Mr. President, today we will return to the pending \nbusiness of the Homeland Security appropriations bill. We have six \namendments that were called up yesterday and are currently pending. The \ntwo managers have been working on the sequencing of amendments. \nTherefore, we should have an additional lineup of amendments that are \nexpected during today's session.\n  As we stated at closing last night, we have two Senate delegations \ntoday, one attending the funeral of former Senator Gaylord Nelson and \nanother delegation in Florida. It is lining up in such a way that we \nwill have very productive debate over the course of the day, but we \nwill be voting later this evening. I do not know exactly what time that \nwill be. We will have the exact timing of these votes announced later \ntoday as we look at the appropriate schedules. I doubt that there will \nbe voting before 7:45 or so tonight. We will be voting tonight.\n  I have said on many occasions that we will be finishing homeland \nsecurity legislation before we leave this week. I believe we have a \ngood shot at completing that bill tomorrow night. I don't know what \ntime that will be. We will go to another bill on Friday. That bill will \nbe determined over the course of today.\n  The funding legislation we are currently addressing in the Senate is \ntoo important to not complete this week. We will be using debate time \nthroughout the course of the day. We will have the votes this evening. \nWe will have a very busy session tomorrow.\n  I also wish to take the opportunity to remind my colleagues we will \nhave an all-Senate briefing this afternoon, for those who are \ninterested, from 3 to 4 o'clock by Director Negroponte. I believe \nSecretary Chertoff will also be coming by as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/13/senate-section/article/S8153-7", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8153-S8154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n.\n\n\n                       SUPREME COURT CONFIRMATION\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have some brief remarks about \nconfirmation of a new Supreme Court Justice.\n  As we all have witnessed, the process is off to a great start. \nConsultation is well underway between the President of the United \nStates and the Senate. It is ongoing. The President and his staff are \nreaching out to Senators from both parties to listen to their \nsuggestions, both in person and through phone calls. To date, the \nadministration, the President and his staff, have contacted directly \nmore than 60 Senators, more than two-thirds of the Democratic caucus, \nevery member of the Judiciary Committee. The President's approach has \nbeen bipartisan and open and unprecedented in scope. I commend him for \nthat effort.\n  As we look ahead, I encourage each Senator to reflect upon the \nnominee we will consider and the confirmation process we will \nundertake. As Senators, confirming a nominee to the Supreme Court is \none of our highest constitutional duties. The new Justice, whomever the \nPresident chooses, will influence American law for years and\n\n[[Page S8154]]\n\nyears to come. He or she will impact the lives of millions of \nAmericans.\n  As Senators, we should ask ourselves, What kind of Justice does \nAmerica expect on the Supreme Court? I am confident President Bush will \nchoose a qualified nominee who will make America proud, someone of \ndemonstrated character and integrity, someone who is fair, intelligent, \nopenminded, and impartial; he or she will listen to the merits of every \ncase and make a determination based on the facts, the law, and the \nConstitution, not driven to prejudge cases, predetermine outcomes, or \nadvance a personal political agenda; the nominee will treat litigants \nand their attorneys fairly and with dignity and respect; and above all, \nthis person will uphold the Constitution and be fully committed to \nequal justice under the law.\n  I am confident of all these things because every day I have seen the \ncare, seriousness, and the thoughtfulness President Bush brings to this \ntask.\n  In addition to considering the type of nominee America expects, I \nalso encourage my colleagues to ask themselves, What kind of Supreme \nCourt nomination process does America expect from the Senate? The \nAmerican people, through their votes, have put their trust in us. They \nhave entrusted us to govern as their elected representatives. History \nwill reflect on the Senate's deliberations, how Senators conduct \nthemselves, how we treat a nominee, and how we reach a decision.\n  We owe it to the American people to conduct a fair process that \ntreats nominees with dignity and respect. It should include a fair \nhearing, a floor debate in which all views are heard, and then an up-\nor-down vote on the confirmation. This process should not become a \ntrial. It is a process by which we examine the character and \ncredentials of someone willing to volunteer to serve America on its \nhighest court.\n  In the past, the judicial nominations process has been marked by \nobstruction, many times partisan obstruction, and attacks on the \ncharacter and integrity of nominees. I hope we have put this painful \nand humiliating process behind us. Given the monumental role this \nnominee will play sitting on America's highest court, we need the best \nof the best legal minds. This requires a process that will not deter \nthe best of the best from serving. The fair and dignified nomination \nprocess requires civility, requires common sense and some self-\nrestraint.\n  As we consider the nominee who will soon come before the Senate, I \nencourage my colleagues to focus on questions that are relevant to the \nnominee's qualifications and experience, questions such as: Will the \nnominee be fair, independent, and unbiased? Will the nominee consider \neach case before the Court with an open mind, examining the facts, the \nlaw, and the Constitution very carefully? Will the nominee place the \nConstitution and the law above personal political ideology? Will the \nnominee approach his or her role as a Justice as an interpreter of the \nlaw and the Constitution and not as a lawmaker who will legislate from \nthe bench? Is the nominee qualified to serve on our highest court? Does \nhe or she have the necessary experience to serve as a Supreme Court \nJustice?\n  These are the questions nominees should be asked to answer honestly \nand thoroughly. They should not be asked to prejudge cases or to \nspeculate on how they would rule or not rule on a hypothetical scenario \nthat may or may not come before the Court.\n  I look forward to working with our colleagues on both sides of the \naisle in the coming weeks. We should work together to conduct the kind \nof confirmation process America expects from its elected \nrepresentatives, a fair and thorough confirmation process that treats \nnominees with dignity and respect and confirms a new Justice before the \nSupreme Court starts its new term on October 3. I am confident the \nPresident will nominate someone who will make America proud, someone \nwho will be worthy of this seat he or she will fill. This is what the \nAmerican people expect, what our justice system needs, and what our \nNation and the nominee deserves.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/13/senate-section/article/S8154-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n.\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, regarding the statement of my distinguished \nfriend, my counterpart, the Republican leader, 90 percent of what he \nsaid is right on target. It is absolutely true that we need a process. \nThat is why Senators Hatch and Specter have been working on this for \nseveral weeks prior to the resignation of Sandra Day O'Connor. The \nprocess is moving along very well.\n  I acknowledge that the meetings I have had with the President on this \nmatter have been very productive. They have been good and are pointed \nin the right direction.\n  However, on a couple of things I disagree with my distinguished \nfriend, the senior Senator from Tennessee; that is, we need to be very \ncareful and put these problems we have had behind us, dealing with the \nso-called nuclear option. It is easy to throw words around like \n``obstructionism,'' but the fact is the vast majority of the \nPresident's nominees were approved easily. I don't know the exact \nnumbers, but I believe 210 out of 219 were approved, and a number of \nthem withdrew. The battles over 5 turned out to be 5 out of 219. We do \nnot need words like that. We need to look at this in a positive sense.\n  There are times, as has been indicated in the recent debate that \noccurred in the Senate, where certain nominees have to be viewed very \ncautiously and carefully. For example, the person the President has \nchosen to go to the United Nations has caused close scrutiny of this \nindividual.\n  The other two people the President sent to the United Nations as our \nAmbassador are people who the minority proudly voted for. Ambassador \nNegroponte went through here very quickly. And then, of course, Jack \nDanforth, the former Senator from Missouri, whipped through here and \nwas our United Nations Ambassador. John Bolton is a different story. We \nhad to take a look at him. That is not obstructionism. We asked for \ncertain information. It was not forthcoming.\n  So as I said, I agree with my friend from Tennessee that this is a \nprocess that needs to have the view of the American public, and they \nneed to be proud of the work we do. I think we are headed in the right \ndirection. I am cautiously optimistic we can move through this. I have \ngiven President Bush the benefit of every doubt that he is doing this \nwith his heart in the right place. I have told him personally and in \nwriting how much I appreciate his reaching out to me. And I continually \nwill be optimistic until there is no need to do so.\n  It would be so good for the country if they could see the Senate at \nits best, moving a nomination that is a consensus candidate; that is, \nsomeone Democrats and Republicans both support to this very high, \nhonorable position, a member of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I look forward to my continued consultation with the administration. \nI had a conversation yesterday with one of the President's \nrepresentatives, his legal counsel. I am going to continue to do \nwhatever I can to make this process move as quickly as possible, and \nnot only as quickly as possible but as dignified as possible. And \nhaving done this, it would be a strong message for us to send to the \npeople of America.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

RAIL TUNNEL SECURITY RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) railroad tunnels, and underground stations have been \n     identified as particularly high risk terrorist targets \n     because of the potential for large passenger volumes, \n     confined spaces, relatively unrestricted access, and the \n     potential for network disruptions and significant economic, \n     political and social impact;\n       (2) many rail tunnels have safety problems including \n     structural deficiencies, ventilation problems, lack of \n     communications equipment and insufficient emergency access \n     and exits;\n       (3) there are more than 898 miles of rail tunnels in \n     transit systems across the country;\n       (4)(A) security experts have identified a number of \n     technology and training needs to prevent attacks on tunnels \n     and to mitigate and remediate the impact of such attacks;\n       (B) technological needs include detection systems, \n     dispersal control, and decontamination techniques; and\n       (C) training for emergency response to a variety of \n     scenarios is also needed; and\n       (5) the Department of Transportations Transportation \n     Technology Center in Pueblo, Colorado--\n       (A) is one of the Nation's largest and most advanced rail \n     safety research centers in the Nation; and\n       (B) offers full-scale testing, dynamic modeling, \n     performance monitoring, technical analyses, feasibility and \n     economic studies as well as training classes to prepare first \n     responders and test new safety technologies.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Department of Homeland Security is urged to invest \n     in research to promote tunnel rail safety as well as training \n     to ensure first responders are prepared to respond to rail \n     tunnel emergencies; and\n       (2) employing existing Federal facilities in this effort \n     can result in efficiencies and permit this important research \n     to proceed at decreased cost to the taxpayer and with minimal \n     interference with ongoing passenger and freight rail traffic.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue that is \nperhaps the most important challenge of our National Government, and \nthat is protecting the security of our people in this Nation, securing \nour borders, and making sure we have a homeland security that addresses \nthe concerns of the post-9/11 world in which we live.\n  For 6 years, I had the honor of serving with 14,000 men and women who \nare peace officers in the State of Colorado. I worked with them to \nensure that we had public safety on our streets and to help in the \ndevelopment of the best strategies we could develop in creating a \nhomeland security that addressed the war on terror and the threats from \nterrorism within the State of Colorado.\n  The legislation we are currently considering is legislation that is \nspecifically intended to address that issue on a national level. While \nthere can be no doubt we have spent billions of dollars on the issue of \nhomeland security since 9/11, the recent events in London remind us all \nthat we can never be too far from having this issue at the forefront of \nour radar screens.\n  It is with that approach that I would like to speak about these \namendments, as well as the amendment I cosponsored with Senators \nLieberman and Collins yesterday.\n  I commend Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman on their efforts to \ndramatically improve our Nation's homeland security grant process. I \nalso would like to discuss my three simple and straightforward \namendments to the Homeland Security appropriations bill.\n  Before I arrived in the Senate, I was Colorado's attorney general. I \nworked hard to establish greater coordination between law enforcement \nagencies at the local, regional, and State level. This is a complicated \ntask because often what happens with law enforcement agencies is they \nwork within the stovepipes of their own jurisdictions. So bringing law \nenforcement agencies together to make sure they are coordinating and \nproviding the greatest degree of public safety has been one of the \nmonumental challenges of the last several years.\n  Unfortunately, at a national level, there is often very little \nconsultation with local officials. Too often, lawmakers in Washington \ndevelop Federal policy without taking advantage of the expertise of the \npeople who are on the ground. Too many local emergency officials in my \nState feel that the Department of Homeland Security policies are \ndictated to them from above.\n  One of the first things I did when I came to Washington was to survey \nColorado's emergency response officials to ask them what they thought \nabout a variety of issues. Those responses were alarming. Those chiefs \nof police and sheriffs told me that 66 percent of Colorado's first \nresponders faced significant problems using radio equipment to \ncommunicate with other agencies. Fifty-nine percent said that Federal \ngrants are not going to the right priorities. Fifty-nine percent said \nthat the Federal grants were not going to the right priorities. And by \na 4-to-1 margin, Colorado officials feel unprepared to handle a weapon \nof mass destruction. That is 4 to 1 of people on the ground in my State \nfeel they are unprepared to handle a weapon-of-mass-destruction attack \nwithin my State.\n  By a 3-to-1 margin, responders feel that antiterrorism information \nthey receive from the Federal Government is insufficient or not \nactionable. That is a 3-to-1 margin. So my survey at the bottom line \nsays that we must do better in preparing our homeland to be more \nsecure.\n  Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman have sponsored, and we in this \nSenate last night adopted, a thoughtful and comprehensive piece of \nlegislation that will make Americans safer. It will significantly \nincrease the amount of Federal money targeted to high-risk States and \ncities while assuring that first responders in all States receive the \nnecessary equipment and training to prevent and to be prepared for \npotential terrorist acts. That is an important balance.\n  We obviously have to focus money where there has historically been a \ngreater threat. New York and Washington in the past have been targets, \nand there are other areas of the Nation that have been impacted. \nLikewise, in California, an attack on the ports of Los Angeles could \ncost the Nation's economy billions of dollars. We clearly need to step \nup security efforts in America's largest cities and in the port cities \nof our Nation.\n  However, in the past, we also have seen that the terrorists are \nconstantly looking for targets of opportunity no matter where they lie. \nWhether it was the bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen or the Oklahoma \nCity bombing or the hostage takeover in the Russian schoolhouse in \nBeslan or the bombing of hotels in Bali, the terrorists struck, and \nthey will strike where they can. We cannot, therefore, make any \nassumptions about where the enemy will strike. If we can make New York \na fortress, the terrorists may hit Philadelphia or Seattle or Denver or \nany of the rural communities which span the countryside of America. Our \nnational security is only as strong as our weakest link.\n  This amendment, which I was proud to cosponsor, succeeds in \nmaintaining that critical balance between assuring that our Nation's \ntop cities are protected and that the entire Nation has the resources \nand infrastructure to keep us safe.\n\n  The amendment also takes huge steps toward reducing waste in Federal \nhomeland security spending and giving State and local officials \nguidance and resources needed to improve long-term planning and grant \nadministration. Its focus on essential capabilities and coordination of \nhomeland security grants across the Federal agencies will help make \nsure we get the most bang for our homeland security bucks.\n  I was proud to work with Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman to \nimprove their already good amendment. My proposals included in this \namendment would ensure that State and local officials have a seat at \nthe table when Federal officials review the Homeland Security Grant \nProgram. We task the Department of Homeland Security to\n\n[[Page S8157]]\n\nmake grant applications as user-friendly as possible, especially for \nthe smaller police and fire departments of our Nation. My changes would \nalso stiffen requirements on States that they do proper long-term \nplanning and administration.\n  Together these changes will make it much easier for State and local \nofficials to work with the Department of Homeland Security. They should \nease the burdens on local first responders and help make America safer.\n  My amendments to the underlying appropriations bill build on the \nspirit of Collins-Lieberman and on the knowledge I have gained from \nColorado's first responders.\n  My first amendment would improve the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's long-term planning. Every 4 years, the Department of Defense \nconducts a Quadrennial Defense Review. This invaluable document paints \na detailed picture of the threats our country faces and a comprehensive \nplan for how to confront those threats in the future. My amendment \nwould simply require the Department of Homeland Security to do the \nsame.\n  The Homeland Security Secretary would work with the Director of \nNational Intelligence to identify the greatest threats to our homeland \nsecurity. The Secretary also would consult with the Department of \nDefense and other Federal agencies on how best to work together.\n  This is not just another reporting requirement. It is a move toward \nrational, strategic, long-term planning that will empower the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and Congress to make better decisions \nto protect the American people.\n  My second amendment would build on the knowledge I gained from the \nrecent survey in Colorado. It would require the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to conduct a nationwide survey of police, fire, medical, and \nemergency management officials about the problems they are experiencing \nwith Federal grants, intelligence sharing, infrastructure protection, \nand regional coordination. The Department of Homeland Security would \nhave to report the results to Congress and come up with a plan on how \nto address the problems the locals have identified. This survey would \nhelp ensure that our significant investments in homeland security are \ngoing to the right priorities and that local officials are getting \nbetter direction to guide their efforts.\n  This sounds like a simple task, and it is, but I promise you that \nwhen we get this survey back, we will all learn something new that will \nhelp us improve America's security.\n  My last amendment is a sense of the Senate in support of research on \ntunnel rail safety. We have known for some time that subway and rail \ntunnels are particularly tempting terrorist targets. For the cost of a \nsubway fare, a would-be bomber has access to thousands of people \ncrammed into a very small space. A relatively small amount of \nexplosives can cause many deaths and bring an entire city to a halt, as \nwe have recently seen in London. That carnage in London last week \nshowed that a handful of terrorists can strike subway tunnels and cause \ngrave havoc for a city. Our prayers go out to the more than 50 people \nwho perished during that cowardly attack. America has known the \nterrible pain of terrorism, and last week, Americans were all \nLondoners.\n\n  In America, there are more than 898 miles of rail tunnels and transit \nsystems across the country. Many of our rail tunnels have structural \ndeficiencies, ventilation problems, lack of communications equipment, \nand insufficient emergency access and exits. Detection systems, \ndispersal control, and decontamination techniques can greatly mitigate \nthe effects of an attack, as can adequate training for emergency \nresponders.\n  The Department of Transportation has long recognized the need to \nimprove rail safety and has invested millions of dollars in researching \nnew technologies and training first responders. The Department of \nTransportation's Transportation Technology Center in Pueblo, CO, is one \nof the largest and most advanced safety centers in the world. The \nTransportation Technology Center offers full-scale testing, dynamic \nmodeling, performance monitoring, technical analyses, feasibility and \neconomic studies, as well as training classes to prepare first \nresponders and test new safety technologies. The center features 48 \nmiles of test track and a variety of freight, passenger, and hazardous \nmaterial cars, as well as other test vehicles. What the center does not \nyet have is the capability to simulate rail tunnel accidents. That is \nwhy the Transportation Technology Center's backers are now hoping to \nbuild a facility for underground rail security testing. This proposed \ncomplex of 1.5 miles of aboveground tunnels would simulate every major \nrail tunnel system in the country.\n  My amendment would not single out this or any particular facility. It \nsimply encourages investment in research to promote tunnel rail safety \nas well as training to ensure first responders are prepared to respond \nto rail tunnel emergencies. It would put the Senate on record for \ntaking a small step forward in protecting the millions of Americans who \ndepend on subways and passenger trains all across the country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these three amendments, and I urge my \ncolleagues to move forward in working on what is our most important \nagenda, and that is making sure we are doing everything we can to \nprotect America's homeland from the kinds of attacks we saw on 9/11 or \nthe attacks we saw last week in London.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, I congratulate my friend and \ncolleague from Colorado for his excellent statement and his leadership \non this issue and so many other issues. Since coming to the Senate 6 \nmonths ago, the Senator from Colorado has demonstrated his compassion, \nintelligence, and ability to speak to the issues that people in this \ncountry desperately care about and desperately need. I congratulate \nhim, once again, on having amendments that are very important for the \nfamilies of our country.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1217\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside and call up my amendment No. 1217.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is pending.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask further unanimous consent that \nSenators Levin, Corzine, Akaka, Dodd, and Lautenberg be added as \ncosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, one of the most important appropriations \nbills is before us now, and that is our Homeland Security bill. \nCertainly we are reminded again, because of what happened in London \nlast week, that we on our soil are vulnerable and are looking to stop \nterrorists overseas.\n  Our goal, certainly the goal of our caucus, our goal as Democrats, \nhas been to make sure Americans are prepared and protected both at home \nand abroad. That is what this bill is really all about. It is not a \npartisan issue. This is an American issue. All of us I know care about \nthis issue, and we need to make sure this budget reflects the goals of \nmaking sure that our first responders are prepared, that all Americans \nare prepared, and that we are protected from terrorism in America. My \namendment addresses a very important piece of that. We have come \ntogether in a bipartisan way to make sure that soldiers in America and \nAfghanistan have the most sophisticated technology so that they can be \nprepared to protect themselves and fight successfully abroad. \nUnfortunately, the same is not true at home for our police officers, \nour firefighters, and our emergency responders. Too many of them rely \non outdated technology and equipment that is not integrated with our \nState departments, our transportation departments and our homeland \nsecurity departments.\n\n  Even if we are defeating terrorists in Iraq, we are not providing the \nresources and the equipment at home to make sure that we are fully \nprepared to fight, succeed and, most importantly, protect our families \nand communities at home.\n  Too many of our police officers, our firefighters, our emergency \nmedical services personnel and transportation officials are not able to \ncommunicate with each other. They have the basics.\n\n[[Page S8158]]\n\nThat is what my amendment speaks to, the ability to make sure that \nevery part of our emergency preparedness system has the ability to \ncommunicate with each other. Interoperability is the term often used.\n  Right now, they are not able to communicate with each other. How much \nmore basic can we get than creating a way for everyone to be able to \ntalk to each other, to literally be on the same wavelength as well as \nfiguratively. Too many first responders, whom I have spoken to as I \nhave moved around Michigan in the last 4 years, have said to me that \ntheir communications, alerts going up or down, often come from CNN. The \ncommunications are received from CNN before they actually receive them \ndirectly to their departments. This does not make any sense.\n  A June 2004 survey by the U.S. Conference of Mayors found that 80 \npercent of the cities that responded do not have communications \nequipment and the ability to communicate with the Department of \nHomeland Security or the Justice Department. My guess is that the \npeople we represent in our States assume something very different, as \nthey should. After September 11, 2001, everyone assumes that these \nthings have been addressed, and yet they have not been addressed.\n  The survey also found that 94 percent of cities do not have \ninteroperable capability between their rail facilities, their police, \ntheir fire, and their emergency responders. This is especially \ntroubling, given what just happened and the tragic attacks on London's \nsubway system last week.\n  Their survey also said almost half of the cities said that a lack of \ninteroperable communications had made a response to an incident within \nthe last year very difficult. Sixty percent of the cities said they do \nnot have the communications capability within the State emergency \noperations center. I have spoken with police and fire chiefs across my \nState, and overwhelmingly they have expressed concern about this issue, \nas well as the fact that they actually have fewer police and \nfirefighters in their departments now than they did before 9/11.\n  I believe we find ourselves in a very vulnerable situation for a \nnumber of reasons as it relates to homeland security, but a basic area \nthat needs improvement, in terms of infrastructure, is our ability to \nhave our communications systems connected so that our emergency \nresponders can talk to each other and can respond quickly, both before \nsomething happens and during an emergency, and do it effectively.\n  This is a crisis now, not just a nagging inconvenience. Our lack of \ninteroperable communications is a crisis in this country.\n  The September 11 attacks highlighted this crisis when New York police \nand fire personnel were on different radio systems and could not \ncommunicate. Over 50 different public safety organizations from \nMaryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia reported to the \nPentagon that they could not talk to each other.\n  On more than one occasion now, we have had circumstances where we \nhave been on the Senate floor, and there has come an alert to evacuate \nthis very Chamber. We have been asked to move out away from the Capital \ncomplex over to Union Station or to other places around the city. We \nassume that folks are able to talk to each other, are able to \ncommunicate what is going on. Yet, unfortunately, the communication \nsystems that need to be in place are not in place for full \ninteroperable communications.\n  Nearly 4 years after September 11, 2001, the No. 1 request for \nappropriations that I receive each year from communities is on \ncommunication systems. This year, Michigan communities made over 41 \nrequests. They requested over $75 million for interoperable \ncommunications in this bill and in the CJS appropriations bill alone. \nMy guess is, if I went to every community, they would gladly have a \nrequest for help to be able to be connected. We can do something about \nit, and that is what this amendment does.\n  Most estimates place the cost of equipping America's first responders \nwith interoperable communications in excess of $15 billion. In November \n2003, the Congressional Budget Office testified before Congress that \nthere is insufficient funding in place to solve our Nation's \ncommunications problems, and it would cost over $15 billion to begin to \nfix the problem.\n\n  So my amendment begins that process by suggesting a 3-year funding \nstream. My amendment would provide the first year funding for that, $5 \nbillion for interoperable communications grants for America's first \nresponders to provide a strong Federal commitment to the safety of our \ncitizens. I might add, while that is a substantial sum of dollars, that \nis approximately what we are investing in Iraq each month. So my \namendment would ask that we commit 1 month for America; 1 month for \nAmerica's preparedness to protect the people of America; 1 month to be \nable to say that we have provided the resources, we have begun to make \nsure that we are prepared, that we are protected, that our \ncommunications systems are connected, and that we are doing all we can \ndo to keep our families safe.\n  I urge the support of the Stabenow amendment on communications.\n  I see my colleague standing, I assume to make a motion, but I want to \nspeak to one other amendment, briefly.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator from Michigan yield?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I would be happy to yield while retaining the floor, \nyes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. My hope is that we can accept the amendments of the \nSenator from Colorado, then we will have further discussion of the \npending amendment of the Senator from Michigan, probably with a point \nof order being made at that point, and then we would turn to the \nSenator from Massachusetts for up to 15 minutes. That is the game plan, \nhopefully. So when the Senator from Michigan completes her statement, I \nwill proceed with that proposal.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to speak to an amendment that \nSenator Dodd will be offering on his and my behalf in the next hour, I \nam sure. This relates to the other piece of what needs to happen to \nmake sure that we are thoroughly prepared and protected. Again, that is \nour goal, to be prepared and protected. That is what we are fighting \nfor. That is what we are working toward. That is what we need to do \ntogether.\n  My amendment would invest in the interoperable communication so that \neveryone could speak to each other and be able to respond.\n  There is another amendment that Senator Dodd and I are introducing \nthat speaks to the larger question of whether we are providing all that \nwe need to, to invest at home in our first responders and what they \nneed to be successful. We know that right now, based on a report that \nwas done back in the spring of 2003, there was a blue ribbon panel of \nexperts, led by former Republican Senator Warren Rudman, that found the \nUnited States is drastically underfunding local emergency responders \nand, in their words, remains dangerously unprepared to handle a \ncatastrophic attack on American soil. They recommended at that time a \nmajor investment over a 5-year period to fully prepare us so that our \nfamilies and communities are protected.\n  After that report was given to us, Senator Dodd and I came to the \nSenate floor 2 years ago and offered an amendment for the first year of \nthat 5-year funding.\n  It was not passed. We came last year and offered it again. We stand \ntoday asking our colleagues, with an even greater sense of urgency, to \nfinally pass this amendment so that we can begin that 5-year process of \nfully preparing our first responders and supporting them so that our \nfamilies are protected. It is a major investment of $15 billion this \nyear. But when we look at what we are spending abroad, we cannot be \njust concerned about fighting terrorism in somebody else's country. We \nknow we have to be prepared to fight it here. Yet we see hundreds of \nbillions being spent in Iraq, being spent overseas. I supported those \ndollars so our troops are successful, so they have what they need, but \nthat is not enough. If the troops on the ground in America--our police \nofficers, our firefighters, our emergency responders--do not have the \nsame commitment from us, why would we say we are going to make sure our \ntroops have what they need overseas and then dramatically underfund \nwhat they need at home? It makes absolutely no sense.\n\n[[Page S8159]]\n\n  This is way beyond anything that is viewed as a partisan issue \nbecause it does not matter, Democrat or Republican, when we look at the \nvulnerabilities for our families and communities for us right now, this \nis something we should all be rallying around. I hope that we are not \nin a situation looking back at some point and saying we should have \ndone this but, rather, aren't we glad that we did.\n  The Rudman report that was given to us in the spring of 2003 found \nthat, on average, our fire departments have only half the number of \nradios they need, and I spoke to that in my other amendment, only \nenough breathing apparatus for one-third of their firefighters. So one \nout of three gets breathing equipment. Police departments across \nAmerica do not have the protective gear to respond to a WMD attack. Our \npublic health laboratories lack the basic equipment to respond to a \nchemical or biological attack and most report that they are overwhelmed \nwith testing requests.\n  Finally, our first responders do not have the equipment they need to \ndetermine what kind of hazardous material they may be facing. The \nadministration's support for first responders has been on a steady \ndecline. It is less in this budget than it was in last year's budget. \nThat makes no sense.\n  For example, last year's funding for Michigan State homeland security \ngrants dropped from $47 million to $29.7 million. In this budget, the \nadministration eliminates the law enforcement terrorism training \nprogram, cutting another $400 million from our first responders.\n  Last week's tragedy in London has again shown how important it is to \nbe able to respond quickly and effectively, for them to be able to \nspeak to each other, for us to be able to have enough personnel who can \nrespond. Michigan has three of the busiest commercial crossings in the \nUnited States--approximately 3,200 miles of coastline, three nuclear \npowerplants, ports, and other numerous critical infrastructure that we \nmust protect. Our homeland security needs are somewhere between $1.4 \nbillion and $2.7 billion that we need to invest in every year, yet the \nallocation in this budget is less than $30 million--again, down from \n$47 million. That is not even close to what we need to be prepared and \nprotected--not even close.\n  I have also spoken with police and fire chiefs across the State. \nAgain, it is amazing to me. I do not believe the average person would \nbelieve what is happening until they talk to local law enforcement \nofficials. When I talk to them, there are fewer police officers on the \nbeat today than 9/11/2001. It is shocking. It is truly shocking, and I \nbelieve it is truly irresponsible.\n  Last month we spent about $5 billion in Iraq and Afghanistan. We need \nto put this in perspective. If we take 3 months of what we are spending \nthere, we can fully fund what the Rudman report says is necessary for \nour first responders. I believe we cannot afford another day without \nacting on this and other critical areas of infrastructure need. This is \nabout whether we are going to be committed to protect the people of \nAmerica.\n  The two amendments about which I have spoken today address and would \nmake sure that we begin to invest in being fully prepared in case of a \nterrorist attack here at home, and that our families are truly \nprotected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to respond to the Senator from \nMichigan, but prior to doing that, I yield to the Senator from Colorado \nso we can straighten out his amendments.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 1209 and 1210, As Modified\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR.

RAIL TUNNEL SECURITY RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) railroad tunnels, and underground stations have been \n     identified as particularly high risk terrorist targets \n     because of the potential for large passenger volumes, \n     confined spaces, relatively unrestricted access, and the \n     potential for network disruptions and significant economic, \n     political and social impact;\n       (2) many rail tunnels have safety problems including \n     structural deficiencies, ventilation problems, lack of \n     communications equipment and insufficient emergency access \n     and exits;\n       (3) there are more than 898 miles of rail tunnels in \n     transit systems across the country;\n       (4)(A) security experts have identified a number of \n     technology and training needs to prevent attacks on tunnels \n     and to mitigate and remediate the impact of such attacks;\n       (B) technological needs include detection systems, \n     dispersal control, and decontamination techniques; and\n       (C) training for emergency response to a variety of \n     scenarios is also needed; and\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Department of Homeland Security is urged to invest \n     in research to promote tunnel rail safety as well as training \n     to ensure first responders are prepared to respond to rail \n     tunnel emergencies; and\n       (2) employing existing Federal facilities in this effort \n     can result in efficiencies and permit this important research \n     to proceed at decreased cost to the taxpayer and with minimal \n     interference with ongoing passenger and freight rail traffic.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent the three amendments which are \npending, by the Senator from Colorado, 1207, 1209, and 1210 be agreed \nto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (No. 1207); (No. 1209), as modified; and (No. 1210), \nas modified, were agreed to.\n\n[[Page S8160]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan has offered one \namendment and intends to offer another amendment. The first amendment \nthat is pending is her amendment relative to interoperability which \nwould increase spending in this account by $5 billion next year. The \nentire budget for homeland security, of course, is $30 billion, so this \nwould be a 20-percent plus-up in her amendment for the entire budget in \none line item which line item does not exist. Interoperability is \nobviously a major issue of concern.\n  It should be noted, however, that the purchasing of communication \nequipment has traditionally fallen to the responsibility of and to the \ndecisionmaking process of the local departments, whether they be fire, \npolice, or first responders in the area of health. Equipment purchasing \nhas been done by those departments over the years, city by city, town \nby town, State by State. The failure to have interoperability is not so \nmuch a Federal failure, it is a decision made at the local level for \nlocal reasons not to have interoperability. If a local police \ndepartment wants to buy a type of communications equipment and the \nlocal fire department in the same town wants to buy a type of \ncommunications equipment and they decide to buy communications \nequipment that does not communicate with each other, that is a local \ndecision. That equipment is physically in place. It is not as if these \ndepartments don't have the equipment. They purchased the equipment.\n  It is not the Federal role to come in and rebuy equipment for every \npolice, fire, and health first responder in this country. That still \nremains a local responsibility to a large degree. However, we do as a \nFederal Government request that States put forward what is known as a \nplan of action relative to first responder coordination.\n  As part of their plan of action, a State can decide to fund \ninteroperability grants to local communities. As part of the first \nresponder initiative, that has occurred and is occurring across the \ncountry. In fact, within the first responder grants that have gone out \nso far, approximately $1.8 or $1.9 billion of that has been spent on \ninteroperability activity by States deciding they wanted to pursue \ninteroperability or communities deciding they wanted to pursue \ninteroperability.\n  However, the concept that we should increase funding in this \ninteroperability initiative by $5 billion in 1 year is essentially an \nextraordinary statement as to what the priorities should be for the \nFederal Government in fighting terrorism. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity has a lot of issues of responsibility. The Federal Government \nhas priority responsibility, for example, for protecting our borders. \nIt has priority responsibility, for example, for protecting our \nairlines and air travel. It has priority responsibility for making sure \nwe are ready to fight and address the threat of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  It does not necessarily have, as a first responsibility, making sure \nthat every police department and fire department in this country buys \nnew radio equipment that can communicate with every other police and \nfire department. In fact, this effort is, and always has been, a State \nand local effort. In fact, there is still no consensus as to how \ninteroperability should occur. There has been an attempt to reach a \nstandard agreement on interoperability going on for 25 years, called \nthe P-25 standards, and those standards simply have not been reached. I \nknow from my experience in New Hampshire we had a problem in Vermont. \nThe New Hampshire police couldn't talk to the Vermont police and our \nState police couldn't talk to our local police and our Fish and Game \npeople couldn't talk to our State Police and our Customs officers along \nthe borders couldn't talk to anybody other than the other Customs \nofficers, so we sat down in a room and figured out how to do it and we \ngot everybody on the same page. But that was a State decision on the \nissue of interoperability. Then the State decided to take funds and use \nthem to fund interoperability coming through the State grants.\n\n  That is the way you approach this problem. But by taking the Homeland \nSecurity budget and increasing it 20 percent for a line item that \ndoesn't exist to fund interoperability grants is, in my opinion, not \nthe best way to spend dollars in this present context. It should be put \nin the fuller context, which is this: These funds would go into a pot \nof money which presently exists, first responder money, of which $7 \nbillion still has not been spent. Seven billion dollars is still \nsitting here in the Federal Treasury waiting to be spent because the \nplans are not in place for how to efficiently spend it at the State and \nlocal level. So to put another $5 billion on top of that, and then I \nunderstand Senator Dodd and the Senator from Michigan are going to come \nforward with another $15 billion or $20 billion plus-up of State and \nlocal grants for next year when we still have $7 billion in the \npipeline that hasn't been spent is, to say the least, I think not good \nmanagement of our dollars in the area of how we protect our Nation.\n  Much higher priorities exist. To the extent we can find additional \nresources, those high priorities such as the borders, such as fighting \nweapons of mass destruction, such as hardening our systems in the area \nof chemical plants, in the area of nuclear plants, in the area of \nintelligence gathering--which is the key to this whole exercise--are \npriorities.\n  Yesterday Secretary Chertoff outlined how he intends to refocus the \npriorities of the Homeland Security agency and, yes, first responders \nare a key part of this. But a 20-percent plus-up makes no sense.\n  This amendment has, as part of its elements, an emergency \ndesignation. Under the Budget Act an emergency is something that is \nsudden, urgent, and unforeseen. The failure of the police department to \nbe able to talk to the fire department in Epping, NH, has been \noccurring for a long time. It is not a sudden, urgent, unforeseen \nevent. It is actually something that should have been planned for. I am \nnot picking Epping out, because I suspect Epping actually has everybody \nspeaking to each other, knowing it is a very well-run town. But \ninteroperability is not a sudden, unforeseen, urgent event. It is an \nevent that needs to be addressed, it needs to be managed, and needs to \nbe managed within the context of the plans the States have for \ndeveloping their first responder response.\n  We know it is a big issue. Each State is hopefully grappling with \nthis and coming forward with their plans. But clearly it does not fall \nwithin the context of an emergency designation as the budget perceives \nemergency designations. So this amendment as proposed is clearly \noutside the emergency designation qualification and it does represent a \n$5 billion plus-up, which would be an addition to our deficit of $5 \nbillion were it to pass, and therefore is subject to a point of order \nand is not, in my humble opinion, good policy to pursue at this time.\n  Therefore, pursuant to section 401(b)(5) of H. Con. Res. 95 for the \nfiscal year 2006 Budget Resolution, I raise a point of order against \nthe emergency designation provisions contained in this amendment and \nmake that point of order.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I move to waive the applicable sections \nof the Congressional Budget Act for purposes of considering my \namendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, at a later time today we will set up this \nmotion to waive the Budget Act vote. It looks as if we are not going to \nhave votes until quite late this evening, probably not starting until \n7:30 or 8 o'clock. This will obviously be one of those votes, should \nthe leader decide he wants to hold votes at that time, and I appreciate \nthe courtesy of the Senator from Michigan.\n  Pursuant to the prior discussion, I yield the floor to the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  (The remarks of the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, are \nprinted in today's Record under ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S8161]]\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I will speak for a few minutes and \nhighlight some of the important provisions of this appropriations bill, \nspecifically as they pertain to the issue of border security. The \nSenator from New Hampshire, the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nHomeland Security, along with the entire Appropriations Committee, have \ndone much good that should be heralded. But those steps should also be \nseen as just a first step toward getting us in the right direction, \nwhich is to obtain operational security of our Nation's borders, \nsomething we do not have now and something which represents a clear \nthreat to our national security.\n  As the Senate Committee on Appropriations recognized, these resources \nare just a first step toward true reform of our immigration system. \nAdditional enforcement resources along the border will be needed. In \nthat connection, Senator Kyl, the junior Senator from Arizona, and I \nwill be filing a bill within the next couple of weeks that will \nauthorize additional resources to secure our border.\n  Our Nation's immigration and border security system is badly broken. \nIt leaves our borders unprotected and threatens our national security. \nIt makes a mockery of the rule of law. This system unfortunately has \nsuffered from years of neglect. But in a post-September 11 world we \nsimply cannot tolerate this situation any longer. We stand here today \nalmost 4 years from that terrible date, and we are reminded as recently \nas just last week--with the attacks in London--that terrorism is a real \nand tangible threat to the free world.\n  National security demands a comprehensive solution to our immigration \nsystem. That means both stronger enforcement and reasonable reform of \nour immigration laws. We have to confess that we have not devoted the \nfunds, the resources, and the manpower necessary to enforce our \nimmigration laws and protect our borders.\n  Representing a border State with about 1,600 miles of border with \nMexico, I can state that for too long Washington has simply taken the \nattitude that this is a local or State problem. If it is not the duty \nof the Federal Government to deal with the security of our borders, \nwhose responsibility is it? It is a Federal responsibility, and it is \none that has simply been abdicated for far too long.\n  No discussion of comprehensive immigration reform, however, is \npossible without a clear commitment to and a substantial and dramatic \nescalation of our efforts to enforce the law. In my capacity as the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security and \nCitizenship of the Senate Judiciary Committee, we have held a number of \nhearings on this issue of border security and immigration enforcement. \nThey have been quite revealing. I will share some of the information \nwith our colleagues because it supports the direction in which this \nHomeland Security appropriations bill takes us, and puts us one step \ncloser to the final goal: control of our borders and a secure, orderly \nimmigration process.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has testified recently that they \ndo not have operational control over parts of the southern border. That \nis obvious to those who live and work along that border and represent \nthose States.\n  My constituents have told me as recently as last week when I traveled \nto south Texas, to Laredo, TX, when I traveled to McAllen, TX, and the \nRio Grande Valley that the nature of the immigrants coming across our \nsouthern border is vastly different from what it has historically been. \nFor example, over the last 3 years, the number of apprehensions of \nthose designated as ``OTM,''--other than Mexican--has doubled from \n37,316 in 2002 to 75,000-plus in 2004. This year, it is currently \n96,000. It is likely that the number will be twice this year what is \nwas last year.\n  The vast majority of these individuals who are apprehended as they \ncome across the border are from countries that you would expect: Mexico \nand countries in Central and South America. However, the Border Patrol \nchief, Chief Aguilar, has testified at one of our hearings that 400 \naliens from special-interest countries had been apprehended last year. \nSome come from countries that support international terrorism. That \nought to be a grave concern to all of us. We need to expend additional \nresources, both to ensure we are apprehending aliens who are trying to \nenter our country illegally, and to make sure we detain them and remove \nthem in an expedited fashion.\n  Let me bring to the attention of our colleagues some of the facts \nbecause they may not be aware of them. I think they will be shocked to \nfind out how unsuccessful we are, despite the best efforts of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  Last year alone, the Border Patrol detained roughly 1.1 million \npeople coming across our borders. Now, my information, from those who \nare on the ground who deal with this on a day-in-and-day-out basis, is \nthat they think they probably are capturing between one out of every \nthree or one out of every four. Yet last year alone they captured \napproximately 1.1 million and detained them.\n  But the concern is that we only have roughly 20,000 detention beds. \nSo what the Border Patrol does is, after doing a background check, \nafter which they run these aliens' names against a terrorist watch list \nand various criminal justice data bases, they engage in what can only \nbe called a catch-and-release program. In other words, they release \nthem on their own recognizance based on their promise to return for \nfurther proceedings later on. It should come as no surprise that the \noverwhelming number of these detainees do not reappear for their \nhearing, and they simply melt into the landscape.\n  As a result of this flawed policy, we know we have approximately 10 \nmillion people living in our country outside of our laws. And those \nnumbers are getting bigger, not smaller.\n  I do not know how we can stand here, particularly in the face of the \nthreat of international terrorism, and tell the American people we are \ndoing the job they sent us here to do. Because we know that organized \ncrime groups, which are only interested in making money, do not care \nwhether they deal with human beings who want to come here to work, \nwhether they engage in human trafficking, whether they engage in \nillegal drug transactions, illegal arms transactions, or any one of a \nnumber of other activities that are designed to generate money. We know \nin these organized smuggling activities, many of which originate from \nAsia and the Middle East, people are literally brought across the ocean \nto South America, or to Mexico, or Central America, and then they take \nadvantage of our porous southern border and potentially threaten our \nnational security.\n  I hope, and indeed I believe, that most of the people who come to \nthis country across our border outside of our laws are coming here for \nthe same reason they have always come here; and that is, to find work \nand the ability to support their families because they cannot do so \nwhere they live. But we have to acknowledge this porous border we have \nand our failure to obtain operational security of our borders is a \nnational security threat because the same avenues of entry into the \ncountry by which construction workers and others might come are \navailable for exploitation by international terrorists.\n  We have no idea, and no agency of the Federal Government can tell us, \nwhether or not we have sleeper cells of terrorists who have exploited \nthat border to come here. But we know they continue to come, that \nvulnerability continues to exist, as long as the Federal Government \nfails to live up to its responsibility to secure our border.\n  This bill, to the great credit of the subcommittee and its chairman, \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, recommends a total of about $6 billion \nfor securing the Nation's borders, including $1.7 billion for border \nstaffing between the ports of entry.\n  Separately, the bill includes $81 million for construction \nrequirements associated with 1,000 new Border Patrol agents. I \nmentioned the issue of detention beds. There are only 20,000 beds right \nnow, which is woefully inadequate. Given our failure to implement \nnationwide expedited removal processes for people who come to our \ncountry illegally, the Border Patrol and the\n\n[[Page S8162]]\n\nFederal agencies are simply left with this unworkable and inexcusable \nsystem of catch-and-release, which merely exacerbates the problem we \nhave in this country with illegal immigration.\n  This bill moves us in the right direction by funding an additional \n2,240 detention beds, with a $77 million increase, bringing the total \nup to almost 23,000 beds. It is still not enough, but clearly this \nmoves us in the right direction.\n  The Intelligence Reform Act authorizes 8,000 beds per year, and the \nIraq war supplemental funded almost 2,000 beds.\n  The bill I alluded to earlier that Senator Kyl and I intend to file \nshortly calls for an additional 10,000 detention beds to be constructed \neach year, at an estimated cost of $330 million, which is an increase \nof 2,000 beds per year over what was authorized in the Intelligence \nReform Act.\n  The recent surge of people coming illegally into our country outside \nof just our immediate neighbor of Mexico demonstrates this catch-and-\nrelease policy must be changed. It is only through the commitment of \nresources, such as being done in this bill, that we are going to get to \nwhere we need to be.\n  I am pleased to see the recommendations that are made as to \nadditional resources in this bill, but I remind my colleagues there is \nstill much that needs to be done when it comes to ensuring our security \nand our safety by enforcement of our laws.\n\n  I hope at another time to be able to come back and address my \ncolleagues on the details of the bill Senator Kyl and I intend to \nintroduce which is composed of four main provisions.\n  One provision has to do with enhanced border security, which I have \nalready alluded to here. The second provision has to do with interior \nenforcement. In other words, once people get past the border, then they \nare simply lost to our Federal law enforcement agencies. We simply, as \nthe Federal Government, do not provide them the additional resources \nthey need in order to be partners in our law enforcement effort when it \ncomes to border security and immigration law enforcement.\n  Last week, I visited with a group of sheriffs in Victoria and Goliad \nCounties. They are about 200 miles inland. But you may recall, Mr. \nPresident, and my colleagues may recall, it was about 2 years ago when \n19 immigrants, who had been smuggled illegally into the country, were \nleft to die in a trailer because the human smuggler--a coyote, as they \nare called in our part of the country--cared nothing about them and \nleft them to die in over 100-degree temperatures inside a cattle \ntrailer.\n  These local law enforcement officials are willing to help and willing \nto be of assistance, but they want the training and they need \nadditional resources so they can hire the personnel. We must meet our \nobligations to provide the additional resources they need so we can \nwork as partners with local law enforcement and State law enforcement \nto enforce the law.\n  So the first component is enhanced border security, and the second \ncomponent is enhanced interior enforcement.\n  The third component of the bill Senator Kyl and I will file has to do \nwith employer accountability. It may come as a shock to the people of \nAmerica to know we currently do not have in place an effective way for \nemployers to authoritatively determine whether the person standing in \nfront of them, who wants to be hired, is in fact authorized to work in \nthe United States of America or whether they happen to be an illegal \nimmigrant who cannot legally be hired by American employers.\n  What our bill will do is remedy that deficiency and provide employers \nwith a reliable means to document the fact that indeed this perspective \nemployee is authorized to work in the United States, and to do so in a \nreliable fashion.\n  We will also at the same time insist that employers, once we give \nthem the tools they need, enforce the law and make sure they document \nthat, in fact, this perspective employee is authorized to work in the \nUnited States.\n  The fourth and last component has to do with a temporary worker \nprogram. The President talked about this a couple of years ago. I think \nhe is exactly right. But the problem is, it has to be combined with \nenhanced border security, enhanced interior enforcement, and tools that \nemployers need in order to determine the legal status of the \nperspective employees that stand in front of them. But we also have to \nacknowledge the facts: America's economy is strong, and we have a \ndemand for the labor many immigrants provide, but we simply need to \nprovide a legal means for people to work and perform those jobs that \nAmerican citizens do not want or are not available to do.\n  Then we need to provide a means to return those individuals who come \nhere on a temporary basis and work in the United States under this \nlegal regime, to return them to their home, with the skills and the \nsavings they have acquired working in the United States. Because unless \nwe deal also with the economic aspects of this problem that affects our \nnational security, we will never have any hope of solving it.\n  I will speak more on that later. But I did want to give our \ncolleagues a preview of what is being worked on as a comprehensive \nsolution. And I did want to come to the floor and express my great \nappreciation to the Senator from New Hampshire, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, and all of those who have made it possible for us to \nfocus our efforts on enhanced border security, and to explain why I \nbelieve it is absolutely critical to the safety and security of the \nAmerican people that we obtain operational security of our border. It \nis something we cannot claim now and which, indeed, law enforcement \nofficials of the U.S. Government admit we do not currently have.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Launch Of Space Shuttle ``Discovery''\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would like to take about a minute more \nof our colleagues' time. I neglected to make some additional brief \ncomments that I would like to make on the space shuttle launch that is \noccurring today.\n  It was my very first speech on the Senate floor, sadly, when I paid \ntribute to the astronauts who lost their lives in the Columbia disaster \nin February of 2003. The thoughts and admiration of the Nation are with \nthe brave astronauts aboard Discovery today as they make their journey \ninto space. It is the first one this Nation has attempted since that \nterrible tragedy in February 2003.\n  I believe the robust manned space program is critical to both \nAmerica's proud tradition of exploration and its commercial and \nmilitary preeminence in space.\n  NASA's missions foster technological and scientific advances and help \nensure our national security as well as create jobs for thousands of \nTexans and thousands of Americans.\n  I believe the mission of NASA, together with the President's vision \nfor future space exploration, will also encourage young people to study \nmath and science and prepare for space-related careers. As so many \nyoung children have done in the past, they are inspired by the feats of \ndaring and accomplishment by these brave astronauts who are launching \ninto space again today. These goals are set not just for our current \nbenefit, but also for future generations of leaders and innovators in \nTexas and across America.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Madam President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself \nand my colleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, along with Senators \nCorzine and Lautenberg of New Jersey.\n  The purpose of this amendment is very simple, although the amount I \nam asking for here is rather large. The purpose is to fund sufficiently \nthe urgent priorities of our Nation's firefighters, law enforcement \npersonnel, emergency medical personnel, transportation systems, and \nother critical infrastructure such as our ports and chemical plants. \nThe amendment's language suggests paying for these vital priorities by \nlimiting some of the tax breaks for individuals with annual incomes in \nexcess of $1 million. I assume that at an appropriate time my colleague \nfrom New Hampshire or others will make a point of order against this \namendment. I will then move to waive that point of order. In the \nmeantime, let me explain the amendment.\n  It is one I initially offered two years ago during a similar debate \nregarding homeland security. I was not successful in having the \namendment adopted then. I am hopeful that I will be successful today, \nespecially in light of events during the last several days in London. \nBut I understand, given the size of the amount I am requesting, that \nthe chances of this amendment being adopted are not great.\n  Nevertheless, it is important to offer this measure anyway because it \nisn't an amendment I crafted per se, although I offer it here \nlegislatively. The language and request of this amendment were a result \nof two task forces conducted by the Council on Foreign Relations that \nexamined America's needs in the wake of the attacks on September 11, \n2001, and laid out, by our former colleagues Senators Warren Rudman and \nGary Hart, along with members of their task force, the vital importance \nof sufficiently preparing for the inevitable events that are occurring \nat the hands of terrorist organizations. I don't know how many more \nevents it is going to take for us to respond with the kinds of \nresources we need to have in place.\n  I was a Member of this body when the Marine barracks in Lebanon were \nhit, the Lockerbie incident happened, the World Trade Center was first \nbombed, the USS Cole was attacked, the embassies in Africa were bombed, \nand then, of course, when the World Trade Center was attacked for the \nsecond time. We have seen in Tokyo the subway attacks in 1996, the \nMadrid train bombing in March of 2004 and, of course, the London \nUnderground attacks only a few days ago. These are just a few of the \nhundreds of terrorist attacks that have taken place around our world \nover the last couple of decades.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me outline the Rudman report and why this amendment is \nimportant.\n  Two years ago the Council on Foreign Relations convened an \nindependent task force to identify the challenges faced by our Nation \nin preventing and responding to acts of terrorism. This task force was \nchaired by our former colleague Senator Rudman. In June 2003, the task \nforce issued a comprehensive report entitled ``Emergency Responders: \nDramatically Underfunded, Dangerously Unprepared.''\n  Former Senator Rudman was joined on this task force by a very \ndistinguished group of our fellow American citizens. I ask unanimous \nconsent to print in the Record the entire list of those people who \nprepared the report.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                           TASK FORCE MEMBERS\n\n       Charles G.

Let me mention several of them because they are important. \nWhat I am offering as an amendment were suggestions made by this panel \nto the Department of Homeland Security and to the Congress as a way of \nbolstering our security needs across the Nation.\n  The membership of this distinguished panel included George Shultz, \nformer Secretary of State, Treasury, and Labor; William Webster, former \nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency; Charles Boyd, chief \nexecutive officer and president of the Business Executives for National \nSecurity; Margaret Hamburg, vice president for biological weapons at \nthe Nuclear Threat Initiative and former Assistant Secretary for \nplanning and evaluation at the Department of Health and Human Services; \nDon Marron, former chairman of UBS America; James Metzl, former staff \nmember of the NSC, the Department of State, and former staff director \nof the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; Norman Ornstein, resident \nscholar at the American Enterprise Institute; Anne-Marie Slaughter, \ndean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs \nat Princeton University; and Harold Varmus, president and chief \nexecutive officer of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Institute.\n  The list goes on. These are the people who ``prepared,'' in a sense, \nthe amendment I am offering. The suggestions I am offering are ones \nsuggested as a result of the task force's recommendations.\n  Let me say that I have great respect for Senator Gregg and Senator \nByrd who have dealt with these issues in their capacities as Chairman \nand Ranking Member on the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee \nrespectively. It is not easy to put together these bills under budget \ncaps. I understand that, and I have respect for it. I understand the \nconstraints under which my colleagues operate. Certainly, they are \ntrying to provide adequate resources for our emergency responders and \ncritical infrastructure needs in this country.\n  If the tragic events in London and the events I mentioned at the \noutset say anything to us as a people, it is that we must renew and \nredouble our efforts to prevent and respond to terrorism at home. The \nRudman report only underscores the sense of urgency that we ought to \nhave about protecting our country from the risk of terrorism.\n  I appreciate that the managers of the bill are seeking to have $100 \nmillion of added resources for transit security. They are working \nwithin very tight budget constraints. Nevertheless, the security needs \nof our country far exceed what the managers are able to provide with \nthe limited resources they have been given under this bill.\n  The Rudman report says our Nation should immediately spend--and this \nwas 2 years ago--$20 billion per year for 5 years to hire, equip, and \ntrain first responders and to better protect our critical \ninfrastructure from attack. This bill spends roughly $3.9 billion--less \nthan one-fifth of what the Rudman report called for 2 years ago. That, \nI might add, is close to $700 million less than was spent 2 years ago. \nSo it appears we are headed in the wrong direction and doing less than \nwhat we should be doing.\n  I would like to read various passages of the Rudman report to try to \npersuade Members of the sense of urgency that Senator Rudman and the \nCommission certainly had 2 years ago, and to shed light, if you will, \non a survey and study done by those who are very knowledgeable about \nthe challenges posed by international terrorism and about the needs and \nsteps that need to be taken to make our Nation more prepared to meet \nthose challenges.\n  I will read the conclusion of the report prepared by Senator Rudman:\n\n       The terrible events of September 11 have shown the American \n     people how vulnerable they are because attacks on that scale \n     had never been carried out on United States soil. The United \n     States and the American people were caught underprotected and \n     unaware of the magnitude of the threat facing them.\n\n  In the wake of September 11, ignorance of the nature of the threat or \nof what the United States must do to prepare for future attacks can no \nlonger explain America's continuing failure to allocate sufficient \nresources in preparing local emergency responders. It would be a \nterrible tragedy indeed if it took another catastrophic attack to drive \nthe point home.\n  I do not think any words can express the problem before us more \nclearly than those of Senator Rudman.\n  I will quote from the foreword written by Les Gelb, the former \nPresident of the Council on Foreign Relations:\n\n       As I sit to write this forward, it is likely that a \n     terrorist group somewhere in the world is developing plans to \n     attack the United States and/or American interests abroad \n     using chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or \n     catastrophic conventional means. At the very same time, \n     diplomats, legislators, military, and intelligence \n     officers, police, fire, and emergency medical personnel, \n     and others in the U.S. and across the globe are working \n     feverishly to prevent or prepare for such attacks. These \n     two groups of people are ultimately in a race with one \n     another. This is a race we cannot afford to lose.\n\n  Several months prior to the issuance of the Rudman report, in October \n2002, the Council on Foreign Relations convened another task force, the \nIndependent Task Force on Homeland Security, which issued the report, \n``America: Still Unprepared, Still in Danger.'' The task force, co-\nchaired by Senators Rudman and Hart, came to the general conclusion \nthat:\n\n       America remains dangerously unprepared to prevent and \n     respond to a catastrophic terrorist attack on U.S. soil.\n\n  The report further warned that:\n\n       America's own ill-prepared response could hurt its people \n     to a much greater extent than any single attack by a \n     terrorist, and the risk of self-inflicted harm to America's \n     liberties and the way of life is greatest during and \n     immediately following a national trauma.\n\n  So here you have two seminal reports, issued within 8 months of one \nanother, prepared by some of the most respected individuals in this \ncountry, who have longstanding experience in the matters of diplomacy \nand national security. These are not lightweights who made these \nrecommendations I am offering as part of this amendment. They are top \nexperts and they have sounded the alarm to us. They sounded it after 9/\n11; they sounded it before Madrid and London. How many more events \nbefore we put the kind of resources in place that allows this Nation to \nhave a much higher sense of security, as we ought to have in light of \nthe attacks presently being prepared and focused against us?\n  The funding level that Senator Stabenow and I are proposing in this \namendment is over $16 billion. It is huge; I understand that. It \nsupplements the approximately $4 billion that the underlying measure \ndevotes to emergency responders and infrastructure security. Together \nthe bill and the amendment provide $20 billion in emergency responder \nfunding over the next year.\n  This is the recommendation of the Rudman report. This is the \nrecommendation of the individuals who helped prepare that report. It is \na recommendation made by respected experts and leaders in the fields of \nnational security, intelligence, foreign relations, military affairs, \nbio-terrorism, business, public health, and budget analysis. These \ndistinguished\n\n[[Page S8165]]\n\nmen and women spent significant time analyzing the problems facing our \nfirst responders and our Nation's security. They gave us their best \nprofessional judgment of what we need to do. Regrettably, we are \nfalling woefully short of what needs to be done in this country.\n  I understand the need for a budget resolution that sets caps on \nappropriations bills. Effective budget resolutions in the Senate are \nthose that achieve balance. They curb reckless spending while providing \na sound investment in our domestic and foreign priorities. \nUnfortunately, I don't find the current budget resolution and the caps \nit has imposed very balanced at all. While constraining our ability to \ninvest adequately in our emergency responders and domestic security, \nthis resolution causes, in my view, the national deficit to increase by \nat least $130 billion over the next 5 years, principally through tax \ncuts that only benefit the most affluent of our citizens.\n  I represent if not the most affluent State, one of the most affluent \nStates in the country. I have no doubt that the people of Connecticut \nwould certainly be prepared--when asked whether they could do with a \nlittle less in order to provide the Nation with more security--to \nagree. They understand this issue. I believe that given the choice, \nthey would rather see the tax cut they are receiving go to this kind of \ninvestment.\n  The report before us represents an uncomfortable reality that we have \nto face as a nation. I certainly applaud the hard and groundbreaking \nwork done so far to reduce the threat of terrorism in this Nation. A \nlot of good people are working hard at this. Yet as the tragedy in \nLondon vividly showed us last week, no nation, including ours, is \ninvulnerable. We still possess weaknesses in our domestic security and \nour infrastructure that must be strengthened.\n  For over 2 years now, we have possessed in the form of the Rudman and \nHart reports a clear message from the most qualified experts in our \nNation that we need to do more to prepare ourselves. While I apologize \nfor offering an amendment that costs over $16 billion, I ask my \ncolleagues why we should not offer an amendment that encompasses what \nthe Rudman report recommends and what is dearly needed. Why not offer \nan amendment that meets the needs of our emergency responders while \ndoing significantly more to boost security measures along our rails, on \nour trucks, and in our seaports and harbors? In my view, we should \ndecide whether we think the recommendations made by these distinguished \nAmericans deserve our support and whether we have the will to do what \nis needed to be done to put our country on a more sound and secure \nfooting.\n  The Rudman report makes several comprehensive recommendations to \nincrease our investment in emergency responders and domestic security. \nAmong these recommendations are: One, developing a standard for \nemergency responder minimum essential capabilities in fields such as \ntraining, interoperable communications systems, and response equipment; \ntwo, developing a standard for determining the nature of cost sharing \nbetween Federal, State, and municipal governments for homeland security \nactivities; three, guaranteeing multiyear Federal funding for homeland \nsecurity activities funded jointly by Federal municipal resources; \nfour, reforming congressional oversight; five, allowing for greater \nflexibility in using Federal homeland security resources; six, \ndeveloping a standard for evaluating best practices; and seven, \ndeveloping a standard to ensure more effective coordination between \nFederal, State, and municipal governments.\n\n  While the Department of Homeland Security has started to address some \nof these recommendations--and I note that this morning Secretary \nChertoff announced some significant administrative changes to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, and I applaud him for that--I think \nmany more changes and resources must be implemented and provided \nrespectively to meet the Rudman report recommendations fully. I think \nwe ought to be doing more by supporting the financial needs that are \ngoing to provide for the various gaps that occur in the security of our \nvarious infrastructure systems.\n  Finally, we all know that the cost of this amendment is large. I want \nto put this figure in perspective. We are spending roughly $5 billion \nevery month in Iraq and Afghanistan--$1 billion a week in Iraq and $1 \nbillion a month in Afghanistan. That is $15 billion in vital spending \nand funding every 3 months to ensure that our men and women in uniform \ncan deal with the threats in those foreign lands. Senator Stabenow, the \nother cosponsors of this amendment, and I are asking for $16 billion \nfor a whole year to make us more secure at home. I understand the needs \nand I have supported the funding for our troops in the field. We know \nas a result of the Rudman report that we are woefully short in what \nneeds to be done at home to keep our Nation more secure.\n  As I mentioned a moment ago at the outset of these remarks, how many \nmore incidents need to occur before we do what the Rudman report has \ncalled for? How many more times do we have to be attacked to realize \nwhat major steps need to be taken to be better prepared?\n  I believe that if we have the will, we can find the resources that we \nknow are needed to make sure we have the infrastructure security in \nplace and the personnel support in place to give our fellow citizenry \nthe greater sense of security that they ought to have.\n  With that, at the appropriate time, I will ask for the yeas and nays \non this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, it is my intention to respond to the \namendment proposed by the Senator from Connecticut and make a point of \norder relative to it. Prior to doing that, I will yield to the Senator \nfrom Arkansas for 5 minutes so he may offer an amendment and get it in \nthe queue. Then we can agree to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1125\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I ask that amendment No. 1125 be called \nup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1125.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To encourage the acquisition by the Secretary of Homeland \n            Security of an integrated mobile medical system)\n\n       On page 83, line 26, before the period, insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That of the total amount \n     made available under this heading for the support and \n     acquisition of mobile medical units to be used by the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency, Directorate of Emergency \n     Preparedness and Response, in response to domestic disasters, \n     the Secretary of Homeland Security is encouarged to acquire \n     an integrated mobile medical system for testing and \n     evaluation in accordance with subchapter V of chapter 35 of \n     title 31, United States Code (commonly known as the \n     `Competition in Contracting Act')''.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, my amendment simply encourages the \nSecretary of Homeland Security to consider an integrated mobile medical \nsystem as part of the Department's requirement for mobile medical \nsystems.\n  The DOD is currently evaluating a fully integrated mobile medical \nsystem, and it appears that this system holds very promising results to \nprovide quality medical treatment for emergency situations.\n  My amendment encourages the Department of Homeland Security to look \nat this issue and maybe allocate some resources for it.\n  I thank the majority staff, as well as the minority staff, and the \ntwo bill managers for their assistance on this amendment. The amendment \nhas been agreed to. I thank my staff as well for all the hard work and \ndiligence they put into it. The amendment has been cleared on both \nsides. I thank specifically Chairman Gregg and Senator Byrd for their \nsupport and assistance.\n\n[[Page S8166]]\n\n  Madam President, I ask for the immediate consideration of amendment \nNo. 1125.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1125) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1202\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, the Senator from Connecticut, joined by \nthe Senator from Michigan, as I understand it, has offered an amendment \nwhich would increase the funding for first responder activity by $16 \nbillion. I note, as an initial comment, that this represents a 50-\npercent increase in funding for this bill in toto. In other words, the \nentire funding of the Homeland Security agency is about $31 billion, \nand $15 billion on top of that would be a dramatic increase, to say the \nleast.\n  The logic for the approach is that there is a representation that the \nRudman Commission and other people who have looked at this issue say \nfirst responders need more money. It is hard to argue with the fact \nthat first responders do need more money, but the question becomes, in \na world where we do not have unlimited resources, where should we put \nthe resources to get the best results in this fight on the war on \nterrorism?\n  An additional logic for their position is because we are spending \nsignificant dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan on a monthly basis, $5 \nbillion is the number suggested by both Senators that we should be able \nto simply, easily afford and $15 billion of additional spending for the \nHomeland Security agency in the area of first responder activity.\n  I suggest, at the beginning, that type of logic could lead to \nbasically there being no end of spending on all sorts of programs. If \nwe are going to use the example of the amount of dollars it takes to \nkeep our service people properly equipped and properly armed and \nproperly taken care of when they are in a field of battle, when they \nare engaged with an enemy on a daily basis, if we are going to use that \nnumber as the number which defines what we should spend, whether it is \nfire departments in New Hampshire or education departments in \nConnecticut or libraries in Michigan or colleges in West Virginia, we \nare going to end up with amendment after amendment which spends \nbillions upon billions of dollars on the representation that, gee, we \nare spending all this money in fighting this war to try to make sure \nour troops are properly supported so, therefore, why can't we spend a \nlot of money somewhere else? I do not think there is a lot of \nconsistency to that logic.\n  We know we have a limited amount of money as a Federal Government to \nspend--at least we should. We did pass a budget to try to put in place \nthe context of how much money we have to spend. And in the context of \nthat budget, we did fund the war, we did fund the Defense Department, \nand we did fund the other functions of Government at a certain level. \nWe dramatically increased the funding, for example, in education, we \ndramatically increased the funding in the area of homeland security, \nand we dramatically increased the funding for first responders, but \nwithin the context of a budget.\n  So when you bring an amendment to the floor that essentially says, \nIgnore the budget and spend $15 billion next year on first responders \nand then spend another $5 billion on top of that, which would be the \nStabenow amendment on providing communications equipment, you are \nessentially saying we have no fiscal discipline and our purposes are \nnot controlled by any sort of logic as to the relationship of the \namount of money which the Federal Government takes in versus the amount \nof money the Federal Government spends.\n  The representation from the Senator from Connecticut is, if we were \nsimply to repeal some of these permanent taxes that were extended in \nthe budget, we could pay for this. I note for the Senator from \nConnecticut that he may not have noted this because he did not vote for \nthe budget, and I understand he may not have focused a lot of time on \nit. But the budget, as passed by the Congress, did not have any \npermanent tax extensions in it relative to general income tax.\n  The only permanent extensions in the budget are for tuition tax \ncredits for kids going to school, tax deductions for teachers who spend \nmoney to pay for school supplies in their classrooms, and a couple of \nother lesser tax deductions within the Code. So maybe he wants to \nrepeal those extensions. I think those extensions are good policy. If \nthat is his position, that will recover maybe--I don't know, I am not \nsure how much it would recover off the top of my head, but it would not \nbe a great deal of money, and it certainly would not be enough money to \ncover this $16 billion which is being proposed.\n  The budget did not, and it is a misrepresentation to come to the \nfloor and represent that it did, extend permanently any rate tax cuts \nat all.\n  So this argument that, well, we can just do it by changing the \nbudget, by changing the terms as to the way it applies to tax policy is \nincorrect on its face because there were no permanent extensions.\n  The issue really is this: Within the context of a reasonable budget \nfor national defense and for homeland security, where should the \ndollars go first? What are the priorities? We made a conscious decision \nin this bill to focus the dollars on what we saw as the primary \nthreats. I believe, and I was joined by the Senator from West Virginia \nand I think he agrees, that we should have a threat-based funding \napproach to the whole issue of homeland security. If one listened to \nSecretary Chertoff yesterday, that is what he plans to do.\n  What are the priority threats? No. 1, right at the top of the list, \nunquestionably the most significant threat is the question of weapons \nof mass destruction. So we have put a significant amount of dollars \ninto trying to increase our capacity to address, first, the detection \nand, second, a response capability in the area of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  No. 2, the second largest threat which we have, in our opinion, is \nthe fact that we have borders which are extraordinarily porous. Madam \nPresident, 3 million a year is the estimate of how many people come \ninto this country illegally; 500 million people come into this country \nlegally, and we really do not know a great deal about what their \npurpose is or what they are doing coming in and out of the country. In \nfact, we do not know if they are criminals because our databases are \nnot capable of analyzing their entry documentation to determine whether \nthey are some sort of threat or whether they are just citizens from \nanother country who are coming here to enjoy our great Nation.\n  We have committed significant resources in this bill. We have moved \nmore than $600 million from various accounts into border security, \nspecifically putting more feet on the border in the sense of adding \nmany more Border Patrol personnel, giving those Border Patrol personnel \nthe capital structure they need to support themselves, physical \ninfrastructure, adding more detention beds, focusing on upgrading our \ncomputer and IT systems relative to entry-exit activity, especially the \nUS-VISIT Program. That is because that is a huge threat.\n  Those are the two huge priority threats on which we focused.\n  The issue of first responders is a priority for us as a nation, but \nis it the No. 1 item that should be focused on in this bill? No. Is it \nHomeland Security's first line of activity? Quite honestly, it is not. \nIt is a major line of activity, but the first lines of activity are the \nones for which Federal Government is primarily responsible, such as \nairline safety, border safety, making sure we are ready to deal with \nweapons of mass destruction. That is why we mention those issues. But \nin the specific area of first responder accounts, this proposal, which \nwould up the funding in first responders by $16 billion and the \nproposal of the Senator from Michigan which would up the funding for a \nnew line item, it would create a new line item in first responders of \n$5 billion for communications assistance, truly is a misallocation of \nresources.\n  Even if we could afford it, we would not want to put that money into \nthose accounts at that level. Why? Because these groups involved in \ndeveloping first responder capability are not capable of spending that \namount of money. How do we know that? Because we have $7 billion--$3 \nbillion from the year 2004 and $4 billion from the year 2005--sitting \nin Washington, in the Federal Treasury, which has not gone out yet for \nfirst responder funding activity.\n\n[[Page S8167]]\n\nWhy is that? It is because, first, the Department of Homeland Security \nhas some problems, and we are trying to address those in this bill, and \nwe put in specific language to try to change that, and I know Secretary \nChertoff has addressed it, but it is larger than that. It is not just \nthe homeland security issue, it is the fact that one of the points the \nRudman Commission made, and was even more aggressively made by the \nGilmore Commission, which was another high-quality group of people who \ngot together to study this issue, was that until you have a plan for \nhow you are going to spend this money, if you just send it back to the \nStates and to the communities without a plan which they have to follow, \nall you are doing is revenue sharing. It is going to end up being a \nplus-up for local agencies. Some will buy new cruisers or buy bomb dogs \nor just buy dogs, and they will buy whatever they want to buy without \nany plan or organization.\n\n  The reason the $7 billion is still in the Treasury instead of out \nthere on the streets helping out the fire, police, and local agencies \nis that the assessment plans, which are critical to the effort of \ngetting in place a thoughtful approach to first responder funding and \nhow they use these dollars, have not yet been completed. States are \nstill working on assessment plans so they can come forward with these \nplans, and then the money will go out, and it will be spent in an \norderly way instead of a haphazard way.\n  We do not want to get back into the situation we had in the 1970s, \nwhere essentially we were sending out hundreds of millions of dollars--\nnot billions of dollars as we are today--to various groups across the \ncountry in the name of better law enforcement. A great deal of it ended \nup buying equipment and items that turned out to be not only not \nproductive but counterproductive because a lot of interoperability \ncommunications was bought with that money when there was no plan \noverlying that LEA money to require interoperability. So the police \ndepartment would get a grant for $20,000, $30,000 and go out and buy \ntheir system of communications, and then the fire department in the \nsame town would get their $20,000 or $30,000, and they would go out and \nbuy theirs, and neither could talk to each other because there was no \nplan.\n  The whole concept behind the assessment approach is so we can have a \nplan so that the civil defense centers in the States--fire in the \nStates, police in the States, first responder health care communities \nin the States--are all coordinated and the money goes out in a \ncoordinated way, that when it is completed, we actually have a \nsituation where, if there is an incident and these folks who are so \ncommitted to making their communities stronger and better have to \nrespond to it, it will be done in a focused and coordinated way \npursuant to a plan which has been funded and focused in a coordinated \nway.\n  First off, the theory behind this, that we can spend another $21 \nbillion because we are spending $30 billion in Iraq is--I think that \ntheory totally disconnects.\n  Secondly, the concept that this may be paid for some day by repealing \nthe budget point on permanent extension of tax cuts is purely incorrect \nbecause there were no permanent extensions in the budget.\n  Thirdly, if we are going to spend money on national security in the \nhomeland area, we should spend it on threat-based activity, which is \nwhat this bill does. And the threats, in order of priority, put the \nissue of first responders lower than some of the first responsibilities \nof Homeland Security, such as border security, airline security, \nweapons of mass destruction protection, and intelligence-gathering \nagencies. That is absolutely critical.\n  Fourth, as a practical matter, we can appropriate all this money, but \nit cannot be spent, so there is no point in appropriating it at this \ntime. Maybe a year from now, maybe 2 years from now, after that $7 \nbillion has come down a little bit. Remember, we are adding another $4 \nbillion to it this year anyway. This bill is not cheap on the side of \nfirst responders. We are putting another $4 billion on top of the $7 \nbillion that still has not been spent.\n  When these assessment plans get in place and we start to generate \nsome proper activity that allows this money to be spent in an orderly \nway and does not get wasted, then we might want to significantly \nincrease this funding because we know it will be effectively used. But \nright now, to increase this funding just means it is going to sit at \nthe Treasury, instead of being used where it really needs to be used, \nwhich is on threats which exist today and which we have to address \ntoday, which brings me to the underlying issue of threat because we are \ngoing to hear about this again and again. There is going to be an \nattempt to spend another $1 billion, $2 billion, or $3 billion--I do \nnot know what the final number will be--on mass transit.\n  The key to our capacity to defend ourselves from these terrorists is \nour capacity to stop them before they get here, and that means we have \nto have better intelligence and we have to have better border security. \nWhen they do get here, the key is to make sure they do not have the \nopportunity to use their hate and their commitment to trying to kill \nAmericans in a vast way versus in a confined way by stopping them from \nhaving weapons of mass destruction or using a vehicle that would allow \nthem to plus up their heinous crimes such as they did on 9/11 when they \nused airplanes as weapons, as missiles essentially.\n  So it all becomes a matter of order of threat, where the dollars \nshould be. And the No. 1 issue we have to address is better gathering \nof intelligence, in which Homeland Security has a limited role, but \nSecretary Chertoff is going to expand that effort; followed by the \nissue of weapons of mass destruction; followed by border security; \nfollowed by the first responsibilities of the Federal Government which \nare things such as air traffic control and air management; followed by, \nof course, funding and helping out first responders, which we have \ndone, which is why there is still $7 billion sitting in the bank \nbecause we have done it, but the system is not yet ready to effectively \nhandle that money. It will be soon, hopefully. A lot of pressure is \nbeing put on both the Department of Homeland Security in this bill and \non the State assessment plans to accomplish that.\n  This proposal is maybe well intentioned, but it is misguided at all \nsorts of different levels. Therefore, I cannot support it. Obviously, \neven if it were within the budget I would not support it because this \nis not where we need to allocate resources at this time at this level \nof activity.\n  I make my point of order at this time that under section 302(f) of \nthe Congressional Budget Act the amendment provides spending in excess \nof the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I move to waive the budget point of order \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I simply note that we will be voting on this, hopefully, \nlater today when we have more of a contingency available to \nparticipate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I know my colleague from Hawaii is in the Chamber, but I \nwant to respond to comments made by my friend from New Hampshire. He \ngave a good response to this amendment. It is a good bureaucratic \nresponse. As I said during my remarks, I apologize for offering an \namendment of this magnitude. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nabsolutely correct, the entire budget we are talking about for homeland \nsecurity is around $31 billion. This amendment is 50 percent of that \nbudget.\n  I was fully aware, when I came to the floor to offer this amendment, \nof the reaction it would receive, but I also happen to believe the \nRudman report, written by a group of people who are serious about these \nmatters, has laid out for us very clearly what needs to be done.\n  Whether our domestic security is funded by reducing millionaire tax \ncuts or by some other mechanism, I am willing to listen. I just tried \nto offer one idea of where these resources could come from. Obviously, \nwhen an amendment like this is offered, I do not have the right to \noffer necessarily an offset so large. Tax cuts provided to the most \naffluent Americans was simply a suggestion as to where the resources \ncould come from.\n\n[[Page S8168]]\n\n  The underlying point needs to be made that we are not doing enough in \nthe areas where we are terribly vulnerable. I will state how we are \nspending this money and lay it out. First, we are spending actually \nless this year than we have in the previous 2 years. In the Office of \nState and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness, which covers \nport security, truck security, rail security, training, technical \nassistance and development, we are going to spend just under $2.7 \nbillion. Last year, it was in excess of $3 billion. The numbers are \ncoming down, and yet almost everyone now knows in this country that our \nports across the Nation are entirely vulnerable.\n  Less than 5 percent of containers have any screening done on them. \nOur rail and freight systems are virtually wide open. Stories get \nwritten every single day about the vulnerabilities that exist. We take \nthe bulk of the funding proposed by this amendment--in excess of $11 \nbillion--and put it into these critical areas.\n  Again, I know it is a lot of money, but let another attack occur in \nthis country, as I believe it will, and then look back and say: I \nwonder if we might have done a little more in the areas where we were \nvulnerable to prevent the attack, or I wonder whether or not the \nSenator from Connecticut was asking for too much.\n  I merely cited Iraq and Afghanistan to give a sense of \nproportionality. I have strongly supported the resources that ensure \nour troops receive the adequate funding they need.\n  And by the way, in certain areas like equipment, they are not even \ngetting what they ought to be getting.\n  I make the point that there we are spending roughly $15 billion every \n3 months. This amendment costs roughly the same amount over a full \nyear.\n  I have a pretty good sense, after a number of years here, as to what \nis going to happen with this amendment. It is probably going to fail. \nBut I want the American public to know there are those of us who \nbelieve that if one has the will, one can find a way to do this. \nWhether one likes my proposed offset or not, if one believes that we \nought to be doing more to make our ports, our rail systems, our truck \nsecurity, and other infrastructure far better prepared than they are \ntoday, then they ought to support this amendment.\n  If they think we are doing enough already, then vote against it. I \nbelieve we are not doing enough, and I think many people in this \ncountry believe that as well. That is why I offer this amendment.\n  In conclusion, I would like to add a summary of the conclusions and \nrecommendations of the Rudman report. The full report is some 70 or 80 \npages and that is too long to include in the Record. It is available to \nMembers who would care to have a full copy of it. This is approximately \n12 pages. I ask unanimous consent that the conclusions and \nrecommendations of the Rudman Report on Homeland Security be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Report Prepared by the Council on Foreign Relations--Conclusions and \n                            Recommendations\n\n\n        1. Define and Provide for Minimum Essential Capabilities\n\n       The Task Force found that there is no systematic national \n     standard that defines the essential minimum capabilities for \n     emergency responders that every jurisdiction of a given \n     population size should possess or be able to access. Because \n     of this, there are currently no comprehensive, systematic, \n     and consolidated principles or measures against which the \n     degree and quality of preparedness can be tracked nationwide. \n     Current efforts to develop such standards are inconsistent \n     and dispersed among various government agencies and \n     nongovernmental organizations. Additionally, existing \n     standards for minimum capabilities for emergency responders \n     are a patchwork with many missing pieces that lacks \n     systematic integration, are insufficient to address many \n     major challenges--inc1uding that of catastrophic terrorism \n     involving WMD--and are not harmonized across the many types \n     of emergency responders. While existing standards provide a \n     useful starting point, they do not constitute ``national \n     standards for emergency response training and preparedness,'' \n     as called for in the National Strategy for Homeland Security. \n     (A selection from this document is included in Appendix B.) \n     At the end of five years of federal funding, therefore, some \n     metropolitan areas may still lack fundamental emergency \n     responder capabilities.\n       Congress should require DHS and HHS to work with other \n     federal agencies, state and local emergency responder \n     agencies and officials, and standard-setting bodies from the \n     emergency responder community to establish clearly defined \n     standards and guidelines for federal, state, and local \n     government emergency preparedness and response in such areas \n     as training, interoperable communication systems, and \n     response equipment. These standards must be sufficiently \n     flexible to allow local officials to set priorities based on \n     their needs, provided that they reach nationally determined \n     preparedness levels within a fixed time period. These \n     capabilities must be measurable and subject to federal audit.\n       Congress should require that the FY05 budget request for \n     DHS be accompanied by a minimum essential emergency responder \n     capability standard of WMD--and terrorism-related disaster \n     equipment and training per 100,000 persons in a metropolitan \n     region, and by separate standards for rural areas. Each \n     recipient state and metropolitan area should then be required \n     to submit a plan detailing how it intends to achieve that \n     standard, to incorporate it into all appropriate training \n     programs, and to regularly test its effectiveness.\n       National performance standards could be implemented through \n     an incentive grant system making federal funding conditional \n     and available to those localities that adopt federally \n     approved standards of preparedness.\n\n\n                  2. develop requirements methodology\n\n       National capability standards for levels of preparedness \n     must drive an emergency preparedness requirements process. \n     This process must evolve into one similar to that currently \n     used by the U.S. military. Threats must be identified, \n     capabilities for addressing threats determined, and \n     requirements generated for establishing or otherwise gaining \n     access to necessary capabilities. The Task Force found that \n     the administration and Congress were funding emergency \n     preparedness without any agreement on methodology to \n     determine how much is enough or what the requirements are. It \n     is therefore extremely difficult, if not impossible, to \n     measure how well prepared the United States is.\n       Congress should include in the FY04 appropriations for DHS \n     and HHS a provision calling on each agency to accompany the \n     FY05 budget request with a detailed methodology for \n     determining the national requirements for emergency responder \n     capability and assistance.\n       Congress should require that DHS and HHS submit a \n     coordinated plan for meeting national preparedness standards \n     by the end of FY07.\n       Congress should require DHS and HHS to report annually on \n     the status of emergency preparedness across the United \n     States. This report should indicate the levels of federal, \n     state, and local expenditures for emergency preparedness, \n     evaluate how effectively that funding is being used, and \n     assess the status of preparedness in each state based on \n     national preparedness standards.\n\n\n                   3. accept necessary burden-sharing\n\n       The Task Force found that there were no accepted national \n     guidelines for determining the nature of burden-sharing \n     between the federal government and state and local \n     jurisdictions. Although state and local jurisdictions should \n     maintain primary responsibility for funding normal levels of \n     public health and safety readiness, the Task Force found that \n     the federal government should be responsible for providing \n     the funds necessary to cover the incremental costs of \n     achieving essential standards in responding to the additional \n     national security threat posed by terrorism. In some \n     outstanding cases, federal funds may be required to enhance \n     state and local emergency responder infrastructure that has \n     been starved of resources if the deterioration of \n     capabilities is such that it poses a threat to national \n     security and state and local resources are not reasonably \n     sufficient for addressing this shortfall.\n\n\n                4. guarantee sustained multiyear funding\n\n       The Task Force found that many state and local governments \n     are unwilling or unable to accept federal funding for \n     programs that will generate long-term costs in the absence of \n     guarantees that the federal government will make funds \n     available for sustaining such programs. Stable and long-term \n     funding is critical for encouraging state and local \n     governments to develop the necessary emergency response \n     capabilities and, most critically, to sustain them over time.\n       Congress should accompany all authorizations for emergency \n     responder assistance grants in FY04 and thereafter with \n     budget authority for sustaining those grants through the \n     following two fiscal years.\n\n\n                     5. refocus funding priorities\n\n       The Task Force found existing systems for determining the \n     distribution of appropriated funds to states to be badly in \n     need of reform. The federal government currently determines \n     levels for emergency preparedness funding to states primarily \n     on a formula that guarantees minimum funding levels to all \n     states and then determines additional funding based on each \n     state's population. All citizens of the United States deserve \n     a base level of protection regardless of where they live. \n     Nevertheless, the state and population-drive approach has led \n     to highly uneven funding outcomes. Wyoming, for example,\n\n[[Page S8169]]\n\n     receives $10.00 per capita from DHS for emergency \n     preparedness while New York State receives only $1.40 per \n     capita. While this approach may have political appeal, it \n     unnecessarily diverts funding from areas of highest priority. \n     In addition, decision by state officials regarding the \n     allocation of funds in their states have not sufficiently \n     taken into account the multitude of necessary factors.\n       Congress should establish a system for allocating scarce \n     resources based less on dividing the spoils and more on \n     addressing identified threats and vulnerabilities. To do \n     this, the federal government should consider such factors as \n     population, population density, vulnerability assessment, and \n     presence of critical infrastructure within each state. State \n     governments should be required to use the same criteria for \n     distributing funds within each state.\n       Congress should also require each state receiving federal \n     emergency preparedness funds to provide an analysis based on \n     the same criteria to justify the distribution of funds in \n     that state.\n\n\n                 6. RATIONALIZE CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT\n\n       The Task Force found that the proliferation of committees \n     and subcommittees in Congress makes it hard to devise a \n     coherent homeland security policy and a focused homeland \n     defense system. Congress needs to have a lead committee, or \n     an effective joint committee, to shape overall policy. \n     Otherwise the system is likely to be fragmented and plagued \n     with pork.\n       The U.S. House of Representatives should transform the \n     House Select Committee on Homeland Security into a standing \n     committee and give it a formal, leading role in the \n     authorization of all emergency responder expenditures in \n     order to streamline the federal budgetary process.\n       The U.S. Senate should consolidate emergency preparedness \n     and response oversight into the Senate Government Affairs \n     Committee.\n\n\n                  7. ACCELERATE DELIVERY OF ASSISTANCE\n\n       The Task Force found that many metropolitan areas and \n     states had actually received and spent only a small portion \n     of the funds for emergency responders that have been \n     appropriated by Congress since September 11. The current \n     inflexible structure of homeland security funding, along with \n     shifting federal requirements and increased amounts of \n     paperwork, places unnecessary burdens on state and local \n     governments as they attempt to provide badly needed funds to \n     emergency responders. While a balance should be maintained \n     between the need for the rapid allocation of emergency \n     preparedness funds and the maintenance of appropriate \n     oversight to ensure that such funds are well spent, the \n     current danger is too great to allow for business as usual. \n     According to the National Emergency Managers Association, \n     ``appropriation cycles have been erratic causing extreme \n     burdens on state and local governments to continue \n     preparedness activities when there is no federal funding, and \n     then forcing them to thoughtfully and strategically apply \n     several years of federal funds and millions of dollars at one \n     time.'' (NEMA, State Spending and Homeland Security Funds, \n     April 2, 2003) As a first step toward addressing this \n     problem, Congress instructed the DHS Office of Domestic \n     Preparedness in the FY03 consolidated appropriations measure \n     (P.L. 108-7) to distribute grant funds to states within 60 \n     days of the enactment of the bill and required states to \n     distribute at least 80 percent of those funds to localities \n     within 45 days of receipt.\n       Congress should ensure that all future appropriations bills \n     funding emergency response include strict distribution time-\n     frames as exemplified by the FY03 consolidated appropriations \n     measure.\n       Congress should require states to submit data regarding the \n     speed of distribution of the federal funds for emergency \n     responders appropriated to states.\n       Congress should grant DHS the authority to allow states \n     greater flexibility in using past homeland security funding. \n     As a first step in this direction, Congress should authorize \n     greater flexibility in the federal guidelines laid out in the \n     FY03 Omnibus Appropriations Bill for the percentages of funds \n     that can be used for various emergency response activities \n     (e.g., 70 percent for equipment, 18 percent for exercises, 7 \n     percent for planning, 5 percent for training) to make it \n     possible for states to better allocate resources according to \n     their most urgent needs. This authority should be granted on \n     a case by case basis by means of a waiver from the Secretary \n     of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\n                       8. FIX FUNDING MECHANISMS\n\n       Many states have been mandated to develop more than five \n     separate homeland security plans. While the information \n     requested by each homeland security plan is similar, states \n     and communities are often required to reinvent the wheel from \n     one emergency plan to the next.\n       DHS should move the Office of Domestic Preparedness from \n     the Bureau of Border and Transportation Security to the \n     Office of State and Local Government Coordination in order to \n     consolidate oversight of grants to emergency responders \n     within the Office of the Secretary.\n       States should develop a prioritized list of requirements in \n     order to ensure that federal funding is allocated to achieve \n     the best return on investments.\n       Congress should require DHS to work with other federal \n     agencies to streamline homeland security grant programs in a \n     way that reduces unnecessary duplication and establishes \n     coordinated ``one-stop shopping'' for state and local \n     authorities seeking grant funds. Efforts to streamline the \n     grants process should not, however, be used as a \n     justification for eliminating existing block grant programs \n     that support day-to-day operations of emergency responder \n     entities. In many cases, such grants must be expanded.\n       Congress should create an interagency committee to \n     eliminate duplication in homeland security grants \n     requirements and simplify the application process for federal \n     grants.\n\n\n                     9. DISSEMINATE BEST PRACTICES\n\n       Although emergency responders have consistently identified \n     as a high priority the need to systematically share best \n     practices and lessons learned, the Task Force found \n     insufficient national coordination of efforts to \n     systematically capture and disseminate best practices for \n     emergency responders. While various federal agencies, \n     professional associations, and educational institutions have \n     begun initiatives to develop and promulgate best practices \n     and lessons learned, these disparate efforts generally are \n     narrow and unsystematic and have not sufficiently reached \n     potential beneficiaries. Such information-sharing could be \n     one of the most effective ways to extract the greatest amount \n     of preparedness from a finite resource pool. Once centralized \n     and catalogued, such data will allow all emergency responders \n     to learn from past experiences and improve the quality of \n     their efforts, thereby assuring taxpayers the maximum return \n     on their investment in homeland security. Access to this \n     resource will provide the analytical foundation for future \n     decisions regarding priorities, planning, training, and \n     equipment.\n       Congress should establish within DHS a National Institute \n     for Best Practices in Emergency Preparedness to work with \n     state and local governments, emergency preparedness \n     professional associations, and other partners to establish \n     and promote a universal best practices/lessons learned \n     knowledge base. The National Institute should establish a \n     website for emergency preparedness information and should \n     coordinate closely with HHS to ensure that best practices for \n     responding to biological attack are sufficiently incorporated \n     into the knowledge base.\n\n\n                 10. ENHANCE COORDINATION AND PLANNING\n\n       The Task Force found that although effective coordination \n     and planning are among the most important elements of \n     preparedness, jurisdictions across the country are neither \n     sufficiently coordinating emergency response disciplines \n     within their jurisdictions nor adequately reaching across \n     jurisdictional lines to coordinate their efforts with \n     neighboring communities. Although Title VI of the Stafford \n     Act (P.L. 106-390) authorizes the Director of FEMA to \n     coordinate federal and state emergency preparedness plans, \n     this authority has not been applied sufficiently to ensure \n     adequate levels of coordination and planning between and \n     among federal, state, and local jurisdictions. In addition, \n     state and local emergency management agencies lack the \n     resources to develop and maintain critical emergency \n     management capabilities. More also needs to be done to \n     encourage and facilitate mutual aid and other cross-\n     jurisdictional agreements that pool resources, minimize \n     costs, and enhance national preparedness.\n       DHS should require that all states and territories submit \n     statewide mutual assistance plans, including cross-border \n     plans for all cities and counties adjoining state or \n     territorial borders. Reference to such plans should be \n     required in all homeland security grant applications for \n     federal funding. Wherever possible, grants should be \n     structured to reward the pooling of assets across \n     jurisdictional lines.\n       DHS should develop a comprehensive national program for \n     exercises that coordinates exercise activities involving \n     federal agencies, state and local governments, and \n     representatives from appropriate private sector entities \n     including hospitals, the media, telecommunications providers, \n     and others. These exercises should prepare emergency \n     responders for all types of hazards, with a specific focus on \n     WMD detection and response. When necessary, funds should be \n     provided to ensure that exercises do not interfere with the \n     day-to-day activities of emergency responders.\n       Congress should work with DHS to expand the capacity of \n     existing training facilities involved in the National \n     Domestic Preparedness Consortium and to identify any new \n     training facilities for emergency responders that may be \n     required.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Again, I have great respect for my colleague from New \nHampshire. He has a very difficult job, and there are constraints, but \nI also have been around long enough to know that when faced with \nemergencies that we have a way of getting around those constraints and \ndoing what needs to be done. We have certainly done that in Iraq. We \nhave done it in Afghanistan. I believe we ought to do it at home as \nwell.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S8170]]\n\n  (The remarks of Mr. Akaka are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee.) The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send three modifications of my \namendments Nos. 1171, No. 1150, and No. 1151, to the desk and ask \nunanimous consent those modifications be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have now three pending amendments that \nhave been modified, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to make those amendments \npending?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe they are not pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendments have been filed for future \nconsideration.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes. That is fine. The modifications to the filed \namendments have been agreed to.\n  I would like to make a statement about rail security legislation and \nthen, after conversations with Senator Gregg, bring up an amendment on \nUAVs, which is filed, and then have two additional amendments pending, \nbecause I am afraid I may need up-or-down votes.\n  I am pleased the Senate continues to make progress on the Department \nof Homeland Security appropriations bill. It is important that we \nadequately fund this Department and its essential programs which are \ncritical to our Nation's efforts to secure our homeland as we fight the \nwar on terrorism.\n  In addition to this funding measure, legislation authorizing security \nefforts is equally important. I am particularly concerned about an \nauthorizing bill the Senate passed by unanimous consent in the 108th \nCongress, but which has not yet been enacted. Earlier this week I \nintroduced the Rail Security Act of 2005, legislation that is nearly \nidentical to the rail security bill that passed the Senate last year, \nas I say, unanimously. I sincerely hope we once again pass this \nimportant legislation and, given current events, the sooner we act, the \nbetter. Rail security must be made a top priority in this Congress.\n  I would like to mention the Rail Security Act we passed in the 108th \nCongress was the product of numerous hearings in the Commerce \nCommittee, with expert witnesses and with administration support. So \nthat is why I believe it should have relatively little controversy \nassociated with it.\n  We are all deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life caused by the \nterrorist attacks in London last week. Those instances are a painful \nreminder of the cruel nature of our enemies in this war and of what we \nmust do to fight and win against those who wish to eradicate our way of \nlife. I have said on many occasions that we cannot just play defense in \nthis war, that instead we must take the fight to the enemy. Still, we \nmust do what is possible to protect Americans at home. The London \nbombings and the attacks on Madrid's commuter rail system last year \ndemonstrate all too vividly the continuing need for this legislation.\n  We have taken considerable action to address aviation security and \ndevoted significant resources to that mode. I think all would agree \naviation is safer now than before 9/11. However, since the terrorist \nattacks nearly 4 years ago, only relatively modest resources have been \ndedicated to rail security. Our Nation's transit system, Amtrak, and \nthe freight railroads, I am sad to say, remain vulnerable to terrorist \nattacks, this despite the fact that the Department of Homeland Security \nhas identified as potential terrorist targets the freight and rail \npassenger networks, which are critical to the Nation's transportation \nsystem and national defense.\n  The 9/11 Commission, in its report on the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding the 9/11 attacks, called for improved security in all modes \nof transportation, noting that ``terrorists may turn their attention to \nother modes.''\n\n  The Rail Security Act would authorize a total of almost $1.2 billion \nfor rail security. More than half of this funding would be authorized \nto complete tunnel safety and security improvements at New York's Penn \nStation, which is used by over 500,000 transit, commuter, and inner \ncity passengers each workday. The legislation would also establish a \ngrant program authorized at $350 million to encourage security \nenhancements by the freight railroads, Amtrak shippers of hazardous \nmaterials, and local governments with security responsibility for \npassenger stations not owned by Amtrak.\n  Further, DHS would be required to complete a vulnerability assessment \nof the rail network to terrorist attack, and make recommendations to \nCongress for addressing security weaknesses. Importantly, to protect \nthe taxpayers' interests, all Amtrak authorizations would be managed by \nthe Department of Transportation through formal grant agreements.\n  We face a dedicated, focused, intelligent foe in the war on \nterrorism. This enemy will probe to find our weaknesses and move \nagainst them. We have seen the vulnerability of rail to terrorism in \nother countries and the devastating consequences of such an attack. It \nis essential we move expeditiously to protect all the modes of \ntransportation from potential attack.\n  Also, at this time I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nDelaware, Mr. Biden, be listed as a cosponsor of the Rail Security Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator for his cosponsorship of this \nlegislation, particularly given that Mr. Biden travels daily on the \nrails, back and forth to his home in Delaware.\n  I trust the Senate will move quickly to once again pass this \nessential legislation. We owe at least that much to the American people \nas we continue our struggle against an enemy that wants nothing less \nthan to destroy everything we stand for and believe in.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1151, As Modified\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to set aside pending legislation \nand take up amendment 1151 as modified, UAVs at the southwestern \nborder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n  The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment numbered \n1151, as modified.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To specify how certain vehicles are to be deployed to enhance \n                            border security)\n\n       On page 61, line 26, insert ``which may be deployed between \n     ports of entry along the southwestern border of the United \n     States, taking into consideration the particular security \n     risks in the area and the need for constant surveillance of \n     such border,'' after ``unmanned aerial vehicles,''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, despite the worthy efforts that have been \nmade to secure our homeland, much remains to be done. I, for one, do \nnot believe we can ever expect to fully secure our Nation until we \nenact comprehensive immigration reform that includes strong and \neffective enforcement requirements. We cannot accomplish that in this \npending bill, but in the meantime we can still take additional measures \nto better secure our border.\n  I commend the chairman, subcommittee chairman, and the ranking \nmembers for putting forward an appropriations bill that includes a \nnumber of sound border security funding provisions. One area I would \nlike to see strengthened, as is proposed by this amendment, is to \nensure we are more fully monitoring the southwestern border where most \nof the illegal crossing and needless deaths occur annually.\n  Let me cite a few of the more alarming statistics about what is going \non in the southwestern border region. Over 300 people died in the \ndesert last year trying to cross the border. About 200 of those deaths \noccurred in the Arizona desert. The Border Patrol is currently \napprehending approximately 1,300 undocumented immigrants a day in \nArizona. This number is expected to rise. An estimated 3,000 people \nenter the United States illegally from Mexico every single day. Last \nyear, 1.1 million illegal immigrants were caught by the Border Patrol \nand more than half of those were in the State of Arizona. The Border \nPatrol releases more than 90 percent of the people they catch through \nvoluntary repatriation, because the system is simply overwhelmed.\n  I want to repeat that, Mr. President. Anybody who has visited our \nborder and seen those wonderful men and women who serve there in the \nBorder Patrol and Immigration will agree they are simply overwhelmed.\n\n[[Page S8171]]\n\n  We have our work cut out for us. We need more manpower and better \nfocused technology. This legislation provides some needed funding for \nboth, but I hope by the time it passes the Senate that we redirect some \nof the $31.8 billion in this bill to allow us to fulfill a commitment \nwe made just 7 months ago as part of the intelligence reform \nlegislation. In that law we authorize for the coming year 2,000 more \nBorder Patrol agents, twice as many as would be provided for in the \nunderlying bill, and 8,000 detention beds, 5,790 more than provided for \nin the bill before us.\n  I filed amendments to fulfill these authorized levels and would like \nto work with the bill managers to address these important security \nissues.\n  Another area of particular concern along the southwestern border, \nparticularly to Arizonans, since our State is now the leading gateway \nto illegal entry, is the Federal Government's use of technologies that \nare already available to strengthen our security efforts.\n  Manpower alone is not the answer when we are dealing with a 6,000-\nmile border area. The February grounding of the unmanned aerial \nvehicles, UAVs, in southern Arizona sent the absolute wrong message to \nthose seeking to illegally enter our country. They are a helpful and \nneeded deterrent to illegal entry and have been very useful in helping \nto monitor and better secure our southern border. Halting this program \neven temporarily needlessly jeopardizes our citizens and Nation.\n  The temperature today on the border between Arizona and Mexico is \nprobably, in the middle of the day, 120 degrees. It is awfully hard on \nBorder Patrol people, and there is no way we can patrol these hundreds \nof miles of border simply with ground vehicles. UAVs have proved \nextremely effective in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other places in the \nworld. Clearly it would have tremendous utility in monitoring what is \nhappening along our borders, not only to prevent illegal crossings but \nalso, once those crossings are made, to track down and arrest those who \nare doing so. And as is well known, not everyone who is crossing the \nborder is simply coming for a job. We have significant drug \ntrafficking, and the Director of the FBI has stated that we are \napprehending more and more citizens of ``countries of interest'' that \nare crossing our borders as well.\n  In our efforts to counter terrorism and promote national security, it \nis essential that we use all appropriate assets available to ensure the \nsafety of our citizens and the security of our borders. As we learned \nthrough extensive military operations, UAVs have proven to be a highly \neffective aerial surveillance system that can be used as a force \nmultiplier in coordination with other air and ground surveillance \ntechnologies. Of course, we should work to ensure the most effective \nUAV technologies are employed over the border, but it is important that \nsome form of UAV be deployed in the short term to augment ongoing \nenforcement efforts. Grounding the UAVs also creates a perception in an \nalready volatile border region that the Federal Government is \nabandoning its responsibilities.\n  We are now into our fifth month with grounded UAVs at the southern \nborder, and I find this inexcusable and unacceptable. A UAV program not \nonly helps to deter illegal immigrants but also maximizes the \neffectiveness of our law enforcement agents on the ground.\n  I commend the bill managers for recognizing the need for UAVs and \nhope they can agree to support my amendment that will make clear to DHS \nthat the funding provided in this bill is not to support grounded \ntechnologies but, rather, is provided to support a robust UAV program \nthat best meets the area's security risks while recognizing the need \nfor constant surveillance along the southwestern border.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to ensure UAV \nsurveillance at the Nation's borders and maximize our law enforcement \nefforts.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that the managers of the bill \nwould agree to this amendment by voice vote at the appropriate time, \nbut I would clearly await the presence of the managers before \nproceeding.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1150, as Modified\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1150 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1150, as modified.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 100, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       Sec. 519. (a) The amount appropriated for salaries and \n     expenses by title II under the heading ``Customs and Border \n     Protection'' is increased by $367,552,000, all of which may \n     be made available to hire an additional 1,000 border patrol \n     agents.\n       (b) The amount appropriated by title III for State and \n     local grants under the heading ``state and local programs'' \n     is reduced by $367,552,000.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, despite worthy efforts to secure our \nhomeland, much remains to be done, and I do not believe we can expect \nto secure fully our Nation until we enact comprehensive immigration \nreform that includes strong and effective enforcement requirements.\n  I commend the chairman and subcommittee chairman and ranking members \nfor putting forward an appropriations bill that includes a number of \nimportant border security funding provisions. Clearly, they do not have \nan easy job. And I know they have worked to fund critical homeland \nsecurity needs.\n  One area that I strongly believe should be strengthened, however, \nconcerns the number of Border Patrol agents as they play one of the \nmost critical roles in securing our homeland.\n  To help my colleagues to understand the great need for more manpower, \nlet me cite just a few of the more alarming statistics about what is \ngoing on in the southwestern border region. Over 300 people died last \nyear; an estimated 3,000 people enter the United States from Mexico \nevery day. A few weeks ago, 79 people were found in a Phoenix alley \ncrammed into a commercial horse trailer. The heat was over 100 degrees, \nand they had been there for several days. Of the 79, 11 were children, \nincluding a 4-month-old baby. At the beginning of the summer, when the \ntemperature in the desert rose unexpectedly, 12 people died crossing \ninto Arizona in 1 weekend.\n  Mr. President, we have our work cut out for us. We need more manpower \nand better focused technology. This legislation provides some needed \nfunding for both. But I hope that by the time it passes the Senate, we \nredirect some of the $31.8 billion in this bill to allow us to fulfill \na commitment we made just 7 months ago as part of the intelligence \nreform legislation.\n  Mr. President, a dangerous state of lawlessness exists along the \nsouthwestern border, and it has become increasingly volatile. The \nFederal Government's inability to stem the illegal traffic flowing \nacross the border has shifted substantial financial and social burdens \nto residents of the border region. Recent action by minutemen along the \nArizona border provided the Nation with an image of the frustration \nfelt by many Americans.\n  Border States are suffering from the immediate and downstream \nproblems associated with illegal immigration. Our hospitals are \nburdened with enormous uncompensated costs, and so are our State and \nlocal law enforcement agencies. We simply need more manpower to protect \nthe border in the near term. While I strongly believe that once we fix \nour broken immigration system, we will see the day that some of our \nborder resources can be shifted to other priorities, until then \nCongress must have the will to take the action needed to reform our \nbroken immigration system. We need to have a robust Border Patrol force \nhired, trained, and on the job.\n  While providing solid resources to state and local officials to \nensure the readiness of our first responders is imperative, the men and \nwomen serving in the Border Patrol are literally on the front lines in \nthe fight to keep the terrorists out of our country. CIA Director \nMuller has said that more and more people from ``countries of \ninterest'' are looking at our southwest border as a possible point of \nentry into the\n\n[[Page S8172]]\n\nUnited States. Why shouldn't they. Hundreds of thousands and \npotentially millions of migrants who enter the United States illegally \neach year to work represent the perfect cover for potential terrorists. \nOf course, if others have offsets to suggest, that would be preferable. \nI am open to any and all options that will enable us to meet the full \nlevel of Border Patrol agents so desperately needed on the front lines.\n  Mr. President, I am aware that the managers are not in agreement with \nthis amendment, and that is why I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1171, as Modified\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1171 as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1171, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 100, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       Sec. 519. (a) The amount appropriated for salaries and \n     expenses by title II under the heading ``Immigration and \n     Customs Enforcement'' is increased by $198,990,000, all of \n     which may be made available to add an additional 5,760 \n     detention beds and additional positions or FTEs in the United \n     States.\n       (b) The amount appropriated by title III for State and \n     local grants under the heading ``state and local programs'' \n     is reduced by $198,990,000.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the situation on our borders, as I have \nsaid, has reached a critical juncture. I have given the statistics. The \nBorder Patrol releases more than 90 percent of the people they catch. I \nwant to repeat that. The Border Patrol releases through voluntary \nrepatriation more than 90 percent of the people they catch because the \nsystem is overwhelmed. That probably sounds unbelievable to most \nAmericans. The unfortunate reality is that the Border Patrol simply \ncannot take into custody the vast number of people that are \napprehended. Because of this, they must prioritize. Due to space \nlimitations, our Federal agents rightly give a higher priority to \naliens who represent potential criminal threats.\n  Mexican nationals who are apprehended are usually returned to Mexican \nGovernment officials, voluntarily taken back across the border, and, in \nthe case of a recent pilot program, repatriated to the interior of \nMexico with the hope they are less likely to risk crossing again.\n  However, foreign nationals from other countries often get off much \neasier. Because of the lack of detention space, the fact that their \nhome countries are farther away, and limitations in our immigration \nlaws, nationals from Guatemala, El Salvador, Brazil, and a number of \nother countries are frequently apprehended by Federal officials, given \na court summons to report to deportation proceedings, and released.\n  Mr. President, let me tell you that again. They are apprehended, they \nfind out they are from Brazil, they say, OK, show up in court, show up \nin court inside the United States, and then they are released. How many \nof those do you think we ever see again?\n  The reality has become demoralizing to the men and women serving in \nthe Border Patrol. Word about this loophole has quickly traveled back \nto Central and South American countries. Summonses to report to \ndeportation proceedings are frequently called ``permisos'' or \npermission slips. Smugglers now take migrants as far as they can and \ntell them to approach the first Border Patrol agent they see and turn \nthemselves in. After migrants obtain their permiso, they are then free \nto continue their journey to Chicago, New York, or wherever there is a \njob or a family member awaiting them.\n  One result of this loophole has been a dramatic increase in the \nnumber of Brazilians crossing the border illegally.\n  Fox News channel, Monday, July 11, 2005. ``Other Than Mexicans? \nWelcome to America.''\n\n       Los Angeles.--For many people around the world, the U.S.-\n     Mexico border is a doorway to opportunity--one that's \n     unlocked and wide open.\n       Brazilians, Chinese, Pakistanis and many others are joining \n     the tide of Mexicans who sneak across every day.\n       ``OTMs include people from all over the world--South \n     America, the Middle East, the Caribbean,'' explained former \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service Special Agent Michael \n     W.

While some say more legal immigration is \nneeded, others want the borders effectively closed. Both sides seem to \nagree that giving illegal immigrants a free pass is no solution at all.\n  I read from another article, ``Loophole to America'':\n       In the silvery-blue light of dusk, 20 Brazilians glided \n     across the Rio Grande in rubber rafts propelled by Mexican \n     smugglers who leaned forward and breast-stroked through the \n     gentle current.\n       Once on the U.S. side, the Brazilians scrambled ashore and \n     started looking for the Border Patrol. Their quick and well-\n     rehearsed surrender was part of a growing trend that is \n     demoralizing the Border Patrol and beckoning a rising number \n     of illegal immigrants from countries beyond Mexico.\n       ``We used to chase them; now they're chasing us,'' Border \n     Patrol Agent Gus Balderas said as he frisked the Brazilians \n     and collected their passports late last month.\n       What happened next explains the odd reversal.\n       The group was detained overnight and given a court summons \n     that allowed them to stay in the United States pending an \n     immigration hearing. Then a Border Patrol agent drove them to \n     the McAllen bus station, where they continued their journey \n     into America.\n       The formal term for the court summons is a ``notice to \n     appear.''

That is a no-show rate of 98 percent.\n       The problem is that U.S. immigration authorities are short \n     on detention space. They can send Mexicans back across the \n     border within hours. But international law prohibits them \n     from sending non-Mexicans to Mexico. Instead, they must \n     arrange travel documents and flights directly to the \n     immigrant's country of origin.

Arrests of \n     non-Mexicans along the U.S.-Mexico border totaled 14,935 in \n     1995, 28,598 in 2000 and 65,814 last year. In the first eight \n     months of this federal fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, more \n     than 85,000 have been apprehended. Nearly all are no-shows at \n     their court hearings, but comprehensive federal figures are \n     not available.\n       Statistics aren't the only evidence. Interviews with \n     immigrants caught sneaking across the border recently suggest \n     the problem will only increase as Central and South American \n     migrants learn of the unintended opportunity.\n       ``We thought they were going to deport us,'' said Ceidy \n     Milady Canales Alvarez, a 22-year-old Honduran recently \n     arrested by the Border Patrol in the McAllen sector. She said \n     a cousin in Atlanta had encouraged her to make the trip. So \n     she quit her $50-a-week job sewing shirts and pants that are \n     exported to the United States and crossed the border.\n       A Guatemalan arrested late last month in the McAllen sector \n     who gave his name as Hugo said that when word gets back home, \n     ``Anyone who has a little money will be coming.''\n       In his office on Capitol Hill, Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-\n     Texas., fumed at the news from South Texas and called for \n     emergency measures similar to those he adopted in 1989, when \n     he was the Border Patrol's agent in charge of the McAllen \n     sector.\n       ``We need somebody with a stiff spine who can make a \n     decision and say, `We're going to build a temporary detention \n     facility,' '' Reyes said. ``We need to send a message that \n     anybody who crosses that border illegally is going to be \n     detained. That message gets back (to the sending countries) \n     instantaneously.''\n       Sixteen years ago, Reyes faced a rush of immigrants fleeing \n     the violence of Central American civil wars. Most of their \n     asylum claims were rejected, but only after the migrants had \n     moved far away, armed with notices to appear in court.\n       ``They were coming across and flagging my men down,'' Reyes \n     said. ``It was destroying their morale.''\n       He got permission from the commissioner of the old \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service to establish a \n     temporary tent city with several thousand beds for detained \n     immigrants. That measure, coupled with an increase in the \n     number of agents at key border crossing points, shut off the \n     flow, Reyes said.\n       But the current director of immigration detention and \n     removal operations in South Texas wants nothing to do with \n     such emergency measures.\n       ``Anytime you have temporary facilities, you have a \n     degradation of services, you have anxieties,'' said Marc \n     Moore, who administers 1,700 detention spaces.\n       Reyes reacted angrily to Moore's remarks. While a temporary \n     facility would be expensive and might not be as tidy as Moore \n     would like, Reyes said, ``All these things are worth it given \n     the alternative of the permiso syndrome.''\n       Central and South Americans call the notice to appear their \n     ``permiso,'' which in Spanish means permission slip.\n       About 19,450 immigration detention beds are available \n     nationwide under funding levels established by Congress. \n     Although that is twice the number of beds Congress funded a \n     decade ago, it is far less than the number needed.\n       With the shortage of beds, immigration authorities must \n     choose between using a bed to hold a migrant with a serious \n     criminal record in the United States or one who has come \n     across the border without a criminal record. It's an easy \n     choice. They release the immigrant without the criminal \n     record.\n       Many Border Patrol agents express frustration over the \n     dilemma. They also worry that the high volume of non-Mexicans \n     is taking up much of their time and might be making it easier \n     for potential terrorists to slip past. Some said they spend \n     much of their 10-hour shift processing non-Mexicans.\n       One night last month when six agents were processing non-\n     Mexicans at the Border Patrol's Rio Grande City station, for \n     example,\n\n[[Page S8174]]\n\n     only seven agents were patrolling the 84 miles of river under \n     their watch.\n       Agent Isidro Noyola, who that night detained illegal \n     immigrants from Brazil and Honduras, said, ``Our fear is that \n     when we are processing and not patrolling the border, \n     somebody else is going to be coming through.''\n       Another agent expressed astonishment at the cheekiness of \n     some of the migrants.\n       ``They come up to you and say, `I want my permiso,' '' \n     Agent Larry Alvarez said. ``They want us to hurry up and get \n     them out of here.''\n       Others with the Border Patrol complained that they are \n     being reduced to little more than gun-toting travel agents in \n     uniforms.\n       In particular, the growth in the number of Brazilians \n     taking advantage of the loophole has been spectacular, \n     largely because of that country's poor economic conditions. \n     In 1995, the Border Patrol detained 260 Brazilians along the \n     Mexican border. Five years later, the number had grown to \n     1,241. But over the past eight months, it has soared to some \n     22,000.\n       The number of Brazilians floating north over the Rio Grande \n     might continue to increase because of a prime-time soap opera \n     in Brazil whose central character is smuggled across the \n     Mexican border and finds work as an exotic dancer in Miami.\n       Since its first episode aired in March, ``America'' has \n     become Brazil's most popular ``telenovela.'' In a country of \n     178 million, it has an audience of some 60 million.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am not sure this amendment will solve that problem, but \nI do believe a clear case is made for more detention beds. The \nunderlying bill adds 2,240 new detention beds for fiscal year 2006. The \namendment I am offering today further increases the number of detention \nbeds by 5,760 beds, bringing the number of new beds to the level we \nauthorized 7 months ago in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \nPrevention Act of 2004.\n  Lest there be any mistake made about me authorizing on an \nappropriations bill, this is authorized by the Intelligence Reform and \nTerrorism Prevention Act, as is the previous amendment.\n  I look forward to working with the managers of the bill on both of \nthese amendments.

Mr. President, my amendment addresses the issues of air \ncargo security and how we need to be doing much more to protect our \nNation's skies. Right now, TSA security procedures leave a staggering \n95 percent of cargo on passenger and all-cargo flights unscreened. In \naddition, TSA security regulations are voluntary and go unenforced.\n  My amendment provides a total of $302 million for fiscal year 2006 to \nimprove air cargo security. We all know not only are there planes that \ncarry cargo exclusively but most commercial flights have cargo in the \nbelly of their plane.\n  I ask a rhetorical question: What good does it do to make sure all of \nthe passengers onboard the plane are screened so that there are no \nexplosives or any other weapons, yet allow cargo that would ride in the \nbelly of the plane to not be screened 19 out of 20 times, thus keeping \nevery passenger on that plane, as well as the pilots and everyone else, \nat risk? The answer is obvious. It makes no sense.\n  For all the money we have put into passenger screening, we are \nleaving a gaping hole alongside, and that is cargo screening. While \npassenger screening has, indeed, improved rather significantly--anyone \nwho goes to any airport in this country knows that--cargo security has \nnot.\n  My amendment gives $200 million to improve the existing air cargo \nsecurity measure and $100 million for a competitive grant program to \nfund private research and development into air cargo\n\n[[Page S8175]]\n\nsecurity technology, and $2 million to fund a pilot program to evaluate \nthe use of blast-resistant cargo containers in commercial and all-cargo \naircraft.\n  Last year, I was proud to join our good friend, former Senator \nHollings from South Carolina, in cosponsoring an amendment included in \nthe Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act and signed into \nlaw by the President, authorizing these exact funding levels, totaling \nalmost $1 billion over 3 years to improve air cargo security.\n  My amendment would fully fund 1 year of the 3 years of authorization. \nThis is the second step in something that this body has found very \nnecessary; that is, adequately protecting us from terrorists who might \nput bombs, explosives, or whatever in air cargo. The potential threat \nfrom unchecked air cargo is just as serious, just as dangerous as a \nthreat from an actual terrorist boarding a commercial flight.\n  It has been reported that TSA considers the likelihood of a terrorist \nbombing a passenger airplane to be between 35 and 65 percent. It is the \nlikely primary aviation target for terrorists.\n  An analysis done by the RAND Corporation on security measures at Los \nAngeles International Airport determined that a bomb smuggled onto a \npassenger plane by a passenger but through uninspected cargo posed the \ngreatest threat relative to other types of attack. RAND determined it \nwould be the most likely to succeed and, unfortunately, the most likely \nto kill the most people.\n  Twenty-six percent of all air cargo in the United States is not \ncarried on cargo planes but rather on passenger flights, and only a \ntiny fraction of that is inspected. Even more cause for alarm is the \nfact that 46 percent of all international air cargo is carried on \ninternational cargo flights. The best way to protect against \nbiological, chemical, or nuclear weapons being smuggled onto a flight \nis to ensure that as much cargo as possible is screened through \nadvanced detection systems. However, TSA only screens 5 percent of the \nnearly 3 billion tons of cargo carried on commercial flights each year.\n  My amendment does three things. It gives $200 million to improve \nexisting air cargo security measures, in addition to the $50 million \nalready recommended by the committee for air cargo security activities.\n  Right now, TSA's principal means for checking cargo are through known \nshipper programs where so-called ``trusted'' shippers can avoid \nadditional screening in exchange for following stricter security \nprotocols. However, TSA does little to ensure that shippers are \ntrustworthy and have adequate security measures in place. In addition, \nenrollment in a known shipper program is voluntary, with only a third \nof domestic shippers currently participating. Since the TSA screens \nsuch a small percentage of cargo, it is very likely something could be \nmissed.\n  It is clear we need an additional line of defense. That is why I am \nproposing such a significant investment in new screening equipment and \nsecurity infrastructure so the TSA can check more cargo and protect \nmore flights.\n  Second, the amendment adds $100 million for the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to establish and carry out a competitive grant program to \nencourage the development of advanced air cargo security technology. \nThe amendment will fund research into new cargo screening technology, \nincluding the use of x rays, CT scans, and chemical trace detection to \nspeed up the screening process and allow more cargo to be screened more \neffectively.\n  Third, my amendment would fully fund a pilot program to evaluate the \nuse of blast-resistant cargo containers, cargo baggage containers. You \nput the baggage in a container and even if, God forbid, it explodes, it \ncannot damage the plane. The 9/11 Commission recommended every \npassenger aircraft have at least one hardened container in which \nquestionable or suspicious cargo can be shipped to reduce or eliminate \nthe risk to passengers in the case of an explosion.\n  I know there are many competing demands for Homeland Security \nfunding, but we are not investing enough time, effort, and resources \ninto air cargo security. This amendment will help address this critical \narea. I hope my colleagues will support the amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1190\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent the pending amendment be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I call up amendment numbered 1190.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1190.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To appropriate $70,000,000 to identify and track hazardous \n                          materials shipments)\n\n       On page 71, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n     For necessary expenses of the Transportation Security \n     Administration related to developing and implementing a \n     system for identifying and tracking shipments of hazardous \n     materials (as defined in section 385.402 of title 49, Code of \n     Federal Regulations) by truck using global positioning system \n     technology, $70,000,000.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this amendment is about truck security \nand how we need to be doing much more to protect our highways and \ncommunities from the threat of truck bombs and stolen hazardous \nmaterial.\n  Madrid was a wake-up call for us. And now London is a second wake-up \ncall. Obviously, there is a lot of focus on rail. I support that focus \nand had my amendment which was going to add another $300 million to the \n$100 million already requested in rail security, but I have joined \nefforts with the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Shelby, and the Senator from \nMaryland, Mr. Sarbanes, and the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, \nand others to have one mass transit amendment which will have an amount \nfar greater than the amount I was going to propose--and we will also \nhave a colloquy--so that money can go to more things.\n  The MTA, in my area, the leading mass transit agency that runs New \nYork City subways, the Long Island railroad, Metro-North, carrying \nmillions of passengers every year--billions of passengers every year, \nand millions, I guess, every week--has said they cannot spend the money \non what they need, such as explosive-detecting dogs, which is one of \nthe best types of ways to stop explosives. But that is rail security. \nAs I said, that will come for another time in debate, I believe, \ntomorrow.\n  But what Madrid also teaches us and London also teaches us is that \nterrorists look for weak pressure points. If we strengthen air, they \nmay look to rail. If we strengthen rail, they may look to trucks. If we \nstrengthen trucks, they may look to our ports. So it is extremely \nimportant we have a multifaceted war on terror at home.\n  As you know, I support a strong war on terror abroad. And we are \nfighting a strong war on terror abroad, maybe too strong in the eyes of \nsome. But we also have to have not only a good offense in the war on \nterror, we have to have a good defense. We have to look across the \nboard. It has been a great concern of mine that we are not doing enough \nin various areas. I have tried to put my efforts into the areas where \nthere is clearly a great danger compared to meager effort. Truck \nsecurity is one of those areas.\n  My amendment gives $70 million--not a large sum in this very large \nbudget--to the Transportation Security Administration to develop and \nimplement a system for identifying and tracking hazardous material \nshipments using global positioning system technology.\n  According to the 1997 Census of Interstate Commerce, 740,000 Hazmat \nshipments travel by truck each day in the United States. Approximately \n50,000 trips are made daily by gasoline tankers, and many of them hold \nas much fuel as a Boeing 757. These trips often end with a late-night \ndelivery to a deserted gas station.\n  Trucks also cross the country carrying potentially deadly chemicals, \nsuch as ammonium nitrate, chlorine, and cyanide. An attack with these \ntypes of chemicals could cause an even greater level of destruction \nbecause these chemicals can form clouds of\n\n[[Page S8176]]\n\ndeadly fumes which would affect individuals miles away from the site of \na terrorist incident.\n  My amendment simply provides TSA with the financial resources to look \ninto how we go about monitoring what has been shown to us as a \nvulnerability within our existing plan to secure our country from \nterrorist threats.\n  Have we forgotten the initial attack on the World Trade Center in \n1993 and the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in \nOklahoma City in 1995, both of which were the result of truck bombs? \nWhile the Nation has completely revamped aviation security since the \nSeptember 11 attacks--we have a longer way to go, but we have come a \nlong way--we have done next to nothing to secure our country from the \ndanger that can be caused by a truck filled with explosives, chemicals, \nor biological weapons.\n  Today, on their own, many of the larger trucking companies have GPS \nsystems on their trucks, like an ever-growing percentage of American \nautomobiles. Frankly, they have put the GPS systems on often to deal \nwith theft as much as to deal with the threat from terrorism. The \nsystems allow the companies to know where the trucks in the fleet are. \nIf the truck moves off a route, the company knows. If a truck is \nstolen, the company knows.\n  I believe it is important the TSA take a similar approach and create \na nationwide tracking system so that if a terrorist should steal or \nhijack a truck loaded with dangerous materials, we will find them \nquickly. It would be very similar to when a plane goes off track, we \nnow know that. F-16s are scrambled. We have learned that here in the \nCapitol over the last year, twice. The same thing can be done with \ntrucks, not very expensively.\n  My amendment provides TSA with tremendous flexibility and much-needed \nfunds to address truck security and have none of the mandates or the \nhigh costs to industry that the ATA alleges.\n  In addition, my amendment specifically limits the type of commercial \nvehicles and content subject to tracking to the most dangerous and \nhigh-hazard materials. It is not going to affect every truck shipment.\n  Both the TSA and DOT are currently working on improving truck-\ntracking systems and background checks for commercial driver's licenses \nwith a Hazmat endorsement. My amendment would help continue and build \non those existing efforts, which have been slow, in part, due to lack \nof funding.\n\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and help close this \nhole in our Nation's homeland security.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if I can get the attention of the Senator \nfrom New York, as I understand it, we reached an understanding on your \namendment No. 1184, as modified. Are you going to send a modification \nto the desk? We can just agree to it now.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I believe I have sent the modification to the desk.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator's \namendment No. 1184 be agreed to.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Be?\n  Mr. GREGG. Be agreed to, unless the Senator wishes to oppose it.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. No. I think I have asked that already. But if you want \nto do it twice, maybe it will increase my legislative batting average.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has been agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. It has been agreed to? OK, we missed that.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If my colleague from New Hampshire would yield, I also \nwithdrew amendment No. 1183, as per our agreement.\n  Mr. GREGG. All right. Great. So that leaves us with your amendment \nNo. 1189, dealing with air cargo, and amendment No. 1190, dealing with \nhazardous materials; is that correct?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. We are on the same page. That is good. That is a starting \npoint.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1171\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to request \nthe yeas and nays on amendment No. 1171, Senator McCain's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. It is in \norder to request the yeas and nays on that amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on amendment \nNo. 1171.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Thank you.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 1189 and 1190\n\n  Mr. President, as to the two proposals by the Senator from New York, \nI am going to make a point of order that both proposals exceed the \nbudget allocation which we received. Obviously, they are well-\nintentioned, and they are reasonably confined compared to some of the \nother proposals we have received this morning in the billions of \ndollars. These are in the hundreds of millions--in one case even under \n$100 million.\n  The fact is, in both instances, the Department does not believe it is \nnecessary to do this at this time. They believe they have proposals in \nthe pipeline which will address air cargo, and they have proposals in \nthe pipeline which will deal with hazardous material shipments. But as \nof right now, they are not ready to deal with these additional dollars \nin a way that will use them constructively. So the Department opposes \nboth of these proposals based essentially on the fact that they are \npilot programs, and their initiatives in these areas are not ripe \nenough, are not at the level of capacity yet to handle these types of \ndollars.\n  As the Senator from New York has noted, this is really a question for \nus, as a Congress, and for the Homeland Security agency, as an agency, \nto allocate resources where they can get the most return and the most \neffective use. And within the limited dollars we have--and they are \nfairly significant dollars; actually, the increase in homeland security \nis significant--the focus has been on areas where we think we can get \nconstructive results quickly with the dollars put into the accounts, \nspecifically: weapons of mass destruction, water patrol--I have \nmentioned this before a number of times--and other items like that.\n  So, Mr. President, these dollars at this time exceed the budget and, \ntherefore, I make a point of order against each of these two \namendments. And so, on each amendment, beginning with 1189, I make a \npoint of order that under section 302(f) of the Budget Act that the \namendment provides spending in excess of the subcommittee's allocation \nunder 302(f).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is making it against 1189?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, 1189.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I move to waive the Budget Act as \napplicable to 1189 and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I make a budget point of order against \namendment No. 1190 by the Senator from New York. It is the same point \nof order I just made against 1189.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I move to waive the Budget Act and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to spend a few moments talking \nabout an issue of great concern, and that is transit security. I know \nmy colleagues are working as we speak. I will be working with them--the \nSenator from New Hampshire; the Senator from West Virginia; my \ncolleague, Senator Shelby from Alabama--to raise the amount of \nresources devoted to transit security. The sticking point at the moment \nis how much we can raise these funds. I have urged a significant \nincrease because of the significant threat.\n\n[[Page S8177]]\n\n  We were all shocked last Thursday when we became aware of the news \nthat 52 innocent transit riders in London were killed and over 700 \ninjured in a series of cowardly attacks in the heart of London on their \ntransit system, both on their underground system and their aboveground \nbus system. This horrific attack was reminiscent of other attacks in \nMadrid, Moscow, Israel, and elsewhere. All these attacks are \nspecifically targeted to public transportation. We know this is a \ntarget for terrorists. We also understand that our system in the United \nStates is still vulnerable to those types of attacks.\n  Every workday, 14 million Americans take a train or a bus. To put \nthat in perspective, that is roughly 28 times the population of the \nState of Wyoming. Each and every day these 14 million Americans get on \na bus or take a metro subway to work and to other necessary obligations \nand appointments. We know, quite clearly, that these transit systems \nare the prime target of terrorists. Subways, light rail, buses, and \nferries are designed for easy access and to move large numbers of \npeople efficiently. As a result, they do not have all the panoplies \ntoday of protection that you see at airline terminals, for example.\n  The facts are clear. There have already been numerous attacks on \ntransit. We have 6,000 transit systems in the United States, with 14 \nmillion riders every workday. I do not think anyone could disagree with \nthose facts or disagree with the fact that we have to do more to harden \nand protect our transit systems.\n  Yet the Federal Government's response to these facts has been \nunderwhelming at best. In contrast to aviation, where we have invested \n$9 in security improvements per passenger, to date we have invested \nroughly $0.006 per passenger, a little over half a cent, to protect \ntransit passengers throughout the country.\n  Now, I think we have to do much better. Perhaps we can never reach \nthe level of protection for airlines because of the nature of that \nprocess--we can put screening devices in terminals; we can have \nelaborate followthrough in terms of passenger lists and identifying who \nis getting on which aircraft--but we have to do more in public transit. \nThat is a consensus, a conclusion, I hope we all reach. Again, I think \nthe debate today and tomorrow will be about how much we can do.\n  Now, I will make the case we have to do much more. I am working with \nmy colleagues. I hope we can achieve a sufficient level of investment \nin transit security that is commensurate with the threat that has \nmaterialized just a few days ago, and, unfortunately, is likely to \nmaterialize again here or across the globe.\n  Now, after September 11, when I was serving as chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Housing and Transportation, I held a hearing on the \ntopic of transit security. At that time it was clear that we needed to \ndo more than simply rely on the Federal Transit Administration, whose \nexpertise is building systems, not essentially making them secure. \nTheir efforts were commendable but very limited. They were reviewing \nsecurity procedures. They were trying to disseminate information. But \nthey were not able to because of their expertise as well as because of \nthe resources needed to go in and start making significant capital \nimprovements, supporting operational changes, doing all those things \nthat are absolutely key to protecting our security systems, our transit \nsystems.\n  After the hearing, Senator Sarbanes and I asked the General \nAccounting Office to do a study on transit security. That report was \ncompleted in 2002. They found that one-third of all terrorist attacks \nthroughout the world were directed against transit. Yet we have nowhere \ncommitted the resources commensurate with that level of activity. And \neven more telling was the GAO's conclusion that, in their words, \n``insufficient funding is the most significant obstacle agencies face \nin trying to make their systems more safe and secure.''\n  Typically, in the United States, transit systems are local systems. \nThey depend upon riders' fares, local and State subsidies, and all of \nthese sources are highly constrained in terms of coming up with the \nextra dollars to ensure protection of the system. Because of these \nconclusions from the GAO report, from our hearings, Senator Sarbanes \nand I have come to the floor on several occasions to argue for \nadditional funding. We have done this with respect to supplemental \nappropriations bills. We have done it with respect to other Department \nof Homeland Security appropriations bills. And indeed, we also tried to \nsuggest increased funding during the National Intelligence Reform Act \ndebate.\n  I have been pleased to work with many colleagues, particularly \nSenator Shelby, chairman of the Banking Committee. Last year we were \nable to pass authorizing legislation in the Senate that would have \ncreated a threat-based transit security policy, along with authorizing \n$3.5 billion to help transit systems deter, detect, and respond to \nterrorist attacks. While the Senate did its part in passing the \nlegislation, regrettably it was not passed by the House, nor was it \nsupported with the kind of energy and enthusiasm by the administration \nwhich is so critical to achieving the objective of improved transit \nsecurity. We are here again today on this legislation, in the wake of \nLondon, arguing for additional resources so that we can meet this \nthreat to our transit systems.\n  There are some who might oppose these efforts. They might say it is \ntoo much money. Frankly, when you look at what has to be done--6,000 \ntransit systems--when you look at the amount of training, the amount of \ncapital equipment--just in terms of communications, for example--that \nis a huge number. And when you measure that with the threat--a third of \nall terrorist attacks over the last several decades have been directed \nat transit, and we have seen it in Madrid, in London, in Moscow, in \nTokyo, where a Japanese fanatical group attempted to disperse a \nchemical agent in the tunnels--the threat is there; the resources are \nnot.\n  Since 1992, the Federal Government actually has invested $68 billion \nto construct transit systems, but we haven't yet been able to commit \nourselves to protecting those systems adequately. It has been estimated \nthat roughly $6 million is necessary to provide the kind of protection \nthat at least provides a minimal level of protection. These investments \nrange from fencing to high-tech explosive detection systems, to \ncommunication upgrades. All of these things could be put in place, \nenhancing significantly the security of our systems.\n  In the wake of London, in the wake of Madrid, in the wake of the \ntransit attacks in Russia, I don't think it is too much to ask to spend \n12 cents per transit passenger, as some amendments have proposed, to \nprotect them.\n  I have also heard that we should direct all of our efforts to threat-\nbased approaches--don't single out transit, don't single out aviation, \nany particular mode of transportation or infrastructure. But frankly, \nthe attractiveness--and I say this with regret--of transit to \nterrorists as a target is so compelling that this argument also does \nnot hold water.\n  I also hope that we can continue to support these efforts, \nunderstanding that the primary responsibility is local. These systems \nare local or regional. The States and the localities have an \nobligation. But the reality is--and I don't think I have to spend too \nmuch time saying this--most transit systems are already just scraping \nby in terms of keeping their ridership up, making sure fares are \naffordable, making sure that they can make improvements in their basic \nrolling stock and facilities. These additional resources for security \nproperly could be supported by the Federal Government.\n  We also authorized and created a few years ago the Department of \nHomeland Security. It is the appropriations for that Department we are \ndiscussing today. With respect to that Department, there was an \nacknowledgment that the Federal Government was stepping up to the issue \nof protecting all of our vital infrastructure, including transit, that \nwe do have an obligation. We have assumed that obligation with the \ncreation of the Department of Homeland Security and other steps to \nprotect all of our vital infrastructure. Indeed, our situation with \nrespect to transit is one that cries out for additional resources.\n  The President just ordered, in the wake of London, our transit \nsystems to go to alert level orange. The threat is\n\n[[Page S8178]]\n\nthere. I hope our efforts over today and tomorrow will not only \nrecognize this threat but match it with commensurate resources so that \nwe can begin to seriously protect our transit systems and our riders.\n  One other point, too. Our transit systems--buses, subways--are \nintegral parts of our economy. That is one reason why they are so \nattractive to terrorists. The attack in London was planned so that the \nbombs would go off right in the midst of the financial district, not \nonly with the intent to cause the loss of life, the symbolic and \npsychological horror of such a dastardly act, but also to cripple the \neconomy. If a successful attack is conducted against a transit system \nin a major city, it will not be measured just in terms of casualties \nbut also in potentially huge economic losses. Our efforts today are not \nonly sensible because of the threat, sensible because of the need to \nprotect Americans in areas where they are vulnerable, but to avoid the \nkind of economic chaos that could result from a successful attack \nagainst transit.\n  I hope in the next few hours we can come together with support for \nthese efforts. I know Senators Byrd and Gregg, Shelby and Sarbanes, and \nothers, are working toward that end so we can come up with sufficient \nresources to meet this great threat.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1075\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to offer amendment No. \n1075 to the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2006.\n  First, I acknowledge the hard work of Senators Gregg and Byrd and \nthank them for their diligence in coming to a consensus on this crucial \nlegislation. The balance between enhanced security and responsible \nstewardship of the taxpayers' dollars is a fine one. I applaud their \nattention to both, and I support the legislation.\n  In an effort to increase the sound management of homeland security \nfunds, I offer an amendment that would increase the funding of the \nEmergency Management Performance Grant Program by $10 million. I am \njoined on this amendment by Senators Collins and Lieberman, the chair \nand ranking members of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, as well as 17 other Senators. I thank them all for their \nsupport. I believe that redirecting funds to the EMPG Program, which \nhas a proven track record, is both fiscally responsible and \nstrategically sound.\n  The EMPG Program assists the emergency management agencies and \nprograms of the States, the District of Columbia, U.S. Territories, and \nlocal and tribal governments to prepare for all hazards and disasters, \nboth natural and manmade. The EMPG Program is the only source of \nFederal assistance that supports comprehensive emergency management, \ncoordination, and planning.\n  Funding for this program is split 50/50 between the Federal and State \ngovernments. This unique and important program provides States and \nlocalities with the flexibility to allocate funds according to risk, \nwhich helps address their most urgent needs in disaster mitigation, \npreparedness, response and recovery. Most importantly, EMPG funds are \nalso used to pay for personnel costs, including training and exercises. \nThis aspect of the program is important given the tight budget \nconstraints and increased counterterrorism responsibilities currently \nfaced by State and local governments. States also have the flexibility \nto develop intrastate emergency management systems that encourage the \nbuilding of partnerships which include government, business, volunteer, \nand community organizations.\n  As Governor of Ohio, I had first-hand experience with the EMPG \nProgram and would note some examples that illustrate its effectiveness.\n  Since 2002, Ohio has issued eight major disaster declarations and two \nemergency declarations. The 2005 winter storm was the most widespread \ndisaster in Ohio's history, with 59 counties declared disaster areas \nwith damage assessments that exceeded $260 million. EMPG funding has \nplayed a critical role in allowing Ohio State and local emergency \nmanagement agencies to plan for these disasters, respond in a timely \nmanner to those areas hit hardest, and pay the salaries of local \nemergency management staff.\n  Additionally, Ohio has elected to use a portion of the annual EMPG \nfunding for special projects, such as local emergency operations center \nconstruction. This is one of the few funding streams that allow for \nbrick and mortar type projects. At any given time there are several \ncounties benefiting from the use of these dollars.\n  Ohio is not the only State that has benefited from the EMPG Program. \nFor example, EMPG funds play a critical role in helping the State of \nAlabama develop its plans to respond to natural disasters, particularly \nhurricanes. EMPG grants have been used for contingency planning, \nincluding evacuation plans, debris removal plans, and plans for \npostdisaster distribution of critical aid to those affected by the \nstorms.\n  The State of Kansas is struck by nearly 50 tornadoes every spring. \nWithout local government emergency management staff paid for by EMPG \nfunding, there wouldn't be adequate coordination to help respond to \nthose tornadoes in a timely manner.\n  York County, ME, has had 12 declared disasters in 12 years, including \ncoastal flooding and severe ice storms. The York County Office of \nEmergency Management works with 29 towns on the full range of emergency \nmanagement, including preparedness, response, recovery and mitigation. \nWithout the help of EMPG funds they would have only one full-time \nperson; with EMPG support they have three.\n  Additionally, during last year's devastating hurricane season, the \nEMPG Program proved its worth. The Emergency Management Assistance \nCompact, which is funded by the EMPG, enabled 38 States to provide $15 \nmillion worth of aid and over 800 personnel to support Florida and the \nother impacted States for over 85 days.\n  These are just a few examples of how EMPG funds are used to help \nState and local governments prepare for the worst situations. They \ndemonstrate that EMPG funds are the backbone of emergency management \nand disaster response in America.\n  Many of the people who have been involved in emergency management in \nthe States have been impacted by the budget crisis we are experiencing \nin many States throughout the country. In Ohio, for example, they \nsubstantially cut back on the State funds for local and State \ngovernment. Again, they are being asked to do the ordinary work that \nthey do in emergency management and, at the same time, take on added \nresponsibilities to deal with the issue of responding to terrorists.\n  I will now address how EMPG funds have been spent relative to other \ngrant programs. The Senator from New Hampshire has noted how billions \nof dollars of Department of Homeland Security grant money remains \nunspent by State and local government. However, according to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, EMPG funds are spent rapidly compared \nto other programs. In other words, there may be a problem with some of \nthese other funds getting through to the folks who need them, but in \nthis particular case, these moneys flow very rapidly.\n  In other words, if Congress appropriates extra EMPG funding, it will \nnot go unused. Although both Congress and President Bush have \nrecognized the importance of this program, it still faces a shortfall. \nThe disaster relief fund is our Government's rainy day fund, and it is \nrobust in comparison to other programs in this bill. Therefore, my \namendment would take $10 million from this $2 billion account to \nincrease EMPG funding. Increased EMPG funding will ensure strong \nmanagement and planning prior to any disaster. In other words, when \nasked about the logic of taking $10 million out of the $2 billion \naccount for the disaster relief fund, our arguments would be, as a \nresult of this additional money, we can do a lot better job of \npreventing more of these disasters in the long run and make sure the \ndollars that are spent in the disaster relief fund are spent in the \nmost efficient and effective way.\n  Increased EMPG funding will ensure strong management and planning \nprior\n\n[[Page S8179]]\n\nto any disaster. In other words, redirecting these funds will enhance \nthe effectiveness of every disaster relief fund dollar directed toward \nresponse and recovery and ensure we get the biggest bang for the buck \nwhen it comes to Federal disaster relief funding.\n  Again, there are some other funds in the Homeland Security \nappropriations. It was our best judgment that going after the disaster \nrelief fund was the most logical way to pay and add this $10 million to \nthe EMPG program.\n  As I mentioned, this amendment is sponsored by both the chairman and \nranking member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee which has the oversight responsibility for homeland security, \nas well as 17 other Senators, including Senator Grassley, chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, which is significant.\n  In closing, we must prepare for terrorist attacks in addition to \nnatural disasters. The EMPG program is a proven method of doing this. \nIt is my strong belief that by enhancing the EMPG funding, we increase \nthe capacity of State and local emergency management agencies to get \nthe job done when the needs of our citizens are the greatest.\n  Once again I applaud the efforts of Senator Gregg and Senator Byrd, \nand I ask my colleagues to support increased funding for the EMPG \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, I was going to ask for the yeas and nays, but the fact \nis, we are negotiating now with Senator Gregg's staff and Senator Gregg \nand perhaps we can find some other language that might be more \nacceptable to them. I am not going to ask for the yeas and nays now. If \nwe are unable to reach a compromise, then I will ask for the yeas and \nnays at a later date.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will withhold, does the Senator \nwish to request that the pending amendments be set aside so his \namendment can be called up?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will speak to the underlying bill for a \nmoment. I find it interesting in debating this Homeland Security \nappropriations bill, there have been many colleagues come to the floor \nexpressing the intention to amend the bill to add more resources here \nor there or someplace else. I think it is instructive that the chairman \nof this subcommittee has this year determined it is beyond the time \nthat we need to begin fully funding some of the particular accounts \nthat enable us to better control our border and that my colleagues are \nnow coming, I suggest in the case of some later than I would like, but \nat least to the realization that we have not begun to put the resources \nto controlling our border and some of our other homeland areas of need \nthat we should have.\n  This is a good development in the sense that we are finally beginning \nto realize we have not done what we should do. But I am troubled a \nlittle bit that there still is not adequate funding available to do \neverything we need to do on the border that I am concerned about, and \nthat is our southwest border.\n  Compliments to the subcommittee and to the Appropriations Committee \nfor substantially increasing the funding for more Border Patrol agents, \nfor more detention space for people whom we have to detain who should \nnot be in the United States and who cannot be returned to their country \nof origin immediately, for the technology which is funded here, and for \nall the other things we are trying to do to secure our border. \nCongratulations to Chairman Gregg and to the other members of the \ncommittee for doing this. For my colleagues who would like to add more, \nI appreciate their efforts as well because we all know that whatever we \nare able to do this year, it is still not going to be enough to \nactually gain control of our border.\n  One of the problems that has arisen is the problem of what the border \ncontrol calls ``other than Mexican'' illegal immigrants. As we all \nknow, most of the people coming across our southwestern border are from \nthe country of Mexico, but a lot of them are simply transiting through \nMexico. This population is of increasing concern to us. In fact, we \nwere recently informed that already this fiscal year over 119,000 \nthird-country nationals, that is third country other than Mexico, have \nbeen apprehended crossing our borders. We know there is a rough rule of \nthumb that three or four are not apprehended for every one that is \napprehended, so you get a situation here where it is pretty clear that \nwe have a huge influx of people coming into the United States from \ncountries other than Mexico.\n  What does this mean? We know most of the people coming in from Mexico \nare coming for work. Perhaps some have criminal backgrounds or other \nnefarious purposes, but at least we don't suspect most of them are \ncoming here for purposes of harming us. In the case of these ``other \nthan Mexican'' nationals, the same thing cannot be said because between \n20 or 30 of these countries are countries of special interest to the \nUnited States; in other words, countries from which terrorists have \ncome. The question is both on the southern and on the northern border, \nwhich is equally a problem here, how many of the folks coming into this \ncountry from countries other than Mexico mean us harm?\n\n[[Page S8180]]\n\n  We all know, for example, that in the days of testimony from former \nDHS Deputy Secretary Loy, advising the Senate Intelligence Committee, \nthat:\n\n       [r]ecent information from ongoing investigations, \n     detentions and emerging threat streams strongly suggest that \n     al-Qaida has considered using the southwest border to \n     infiltrate the United States. . . . Several al-Qaida leaders \n     believe operatives can pay their way into the country through \n     Mexico, and also believe illegal entry is more advantageous \n     than legal entries for operational security reasons.\n\n  Secretary of State Rice commented later that:\n\n       We have from time to time had reports about al-Qaida trying \n     to use our southern border. . . . [it] is no secret that al-\n     Qaida will try to get into this country . . . by any means \n     they possibly can. . . . [t]hat's how they managed to do it \n     before and they will do everything they can to cross the \n     borders.\n\n  There is at least one specific case of a terrorist having been \napprehended coming into the United States.\n  There is more we can discuss here, much of it involving intelligence, \nbut on both the northern and southern border there is a threat that \npeople could come into this country and we would not be able to stop \nthem. We wouldn't even know they are here. And clearly because of that \nmeans of entry as opposed to coming, say, from an airplane from London \nor another city, you could at least be carrying contraband here that \ncould be detrimental to us in the form of a chemical or biological \nagent. It is even conceivable you could bring nuclear material in as \nwell.\n  So the security of our borders is critical to homeland security, yet \nup to this year we have not had the kind of appropriations necessary to \nbegin making a dent in the problem. I am, again, exceedingly grateful \nto the chairman this year for seeing to it we are able to get that \nfunding to begin this effort.\n\n  One of the concerns about these ``other than Mexican'' detainees I \nmentioned is that, unlike the case in Mexico where we can simply send \npeople back to the border to be returned, to be repatriated to their \ncountry, it is not that easy in the case of people from other \ncountries. Obviously Mexico will not take them because they are not \nMexicans, even though they transited through Mexico. So you have to \nbegin a long, drawn-out process of contacting the country of origin and \ntrying to get the paperwork in order to see if you can get the country \nto take the individual back, to begin that repatriation process. Some \ncountries will not even take their people back. Other countries take a \nlong time. What do we do in the meantime?\n  Obviously we need to detain those people. So we detain them--right? \nWrong. There is not adequate detention space. So we give them a piece \nof paper and say, Come back in 90 days or 30 days, whatever the time \nperiod is, and report in so we can remove you from the United States.\n  Guess how many of them voluntarily return for removal to their \ncountry of origin? The percentages differ, but you get my drift. A very \nhigh percentage choose to simply meld into American society and become \npart of our illegal population here.\n  That cannot continue. We have called repeatedly on the Department of \nHomeland Security to come up with a plan to ensure that we can detain \nthese individuals until their time for removal. It has yet to come to \nus.\n  One very worthwhile program is called ``expedited removal.'' The \nchief of the Border Patrol, David Aguilar, testified before my \nTerrorism Subcommittee recently that it is their intention and hope to \nbegin to expand this expedited removal program to all of the Border \nPatrol sectors on the southern and southwestern border. There are 20-\nsome sectors, but only two have expedited removal today, the Laredo, TX \nand Tucson, AZ sectors. Here is why that is important. In most cases \nthe average time to remove one of these detainees from another country \nis at least 3 months. It is about 90-some days. In the case of \nexpedited removal we can actually accomplish this within less than 30 \ndays, so at least you lessen the time for detention. You cut that in \nthird, by one-third, and therefore if you have to put somebody in a \ndetention space that is federally owned, you don't have to kick \nsomebody else out in order to detain this person. If you have to rent \nthe space from somebody else, it is going to cost you about one-third \nas much. It costs about $90 a day to house one of these detainees, and \nyou can do that in State and local detention facilities.\n  The bottom line is we don't have enough of that detention space, so \neven today people are not being detained. They are being released on \ntheir own recognizance, told to come back when the paperwork has been \ndeveloped with their country of origin so they can be returned.\n  That is wrong. We have to get the money to detain these folks and \nmake sure we have a policy to do so at the same time we are trying to \nexpand the expedited removal. There is money in this bill for that \ndetention.\n  Again, I thank Senator Gregg for his alertness to this problem and \nwillingness to put money in against the problem. But I fear the \nDepartment of Homeland Security has still not got a plan in place to \nboth pursue the expedited removal for all sectors and, in the meantime, \ndetain those who need to be detained.\n  If we should have a situation arise, as arose in England recently, in \nGreat Britain, where people have come into the country--in this case \nthey appear to be indigenous to the country itself--but where they have \ndecided to engage in some act of terrorism, and it has been our own \nfault that we have allowed them to meld into our society illegally, \nthen obviously we have no one to blame but ourselves.\n  I am calling this to the attention of my colleagues in the hope we \ncan continue to both provide the funding the administration needs and \nto encourage the administration to get onto the solution of this \nparticular problem as well.\n  The problem here is multipronged. I think all of us have understood \nthat with the event in Great Britain a week ago, it illustrates to us \nthe kind of harm that can be caused by a conventional kind of attack of \nterrorists. It doesn't take a major 9/11 kind of attack to create this \nkind of chaos. Yet it calls into question what we could do to provide \ntotal security within our homeland, because a train station, a bus \nstation, other places of public congregation--be they shopping areas, \nsports events or the like--all suggest it is a virtual impossibility \nbefore the fact to provide 100-percent security. It simply cannot be \ndone. That is why you have to try to prevent the problem from arising \nin the first place.\n  I will close by noting that part of our effort, in this appropriation \nbill, in order to control the border itself, is to provide a thousand \nnew Border Patrol agents at the border, also 300 new Immigration and \nCustoms investigators, the new enforcement agents. This bill provides \n460 of those. Incidentally, all of these are in addition to numbers \nprovided in the supplemental appropriations bill. So we have added to \nthe number that we already acted on at the end of last year.\n  We fund over 40,000 positions dedicated to protecting our borders and \nenforcing immigration laws. To break it down, over 12,000 Border Patrol \nagents, 18,000 Customs and border protection officers, nearly 6,000 \ncriminal investigators, nearly 1,300 deportation officers, 2,700 \nimmigration enforcement agents and detention officers. We also have \nmoney for more training of Border Patrol and immigration enforcement \npersonnel.\n  We have money to support the deployment of the US VISIT Program, \nwhich will help us better track the people who both come into our \ncountry and leave the country. We have over a half billion dollars for \nair and marine operations, as I mentioned before, money for over 2,000 \nnew detention beds for these apprehended illegal aliens, and with the \nsupplemental, that adds about 4,000 new detention spaces for this \npurpose.\n  We more than double the number of ports that have our container \nsecurity initiative, 41 that take part in that, and nearly $1 billion \nfor biological countermeasures. These things, by and large, are in \nplace to try to prevent the capability of the terrorists from pulling \noff an attack in the first place. They are not responding to an attack \nafter it has occurred. We have to have responses, but our primary goal \nhere should be to take the fight to the enemy, to try to provide the \nprotection going in, because there is no way, once they are in the \nUnited States, to protect every bit of this wide-open and liberty-\nloving society. So it is better to\n\n[[Page S8181]]\n\ntry to stop them before they get here, and it is better to try to \ndegrade their ability to attack us by taking the fight to them.\n  That is why later on we are going to get into things such as \nreauthorizing the PATRIOT Act, on which we just heard testimony, as a \ncritical component in our war on terror and protecting our homeland and \nother ways in which we can take the fight to the enemy. For now, this \nappropriations bill provides us a significant capability to stop the \nterrorists at our border as well as providing some internal protection \nin those areas that have the highest priority and for which we can get \nthe biggest bang for the buck in terms of protection.\n  Again, I compliment the members of the Appropriations Committee, \nparticularly the chairman of the Subcommittee on Homeland Security, for \ntheir attentiveness to this issue, their willingness to make a \nsignificant effort to help fight this battle.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation when we get to that \npoint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after I be \nrecognized to speak for 10, no more than 15 minutes, Senator Clinton of \nNew York be recognized to speak at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I just returned from a week back in my State of \nIllinois traveling from Chicago through downstate southern Illinois \nmeeting with many people at Fourth of July parades, the usual standard \nprocedure in scheduling for many Members of the Senate and Congress. \nMany people came to say hello, but there were a couple who stand out in \nmy memory of that week. One was a man in southern Illinois who pulled \nme aside and in very quiet tones said, ``Bring our troops home.'' And \nanother, a man standing at O'Hare Airport, as I walked by, recognized \nme and said, ``Support our troops.''\n  I think in those two brief sentences we really have a lot of the \npublic sentiment of America. Support our troops. That is clear. These \nare our sons and daughters. If you have been there, as I was this last \nMarch, and seen them, in Iraq, in Baghdad, risk their lives, see those \nfresh-faced young people who are standing there so proudly on behalf of \nour country, you can't help but support these men and women. You must. \nAnd we have. We should continue to do so.\n  But there is a growing sentiment as well that they should come home. \nSome say bring them home right now. I am not one of those people. I do \nnot believe we can just end our commitment today and leave Iraq. I am \nafraid what would be left behind would be chaos, a training ground for \nterrorism that would threaten not only the Middle East but the entire \nworld. But yet I do believe all of us feel, even the President, that we \nshould be looking to the day when our troops do come home and how we \nwill reach that day because every single day we wait in anticipation of \nthose troops coming home we are losing soldiers.\n  This morning's Washington Post, as it does every day, published the \nnumber of American soldiers killed in Iraq to this moment: 1,755--\n1,755--and more than 13,000 grievously wounded. Many of them I have met \nand seen. Some of the Illinois families, I have been to their funerals, \nmet their families, dropped notes to and spoken to them. It breaks your \nheart to think that they have lost someone they love so much.\n  How do we reach this point where we can bring these troops home and \nfeel that we have achieved what we set out to do? Well, we came up with \na way to try to measure this and set us on a course for it to happen. \nWhen Congress passed the supplemental appropriations bill, we \nauthorized $35 billion directly associated with U.S. operations in Iraq \nand $5.7 billion on top of that to train and equip Iraqi security \nforces. That is the way we bring American soldiers home, by training \nand equipping Iraqis to take their place.\n  That same bill required the Secretary of Defense to provide a \ndetailed report on how the training was progressing and what U.S. troop \nlevels would likely be by the end of the year. The report that was \nmandated by that supplemental appropriations bill was due in 60 days \nafter it was enacted. The due date was July 11. Today is July 13, and \nwe still have not received the report required by law. Some media \nreports the Pentagon is still working on it. Others say the report is \non Secretary Rumsfeld's desk. When we call the Pentagon, the answers \nare conflicting.\n  Congress has approved over $200 billion for the war in Iraq. Although \nI have had serious misgivings about the initial invasion of Iraq as to \nwhether we had a plan for success, not just for deposing Saddam Hussein \nbut for building a peace, while I was concerned that we did not have \nallies to stand with our troops soldier by soldier--only the British \ncame forward with any substantial numbers--and while I was concerned \nabout the American burden of this war not only in human life but in \ntreasure, I have decided, and I think most of my colleagues agree, we \nwill not shortchange our troops in the field.\n  The last time we had a supplemental appropriations bill, $82 billion \nfor our troops passed unanimously in the Senate. Many of us who had \nvoted against the war voted for that money. If it were my son or \ndaughter, I would want them to receive every single penny they needed \nto perform their mission, to perform as they have, and come home \nsafely.\n  Despite having voted for this money, I stand here today with my \ncolleagues in the Senate uncertain as to our progress because this \nreport from the Pentagon which we had asked for, one which attempts to \nmeasure how we are progressing, how the Iraqis are progressing, has \nstill not been delivered, and it is a concern to me because I think \nthis report really goes to the heart of what we are trying to achieve. \nWe are trying to finally learn where we stand in Iraq, how soon our \ntroops are likely to come home. There have been a lot of claims--\n150,000 Iraqi soldiers ready to come into battle--and yet when it comes \nto the real battles it is American soldiers--American soldiers--risking \ntheir lives. That is why we have asked for the Pentagon to tell us what \nprogress is being made.\n\n  The conference report to the supplemental stated that a new \nassessment is necessary because the Pentagon's existing performance \nindicators and measures of stability and security in Iraq are not \nadequate. We have heard about these claims, how many Iraqi soldiers and \npolicemen are ready. Police have been recruited by the tens of \nthousands, according to reports from the Pentagon, but many are just \nmissing in action.\n  The report that we require under law asks for a detailed assessment \nof Iraqi military, political and economic progress. Iraqi battalions \nmust be able to operate on their own against the insurgency, and Iraqi \nforces must be able to secure their own borders.\n  The draft of the new constitution in Iraq is due next month. The \nIraqis have made some progress toward creating a new political system \nof government, and they had an absolutely historical election with \nturnout evidencing a thirst for new leadership in their country, but \nIraqi unemployment may be as high as 50 percent, and some of the most \nfundamental things of civilized life are not there, whether it is \nelectricity, sewage treatment, water, security in your home.\n  The report we asked for demands an assessment on how far we \nprogressed toward our goals. The fact that this report has not been \nfiled is a source of real concern. Progress in Iraq is critical to \nbringing America's soldiers home with a victory. This report asks our \nPentagon what U.S. force levels will be needed by the end of next year. \nWe say that if there is any part of it that needs to be classified, do \nso. Don't disclose anything that could jeopardize the security and \nsafety of our troops.\n  An amendment has been offered by Senator Reid of Nevada and Senator \nKennedy and myself, an amendment to the Homeland Security bill before \nus, asking that this report be provided to Congress on a timely basis. \nIt is long overdue. This is an administration which has measured many \nthings in terms of performance and quality. So many different agencies \nof our Government were held to the standard of what are you producing \nfor the money that is being provided. What we are asking is the same \ntype of accountability and the same type of metric when it comes to our \nprogress in Iraq.\n  I would agree with many who say setting a timetable for withdrawal \nmay be\n\n[[Page S8182]]\n\ncounterproductive, but it is not unreasonable to hold the Iraqis to a \ntimetable, a timetable to develop their government and their security \nforce and their defense so that American soldiers can come home. I \nthink that is reasonable. It was passed overwhelmingly on a bipartisan \nbasis by Members of Congress.\n  The fact that there has been such a delay in providing this \ninformation is troubling, but I am hoping that even as I speak here \ntoday, the Secretary of Defense is preparing this report and sending it \nso we can learn as quickly as possible how soon our soldiers can come \nhome to their families and those of us who love them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask that Senators Lautenberg, Corzine, \nand Schumer be added as cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, this is a commonsense amendment \nregarding the potential threat that all of our cities and States face \nfrom the theft or misuse of general aviation aircraft by criminals or \nterrorists.\n  This amendment would require the Secretary of Homeland Security, in \ncoordination with the Secretary of Transportation, to assess the \ndangers posed to high-risk, large population, and critical \ninfrastructure areas should general aviation aircraft be stolen and \nused as a weapon by a criminal or terrorist.\n\n[[Page S8183]]\n\n  This study would require the two Secretaries to assess the \nvulnerability of general aviation airports and aircraft and study what \nlow-cost, high-technology devices could be available to better track \ngeneral aviation aircraft.\n  Last month, a 20-year-old young man, while intoxicated and \naccompanied by two other individuals, breached a perimeter fence of an \nairport in Danbury, CT. He and his companions stole a small Cessna 172 \naircraft, departed from the airport without detection, flew across the \neastern border of New York, and eventually, thankfully, landed without \nincident at the Westchester County Airport in New York very near to my \nhome.\n  What is alarming about this is that this happened, and it happened \nwithout detection. So far as we know, no one knew the aircraft had been \nstolen or that the joyride was taking place. This incident occurred \nvery close to New York City, very close to Indian Point, the nuclear \nfacility in the county. Thankfully, this particular incident ended \nwithout any damage, destruction, or death, and the individuals were \neventually detained by law enforcement.\n  Following the incident, which, as you might imagine, happening so \nclose to New York City involving stolen aircraft raised a great deal of \nconcern among my constituents, I wrote to Secretary Chertoff and \nSecretary Mineta asking for an investigation into this incident, and I \nhope to hear back from them both soon. But this incident should be a \nforewarning of the types of threats we still face from aircraft. We \nhave been very focused on the big commercial aircraft that many of us \nuse on a regular basis, but we cannot forget that most aircraft are in \nprivate hands in local airports, many of them privately owned or \nprivately leased, and that they still pose a potential danger to key \ninfrastructure, to populated areas, and we need to be more aware of \nwhat that threat could be.\n  The 9/11 Commission, which looked at this, concluded:\n\n       Major vulnerabilities still exist in cargo and general \n     aviation security. These, together with inadequate screening \n     and access controls, continue to present aviation security \n     challenges.\n\n  In addition, the 9/11 Commission told us that we needed to be \nimaginative, we needed to think outside the box. Unfortunately, we \nneeded to think like those who wish us harm about what the new and \nemerging threats could be.\n  The Transportation Security Administration, known as TSA, issued \nsecurity guidelines for general aviation airports in May of 2004, and \nthey outlined some guidelines that general aviation airports should \nfollow in order to secure the aircraft and the airfield. There are more \nthan 19,000 landing facilities nationwide, including heliports, lakes, \nand dirt landing strips from which aircraft could be launched and more \nthan 200,000 general aviation aircraft in our country.\n\n  Of course, it is impossible to avoid every threat that is posed to \nthe public or that we can imagine, but we should be vigilant to make \nsure we have a partnership so that local communities, private \nindividuals, and private businesses can all take necessary steps to be \nvigilant and protective.\n  My amendment requires the Secretary of Homeland Security, in \ncoordination with the Secretary of Transportation, to conduct a threat \nassessment posed by security breaches at general aviation airports and \nto look at the potential impact such threats could pose to a number of \npotential targets if an aircraft were used as weapon or were loaded \nwith explosives by terrorists.\n  The Department of Homeland Security would assess low-cost \ntechnologies to track general aviation aircraft, the feasibility of \nimplementing additional security measures and background checks, an \nanalysis of airports with unmanned air traffic control towers and what \ncosts may be associated with implementing necessary additional security \nmeasures.\n  We have been very blessed that we have not suffered another terrorist \nattack. That is due to the hard work and vigilance of countless \nAmericans who have responded not just heroically but in a very \nsteadfast, daily way to prevent, detect, deter, and defend against \npotential threats.\n  In this building, we have experienced evacuations which, thankfully, \nwere caused by either false alarms or as a result of errors by pilots. \nRecently, another general aviation aircraft breached the airspace over \nCamp David while the President of the United States was present.\n  It is important to evaluate the threats that could be posed. In its \n2004 report, the TSA stated that as many vulnerabilities within other \nareas of aviation have been reduced, general aviation may be perceived \nas a more attractive target and consequently more vulnerable to misuses \nby terrorists.\n  I have flown in just about every little kind of plane you can \nimagine--medium-sized plane, big plane, crop dusters. I have had doors \nblow off, windows blow off, I have had emergency landings in pastures \nand cow fields and roads. I have been in so many airports at all hours \nof the day and night when no one was around except those getting into \nthe airport or those just landing. I have a good idea how available \nthese airfields are.\n  I appreciate the work the Aviation Security Advisory Committee \nWorking Group did in advising the TSA. However, given the heightened \nvulnerability that we all are aware of, given some of the recent \nevents--including the evacuations of our own Capitol involving general \naviation aircraft--we need to roll up our sleeves and take another hard \nlook at this. I hope we can do it hand in hand with the general \naviation fixed-base operators, pilots, owners, airport managers, and \nothers who have been working hard to increase security measures at so \nmany of these small airports.\n  I believe in general aviation. I take advantage of it practically \nevery week. It is a significant and important contributor to our \nnational economy. I want to be sure we do everything possible to make \nsure it is not in any way affected by any potential criminal or \nterrorist activity.\n  This amendment does not mandate any new costs for general aviation. \nIt simply requires the study be conducted on vulnerabilities and a \nreport made to Congress within 120 days. Most people who own these \nairports, most people who own these general aviation aircraft, want to \nbe safe. They want to do what is necessary to protect their investment. \nBut we need to have a good analysis of what the threats might be so we \ncan be smart about how we address them. We certainly do not want to \nwait until an incident happens.\n  I appreciate Chairman Gregg and Senator Byrd who have agreed to \naccept this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent amendment 1106 be agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1106) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I call up amendment numbered 1124 for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Does the Senator wish to call for regular order with respect to that \namendment?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Yes. I send a modification to the desk to that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1124), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 77, line 20, insert ``of which $367,552,000 may be \n     transferred to Customs and Border Protection for hiring an \n     additional 1,000 border agents and for other necessary \n     support activities for such agency; and'' after ``local \n     grants,''.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President; last year when the Senate was considering \nthe national intelligence reform bill, we adopted several \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission.\n  One of those recommendations was to hire an additional 2,000 new \ncustom and border protection agents each year for the next 5 years.\n  This body agreed with the recommendation. We agreed that our national \nsecurity depended on such an investment, and we enacted that \nrecommendation into law.\n  We are now considering the Homeland Security appropriations bill. The \nbill that was reported out of committee includes funding for 1,000 new \nagents in the coming fiscal year. I understand there are problems with \ntraining 2,000 agents.\n  My amendment as modified would provide the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity with the discretion to shift $367 million to hire 2,000 new \nagents next year. This amendment is fully offset. I rise today to urge \nthe Senate to adopt my amendment so that we can keep the commitment \nthat we made to the American people last year. I thank John McCain for \ncosponsoring our amendment.\n  The threat of illegal border crossing by people who wish to kill us \nis very real.\n  The 9/11 Commission found that many of the 19 hijackers that attacked \non 9/11 could have been placed on watch lists. But without adequate \nstaff and coordinated efforts, the terrorists were allowed to enter the \nUnited States. Once here they learned how to fly airplanes at American \nflight schools. They conducted surveillance to assess our weaknesses. \nAnd they attacked.\n  In order to prevent another terrorist attack on American soil, we \nmust improve every aspect of our Nation's security. Our security is \ntruly only as strong as our weakest link.\n  For too long, the lack of funding for border agents has been a weak \nlink. By funding additional agents, we protect both our southern and \nour, often neglected, northern border. This will make it harder for \nterrorists to enter the United States and attack us.\n  There have been several news reports recently that I want to bring to \nmy colleagues' attention.\n  A few months ago, intelligence officials confirmed that the terrorist \nZarqawi plans to infiltrate America through our borders. He plans to \nattack targets such as movie theaters, restaurants, and schools. My \namendment commits the resources to make sure that this does not happen.\n  Just last month, in Detroit, a Lebanese national named Mahmoud \nYoussef Kourani, who was in the United States illegally, pled guilty in \nFederal court to conspiring to raise money for a recognized terrorist \ngroup. He was in the United States raising money to fund terrorists. \nThat is outrageous. But what is equally outrageous is how he came into \nthe United States in the first place.\n  Kourani took advantage of our porous border. Kourani paid a Mexican \nconsular official in Beirut $3,000 for a visa to enter Mexico. Once in \nMexico, he snuck across the U.S.-Mexican border in 2001 and settled in \nMichigan.\n  According to Federal prosecutors, Kourani and another member of his \nfamily are heavily involved with the same group that killed 214 marines \nin Beirut in 1983 and which is also responsible for bombing two U.S. \nembassies.\n  While in the United States, Kourani also helped harbor other illegal \nimmigrants. Thankfully, he was prosecuted before he could inflict any \ndirect harm on any American.\n  Given how easy it is for people like Kourani to enter the United \nStates, I believe that my amendment is imperative to our national \nsecurity.\n  My amendment does not require any additional spending. It gives the \nSecretary discretion which, if used, is completely offset. This \namendment is paid for.\n  Homeland security spending must be based on priorities. The fact that \nterrorists would use our borders to gain access to the United States to \nattack is a real threat. So we must provide funds for customs and \nborder protection.\n  Three and a half years ago it only took 19 people to change the \ncourse of this country. We must do everything that we can to prevent \nanother terrorist attack on American soil.\n  The world has changed dramatically since 9/11 when the terrorists \nused our open and trusting society against us. We cannot allow a repeat \nof that tragedy.\n  This amendment will help those who guard our frontiers by providing \nthe necessary, and I stress necessary, tools to ensure the safety of \nour citizens.\n  In conclusion, I commend the chairman of the subcommittee, Chairman \nGregg, for the job he has done prioritizing what we are doing in the \narea of Homeland Security. His is a very difficult job. We have limited \nresources. It is a question of where are we going to manage our risk \nwith the limited resources we have in this global war on terrorism. \nChairman Gregg has a huge, huge task ahead not only this year but in \nthe years to come.\n  This year's bill is going a long way to reprioritizing what we need \nto do to defend ourselves against the terrorists. Although the bill \ngoes in the right direction, our amendment takes the bill that much \nfurther toward protecting our national security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the commitment of Senator Ensign and Senator \nMcCain on the issue of border security. They have been aggressive in \ntheir commitment and have done a lot of constructive work. I will leave \nit to the Senate to decide how to handle this amendment.\n  I make these points for the purpose of fair disclosure. First off, \nthe amendment takes about $360 million out of the first responder \nprogram and moves it over to the Border Patrol for the purpose of \nhiring 1,000 new border agents. That means first responder money would \ngo from $1.9 billion to $1.4 billion.\n  In addition, the money that will be moved would be money that would \ngo out under threat. In other words, there are two pools of first \nresponder money. There is the money that is distributed on the basis of \nthreat, and there is the money that is distributed on the basis of \nformula.\n  Now, the language of the amendment says ``may.'' I respect the \ndecision of the authors of this amendment to use the term ``may'' \nbecause that will leave it up to the Homeland Security agency to make \nthe decision as to where the money should go, whether it should stay in \nthe area of first responders or whether it should be moved over to the \nBorder Patrol. That is probably good policy in many ways.\n  The second thing I think that needs to be noted, however, is the \nreason we arrived at the number 1,000 that we funded--myself and \nSenator Byrd--in this bill for new Border Patrol is because when you \ncombine that number with the supplemental, where there were 500 new \nBorder Patrol agents added, you are up to 1,500 Border Patrol agents, \nand we know, through efforts of our staff and requests of the \nDepartment, that because of the facilities' restrictions--we moved most \nof the training from South Carolina over to\n\n[[Page S8185]]\n\nNew Mexico--we can only train probably about 1,300 agents a year right \nnow.\n  Now, this bill has money in it to get those facilities up to a \nposition where they can do a much more robust effort in the area of \ntraining. In fact, my hope is next year we can train upwards of 2,500 \nwhen we expand these facilities. But right now they have, basically, \nlimits on the number of people they can train. So it is not clear these \nadditional Border Patrol agents would be able to be trained should we \nwant to bring them on line. We do want to bring them on line; it is \njust a question when we can bring them on line. So that is a concern I \nthink Members should know about.\n  In addition, the physical effort of hiring Border Patrol agents has \nbecome a problem for the Border Patrol. One of the reasons they were \nnot able to hire up to the 2,000, which was originally requested a few \nyears ago, was because they could not find qualified people to meet the \nenlistment rolls. We are not sure whether they are going to be able to \nfind 1,500 new Border Patrol people. We hope they will. It will put a \nlot of pressure on them to try to find 2,500 new people, which is what \nthis number will be if this amendment is adopted.\n  But, again, this is an issue of policy. I think the body has the \nright to make a decision on this issue. I do not intend to make any \npoints of order against it. I will leave it to the majority of the body \nto decide where they want to have this money spent and how they want to \nset the policy on this issue when the amendment comes up for a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1218\n\n  Mr. President, the amendment that the minority leader offered on my \nbehalf would provide an additional $1.33 billion above the underlying \nbill for security funding needed for our transit systems, intracity \nbuses, intercity rail, and freight rail.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the London bombings. \nFor all of us, the pictures were all too graphic reminders of how \nquickly disaster can strike and how deadly terrorist strikes can be.\n  The horrific attacks in London a few days ago were eerily similar to \nthe attacks in Madrid, Spain, in March 2004: targeted, coordinated, and \ntimed bombings.\n  Sadly, crowded subway systems and trains have become inviting targets \nfor terrorists. We have witnessed the hysteria and the chaos that these \nevents can trigger. Could it happen here? Of course. Are our systems \nmore secure? I wonder.\n  Last week, when asked if additional funding was needed to secure mass \ntransit, Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff responded by saying:\n\n       I wouldn't make a policy decision driven by a single event.\n\n  Well, with all due respect to the Secretary, the alarm bells have \nbeen ringing for years.\n  On July 8, the Washington Post printed a chart that provides a \nchronology of bombings with al-Qaida links.

Four trains.....  Bombs in sachels      191\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Washington Post database.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. The alarms do not stop there, Mr. President. According to \nthe RAND Corporation, between 1998 and 2003, there were 181 terrorist \nattacks on rail targets worldwide. The Congressional Research Service \nhas reported that passenger rail systems in the United States carry \nabout five times--five times--as many passengers each day as do the \nairlines. Yet the administration has continuously opposed funding to \nincrease security on our trains, subways, and buses.\n  Public transportation is used nearly 32 million times a day--think of \nthat: 32 million times a day--which is 16 times more than travel on \ndomestic airlines. According to the Government Accountability Office, \nnearly 6,000 agencies provide transit services by bus, subway, ferry, \nand light rail to about 14 million Americans each weekday. Amtrak \ncarried an all-time record ridership of 25 million passengers in fiscal \nyear 2004. Are these lives not worth protecting? How about it?\n  What about the dangerous and hazardous materials that are transported \nby rail? We simply are not doing enough. Without proper security \nmeasures in place, these transports are vulnerable to attack or \nsabotage. Many of these shipments travel to or through major urban \nareas, such as Washington, DC, and, frankly, only minutes down the road \nfrom where we stand today.\n  The Homeland Security Council released a report in July 2004 \nindicating that a chlorine tanker explosion in an urban area could kill \nup to 17,500 people. According to a New York Times editorial on June \n20, 2005:\n\n       One of the deadliest terrorist scenarios the Department of \n     Homeland Security has come up with is an attack on a 90-ton \n     rail tanker filled with chlorine. As many as 100,000 people \n     could be killed or injured in less than 30 minutes.\n\n  Yet only 2 out of every 100 transportation security dollars in this \nbill will be spent on rail and transit. What does this mean? This means \nthat 98 percent of transportation security funding is going--for \nwhat?--going for aviation security.\n  Since 9/11, I have offered amendments on seven different occasions--\nseven different occasions--to add money for transit and rail security. \nHowever, every time the administration opposed my efforts. So I regret \nthe Secretary's comments last week that policy should not be driven by \na single event.\n  I was astonished to learn that the $150 million that Congress \napproved for mass transit and rail security last October is still \nsitting--where?--sitting in the Treasury.\n  Finally, on Tuesday, the Department notified Congress how they intend \nto allocate the funds. But an announcement does not make Americans \nsafer. It takes time for transit and rail systems to actually put these \nsecurity improvements in place, so there is no excuse for these \nbureaucratic delays in Washington.\n  Within very limited allocations, Congress has taken the lead by \nproviding $265 million between fiscal years 2003\n\n[[Page S8186]]\n\nand 2005 for transit security. Unfortunately, the administration has \nlet the money sit in Washington far too long. It was all of 8 months \nbefore all of the 2003 funding was awarded, and 6 months before the \n2004 funding went out the door. And here we are again, 9 months after \nthe fiscal year 2005 transit funding was enacted, and what happens? \nWell, it is deja vu all over again. It is still sitting--where?--in \nWashington, right here in Washington. The administration must overcome \nthe hurdles that have caused those delays.\n  Clearly, the administration is not taking this threat seriously. It \ncertainly would not appear to be. So we must press the administration \nto do more. The horrific events we witnessed just a few days ago ought \nto serve as a call to action by this Government to protect our citizens \nfrom future attack. For far too long, the administration has put its \nhead in the sand where rail and mass transit security are concerned.\n  We should be taking steps right now to improve deterrence in our \ntransit and rail systems by investing in surveillance cameras, \ninvesting in locks, in gates, in canine teams, in sensors, and other \ntools.\n  Last October, the Senate passed two bipartisan rail security \nauthorization bills, S. 2273 and S. 2884, that authorized additional \nfunding for securing mass transit and rail systems, but the bills did \nnot make it to the White House.\n  The bill that is before the Senate reduces funding from $150 million \nin fiscal year 2005 to $100 million. The amendment would increase the \n$100 million to $1.43 billion. That is the amendment that I offer. Let \nme say it again. The amendment would increase the $100 million to $1.43 \nbillion. The $1.43 billion includes $1.166 billion for transit security \nand $265 million for rail security. So we are taking care of both \ntransit security and rail security. That seems to meet both needs, at \nleast part way.\n  Our security efforts cannot be delayed, Mr. President, and must not \nbe underfunded. The lives of the American people depend on strengthened \nsecurity. And whose life is it? It may be your own. It may be your \nrelative's. It may be your friend's. The time for hand wringing is \nover. It is time to act.\n  So I urge all Senators to support the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that the following Senators \nhave their names added as cosponsors to the amendment: Mr. Inouye, Mr. \nSarbanes, Mr. Reed of Rhode Island, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \nKennedy, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Lautenberg, \nMr. Dayton, and Mr. Corzine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the fiscal year 2006 \nHomeland Security appropriations bill. The first fundamental \nresponsibility for our Federal Government is to protect the American \npeople through a strong national defense and effective homeland \nsecurity. Border security and immigration reform are essential elements \nof providing for a secure homeland. With that, I am here this afternoon \nto commend the chairman of the Appropriations Homeland Security \nSubcommittee, Senator Gregg, and the ranking member, Senator Byrd, for \ntheir aggressive and decisive steps forward that are being demonstrated \nin this legislation.\n  This bill continues to improve that which made our Nation and our \npeople much safer than we were before and immediately after 9/11. I am \nproud to serve with the chairman and the ranking member and our \ncolleagues on this subcommittee. We need to do more to improve our \nborder security and immigration enforcement, however. It is important \nfor Americans to understand that this Congress is making significant \nprogress in this area.\n  Earlier this year, as a result of a Byrd-Craig amendment to the \nfiscal year 2005 emergency supplemental appropriations bill, we began \nthe process of adding 500 new Border Patrol agents, 1,950 additional \ndetention beds, and approximately 118 additional investigators, agents, \nand officers to the whole effort at Border Patrol. In fiscal year 2006, \nthe bill that is before us continues to implement and build upon the \nprogress that we have made in the Byrd-Craig amendment.\n  This bill, as reported by the committee, provides for 1,000 more \nBorder Patrol agents. It increases the total number of beds at \nimmigration detention centers by 2,240 to a total of 22,727.\n  It also adds 300 new immigration investigation positions and 200 new \nimmigration enforcement agents and detention officers.\n  This bill, as reported, in combination with the supplemental bill we \npassed earlier, makes record increases to commit record resources to \nborder security and immigration enforcement.\n  In total levels of key personnel alone, the Appropriations Committee \nhas provided for 12,400-plus Border Patrol agents; 18,200-plus Customs \nand border protection officers; 6,000-plus criminal investigators for \nCustoms and immigration work; 1,200-plus deportation officers; and \n2,700-plus immigration enforcement agents and detention officers.\n  In other words, in these positions alone, this bill provides for \nliterally an army of more than 40,000 agents and officers fighting on \nthe front lines for border security and immigration enforcement.\n  The committee has made an earnest attempt to add resources and \npersonnel as fast as the Department of Homeland Security can absorb \nthem and use them effectively. The bill, as reported, makes available \nmore than $7.1 billion for Customs and border protection, and more than \n$4.5 billion in immigration and Customs enforcement.\n  While those dollars and personnel numbers reflect something of our \ncommitment to improve border security and immigration enforcement, it \nis important to emphasize the work being done and the progress being \nmade for the American people.\n  More than 1 million individuals a year are being apprehended \nattempting to enter the country illegally, and formal removals have \nincreased sixfold over the last decade. Worker identification checks \nhave intensified. Development continues on US VISIT--the United States \nVisitor and Immigration Status Indicator Technology Program. Personnel \nare being trained. Technology is being modernized.\n  This bill calls on the administration, and provides resources to \nhelp, to close the gaps at our borders, to improve interagency \ncoordination inside the Department of Homeland Security and with \noutside agencies, and to meet the challenges remaining from the \nhistoric, and massive, reorganization that created the Department.\n  As I have said, we do need to do more. The Federal Government has no \nlaurels to rest on when it comes to border security or immigration. The \nproblem of illegal immigration has grown\n\n[[Page S8188]]\n\nto crisis proportion, with an estimated 10 million undocumented persons \nnow living here in this country.\n  During much of the 1990s, and at different times in preceding \ndecades, the Federal Government simply paid lipservice to enforcing the \nlaw while mostly looking the other way. This was with the quiet \ncomplicity of much of the public, in large part, because whole sectors \nof the economy have become increasingly dependent on the labor of these \npeople. This is an intolerable situation.\n  Our Nation's immigration system and laws are broken. Whether we are \ntalking about more money, more law, or both, a policy that focuses \nexclusively on more enforcement is not enough, and it will not work. It \nis a part of the total picture.\n  The United States has 7,458 miles of land borders and 88,600 miles of \ntidal shoreline. We can secure those frontiers well, but not perfectly. \nAs we have stepped up border enforcement, we have locked persons in \nthis country at least as effectively as we have locked them out of the \ncountry. Even as we have increased border enforcement, net illegal \nimmigration is estimated at 400,000 to 500,000 a year. Fellow Senators, \nthat is a figure worth repeating. Net illegal immigration in our \ncountry still, today, at this moment, in this year, will be between \n400,000 to 500,000. To search door to door, as some would advocate, to \nfind 10 million persons and flush them out of their homes, schools, \nchurches, workplaces, and other areas is simply something the American \npeople, in the end, would never tolerate. The question of civil \nliberties would grow and that effort would fall apart. We fought a \nrevolution once in this great country of ours against search of our \nhomes and, once again, I think the American people would react to that \nas not only unconstitutional, but dramatically intrusive.\n  So what do we do? This bill is a major step in the right direction. \nFirst and foremost, we secure our borders. As I have said, that is step \none. Step two, to me, is we change the law and we change the character \nof the law to deal with the problem that clearly is at hand; provide \nincentives for those inside our borders to come forward and identify \nthemselves; laws that ensure there is a supply of legal guest workers \nto take jobs Americans don't want or won't take. For example, when \nAmerican agriculture briefly had a widely used legal guest worker \nprogram in the 1950s, illegal immigration plummeted by more than 90 \npercent. That program was called the Bracero Program. It worked well, \nbut it had lots of criticism for the way the foreign nationals were \ntreated inside this country. As a result, it fell apart. We were then \ngiven what we have today--a very cumbersome law that no longer works.\n\n  Last year, that law identified about 42,000 to 45,000 legal workers \nfor American agriculture. Yet, we know there were well over a million \nworking in this country for American agriculture that were probably \nillegal. That, too, is an intolerable situation. It is why several \nyears ago I began to look at ways to solve this problem--at least for \nagriculture--because American agriculture is nervous, and they ought to \nbe; they know that even though those workers who come to them have what \nappear to be legal documents, the reality is that they are, by 70 \npercent of their workforce, working illegal foreign nationals. If it is \nnot corrected, it is an intolerable situation for American agriculture \nto be in.\n  That story can be played out in a variety of other industries. But as \nI began to focus on this a good number of years ago, I recognized there \nwas a significant problem that had to be dealt with. It is not a \npopular thing to do, but immigration and immigration reform is never \npopular. Those of us who are the children of immigrants sometimes hold \nthe attitude, close the border and let no one in. Yet, today, in the \nAmerican workforce we know that at a growing high record of employment \nwe still have well over 10 million foreign nationals, undocumented, \nworking in our economy in jobs that Americans oftentimes choose not to \nwork in.\n  That is why I created the bill AgJOBS, now supported by well over 60 \nSenators. We got a vote this year of 53 to 45 on a procedural motion to \nallow that Agricultural Job Opportunity and Benefit Security Act to \ncome to the floor and ultimately work through the process and become \nlaw. Other colleagues of mine are working on types of reform.\n  So what we are doing today with the Homeland Security Appropriations \nbill is making a quantum leap in the right direction. No immigration \npolicy, no matter how forward-looking, how flexible, and how reasonable \nit might be to identify those who are in the country, to allow the ebb \nand flow necessary to meet both the economic needs and humanitarian \nneeds that we are all for--you cannot do it without controlling your \nborders, without controlling the flow that comes across them. That is \nwhat this bill makes a major step in doing.\n  I am pleased to be a member of the subcommittee and to join with \nChairman Gregg and the ranking member, Senator Byrd, whom I have worked \nwith on this issue before. I believe this bill deserves the support of \nthe Senate. If you are for immigration reform, if you believe in \ncontrolling our borders, if you recognize this is an issue that has \ngone well out of control, then you would want to vote for this \nlegislation. Is it a tremendous investment? You bet it is. But it is an \ninvestment long coming, because it is the investment we have denied and \nignored as necessary to make for well over two decades. As a result of \nthat, we have the consequences of the situation we deal with today.\n  Now is the time to correct it. Now is the time to reshape immigration \npolicy in our country, and to do so recognizing that it is a two-front \nissue--both to have the right law in place, and to secure our borders \nso that those who come across are identified and move across legally \nand appropriately, consistent with the laws of our land.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is a very brief and simple amendment. \nIt designates MidAmerica St. Louis Airport in Mascoutah, IL, as a port \nof entry.\n  MidAmerica Airport is the civilian side of Scott Air Force Base, one \nof the region's largest employers. MidAmerica and Scott Air Force Base \nhave a successful joint-use plan.\n  MidAmerica is classified as a foreign trade zone and is a finalist to \nbe classified as an interior transshipment point for international air \ncargo. The MidAmerica Airport does not currently have international \ntraffic, although a passenger terminal was built to host pre-9/11 \nCustoms activities. International air cargo transport is nonexistent in \nthe region, and it would give MidAmerica a means to enhance the \nregion's economy. This would be beneficial to homeland security and \nwould enhance economic development in the metro East St. Louis region.\n  Mr. President, I ask that this amendment be set aside.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, the funding level in this amendment is \nbased on many things, and I will tell you about it. In fiscal year \n2006, we were planning to have the Public Transportation Terrorism \nPrevention Act that would have provided a total of $1.166 billion for \npublic transportation security grants based on risk. It provides for \ngrants for capital infrastructure improvements, for public \ntransportation systems, as well as operational costs for drills and \ntraining and research funding. Everything--cameras, dogs, and you might \ngo further with it.\n  We have taken necessary and prudent steps toward protecting our air \ntravel from terrorism--we hope. We made strides toward hardening our \naviation systems and making them less vulnerable to attack. Now I \nbelieve is the time to do the same for public transportation.\n  In 2004, the last year that data was available, over 9.6 billion \npassenger trips were taken on buses, trains, and other forms of public \ntransportation. The American Public Transportation Association \nestimates that over 14 million Americans ride on public transportation \neach weekday. The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that \nanother 25 million use public transportation less frequently but on a \nregular basis.\n  Securing public transportation presents many challenges. We know \nthat. The public transportation system includes over 100,000 miles of \nrail, almost 1,000 train and subway stations, and 60,000 buses. Meeting \nthis challenge will require devoted resources and steadfast commitment \nto the task.\n  Today this amendment I am offering on behalf of myself, Senator \nSarbanes, and others is an amendment to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill. As the Banking Committee has jurisdiction \nover transit security issues, a lot of the colleagues on the Banking \nCommittee on both sides of the aisle are joining me in this amendment.\n  The London attacks well illustrate the threats we face in this \ncountry, and we know all too well that England is not alone. Terrorists \nhave targeted public transportation systems the world over, and we know \nthey would delight in a successful attack here.\n  To this date, most terrorist attacks around the world have occurred \non public transportation. Examples are, as you know, Mr. President, \nSpain, Israel, Japan, and other countries, and this should cause us to \nconsider how we will aim to prevent such terrible attacks on our soil.\n  Over a year ago, Senator Sarbanes and I reported out of the Banking \nCommittee the Public Transportation Terrorism Prevention Act. It had \nnumerous cosponsors and passed the Senate with a unanimous vote. The \nbill was crafted in a thoughtful and considered manner after a series \nof hearings held in the committee.\n  In those sessions, we spoke to terrorism experts and industry \nofficials to ascertain the best way to protect public transportation \nsystems in the country. The product was a bill that had the support of \nindustry and terrorism experts alike. This amendment we are offering \ntoday comes out of that bill.\n  I believe we must provide resources toward mitigating these security \nthreats, and we must do so as soon as possible. We cannot wait.\n  I also appreciate the challenge that Chairman Gregg of the committee \nfaces. I serve on the Appropriations Committee with him, and I, too, am \nchairman of a subcommittee on appropriations. As he attempts to address \nthe multitude of security challenges in\n\n[[Page S8190]]\n\nthis appropriations bill, the allocation of funding is daunting. \nAttempting to find the balance between ports, rail, public \ntransportation, and other targets is a difficult task.\n  We could have infinite resources to spend and still not be totally \nprotected. We must realize this. We must concede that in the debate. \nBut I think we have to do more to protect our public transportation \nsystem. It is in that spirit, I am offering this amendment tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 1220 to Amendment No. 1205, as Modified\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1205, As Modified\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by the distinguished chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs Committee. The need to improve security throughout \nour Nation's public transportation system has been apparent for quite \nsome time. In fact, last year in the committee, I worked closely with \nChairman Shelby and with Senator Reed of Rhode Island who have been \nleaders on this issue both within the committee and throughout the \nSenate, on the Public Transportation Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004.\n  That legislation came out of the committee unanimously and was \napproved in the Senate last October 1 by unanimous consent. So every \nMember of this body, in effect, validated that legislation. That bill \nauthorized $3.5 billion over 3 years in security for our Nation's mass \ntransportation systems. Of that amount, $1.16 billion was scheduled for \nfiscal year 2006.\n  This funding level was authorized to begin to address the critical \nsecurity needs that exist throughout the thousands of public \ntransportation systems in our country. The amendment offered by the \nchairman of the committee, which I have joined in cosponsoring, along \nwith my able colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, and others, \nseeks to provide the appropriations level to sustain the authorized \nlevel, which this body has heretofore approved.\n  In the wake of the tragic attack in London last Thursday, which has \nclaimed over 50 lives and left hundreds more injured, we clearly need \nto more fully fund transit security, and going to the previously \nSenate-authorized level seems to make imminent good sense. The Senate \nanticipated this problem in the authorization, and the committee \nbrought out well-considered legislation which this body passed \nunanimously. We have not provided the wherewithal to support the \nauthorization, and this amendment seeks to do exactly that.\n  The threat to transit is not new. We have had terrorist attacks \nagainst transit systems in Moscow, South Korea, and London. In fact, in \n2002, the GAO found that one-third of all terrorist attacks worldwide \nwere against transit systems. Despite this significant threat, security \nfunding has been grossly inadequate.\n  Our Nation's transit systems have been unable to implement necessary \nsecurity improvements, including those that have been identified by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. In an editorial last Friday, the \nBaltimore Sun stated that, ``Since September 11, 2001, the Federal \nGovernment has spent $18 billion on aviation security. Transit systems, \nwhich carry 16 times more passengers daily, have received about $250 \nmillion. That is a ridiculous imbalance.''\n  They go on to state:\n\n       Transit officials estimate it would take $6 billion to make \n     buses and rail systems safe. And Congress has in the past \n     considered authorizing $3.5 billion over three years for the \n     same purpose.\n\n  That is a direct reference to the Public Transportation Terrorism \nPrevention Act of 2004, which, as has been noted, passed the Senate \nunanimously.\n  These moneys will be used for such necessities as: security cameras, \nradios, front-line employee training, and extra security personnel. \nThey are not extravagant requests.\n  Let me give one example of a critical need right here with respect to \nWashington's Metro. Their greatest security need is a backup control \noperations center. This need was identified by the Federal Transit \nAdministration in its initial security assessment and then identified \nagain by the Department of Homeland Security in its subsequent security \nassessment. This critical need remains unaddressed because it has been \nunfunded. This amendment provides the funding to match what was set out \nin the authorization.\n  We know that transit systems are potential targets for terrorist \nattacks. We know the vital role these systems play in our Nation's \neconomic and security infrastructure. We can wait no longer to address \nthese critical security needs of the transit systems throughout the \nNation. This amendment begins the important process of providing these \ncritically needed funds.\n  Again, I thank the able chairman of the committee for his excellent \nleadership on the transit security issue and Senator Reed for his \nstrong and continued commitment on this issue and his perseverance over \na sustained period of time. I thank all of our colleagues who have \njoined as cosponsors of this amendment. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial from the Baltimore Sun of \nJuly 8 referenced in my statement be printed in full at the end of my \nstatement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Security Derailed\n\n       Yesterday's attack on London's transit system was \n     frighteningly familiar. Just 16 months ago, terrorists in \n     Madrid killed nearly 200 people and wounded more than 1,500 \n     by setting off bombs in commuter trains. Both demonstrated \n     the potential vulnerability of buses and rail systems. Yet, \n     until yesterday, many in Washington seemed unconcerned that \n     something similar could happen in the United States.\n       Last month, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted to \n     reduce the Department of Homeland Security's budget for \n     transit and rail security from $150 million (the amount spent \n     annually now) to $100 million in the upcoming fiscal year. \n     Certainly, no one knew terrorists would target London, but \n     the 2004 bombings in Spain should have been fresh in \n     senators' minds. What does it take for Congress to grasp this \n     issue?\n\n[[Page S8191]]\n\n       Since Sept. 11, 2001, the federal government has spent $18 \n     billion on aviation security. Transit systems--which carry 16 \n     times more passengers daily--have received about $250 \n     million. That's a ridiculous imbalance. Transit officials \n     estimate it would take $6 billion to make buses and rail \n     systems safe. And Congress has in the past considered \n     authorizing $3.5 billion over three years for the same \n     purpose.\n       How would those in charge of the nation's public transit \n     systems spend the extra money? Chiefly for necessities like \n     security cameras, radios, training and extra security \n     personnel. Those aren't extravagant requests. Local \n     governments have spent $2 billion to keep buses and trains \n     safe over the past four years, according to the American \n     Public Transit Association.\n       The Bush administration originally asked for significantly \n     more than $150 million to create a Targeted Infrastructure \n     Protection Program that would not only increase transit \n     security but also assist vulnerable shipping ports and energy \n     facilities, too. And though transit and rail systems might \n     have been shortchanged by that arrangement, it is not \n     unreasonable to let DHS officials set their own investment \n     priorities--if an adequate budget is made available to them.\n       Transit advocates are hopeful that the $50 million cut can \n     be restored. The attacks in London suggest much more is \n     needed. Advocates want $2 billion for transit and rail \n     security in the fiscal 2006 budget (not counting the amount \n     needed to protect Amtrak). Suddenly, that doesn't seem quite \n     so unreasonable an expenditure.\n       Still, the failure to address transit security in the wake \n     of last year's bombings in Madrid underscores Capitol Hill's \n     inability to set appropriate spending priorities in matters \n     of domestic security. As the 9/11 commission pointed out, \n     Congress has treated portions of the DHS budget like so much \n     bacon, apportioning more per capita to Wyoming than to New \n     York. Between the costly war in Iraq and record budget \n     deficits, the nation can ill afford to be so foolish with its \n     security resources.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to commend Chairman Shelby for his \nleadership on this issue and Senator Sarbanes for his leadership. I am \nproud to be a cosponsor of this amendment along with Chairman Shelby \nand Senator Sarbanes. They have said it very well. We understand that \ntransit systems are threatened by terrorists. That understanding was \ndeveloped after 9/11, but certainly it was sharpened last week with the \nattack in London that left 52 dead and over 700 injured.\n  We recognize that we have to protect these vulnerable transit \nsystems, and the purpose of this amendment is to provide the resources \nto do that. There are 6,000 transit systems in the United States, so \nthis money, although it seems significant, will barely keep up with the \ndemands for security improvements to transit systems across the United \nStates.\n  Each day, 14 million riders use transit to get to work, to get to \nappointments, to get to hospitals, to do what they must do. Let me \ndisabuse the notion that this is just the province of the very biggest \nmetropolises like New York City. In Dallas, for example, on a yearly \nbasis, 55 million trips a year on transit; Houston, 96 million trips a \nyear; Atlanta, 137 million trips per year; Portland, 95 million; \nCharlotte, NC, 16 million trips per year; Philadelphia, PA, 297 million \ntrips per year; and Minneapolis, 56.9 million trips per year.\n  Millions of Americans each day get on a subway or a bus and use the \ntransit system. They are today not as well protected as they should be. \nThe point of this amendment is to begin to get the resources together \nto start those sensible investments in capital equipment, in \noperational techniques and training and in consequence management that \nare so important for transit security.\n  As Senator Sarbanes pointed out, the GAO has found that one-third of \nthe terrorist attacks in the last several years have been directed \nagainst transit systems. We know it is a target.\n  After 9/11, as I was acting as chairman of the Subcommittee on \nHousing and Transportation, I held a hearing--in fact several \nhearings--about the need for improvement of transit security. Today, \nthat evidence is even more compelling based upon what has happened in \nLondon, Moscow, and Spain. All of these things should compel us to \nsupport this amendment enthusiastically.\n  One final point: Not only is transit important, not only is it a \ntarget for terrorists, but in terror attacks transit is an important \naspect in consequence management. People were evacuated from the \nPentagon because of the subway systems and the Metro systems in \nWashington. Transit trains moved underneath the World Trade Center. In \nfact, cool action by some of the transit police and transit dispatchers \nwas able to minimize casualties. That will not happen if they do not \nhave the communication equipment, the training, and the ability to \nrespond and react to a possible terrorist attack.\n  So not only is transit a likely target, but it is an essential means \nof managing the consequences of an attack in any urban area anywhere in \nthe United States.\n  So I again urge my colleagues to join Senator Shelby, Senator \nSarbanes, and our other colleagues who support this amendment. It is \nimportant. It is more than timely; it is, frankly, after last week, \noverdue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it appears we will be able to begin voting \nhere around 6:30, just for Members' edification. The first vote will be \non the point of order relative to the amendment of Senator Dodd, \nfollowed hopefully with a second amendment dealing with one of the \namendments of Senator Akaka.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1202, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have cleared this with the distinguished \nmanager of the bill. I send a modification of the Dodd amendment, \namendment No. 1202, to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Let me begin once again by expressing my appreciation to \nthe chairman and the manager of this bill, Senator Gregg, and my \ncolleague from West Virginia, Senator Byrd. They have done a good job \nwith this bill. This bill deals with several complicated issues. The \nevents during the past few days in London have highlighted the \nimportance of these issues concerning our homeland security. I want to \nexpress my appreciation to Senator Gregg and Senator Byrd for operating \nwithin the constraints of the budget caps.\n  I realize by offering an amendment so large--50 percent of the entire \namount in this bill--I am offering an extraordinary amendment. I tried \nto make it clear today that these are extraordinary times with \nextraordinary events. Since 1983, when the bombing of the Marine \nbarracks took place in Beirut where we lost 242 Marines, 221 major \nterrorist attacks have occurred around the world. Fifty-eight of those \nattacks, almost 25 percent, were carried out in transit systems, with \nthe use of trucks or cars or in seaports.\n\n[[Page S8192]]\n\n  We know today in our own country that we are glaringly lax in \nproviding the security we need within our transit systems, harbors, and \nports.\n  The amendment I am offering is not one that I have crafted on my own. \nIt was crafted largely from the recommendations Senator Warren Rudman, \nour former colleague, had suggested in a report sponsored by the \nCouncil on Foreign Relations that included many distinguished Americans \nwho have worked in areas of national security as well as public health, \nintelligence, and bioterrorism. They suggested strongly in their report \nthat we spend some $20 billion a year in order to fully invest in what \nwe need to make our country more secure.\n  Let me quote, if I can, once again, because I think his comments are \nworth repeating, the language of Senator Rudman in that report. Senator \nRudman said at that time:\n\n       The terrible events of September 11 have shown the American \n     people how vulnerable they are because attacks on that scale \n     had never been carried out on U.S. soil. The United States \n     and the American people were caught underprotected and \n     unaware of the magnitude of the threat facing them.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       In the wake of September 11, ignorance of the nature of the \n     threat or of what the United States must do to prepare for \n     future attacks can no longer explain America's continuing \n     failure to allocate sufficient resources in preparing local \n     emergency responders. It would be a terrible tragedy indeed \n     if it took another catastrophic attack to drive that point \n     home.\n\n  Let me also, if I can, read once again the language of Les Gelb, in \npreparing the foreword of that report. Les Gelb wrote, on the occasion \nof this report being filed:\n\n       As I sit to write this foreword, it is likely that a \n     terrorist group somewhere in the world is developing plans to \n     attack the United States and/or American interests abroad \n     using chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or \n     catastrophic conventional means. At the same time, diplomats, \n     legislators, military and intelligence officers, police, \n     fire, and emergency medical personnel and others in the \n     United States and across the globe are working feverishly to \n     prevent and prepare for such attacks. These two groups of \n     people are ultimately in a race with one another. This is a \n     race we cannot afford to lose.\n\n  I think those words ought to be taken to heart. Since that report was \nfiled, of course, we have seen the attacks in Madrid on their transit \nsystem and the people there who lost their lives in March of 2004 and \nwe have seen the attacks in London, the suicide bombings that we now \nknow occurred there--the first time suicide bombers appeared in the \nWest. What kind of attack will it take for us to realize we can no \nlonger wait to do what needs to be done to prepare our transit systems, \nour ports, our harbors--what more needs to be done to make America more \nsecure?\n  Is my amendment a large amendment? It is. Is it extraordinary in its \nsize? It is. But I strongly suggest to my colleagues the events we are \nfacing as a people are no less extraordinary and demand, I think, \nextraordinary action.\n  While there will be a move here, obviously, to raise the point of \norder on the budget against this amendment because of its size--and I \nhave asked to waive that point of order--at some point we are going to \nbe faced again with these tragedies. I only hope we have the resources \nat hand to minimize them. How many events will it take? What \ncatastrophic occurrence is going to have to occur before we realize we \nneed to make these investments?\n  I know all the bureaucratic arguments that are being made here, but I \ndon't think they apply. I think when we are faced, as we have been \nhistorically, with major events, major problems, this body, this \nCongress, the American people have responded accordingly. I think the \nAmerican people expect nothing less of us at this hour. So I urge my \ncolleagues to support this motion to waive and to support this \namendment so we can do what needs to be done to make our country more \nsecure.\n  Again, I appreciate immensely the efforts of the Senator from New \nHampshire. I understand his points. They are points that are well \ntaken. But I also believe the point I am making here is one deserving \nof attention.\n  Mr. President, I list here, for those who may be interested, the 221 \nsignificant terrorist incidents since 1983. I have categorized each of \nthem that occurred and the numbers of lives lost. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have that printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Significant Terrorist Incidents, 1961-2003: A Brief Chronology\n\n       Bombing of U.S. Embassy in Beirut, April 18, 1983: Sixty-\n     three people, including the CIA's Middle East director, were \n     killed and 120 were injured in a 400-pound suicide truck-bomb \n     attack on the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon.

I thank the Senator for his patience and indulgence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the concern of the Senator from Connecticut \nand I know he is working hard in this area, but the response to this \namendment is not bureaucratic. The response to this amendment focuses \non the fact that this bill, and our efforts as a Nation, must be threat \nbased as we address terrorism.\n  I was interested today in a quote from Mayor Bloomberg in one of the \nNew York papers. He essentially said if a professional terrorist, whose \npurpose it was to kill Americans indiscriminately, wishes to attack the \ntransit systems of New York, it is virtually impossible to stop that \nindividual at the site of the attack.\n  Where do you stop that individual? You stop him by obtaining the \nintelligence necessary to interdict him before he can attack us. The \nenergy we in this Nation are putting in the area of fighting terrorism \nis to do exactly that.\n  One of the primary reasons we are fighting in Iraq, one of the \nprimary reasons we are fighting in Afghanistan, is in order to develop \nintelligence which will give us the capacity to stop these individuals. \nThese individuals come from that part of the world. One of the reasons \nwe have Guantanamo Bay is to develop intelligence capability. A \nsignificant amount of our intelligence capability coming out of that \nfacility is as a result of taking their prisoners, who are bad actors, \npeople who are fundamentally focused on hurting Americans, and getting \ninformation from them in a proper way.\n  One of the reasons we have the PATRIOT Act is to develop the \nintelligence we need to interdict an attack.\n  One of the reasons we do profiling is in order to get the \nintelligence we need to catch these people before they attack us. This \nbill addresses intelligence. We have significantly improved or are \ntrying to improve with this bill what is our highest risk relative to \nthe capacity of a terrorist to attack us, which is the porousness of \nour borders.\n  And so these funds which are being proposed here, $16 billion, which \nliterally represents 50 percent of the entire budget of the Homeland \nSecurity agency being put into first responder programs when we already \nhave $7 billion in the pipeline that hasn't been spent yet because the \nassessments and plans for spending the money haven't been properly \nprepared, would really be a true misallocation of resources, a true \nmisallocation of resources in our effort to defend ourselves. They \nsimply could not be handled, these types of dollars. The dollars \nalready in the pipeline we have not been able to handle. This bill puts \n$4 billion into these accounts, and we know that $4 billion will not be \nout the door as quickly as it should. To put $16 billion on top of that \nis a political statement but is not going to have a dramatic impact \nbecause the system to handle the dollars is not there and lot of money \nwill be wasted. Taxpayers will find that instead of getting more \nsecurity, what they are getting is dollars that could have been used \nmore efficiently somewhere else, that will have been drained off, and \nthose dollars should be going into intelligence gathering and \nprotecting our borders and to fighting these wars which we are \nparticipating in and making sure our military has adequate support in \nplaces such as Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  Independent of that, the amendment dramatically exceeds the budget \nand is therefore subject to a point of order, which I have made, and \nthe motion to waive has been made by the Senator from Connecticut, and \nwe will have a vote on it.\n  So at this time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 6:30 \nthis evening the Senate proceed to a series of votes in relation to the \nfollowing amendments and the motions where pending; further, that no \nsecond-degree amendments be in order to any amendments prior to the \nvote, and that there be 2 minutes equally divided for debate prior to \neach vote: The first amendment will be the Dodd amendment, a motion to \nwaive the budget point of order, and the second amendment would be \nAkaka amendment No. 1112, and on that amendment there will also be a \npoint of order and I presume the vote will be on the motion to waive \nthe point of order since that amendment also significantly exceeds the \nbudget allocation of this committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Is there an objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is \nnot present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1112, as Modified\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask that the pending amendment be set \naside and the amendment No. 1112 of Senator Akaka be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I raise a point of order under section \n302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act that the amendment by Senator \nAkaka provides spending in excess of the subcommittee allocation under \nsection 302(b).\n  I am sorry, I reserve that motion and I guess Senator Akaka is going \nto send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I reply to the chairman it does not affect \nthe content of the amendment. I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Hawaii wish to send a \nmodification to the desk?\n  Without objection, the modification is accepted.\n  The amendment (No. 1112), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 77, line 18, strike ``$2,694,300,000'' and insert \n     ``$3,181,300,000''.\n       On page 77, line 20, strike ``$1,518,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,985,000,000''.\n       On page 79, line 21, strike ``$321,300,000'' and insert \n     ``$341,300,000''.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, at this point I raise a point of order \nunder section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act that the amendment \nprovides spending in excess of the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, in accordance with section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for purposes of the pending amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. The yeas and nays are \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is my understanding that we will now have a vote on \nSenator Dodd's amendment, on the motion to waive the Budget Act, \nfollowed by a vote on Senator Akaka's motion to waive the Budget Act. I \nshould inform Members that we actually are going to have three other \nvotes following those two votes as soon as we line them up. The first \nvote will begin at 6:30.\n  I think Senator Akaka wanted time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Sarbanes be added \nas a cosponsor to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly on my first \nresponder amendment to the Homeland Security appropriations bill.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee has \ncited $7 billion in unspent first responder grants as justification for \nreducing first responder funding in fiscal year 2006. I wish to take a \nmoment to respond to the statement. First, much of the $7 billion \nfigure has been legally obligated for specific purposes or in some \ncases even already spent. As the DHS inspector general observed in a \nMarch 2004 report on the distribution of first responder grants, the \namount of funds drawn down by States provide an incomplete picture of \nthe progress States and local jurisdictions are making. A more accurate \nway to monitor progress would be to identify the amount of funds \nobligated and spent by the State and local jurisdictions.\n  Following this approach and looking at data received from DHS, \nvirtually all the money that has been awarded to\n\n[[Page S8200]]\n\nStates in prior years under the three main homeland security first \nresponder grant programs has been obligated.\n  Second, the $7 billion includes fiscal year 2005 grant funds which \nwere only made available to States by DHS very recently and could not \nreasonably be expected to have already been spent in the middle of the \nsame fiscal year.\n  We should not punish first responders for bureaucratic procedures and \nredtape. Our country cannot afford to take resources away from its \nfirst responders at a time when we rely on them more than ever.\n  Mr. President, I urge support of our amendment. I have asked for the \nyeas and nays. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to support this amendment \nto the fiscal year 2006 Department of Homeland Security appropriations \nbill to provide additional funding for our first responders and \npreventers--the men and women who go to work every day to keep our \ncommunities safe, and who rush into the face of disaster when it \nhappens.\n  Last Thursday, the world saw again with the despicable attacks in \nLondon that terrorists are still capable of killing innocent civilians. \nIt is yet another wake up call to all of us, and a sign that we cannot \nlet down our guard. We must stay vigilant.\n  In fact, our intelligence and security experts have been telling us \nin no uncertain terms that the threat of terrorist attacks right here \nat home is one we will have to live with for some time to come. CIA \nDirector Porter Goss has said, ``It may only be a matter of time'' \nbefore terrorists strike again within our borders with weapons of mass \ndestruction. And FBI Director Robert Mueller has said our Nation is, \n``awash in desirable'' targets for terrorists.\n  Given these pronouncements, it is wrong to leave our police, \nfirefighters, and emergency medical workers undertrained and ill-\nequipped to protect American citizens. We would never consider denying \nthe training and equipment needs of our men and women fighting in Iraq \nand we should not deny the training and equipment needs of those we \nrely on to protect us in the war on terror at home.\n  Yet that is exactly what this spending bill does. It sends the wrong \nmessage not only to first responders and the state and local officials \nstruggling to cover the costs of preparing for new threats. It also \nsends a dangerous message of complacency to the public.\n  The amendment that Senator Akaka and I are offering today would boost \nour first responder spending by $587 million--to restore three key \ngrants programs to last year's funding levels. Those grant programs are \nthe State Homeland Security Grant Program, the Urban Areas Security \nInitiative, and the Fire Assistance Grant Program--all of which supply \nfirst responders with the training and equipment they need to do their \njobs effectively and safely.\n  Opponents of this amendment will argue that Congress has already \nappropriated billions of dollars for first responders and preventers \nsince September 11, and that some $7 billion remains unspent in the \npipeline. This is a common misperception.\n  First, the $7 billion figure includes fiscal year 2005 grant funds--\nfunds that were only made available to states by DHS very recently and \nthat could not reasonably be expected to have already been spent in the \nmiddle of the same fiscal year. Second, the $7 billion refers to money \nthat has not actually been ``drawn down'' from the U.S. Treasury. Much \nof this money, however, has been legally obligated for specific \npurposes or in some cases even already spent. As DHS's inspector \ngeneral observed in a March 2004 report on the distribution of first \nresponder grants, ``The amounts of funds drawn down by states provide \nan incomplete picture of the progress states and local jurisdictions \nare making. A more accurate way to monitor progress would be to \nidentify the amount of funds obligated and spent (outlays) by the \nstates and local jurisdictions.''\n  Following this approach and looking at data we have received from the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, it appears that virtually all the \nmoney that has been awarded to States in prior years under the three \nmain homeland security first responder grant programs--the State \nHomeland Security Grant Program, the Urban Area Security Initiative, \nUASI, and the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program, has been \nobligated.\n  At any rate, the billions we have appropriated over the years still \npales by comparison to what most experts--Republican and Democrat--say \nis needed to adequately prepare our first responders and preventers. In \nJune 2003, a nonpartisan task force chaired by former Republican \nSenator Warren Rudman reported that--over the next 5 years--we will \nunder fund the needs of critical emergency responders by nearly $100 \nbillion. And that figure was arrived at based on maintaining 2003 \nfunding levels.\n  The task force found that, on average, fire departments had enough \nradios to equip only half the firefighters on a shift, and breathing \napparatuses for only one-third. Just 10 percent had the personnel and \nequipment needed to respond to a building collapse; and police \ndepartments did not have the protective gear needed to secure the site \nof a WMD attack. These dismal numbers may have improved somewhat since \n2003, but no one has suggested that our level of preparedness is near \nwhere it should be.\n  On the key issue of first responder communications interoperability--\nthe top priority of State and local homeland security advisors--the \ntask force recommended spending almost $7 billion over 5 years. And DHS \nestimates the cost of modernizing first responder communications \ninfrastructure at $40 billion. No wonder most States have not yet \nachieved interoperability.\n  In March, New York's Center for Catastrophe Preparedness and Response \nreported that emergency medical workers generally lack not only proper \nequipment but also proper training. And at a Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee hearing in April, we heard disturbing \ntestimony that first responders are often not prepared to respond \nadequately to accidents at chemical facilities, leaving the American \npublic dangerously exposed, even more so if there is deliberate release \ncaused by terrorists.\n  I cannot say it often enough: our first responders are on the \nfrontlines of the war on terror here at home, and we must equip and \ntrain them to do their jobs safely and effectively. Words of praise are \nuseless. They need dollars--dollars to help train and equip State and \nlocal police, firefighters, and emergency medical technicians to help \ndetect or disrupt terrorist activity before an attack occurs or to save \nas many lives as possible and contain the damage if an attack occurs.\n  This amendment is a modest proposal--$587 million--and it seeks \nprimarily to halt to downward trend in funding for our Nation's first \nresponders, and important, and I hope achievable goal. Last year, we \nspent more on Mars exploration. I have consistently advocated that we \nspend much more to make sure that first responders have the training \nand equipment they need to keep the American people safe. For example, \nearlier this year, I proposed to the Budget and Appropriations \nCommittees that we spend $4.2 billion more for first responders and \npreventers, consistent with the advice of experts who have told us that \nwe need to invest billions more to secure our Nation.\n  Yet this appropriations bill reflects, once again, an ill-advised \nadministration strategy to reduce funding for first responders for the \nsecond year in a row. This is no time to retreat. I urge my colleagues \nto support this modest but urgent effort to meet our homeland security \nneeds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the work of the Senator from \nHawaii. He is always a very positive and effective spokesperson in the \nSenate for a variety of different issues. He brings this amendment \nforward. The simple fact is that you can't disregard the fact that \nthere is $7 billion in the pipeline for first responders--$3 billion \nfrom the year 2004, $4 billion from 2005--that hasn't been spent. This \nbill puts another $4 billion into these accounts, so we are not \nshorting these accounts. One of the reasons the Senate has offered this \nbill is it takes money from first responders that is not going to be \nspent in a timely manner, moves it over to Border Patrol where we do \nneed the money, moves it over to weapons of mass destruction where we \ndo\n\n[[Page S8201]]\n\nneed the money, and that is the priority we set as a committee, in a \nbipartisan way, because this has been, as I mentioned a number of \ntimes, a threat-based bill. This is the first time this bill has been \nbrought forth recently, or ever, really, based on threat, and we \ndetermined the threat was weapons of mass destruction and border \nporousness. The fact there were $7 billion in the pipeline, retaining \n$4 billion in this account we felt was an adequate amount to fund those \naccounts for first responders, knowing that down the road we are going \nto put more money into first responders as it can be absorbed. But to \nput more in now would mean just holding it, and that money can be much \nmore efficiently used as we propose to use it by adding more Border \nPatrol agents and detention beds, and more aggressive attempts to fight \nthe use of a weapon of mass destruction against us. So that is why we \nare opposed to this approach.\n  Clearly, it breaks the allocation which we have received. Therefore, \nit would add $587 million to the deficit, which would also be \ninappropriate, and that is why the point of order lies against it and \nthat is why we oppose it at this point.\n  I understand we are now on a minute equally divided on the Dodd \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The understanding is 2 minutes equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. DODD. The chairman is very gracious. He has probably worn out his \npatience on this amendment.\n  This amendment is an extraordinary amendment. I fully understand \nthat. I believe the events, particularly over the last week, have \nhighlighted the extraordinary times we are in and the challenges we \nface.\n  The bulk of the $16 billion is not to first responders but to \nharbors, port and chemical plants where there is great vulnerability \ntoday.\n  Recently, I was in Seville, Spain, attending a conference. I rode the \ntrain from Seville to Madrid and arrived in the same station where the \nattacks occurred in March of 2004. My luggage, when I got on the train \nin Seville to go to Madrid, was quickly checked through a scanning \nsystem. We have nothing like that.\n  I am not suggesting had something like that existed in London the \nproblem could have been avoided. I know terrorists might have used \nanother means to attack as they did that day, but it minimizes the \npossibility.\n  The vulnerabilities we have in our country today in the areas I have \ndescribed demand attention. With all due respect, this bill is a \nreduction in funding for these areas, not an increase. We ought to be \ndoing more. This amendment is a large amount, but to do less would be a \ntragedy. I hope the waiver will be adopted.\n  Mr. GREGG. This is $16 billion, $16 billion into an account where \nthere presently is sitting $7 billion in the bank.\n  We as a nation obviously have a lot of vulnerabilities because we are \nan open society. I wish we could cover them all. But the simple fact is \nthere is not enough money to cover them all. We need to prioritize. \nThis bill does that. This amendment basically flies in the face of good \nutilization of the dollars because we simply could not spend these \ntypes of dollars if they were appropriated effectively. They may get \nspent but not effectively, in our opinion.\n  It is much more appropriate to look at addressing weapons of mass \ndestruction, border patrol, airline security, and to make sure we have \nin place the proper systems in order to protect the homeland through \nthese assessment programs which are going forward before we put a large \namount of money--$16 billion, which would be half the budget of the \nHomeland Security agency--into new spending initiatives or additional \nspending initiatives, the $4 billion in the bill and the $7 billion in \nthe pipeline.\n  The point of order has been made. This is a motion to waive it. This \namendment would add $16 billion to the deficit. We do not think it \nwould accomplish what its purpose is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is now \nagreeing to the motion to waive the Budget Act with respect to Dodd \namendment No. 1202, as modified.

Mr. President, let me take a moment and update everybody \non the schedule. We are going to have one additional vote scheduled \nthis evening. We will be starting that momentarily.

We will have \none more vote starting shortly, and we will start stacked votes at 10 \nin the morning. We will work straight through tomorrow, hopefully \nfinish tomorrow night. We will be in on Friday as well, but I think we \ncan finish this bill tomorrow night.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1112, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Akaka amendment. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, we have been very concerned about first \nresponders and funding they really need. My amendment simply seeks to \nmaintain the fiscal year 2005 funding for first responders. Our country \ncannot afford to take the resources away from them. I urge support of \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment adds $587 million in new \nspending to first responder grants, above the levels provided already \nin the bill. There is no offset. The bill already provides $3.4 billion \nfor first responder grants. In addition, there is nearly $7 billion \npreviously appropriated that State and locals have available to spend \nat this time for first responders. The funding pipeline is full of \nmoney. This amendment will cause the subcommittee to exceed its 302(b) \nallocation.

and\n       (E) to obtaining an estimate of the level of United States \n     troops that will be necessary in Iraq during 2005 and 2006, \n     and in any years thereafter;\n       (2) the report should be provided by the Department of \n     Defense, as required by the Emergency Supplemental \n     Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and \n     Tsunami Relief, 2005 as soon as possible; and\n       (3) the Secretary of Defense should communicate to Congress \n     and the American people why the report was not submitted to \n     Congress by the original deadline for its submittal.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in the 2005 Iraq Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations bill, the House and Senate conferees agreed to an \nextensive set of Defense Department reporting and benchmarking \nrequirements on Iraq that addressed the security, economic, \nreconstruction, and governance areas.\n  This report was due on July 11, and has yet to be provided to \nCongress.\n  This amendment conveys the Sense of the Senate that this information \nis critical to formulating a strategy for success and that the report \nshould be delivered to Congress as soon as possible.\n  Over the last few weeks, the American people have been assured by the \nadministration that they have a strategy for success in Iraq.\n  Unfortunately, too often the rhetorical excesses of senior \nadministration officials have left an impression with the American \npeople of a credibility gap.\n  Overly optimistic statements such as that by the Vice President that \nthe insurgency is in its ``last throes'' have not matched what real \nexperts, including the administration's own intelligence analysts and \nsenior military officers, have said about the challenges ahead.\n  With all this obfuscation, the American people are right to be \nconcerned and right to demand that the administration report more cold, \nhard facts about Iraq on a regular basis.\n  As the administration asks Congress for billions more in funding for \nthe Iraq war in coming months, on top of the more than $218 billion we \nhave provided so far, the American people are entitled to information \nmeasuring whether those resources are having an impact and moving the \nball forward in Iraq.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that this is important not just for our \ndebate about Iraq but for our debate about other priorities such as \nhomeland security. We spend more on Iraq in a month than we spend on \nfirst responders in an entire year. Since 9/11, we have spent $500 \nmillion on mass transit security--an amount that we\n\n[[Page S8204]]\n\nspend every 3 days in our operations in Iraq. This puts a premium on \nensuring the taxpayers' money is being well spent.\n  We won't know whether our strategy in Iraq is making true progress \nuntil real report cards start coming in.\n  The amendment is a reminder that the first of these report cards from \nthe administration was due this past Monday, and that the \nrepresentatives of the people in Congress are waiting.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is the amendment now pending in the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 1161 offered by the Democratic \nleader.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that the Senate act on the amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1161.\n  The amendment (No. 1161) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1075\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order with respect to \namendment No. 1075. It is Senator Voinovich's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Madam President, as we return from the celebrations \nmarking our Nation's Independence Day, we should take a moment to mark \nthe accomplishments of this Senate as we conclude the first quarter of \nthe 109th Session of the U.S. Congress.\n  The list of accomplishments is impressive.\n  Judges to our circuit courts of appeals, stalled for years, now sit \non the bench. Key legislative initiatives, once left to languish, are \nnow the law of the land or on the brink of completion.\n  Class action reform protects plaintiffs from abusive coupon \nsettlements while it prevents lawyers from gaming the system.\n  It had been delayed for at least a decade despite strong public \nsupport and legislative majorities. Now it has been signed into law by \nPresident Bush.\n  So too was a bankruptcy reform bill that ushers in a new emphasis on \npersonal responsibility. It is another reform of our civil justice \nsystem that was long delayed, despite broad support.\n  We met our responsibilities to defend freedom, and the challenges of \ncontinuing to wage war on terrorism, with an emergency funding bill for \nIraq.\n  We responded to the heart-breaking human cry for help by funding \ninternational relief efforts for victims of the Southeast Asia tsunami.\n  The budget resolution, which sets the vision of this nation, was \ncompleted and now permits smooth consideration of appropriations bills, \ntax relief measures, the highway bill, the energy bill and numerous \nother initiatives.\n  After failures to enact a budget in two of the last three sessions, \ngetting this one in place means we are on course to meeting the \nPresident's goal of cutting the deficit in half while funding our \nimportant priorities of health, education, veterans, and homeland \nsecurity.\n  When we've found that our budget needed to be adjusted to meet the \nmedical needs of veterans, we voted to make the adjustments to ensure \nveterans have the health care they need this year as well as next.\n  We now are poised to soon enact a highway bill that will help \nAmericans get where they need to go more quickly and safely, and will \nhelp create jobs within our States as well.\n  We are going to conference now on an Energy bill that will help \nreduce our national dependence on foreign sources of oil and prevent \nblackouts like the one that hit the Northeast United States in 2003.\n  We made the homeland safer by passing the Real ID provision. These \nprovisions tighten our borders, reform our asylum system, and safeguard \nour identity documents so that terrorists cannot use them to avoid \ndetection.\n  We've broken the unprecedented three-year filibuster of President \nBush's judicial nominees who finally received up-or-down votes. Now, \nJudges Owen, Pryor, Brown, Griffith, McKeague, and Griffin have each \ntaken their oaths and assumed the Federal appellate bench.\n  Most recently, the Senate has expanded the benefits of free trade, \neconomic opportunity, and political stability to new regions of our own \nhemisphere with Senate passage of the Central American Free Trade \nAgreement.\n  We've made a good down payment on the appropriations process by \npassing the Interior, Legislative Branch, and Energy and Water.\n  And finally, this week we have paid our respects and expressed our \ncondolences to the victims of the London terrorist bombings, and are \nproceeding to work on funding our own homeland security needs.\n  Freedom never had a greater ally than the valiant United Kingdom, and \nthe United Kingdom will never have a greater friend than America. Our \nprayers are with that great nation today.\n  That is an incredible body of achievement in just six months. Where \nonce there was inaction, we can now boast of accomplishment. We have \ndone what the American people sent us here to do.\n  I hope everyone enjoyed the Fourth of July weekend and paused for a \nmoment to celebrate the fact behind those fireworks--that government \nof, for, and by the people can work, and that the accomplishments of \nthis Senate show that it does work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/13/senate-section/article/S8204-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8204-S8205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n.\n\n\n                                ETHIOPIA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I rise to express concern about \nrecent events in Ethiopia. On May 15, 2005, 90 percent of registered \nEthiopian voters went to the polls in the country's third election \nunder its current constitution. Unfortunately, this historic election \nwas marred by a disputed outcome. Because of the controversy over the \nelection, civil unrest ensued. In responding to protests by opposition \nparties, the Government of Ethiopia acted with excessive force, killing \n36 protestors and arresting large numbers of demonstrators.\n  Final results of the May election were due to be completed by the \nNational Electoral Board first by June 8, then by July 8, and are still \nongoing. Interim certified results from the Electoral Board indicate \nthat approximately 40 percent of the vote is either still under \ninvestigation or in need of review, with one region of the country \nstill to cast its ballots.\n  Let me be crystal clear that the Government of Ethiopia must respect \nthe\n\n[[Page S8205]]\n\nneutrality of the Electoral Board and permit it to go about its work in \na fair and impartial manner. I also call upon Kemal Bedri Kelo, \nchairman of the Electoral Board, to conduct the board's proceedings in \na transparent, fair and evenhanded fashion in order to ensure that the \nboard's ultimate decision is respected by all sides.\n  Ethiopia is an ally of the United States. But that friendship could \nbe strained by failure of the Ethiopian Government to observe \ninternational norms in its elections, failure by the Government to \nabide by the rule of law or failure by opposition groups to avoid \noverheated rhetoric. As chairman of the State/Foreign Operations \nsubcommittee, I will be keeping a close eye on events in Ethiopia as \nthey continue to unfold.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/13/senate-section/article/S8205-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n.\n\n\n                          CLERGY SEXUAL ABUSE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Rick Santorum owes an immediate apology \nto the tragic and long-suffering victims of sexual abuse and their \nfamilies in Boston, Massachusetts, in Pennsylvania, and around the \ncountry. His outrageous and offensive comments which he had the \nindecency to repeat yesterday blamed the people of Boston for the \ndepraved behavior of sick individuals who stole the innocence of \nchildren in the most horrible way imaginable.\n  Senator Santorum has shown a deep and callous insensitivity to the \nvictims and their suffering in an apparent attempt to score political \npoints with some of the most extreme members of the fringe rightwing of \nhis party. Boston bashing might be in vogue with some Republicans, but \nRick Santorum's statements are beyond the pale.\n  Three years ago, Senator Santorum said:\n\n       While it is no excuse for this scandal, it is no surprise \n     that Boston, a seat of academic, political and cultural \n     liberalism in America, lies at the center of the storm.\n\n  When given an opportunity yesterday to apologize, he refused and \ninstead restated these outrageous statements. The people of Boston are \nto be blamed for the clergy sexual abuse? That is an irresponsible, \ninsensitive, and inexcusable thing to say. Rick Santorum should join \nall Americans in celebrating the accomplishments of the people of \nBoston. Apparently Senator Santorum has never heard of the enormous \ncontributions of our universities and industries to our quality of \nlife, our economic strength, and our national security.\n  Harvard and MIT have produced 98 Nobel laureates whose work has made \nan enormous difference in America's strength. Their graduates \ncontribute to industries, Government, their communities, our Nation, \nand throughout the world. In fact, only a quarter of MIT graduates \nremain in New England. Their research keeps our Nation secure.\n  The Pentagon and the CIA, the military, the Energy Department, the \nVeterans Administration--all turn to MIT and Harvard for technology and \nstrategies to protect our Nation from those who would hurt us, and \ntheir research in cancer, children's health, housing, community \ndevelopment, so many other issues, continues to make an enormous \ndifference to the well-being and the health of our children and \nfamilies.\n  More than a dozen current U.S. Senators were educated in Boston.\n  Senator Frist was trained as a heart surgeon at Harvard Medical \nSchool. Senator Dole went to Harvard Law School. Senator Alexander went \nto Harvard's School of Government. Surely my memorable colleagues would \nnot go to a school that is somehow contributing to the downfall of \nAmerica. No, Mr. President, they went to a worldwide leading \ninstitution to prepare them for incredible careers of service and \nleadership.\n  Senator Santorum's self-righteousness also fails to take into account \nthe enormous amount of good will the people of Boston demonstrate for \nthe less fortunate. They started the Massachusetts Children's Hunger \nInitiative, working with leaders in 20 low-income communities to end \nhunger among children.\n  Boston's Children's Hospital has been ranked first in the Nation in \nthe past decade for care and concern of sick children.\n  The quality of life for Boston and its families is rated third in \nAmerica. Massachusetts has the lowest divorce rate in the Nation.\n  Massachusetts ranks in the top 10 States in the Nation when it comes \nto addressing the needs of at-risk or vulnerable children, including \nour efforts to address low birth weight babies, teen homicides and \nother challenges to our children. Pennsylvania doesn't even rank in the \ntop 10.\n  Boston gave birth to America's liberty, and the values that sparked \nour revolution continue to inspire Bostonians today--love of freedom, \ndedication to country, and concern for our fellow citizens.\n  The men and women of Boston have served honorably in our Armed \nForces. They fought and died for our country so that their children \nmight live in freedom and opportunity.\n  The abuse of children is a horrible perversion and a tragic crime, \nand I am proud that the good people of Boston and Massachusetts were \nleaders in coming forward, shedding light, and demanding accountability \nfor this devastating violation of children.\n  Sadly, the sexual abuse of children is a problem throughout the \nworld, and it is not confined in any way to members of the clergy or to \none town or one city. Every State in the country has reported child \nsexual abuse, including Pennsylvania.\n  On behalf of all the victims of abuse and the people of Boston and \nMassachusetts, I ask that he retract his unfounded statements and \napologize. I think the families of Massachusetts were hurt just as much \nby this terrible tragedy as the families of Pennsylvania. Abuse against \nchildren is not a liberal or conservative issue. It is a horrific, \nunspeakable tragedy. Sadly, it happens in every State of this great \nNation--in red States and blue States, in the North and South, in big \ncities and in small. The victims of child sexual abuse have suffered \nenough already, and Senator Santorum should stop making a bad and very \ntragic situation worse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/13/senate-section/article/S8205-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8205-S8206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n.\n\n\n             JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY OF SUPREME COURT NOMINEES\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, President Bush and Members of the Senate \nwill soon have the duty of appointing a new justice to the Supreme \nCourt. In recent days, there have been differences of opinion over \nwhether we should consider the judicial philosophy of nominees to the \nSupreme Court as part of the appointment process. I hope the \nPresident's remarks yesterday make clear once and for all that judicial \nphilosophy is an important part of a nominee's qualifications. \nPresident Bush said that judicial philosophy would be one of the \ncriteria he used to choose a nominee, along with character, integrity, \nand the ability to do the job.\n  I agree with President Bush that these qualities--including judicial \nphilosophy--are important to whether a nominee is fit to serve on the \nCourt. Many times in recent months, and during his campaign for re-\nelection, President Bush has said that nominees to the Federal courts \nmust interpret the law, not make the law. He has said that we should \nappoint persons who would not try to legislate from the bench. This \nview has been echoed by Members of the Senate, both Republican and \nDemocrat, myself included. Senators of both parties agree with the \nPresident that we should not appoint judicial activists who would \ndecide cases based on personal ideology rather than the law.\n  The only way to know whether nominees have an activist judicial \nphilosophy is to find out what their judicial philosophy is. That's the \nonly way to know whether nominees will follow the law or attempt to \nrewrite it. We certainly can't tell judicial philosophy from nominees' \nresumes, where they went to school, or where they worked. These issues \nare relevant and should be considered as part of a nominee's \nqualifications for the Supreme Court. But a resume is no substitute for \nanswering questions about whether the nominee respects the basic rights \nand freedoms on which the nation was founded.\n  The American people deserve to know if a nominee would favor \ncorporate or other special interests, rather than giving everyone the \nsame fair hearing in deciding cases. They deserve\n\n[[Page S8206]]\n\nto know whether nominees would respect the Constitutional power of \nCongress to enact environmental protections or if nominees are so \nopposed to such protections that they would bend or distort the law to \nstrike them down.\n  The American people deserve to know whether nominees would roll back \ncivil rights laws or uphold the rights of the disabled, the elderly, \nand minorities. The American people are entitled to know if a nominee \nrespects women's rights to equal treatment in our society and to \nprivacy in making reproductive decisions.\n  This does not mean every nominee should promise to rule a particular \nway in each of the cases on the Supreme Court's docket for the next \nterm. It doesn't mean that nominees must state how they would rule in \nany specific case. But it does mean that the Senate should expect the \nnominee to answer questions about important legal principles--such as \nthe constitutional power of Congress to protect Americans against \ncorporate abuses, the right to equal treatment, Americans' right to \nprivacy in making personal decisions about medical care, the principle \nof non-discrimination, and the right to be free from unwarranted \ngovernment intrusion.\n  The American people deserve to know the answers to those questions, \nand the Senate's review is the only way that they can get those \nanswers. The nominee will need to say more than ``trust me'' in \nresponse to these important questions, because so much hangs in the \nbalance.\n  The importance of judicial philosophy in deciding whether to confirm \na Supreme Court justice is nothing new. During the first 100 years \nafter ratification of the Constitution, 21 of 81 Supreme Court \nnominations--one out of four--were rejected, withdrawn, or not acted \non.\n  Since 1968, a third of all Supreme Court nominations have failed. \nDuring these confirmation debates, ideology often mattered. John \nRutledge, nominated by George Washington, failed to win confirmation as \nChief Justice in 1795, when Alexander Hamilton and other Federalists \nopposed him because of his position on the Jay Treaty.\n  In 1811, James Madison's nominee, Alexander Wolcott, was defeated \nbecause of his enforcement of the embargo and other trade laws opposed \nby Federalists in the Senate.\n  A nominee of President Polk was rejected because of his anti-\nimmigration position. A nominee of President Hoover was not confirmed \nbecause of his anti-labor view. The Senate failed to elevate Justice \nAbe Fortas to Chief Justice in 1968, when Senate Republicans \nfilibustered his nomination because they objected to his decisions on \nfree speech and defendants' rights.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist himself has stated that it is appropriate for \nthe Senate to ask about a Supreme Court nominee's judicial philosophy, \nstating that this ``has always seemed . . . entirely consistent with \nour [C]onstitution and serves as a way of reconciling judicial \nindependence with majority rule.''\n  As our colleague from Mississippi, Senator Trent Lott, stated in \n1996, ``[w]e should look not only at their education, background, and \nqualifications, but also . . . what is their philosophy with regard to \nthe judiciary and how they may be ruling.'' In Senator Lott's words, \n``if we do not ask questions, then we will be shirking our \nresponsibilities.''\n  Earlier this month, the Senator from Texas, Senator Cornyn, stated \nthat while nominees should not be asked to promise how they will vote \nin a specific case, ``it's an appropriate question to ask what their \nviews are on cases that have been decided and judicial opinions that \nhave been written.''\n  We should all agree that it's appropriate for the Senate to ask \nnominees about the issues most important to Americans. The American \npeople expect and deserve to learn about a nominee's legal philosophy \nduring the hearings on any Supreme Court nominee. We should do all we \ncan to see that the process provides clear answers, so that the \nAmerican people will have full confidence in the outcome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/13/senate-section/article/S8206-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n.\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n            In Honor Of Private First Class Eric Paul Woods\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor PFC Eric \nPaul Woods of Omaha, NE.\n  Private First Class Woods served his country with the utmost bravery. \nA graduate of Urbandale High School in Urbandale, IA, Woods moved to \nOmaha 5 years ago, joining the Army in April 2004 as a medic with the G \nTroop, 2nd Squadron of the 3rd Army Cavalry. He was based out of Fort \nCarson, CO. Seven years earlier, Private First Class Woods met his wife \nJamie, also of the Des Moines area. The two were wed a year later on \ntheir first anniversary as a couple. On March 8, 2005, Private First \nClass Woods was deployed for his first tour in Iraq.\n  On July 9, 2005, Private First Class Woods was killed in action while \nserving courageously in Iraq. While bravely attempting to save the life \nof a wounded soldier near Tal Afar, Iraq, he sustained fatal wounds as \nan improvised explosive device detonated near the side of the road. His \ncourage should be an example to all, as days before he turned down an \noffer to be moved away from the front lines. His dedication to both his \nfellow soldiers and his country clearly display both his valor and \nresolve.\n  Private First Class Woods is survived by his wife Jamie and his 3-\nyear old son Eric Scott, among numerous other friends, family, and \ncountrymen who proudly honor and remember his sacrifice. I would like \nto offer my sincere thoughts and prayers to Private First Class Woods' \nfamily. His selfless commitment to his country will not be forgotten. \nPrivate First Class Woods will be remembered as a man who honored, \nserved, and died for the liberties and freedoms of all Americans and \nNebraskans.\n\n\n                 PETTY OFFICER 2ND CLASS DANNY P. DIETZ\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate an \noutstanding Coloradan who made the ultimate sacrifice for all of us: \nNavy Petty Officer 2nd Class Danny Philip Dietz, Jr.\n  Petty Officer Dietz was a native of Littleton, CO, and was a member \nof the Navy's elite fighting force, the SEALs. He was killed in \nAfghanistan after an unsuccessful rescue attempt. He was just 25 years \nold about to embark on his fifth year of service to our Nation.\n  Petty Officer Dietz, D.J. to his friends and family, joined the Navy \nin 1999 after graduating Heritage High School where he played football. \nServing his country as a Navy SEAL was Petty Officer Dietz's dream. He \nspent his spare time in high school swimming and building his strength \nto make him a better candidate for this elite program. He spent years \nin training to become part of a specialized SEAL reconnaissance team.\n  In doing so, Danny Dietz took his first step toward becoming a hero \nfor America.\n  When Petty Officer Dietz left for his most recent deployment in April \nout of Virginia Beach, just a few hours from where we are tonight, he \ntold his wife that he was going to do something special for his Nation. \nHe did for all of us, including one of his fellow soldiers who was \nrescued from those Afghan mountains, where Petty Officer Dietz was lost \nto us.\n  Matthew 5:9 teaches us, ``Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall \nbe called sons of God.'' Petty Officer Dietz brave actions overseas are \nthe kind of heroism of which you should be extraordinarily proud and to \nwhich all aspire. Petty Officer Dietz's service to the people of the \nUnited States is a gift for which we are all profoundly grateful and \nwill never forget.\n  Petty Officer 2nd Class Danny Philip Dietz, Jr. served this Nation \nwith extraordinary courage, honor and distinction in fighting for our \nfreedom and liberties. To his wife Maria and his entire family, I can \nonly offer my deepest condolences at your loss. The thoughts and \nprayers of an entire Nation are with you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/13/senate-section/article/S8206-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8206-S8207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n.\n\n\n                    MR. GENE MAY, A BUILDER OF HOMES\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it is commonly said that a man is known by \nhis work. For half of a century, Mr. Gene May of McLean, VA, was known \nby the fine homes he built in the Washington area.\n  Mr. May, who died recently of lung cancer, was a builder and a \ndeveloper, who made an important and lasting impact on this busy, ever-\ngrowing, and highly transient region. He was a good\n\n[[Page S8207]]\n\nman, who touched people with his hard work, his dedication to his \nprofession, and the extra care that he put into the structures that he \nbuilt.\n  Gene May did not merely build houses; he built homes, and he built \nmore than a thousand of them starting with his first, in 1947. He put a \npart of himself into each of his endeavors, into each of the homes he \nbuilt; and as a result, the homes he built reflect his values. Years \nafter he retired, according to the Washington Post, people were still \nwriting to him, praising him for the sturdiness of the homes he had \nbuilt for them, and thanking him for his superb work.\n  Yet, according to his daughter, his work was not the most important \nthing in his life. It wasn't even second. His daughter explained that \n``the most important thing in his life was his family, followed by his \nchurch. And he viewed his work as a way to serve both.''\n  What a wonderful way to regard one's work. What a contribution all of \nus could make to our families, our society, and ourselves with such an \noutlook on life, that our work is a way to serve our family and our \nCreator.\n\n  Gene May's philosophy served as an underpinning for a rewarding life. \nHe put family first, and what a wonderful family he had. He was married \nto his loving wife, Barbara May, for 58 years. They had two children \nand five grandchildren.\n  Gene May faithfully served his church. I knew Gene May. He built the \nhouse in which I now live. He was a charter member, treasurer, and one \nof the first deacons of the Church of Christ of Falls church. He \nsupervised the building of two of the church's facilities, and actively \nparticipated in the church's mission. In addition, he helped to \nestablish, then served as president of, a christian youth summer camp \nin Virginia's blue ridge mountains.\n  Gene May's community involvement extended well beyond his church \nactivities. For example, he was a member of the school board, a board \nmember of the Arlington Trust Bank, and a founder of the Northeastern \nJunior College in Villanova, PA.\n  When Mr. May learned that he had terminal cancer a little more than a \nyear ago, he reacted to the news with the calmness and level-headedness \nthat had characterized his life.\n  He taught his wife how to handle the family finances, even budgeting \nthe money for his funeral expenses. He then signed up for hospice care, \nso that he would not be a burden to his family; and, he began to \nprepare himself for the afterlife. How about that? He began to prepare \nhimself for the afterlife. Gene May succumbed to the dreaded disease on \nMay 4 of this year.\n\n  This good man, this good neighbor, this good citizen will be missed \nby his family, his community, and his legion of friends. But through \nthe homes he built for more than a thousand people, the memories of his \nlife and work will live for years and years to come. He was a builder.\n  Gene May was a builder in the best and truest meaning of the word.\n\n     I saw them tearing a building down,\n     A group of men in a busy town.\n\n     With a ``ho, heave, ho'' and a lusty yell\n     They swung a beam and the sidewall fell.\n\n     I said to the foreman, ``Are these men skilled?\n     The type you would hire if you had to build?''\n\n     He laughed, and then he said, ``no indeed,\n     Just common labor is all I need;\n     I can easily wreck in a day or two,\n     That which takes builders years to do.\n\n     I said to myself as I walked away,\n     ``Which of these roles am I trying to play?\n     Am I a builder who works with care,\n     Building my life by the rule and square?\n     Am I shaping my deeds by a well-laid plan,\n     Patiently building the best I can?\n     Or am I a fellow who walks the town,\n     Content with the labor of tearing down?''\n\n  My wife Erma, and I extend our deepest condolences to Mr. May's wife, \nBarbara, and their children, and grandchildren.\n  May his ashes rest in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/13/senate-section/article/S8207-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n.\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the foreign \nlanguage needs of the country, a problem that is receiving renewed \npublic attention because of the ongoing war in Iraq and the impact the \nlack of language expertise is having on our foreign policy. As John \nLimbert, president of the American Foreign Service Association, was \nquoted in the Federal Times last month, the shortage of linguists \n``makes our mission of representing the American people that much \nharder.''\n  Frankly, I agree with Mr. Limbert. The stability and economic \nvitality of the United States and our national security depend on \nAmerican citizens who are knowledgeable about the world. We need civil \nservants, area experts, diplomats, business people, educators, and \nother public officials with the ability to communicate at an advanced \nlevel in the languages and understand the cultures of the people with \nwhom they interact. An ongoing commitment to maintaining these \nrelationships and language expertise helps prevent a crisis from \noccurring and provides diplomatic and language resources when needed.\n  My own State of Hawaii is a leader in promoting language education \nand cultural sensitivity. As a gateway to Asian and Pacific nations, we \nin Hawaii understand the importance of knowing other languages and \ncultures, which help to develop strong relationships with other people. \nFor example, according to the 2000 Census, more than 300,000 people in \nHawaii, or about 27 percent of those 5 years and older, spoke a \nlanguage other than English at home. This is compared to about 18 \npercent nationwide. In addition, the University of Hawaii is a leader \nin teaching Korean and is the host of one of two National Korean \nFlagship Programs established by the National Security Education \nProgram. Hawaii is also host to the internationally recognized East-\nWest Center, an education and research organization established in \nHawaii by Congress in 1960, which is a leader in promoting and \nstrengthening relations between the United States and the countries of \nthe Asia Pacific region.\n  In 2000 the Senate Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International \nSecurity, Proliferation, and Federal Services, then chaired by Senator \nCochran, held a hearing on the foreign language needs of the Federal \nGovernment. At that hearing Ellen Laipson,\n\n[[Page S8208]]\n\nvice chairman of the National Intelligence Council, testified as to the \nlanguage shortfalls in the intelligence community and how these \nshortfalls could impact agency missions, especially in emergency \nsituations. For example, a lack of language skills limits analysts' \ninsight into a foreign culture which restricts their ability to \nanticipate political instability and warn policymakers about a \npotential trouble spot. In addition, Ms. Laipson testified that \nthousands of technical papers providing details on foreign research and \ndevelopment in scientific or technical areas were not being translated \nbecause of the lack of personnel to interpret the material, which could \nlead to the possibility of ``a technological surprise.''\n  Understanding the importance of improving our language capabilities, \nI introduced with Senators Durbin and Thompson the Homeland Security \nEducation Act and the Homeland Security Federal Workforce Act. Our \nbills proposed a comprehensive strategy to improve language education, \nas well as science and math education, at the elementary, high school, \nand college levels and to provide incentives for individuals possessing \nsuch skills as a result of these programs to enter Federal service in \ncritical national security positions. The Senate passed the Homeland \nSecurity Federal Workforce Act on November 5, 2003, and provisions of \nthe bill were included in the Intelligence Reform Act of 2004. In \naddition, I successfully added an amendment to the Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2005 requiring the Department of \nDefense to report on how it will address its language shortfalls in \nboth the short and long term. Earlier this year, the Department issued \nits Defense Language Transformation Roadmap which lays out an ambitious \nplan for improving the language education of its employees.\n  While Congress has adopted several provisions to improve language \neducation, including some that I have proposed, it has not been easy to \ngain a wider acceptance of this need. It has been said that the events \nof September 11, 2001, were a modern day Sputnik moment, demonstrating \nthat shortages of critical skills can have dire national security \nconsequences. While Sputnik pointed out the importance of science and \nmath education, September 11th reminded us that language skills and \ncultural awareness are essential for improving relations with the \ninternational community and strengthening our national security. \nHowever, nearly 4 years after that terrible day, we are still without \nsufficient language skills. We still have not learned the lesson that \nthe Soviet launch of Sputnik taught us in 1958: investment in education \nis just as important to our national security as investing in weapons \nsystems. As such, we need sustained leadership and a coordinated plan \nof action to address this on-going problem and to ensure that this \nNation never falls short in its language capabilities again or fails to \ncommunicate effectively with our neighbors around the world.\n  That is why I have introduced the National Foreign Language \nCoordination Act with Senators Dodd and Cochran. Our legislation, S. \n1089, is designed to provide the needed leadership and coordination of \nlanguage education. Primarily, the legislation creates a National \nForeign Language Coordination Council which is composed of the \nsecretaries of various executive branch agencies and chaired by a \nnational language director. The national language director would be \nappointed by the President and is to be a nationally recognized \nindividual with credentials and abilities necessary to create and \nimplement long-term solutions to achieving national foreign language \nand cultural competency. By having the key players of the executive \nbranch on the Council, I hope that each agency will come away with an \nunderstanding of what their role is, how they can reach out to their \nstakeholders for input, and become engaged in addressing this problem.\n  The Council would be charged with developing and overseeing the \nimplementation of a national language strategy. In particular, the \nCouncil would identify priorities, increase public awareness, advocate \nneeded resources, and coordinate efforts within the Federal Government \nto ensure that we are meeting our goal of improved language education \nand cultural understanding. As former Senator and 9/11 Commissioner Bob \nKerrey recently said, ``Someone in the executive branch has got to say, \n`Here's where we are today, here's where we want to be in five years, \nand here's what it's going to take to get there.' '' The National \nForeign Language Coordination Act will do just that.\n  There have been several articles issued recently that have \nhighlighted the need for more language training and the need for \nleadership in this area. I ask that the following articles be printed \nin the Record:\n  Tichakorn Hill, Does Anyone Here Speak Arabic? ( or Farsi, or \nPashto?) The Government's Push to Close the Language Gap, Federal \nTimes, June 20, 2005. John Diamond, Terror War Still Short on \nLinguists, USA Today, June 20, 2005. John Diamond, Muslim World Isn't \nBig with U.S. Students, USA Today, June 19, 2005.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From USA Today, Jun. 20, 2005]\n\nMuslim World Isn't Big With U.S. Students\n\n                           (By John Diamond)\n\n       Washington--Despite an expansion of federal efforts to \n     promote learning Arabic and other languages of the Islamic \n     world, there has been no dramatic increase in Americans \n     studying in countries where such languages are spoken, \n     according to the latest statistics on overseas study. That's \n     the case even though the number of Americans studying abroad \n     has more than doubled since the mid-1990s.\n       There are some signs of growing interest among American \n     students in learning Arabic, which the U.S. intelligence \n     community hopes will help bolster its ranks with specialists \n     for the war on terrorism.\n       But as Karin Ryding, a professor of Arabic at Georgetown \n     University, points out, U.S. intelligence can't get by with \n     ``hothouse'' Arabic speakers who have learned the language \n     sitting in American classrooms. They must travel to the \n     region and immerse themselves to become fluent.\n       Overall interest in foreign languages hasn't surged either \n     since the Sept. 11 attacks. The difficulty of learning Arabic \n     and other Middle East languages means it will be years before \n     academia can produce significantly more graduates fluent in \n     languages important to U.S. national security.\n       ``It's going to take a good, long while. It's going to be a \n     lot more expensive. And it's a question of whether you can \n     afford to wait,'' says Andrew Krepinevich, head of the Center \n     for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a Washington-based \n     defense think tank.\n       Numbers aren't good\n       For 2002-03, the first full academic year after 9/11, 1,293 \n     Americans studied in predominantly Muslim countries in \n     Africa, the Middle East and Asia. That's a 4.5% increase over \n     the yearly average of 1,237 for the five years leading up to \n     Sept. 11, according to an analysis of figures compiled by the \n     Institute of International Education, which administers \n     several federal study-abroad scholarship programs. The \n     figures cover students who financed their own education as \n     well as those who received private and public scholarships.\n       The list of majority-Muslim countries in which students \n     studied is not identical from year to year but typically \n     includes countries in the Middle East and North Africa such \n     as Senegal, Morocco, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait, \n     Lebanon and Turkey; and nations in Asia such as Pakistan, \n     Indonesia and Malaysia.\n       The institute's figures show that more Americans are \n     studying abroad: 174,629 in 2002-03, up from 84,403 in 1994-\n     95. Yet fewer are focusing on foreign languages: Two decades \n     ago, 16.7% of Americans studying abroad listed foreign \n     languages as their primary field of study, according to the \n     institute's figures. A decade ago, it was down to 11.3%; for \n     2002-03, 7.9%.\n       ``Despite our growing needs, the number of undergraduate \n     foreign language degrees conferred is only 1% of all \n     degrees,'' Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., said last month. Dodd is \n     sponsoring legislation that would increase federal spending \n     on language and foreign study and create a ``national \n     language director'' to coordinate language programs.\n       The stakes are high, according to a January Pentagon \n     report: ``Conflict against enemies speaking less-commonly \n     taught languages and thus the need for foreign language \n     capability will not abate.''\n       Language ability is critical not just for fighting wars or \n     spying, says Thomas Farrell, deputy assistant secretary of \n     State for academic programs. It also means having a better \n     knowledge of ``regions of the world that are important to the \n     United States,'' Farrell says. ``We're seeking to \n     demonstrate, especially to countries with Islamic \n     populations, that people in the United States have respect \n     for their societies and want to learn about them.''\n       Uptick in Arabic studies\n       For years, U.S. students didn't learn much about Arabic. In \n     2002, the latest nationwide figures available, 10,584 \n     students were studying Arabic, whether as a major or an \n     elective. That was a 92% increase from 1998 but\n\n[[Page S8209]]\n\n     still amounted to fewer than 1% of all students enrolled in \n     foreign language courses in 2002, according to a report by \n     the Association of Departments of Foreign Languages.\n       The Department of Education is spending about $10 million \n     this year for language study centers based in the Middle \n     East, U.S. language development centers and scholarships for \n     study abroad. The Pentagon is spending $3.6 million for \n     Middle East language scholarships and other language \n     programs. Some of the money is tied to promises that students \n     will commit to jobs in national security.\n       The State Department handles the bulk of federal money for \n     language scholarships through its Fulbright programs for \n     undergraduates and scholars. Last year, the department spent \n     $86 million on Fulbright and other programs out of a total \n     education and cultural exchange budget of $231 million. Not \n     all of that $86 million was focused on Muslim countries, \n     however.\n       Concerned that no one coordinates the federal programs, a \n     group of senators--including Dodd, Thad Cochran, R-Miss., and \n     Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii--wants to start a National Foreign \n     Language Coordination Council.\n       For now, U.S. military and intelligence agencies compete \n     with one another for a small pool of qualified candidates. \n     Arabic professor John Walbridge of the University of Indiana \n     is worried about the push to fill hiring quotas.\n       ``They're desperate for people,'' Walbridge says. ``They're \n     recruiting people who by no reasonable standard are ready to \n     do intelligence work using Arabic.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From USA Today, June 20, 2005]\n\n                  Terror War Still Short on Linguists\n\n                           (By John Diamond)\n\n       Washington.--Nearly four years after the Sept. 11 attacks, \n     the federal government has created a profusion of programs to \n     train students in languages and cultures important in the war \n     on terrorism. But government leaders and language experts say \n     the effort is an uncoordinated jumble too slow to produce \n     measurable results.\n       ``We're not there, and we're not moving fast enough,'' says \n     Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., chairman of the House \n     Intelligence Committee.\n       Since 9/11, Congress and the White House have pumped money \n     into new and existing programs for training in Arabic and \n     other Middle Eastern languages and cultures. Annual spending \n     has jumped from about $41 million in 2001 to $100 million \n     today. While the funding and programs have grown, the results \n     are, so far, insufficient, according to Sen. Chris Dodd, D-\n     Conn. The government needs to hire 34,000 foreign-language \n     specialists, particularly Arabic speakers, for homeland \n     security, defense and intelligence agencies, he says.\n       The effort to produce more speakers of Arabic and other \n     languages of the Islamic world is needed because many \n     Americans fluent in these languages have difficulty getting \n     security clearances if they have relatives in the region. \n     Producing a ``homegrown'' speaker of Arabic, with its \n     different alphabet and many dialects, can take 10 years, says \n     professor John Walbridge of the University of Indiana, ``if \n     you apply yourself.''\n       No government agency coordinates this effort, and there are \n     no readily available statistics on how many students get \n     federal money intended to produce more speakers of Arabic, \n     Urdu and other strategic languages and more experts on the \n     Islamic world.\n       Based on public records and interviews with relevant \n     officials, about $9.5 million in federal money goes to \n     programs designed specifically to produce job candidates for \n     U.S. intelligence and other national security agencies. Only \n     about 40% of that total, roughly $3.8 million, is focused on \n     the Middle East.\n       The number of students in these programs--named for current \n     and former chairmen of the Senate Intelligence Committee--is \n     modest: 150 in the Pat Roberts Intelligence Scholars Program \n     and 230 in the David Boren Scholarship program. About one-\n     third of the students focus on Middle Eastern languages.\n       ``Someone in the executive branch has got to say, Here's \n     where we are today, here's where we want to be in five years, \n     and here's what it's going to take to get there,'' ' says Bob \n     Kerrey, a Democrat who served on the federal commission that \n     investigated 9/11. That panel pointed out last year that only \n     six students received undergraduate degrees in Arabic in \n     2002.\n       Walbridge and other Arabic scholars agree that living in \n     the Middle East is essential to becoming fluent. But the \n     number of Americans studying in predominantly Muslim \n     countries has remained about the same as pre-Sept. 11 levels. \n     In 2002-03, the most recent year for which figures are \n     available, fewer than 1,300 Americans were studying in Muslim \n     countries, or less than 1% of the Americans studying abroad.\n       ``As a nation, we just don't have any sort of organized \n     language policy, and it shows,'' says Kirk Belnap, director \n     of a federally funded National Middle Eat Language Resource \n     Center at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Federal Times, June 20, 2005]\n\n     Does Anyone Here Speak Arabic? Or Farsi, or Pashto . . . The \n              Government's Push To Close the Language Gap\n\n                          (By Tichakorn Hill)\n\n       When a congressman asked David Kay, the former head of the \n     U.S. team searching for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, \n     how many on his 1,400-person team spoke Arabic and understood \n     the technology of weapons of mass destruction, the answer was \n     discouraging.\n       ``I could count on the fingers of one hand,'' Rep. Rush \n     Holt, D-N.J., recalled Kay as saying about a year ago.\n       Similarly, Holt asked special forces who were combing \n     through Afghan mountain ranges for Osama bin Laden how many \n     of them spoke the local language of Pashto. They said they \n     picked up a little while they were there.\n       ``If Osama bin Laden is truly American public enemy No. 1, \n     how do we expect to track him down if we cannot speak the \n     languages of the people who are hiding him?'' Holt said.\n       Whether it is military troops, intelligence analysts, \n     translators, interpreters, or just federal employees \n     delivering services to an increasingly diverse American \n     population, there is a troubling shortage of people with \n     foreign language skills. And the shortage is most critical in \n     Middle Eastern and South Asian languages: Arabic; Pashto; \n     Dari, which is spoken in Afghanistan; Farsi, spoken in Iran; \n     Kurdish, spoken in Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Armenia and Syria; and \n     Urdu, spoken in India and Pakistan.\n       The consequences, say experts, are disturbing. The problem \n     threatens government efforts to keep the peace and rebuild \n     infrastructure in Iraq, translate foreign documents and \n     interpret foreign conversations that could prove to be \n     valuable intelligence, explain U.S. policies to foreign \n     populations, investigate terrorists, and track down illegal \n     aliens.\n       The shortage of linguists ``makes our mission of \n     representing the American people that much harder,'' said \n     John Limbert, president of the American Foreign Service \n     Association and a former ambassador to Mauritania. ``Most of \n     that mission involves communication--speaking and listening \n     to what others are telling us. I don't see how we can do that \n     without knowing the language of those with whom we are \n     communicating.''\n       The Defense and State departments, intelligence agencies, \n     the FBI and many other agencies were suffering severe \n     shortages of linguists even before 9/11. The FBI, for \n     example, complained to Congress in 2000 that it had large \n     stockpiles of audio tapes and documents awaiting translation. \n     The Defense Department didn't have a single Dari-speaking \n     employee. And it had only one Marine and one sailor who spoke \n     Pashto.\n       Kevin Hendzel, a spokesman for the American Translators \n     Association, estimates it will take intelligence agencies \n     between 10 and 15 years to catch up in translating tons of \n     materials recovered from Iraq and Afghanistan. ``As a \n     society, we pay a huge price for not being competent in \n     foreign languages. This is particularly true in the national \n     security area where the people who want to do us harm do not \n     speak English,'' he said.\n       Federal agencies are expected to hire more than 10,000 \n     contract and staff linguists this year.\n       But while hiring of linguists since 9/11 has exploded, it \n     still hasn't kept pace with the government's needs--\n     especially for people who know Arabic and South Asian \n     languages.\n       The problem\n       Federal managers blame the American education system.\n       According to the National Center for Education Statistics, \n     out of 2 million college graduates in 2004, only 17 earned \n     bachelor's or advanced degrees in Arabic. Only 206 earned \n     degrees in Chinese, the world's most popular language.\n       ``Academia is not producing enough of the right kind of \n     linguists fast enough,'' said an FBI official. ``And we \n     simply cannot wait for the education system to catch up.''\n       But the government is trying to kick-start the system. Last \n     year the Defense Department began awarding grants to \n     universities for foreign language studies in Chinese, Arabic, \n     Korean and Russian.\n       And in Congress, Holt introduced this year the National \n     Security Language Act, which would subsidize colleges and \n     universities that teach critical languages and offer \n     intensive study programs overseas. The bill, which has 43 \n     cosponsors, also would repay student loans for those who \n     study critical foreign languages and then work for federal \n     agencies or as elementary or secondary school language \n     teachers.\n       The recruiting challenge\n       In their rush to recruit people with hard-to-find language \n     skills, agency managers are trying a variety of tactics.\n       They hold job fairs in minority communities, such as Arabic \n     communities in California and Michigan. They advertise in \n     foreign-language newspapers, offer thousands of dollars in \n     sign-up bonuses, and recruit at colleges and universities \n     where needed languages are taught.\n       But there are a lot of factors working against them. One is \n     stiff competition for a limited pool of candidates.\n       ``We're always in competition with other federal agencies \n     and the private sector for that talent,'' said Reginald \n     Wells, deputy commissioner for human resources at the Social \n     Security Administration.\n       Many candidates are foreign-born and foreign-educated, \n     which presents another challenge for agencies trying to \n     verify their credentials.\n       And as if finding people who speak difficult languages is \n     not difficult enough, finding\n\n[[Page S8210]]\n\n     people who know those languages at a professional or \n     technical level is even harder.\n       ``Many of our assignments are highly technical and they \n     [native speakers] simply do not have vocabulary to move \n     between the two languages. That's where our challenges lie,'' \n     said Brenda Spraque, the director of Office of Language \n     Services at the State Department.\n       Not all candidates who meet the grade want to work for, \n     say, the Foreign Service and be posted far from their \n     families, said Nancy Serpa, former director of the Human \n     Resources for Recruitment, Examination and Employment at the \n     State Department.\n       ``The Foreign Service is not a career for everyone, and \n     finding people who want to spend their career overseas away \n     from their family is very difficult to begin with, even \n     though we have a lot of people who take the Foreign Service \n     test,'' Serpa said.\n       National Security Agency managers find that many candidates \n     are reluctant to move even to the agency's Maryland \n     headquarters.\n       ``We may be successful in attracting people to the type of \n     work we do and the opportunities and possibilities we have \n     available, but we're not always successful in encouraging \n     them to move to Columbia or Baltimore,'' said John Taflan, \n     NSA human resources director.\n       Getting new employees a security clearance is another \n     hurdle.\n       ``We require, for all our full-time positions and even some \n     of our contract positions, that people have the ability to \n     obtain a security clearance, and that's become extremely \n     difficult for those who are naturalized American citizens,'' \n     Spraque said. ``That limits your pool to a large extent.''\n       Hiring binge.\n       Despite the recruiting challenges, agencies have been \n     hiring.\n       Since 9/11, the FBI has hired nearly 1,000 linguists and \n     plans to hire 274 more next fiscal year. Currently it has \n     nearly 1,400 contract and full-time linguists who speak 100 \n     languages. Ninety-five of those linguists are native speakers \n     of their languages. The bureau increased its linguists by 69 \n     percent and the number of those in critical languages, such \n     as Arabic, increasing by 200 percent.\n       The State Department this year is hiring nearly 400 Foreign \n     Service generalists, many of whom will get training to speak \n     another language. It's also hiring translators and \n     interpreters. Many of those new hires will staff new \n     embassies in Baghdad, Iraq, and Kabul, Afghanistan; and a new \n     liaison office in Tripoli, Libya. Currently the department \n     has about 7,000 employees speaking 60 languages working in \n     the United States and at 265 posts abroad.\n       Likewise, the National Security Agency is aggressively \n     recruiting: Currently at 35,000 employees, the agency plans \n     to hire 1,500 people every year until 2010, and many will \n     become language analysts. It offers sign-up bonuses of up to \n     20 percent of a person's salary for those who speak critical \n     languages. NSA also hires 50 to 200 bilinguals a year whom it \n     then trains to speak a third language.\n       More training.\n       The shortage of linguists prompted the Defense Department \n     to overhaul its language program. The department in April \n     unveiled a plan, called the Defense Language Transformation \n     Roadmap, to build up its foreign language skills. It includes \n     directing money to colleges and universities to teach \n     languages. Also, the department plans to invest $45 million \n     more than current levels--$195 million in fiscal 2006--in its \n     Defense Language Institute. The department also will build a \n     database of active-duty personnel, civilians, reservists and \n     retirees who speak foreign languages.\n       ``9/11 really changed our whole orientation to understand \n     that this is a major issue that's going to be with us for a \n     long time,'' said Gail McGinn, Defense deputy undersecretary \n     for plans. ``It's going to take a long time to solve it.''\n       Today, Defense has nearly 84,000 military linguists who \n     speak about 250 languages and dialects--up from 72,000 in \n     2000. The military services plan to train about 2,300 \n     linguists this year. The Air Force is the most active and \n     plans to train 1,500 military linguists this year.\n       Agencies that cannot hire or train enough people with \n     foreign language skills borrow them from other agencies or \n     contract for them.\n       Congress in 2003 also created the National Virtual \n     Translation Center, an interagency clearinghouse that lets \n     agencies share translators with each other or to seek the \n     services of translators in the private sector and academia. \n     The center also performs translation work for intelligence \n     agencies.\n       Federal contracting for people with language skills has \n     taken off since 9/11. But as demand has shot up, so have \n     labor rates.\n       Before 9/11, a linguist speaking Arabic might get paid $15 \n     or $20 an hour. Now, rates are about double that. And for \n     those with security clearances and expertise, rates are up to \n     between $70 and $80 an hour. A contract linguist working in \n     Iraq now can make $150,000 a year, Hendzel said.\n       Not all agencies are willing to pay so much, he said. Some \n     want to settle for $20 an hour and hire someone who can speak \n     a foreign language but may not be certified or have \n     experience or expertise in a particular field. By doing that, \n     Hendzel said agencies risk getting poor-quality work that \n     could undermine their missions.\n       ``Mistranslation or distortion are as dangerous as a lack \n     of translation,'' he said.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. We all understand the importance of language education and \ncultural understanding in this country; we just need to figure out how \nwe make it happen. I am confident the National Foreign Language \nCoordination Council will provide the needed leadership and \ncoordination to reach our goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/13/senate-section/article/S8210-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8210-S8211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n.\n\n\n                              U.N. REFORM\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss Coleman-Lugar \nbill that will effect meaningful and reasonable reform of the United \nNations. But before I delve into the issues of U.N. reform, I must take \na moment to thank my colleague Senator Lugar for his leadership. As the \nchairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Lugar has \nbeen at the forefront of these issues for years--working to pass \nbipartisan, consensus legislation touching a wide range of \ninternational matters. In short, Senator Lugar's leadership on the \nissue of U.N. reform has been crucial.\n  Sixteen months ago, as the chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, I initiated a bipartisan, comprehensive investigation \ninto the massive international fraud that flourished under the United \nNations Oil for Food Program. You will recall this program was created \nto help protect the poor of Iraq from the impact of international \nsanctions. Unfortunately, Saddam Hussein manipulated the program--\nsiphoning off billions of dollars in under-the-table payments--and used \nthat money to strengthen his murderous regime at home and reward \nfriends abroad. As Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice testified at her \nconfirmation hearing, Saddam Hussein was ``playing the international \ncommunity like a violin.'' It could not have been more wrong: evil \nprospered while the poor starved; the program designed to control and \noust the oppressor actually helped him stay in power and bolster his \narsenal.\n  Over the course of our 16-month investigation, the subcommittee has \nheld three hearings and released three reports on the oil-for-food \nscandal. At those hearings and in our reports, we exposed how Saddam \nabused the program--we documented how the Hussein regime rewarded \npolitical allies by granting lucrative oil allocations to foreign \nofficials, such as Russian politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky and the \nRussian Presidential Council; we presented evidence of how Saddam made \nmoney on the oil deals by demanding under-the-table surcharge payments, \nand how he generated illegal kickbacks on humanitarian contracts.\n  All of Saddam's abuses occurred under the supposedly vigilant eye of \nthe U.N. How could that happen? Well, over the course of our \ninvestigation, an avalanche of evidence has emerged demonstrating that \nthe U.N. terribly mismanaged the Oil for Food Program. That evidence \nrevealed mismanagement ranging from outright corruption to sloppy \nadministration. For instance:\n  Our subcommittee uncovered evidence that Kofi Annan's handpicked \nexecutive director of the Oil for Food Program, a man named Benon \nSevan, appears to have received lucrative oil allocations from Saddam.\n  Our subcommittee discovered evidence that a U.N. oil inspector \nreceived a large bribe to help Saddam cheat on two oil deals.\n  Fifty-eight reports written by the U.N.'s own internal auditors \nrevealed rampant mismanagement by the U.N., describing a program rife \nwith sloppy stewardship and riddled with ``overcharges,'' ``double \ncharge[s]'' and other ``unjustified'' waste of more than $100 million.\n  The U.N.'s investigators, headed by Paul Volcker, determined that the \nU.N.'s process for awarding three multimillion-dollar contracts in the \nprogram was ``tainted.''\n  The U.N.'s investigators also found that Kofi Annan failed to \nadequately investigate or remedy a serious conflict of interest--\nnamely, that the U.N. had awarded a massive contract to the company \nthat employed Annan's son.\n  Perhaps most disturbing, however, was that Kofi Annan's chief of \nstaff ordered the destruction of 3 years' worth of documents. That \norder was given the day after the U.N. decided to investigate the Oil \nfor Food Program.\n  Such gross mismanagement and corruption in the Oil for Food Program\n\n[[Page S8211]]\n\nraise serious questions about the U.N.'s ability to administer crucial \nprograms in the future. American taxpayers pay roughly 22 percent of \nthe U.N.'s operating costs. They need assurances that their tax dollars \nare well spent. This is especially true in light of the fact that the \nU.N. is playing an increasingly larger role in world affairs.\n  As a result, we must bring about meaningful and reasonable reform of \nthe U.N. Such reforms must include three elements. First is the concept \nof ``transparency.'' As Supreme Court Justice Brandeis famously stated, \n``Sunlight is the most powerful of all disinfectants.'' Today, the \nU.N.'s operations are shrouded in mystery--not a single ray of sunlight \ndisinfects the internal machinations of the U.N. The U.N. should be \ntransparent to its member states, and use those rays of sunlight to \nprevent another episode of massive mismanagement.\n  Another necessary element for U.N. reform is ``accountability.'' \nSpecifically, U.N. officials responsible for the operation and \nmanagement of programs, such as sanctions regimes and humanitarian \nefforts, must be held accountable for their performance. Such \naccountability should apply to all U.N. officials from the highest to \nthe lowest.\n  The third element necessary for U.N. reform is effective internal \noversight. Simply put, the U.N.'s internal auditor--the Office of \nInternal Oversight Services, OIOS, needs drastic improvement. The OIOS \nis woefully underfunded and lacks true independence. With respect to \nfunding, the OIOS receives $24 million per budget--a paltry pittance \nwhen compared to the $162 million allocated to U.N.'s press office. \nWithout an effective and independent auditor, the U.N.'s operations \nwill continue to be plagued with misconduct and mismanagement.\n  Those crucial elements are the cornerstones of the proposed Coleman-\nLugar bill, the United Nations, Management, Personnel, and Policy \nReform Act of 2005. The bill presents a well-balanced and constructive \nU.N. reform initiative that addresses: (1) a variety of U.N. management \nweaknesses identified by the subcommittee, a lack of transparency, \noversight, accountability, and effective budgetary and personnel \nsystems, and (2) a series of U.N. policy issues that need reform, \nincluding peacekeeping and human rights. The legislation strikes an \nappropriate balance between important goals: effecting crucial U.N. \nreforms, preserving U.N. administrative discretion, and ensuring \nlimited U.S. government monitoring and oversight.\n  Our proposed legislation underscores that an effective United Nations \nis in the interest of the United States and that the United States must \nlead the United Nations toward greater relevance and capability. The \nbill also emphasizes that the U.S. push for further reform will require \nbipartisanship and the joint involvement of the executive and \nlegislative branches so that the U.S. presents a unified position \ntoward the United Nations. The proposed legislation exhorts the U.S. to \nuse its voice, vote, and funding in the U.N. to accomplish U.N. \nmanagement, personnel, and policy reforms. It requires the President to \nsubmit an annual report on U.N. reform to ``appropriate congressional \ncommittees.'' It also authorizes the President to withhold 50 percent \nof U.S. contributions to U.N. if he determines that the U.N. is not \nmaking sufficient progress in implementing reforms described in the \nact.\n  While the proposed legislation acknowledges that the U.N. has \ninitiated some reforms, it also recognizes that the U.N. has failed to \nmake many necessary changes. The bill cites past GAO reports on U.N. \nreforms and recent U.N. reports, including the High-Level Panel Report \nand the Secretary-General's Report, on the need to expedite existing \nreforms and implement new urgently-needed reforms. It emphasizes that \nthe U.N. must transform itself to meet current and future challenges \nand undertake institutional reforms that ensure the effectiveness, \nintegrity, transparency, and accountability of the United Nations \nsystem.\n  The proposed legislation recognizes the important findings of the \nsubcommittee in its Oil for Food Program investigation identifying key \ninternal management weaknesses that led to mismanagement, fraud, and \nabuse of the program. It also cites the June 2005 Gingrich/Mitchell \nU.N. Reform Report. The majority of the U.N. management, personnel, \nbudget, and policy issues addressed in the proposed legislation are \nconsistent with many recommendations of the subcommittee and the recent \nGingrich/Mitchell report.\n  The management section of the proposed legislation stems from the \nmany U.N. management weaknesses revealed in the subcommittee's oil-for-\nfood investigation. The section strengthens the power of the Secretary-\nGeneral to replace top officials in the U.N. Secretariat and recruit \nonly the highest quality individuals, placing emphasis on professional \nexcellence over geographic diversity. It calls for an updated \nassessment of the U.N. procurement system and the establishment of a \nnew and improved procurement process that embodies the standards \ncurrently present in the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, \nwhich prohibit officials from making or receiving payments, gifts, or \nexchanging other promises to secure an improper benefit.\n  In short, this legislation will help transform the United Nations \ninto a modern and dynamic institution capable of responding to the many \ncomplex and varied challenges confronting it. The reforms embodied in \nthis legislation provide the United Nations the opportunity to embrace \nchange and regain its role as a critical institution in today's rapidly \nchanging international environment. This legislation will force the \nUnited Nations to be a better managed, transparent, and accountable \norganization. This legislation will prevent reoccurrences of scandals \nlike the Oil for Food scandal, peacekeeping abuses, and other \nmanagerial failures.\n  I must reiterate the importance of a robust and effective U.N. for \nthe future of U.S. relations with the international community. The \nU.N., when properly led and properly managed, can play an important \nrole in promoting global peace and stability. Real reform, and not mere \nrhetoric, is the proper course of action to ensure an effective U.N.--\nthe mission of the U.N. is simply too important to look the other way.\n  As I conclude my remarks, I would like to reiterate my thanks to \nChairman Lugar for his leadership on the issue of U.N. reform and for \nthe opportunity to work with him to tackle this important issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/13/senate-section/article/S8211-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8211-S8212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n.\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         RECOGNITION OF KENNETH W.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer my thanks and \nappreciation, and those of all North Carolinians, to Colonel Charles \n``Ray'' Alexander, Jr., Commander of the Army Corps of Engineers \nWilmington, NC district. Today is Colonel Alexander's last day as \ncommanding officer of the district. While we celebrate his retirement \nwith his family, we will miss the impact he has had on North Carolina \nand the Nation.\n  Colonel Alexander has distinguished himself with exceptionally \nmeritorious service as district commander since 2002. Under his \ncommand, the district continued construction of the Wilmington Harbor \ndeepening project and met the target for delivering deep water to the \nState port docks in January 2004 despite numerous fiscal challenges. \nThe Wilmington Harbor deepening is the largest civil works project in \nthe district's history and a very important navigation project, \nproviding economic benefit to the State. Additionally, the deeper \nchannel has been an asset to the local military installations in \nsupport of the global war on terror.\n  Under Colonel Alexander's direction, the district has been involved \nand successful in protecting the Nation's environment. Numerous \nenvironmental enhancement projects, including the Roanoke Island \nFestival Park aquatic habitat restoration and protection project, are \ntestament to this highly successful program.\n  This and many other projects earned the district the 2004 Coastal \nAmerica Partnership Award and North Carolina Coast Federal Pelican \nAward, the 2003 Chief of Engineers' Environmental Award for product \ndelivery team design and construction of an island estuarine habitat, \nand nomination and subsequent recognition as the North Carolina \nConservationist Partner of 2003 by the North Carolina Land Trust \nCouncil. A district project delivery team under Colonel Alexander's \ncommand also earned an environmental award from the Environmental \nProtection Agency for its work cleaning up EPA facilities in the \nResearch Triangle Park.\n  Colonel Alexander also executed a systematic plan to improve \nrelationships with local, State, and Federal entities. Locally, we \ncompleted renourishment of Kure, Carolina, and Bald Head Island Beaches \nand a project to reinstitute the use of dredged materials on Bogue \nBanks. Additionally, the district created a water management committee \nto meet the needs of over 40 agencies and many private citizens.\n  Colonel Alexander also led the efforts in 2003 to provide \nexceptionally responsive emergency management services during Hurricane \nIsabel in North Carolina, including the highly successful \nreconstruction of vital road infrastructure for the Cape Hatteras \nbreach. He also led the Wilmington effort in aiding the recovery from \nthe recordbreaking 2004 hurricane storm season.\n  I would also like to commend Colonel Alexander for his support of the \nArmy Corps outside his district and in the war on terror. His \nselflessness was exhibited by his leadership for the $84 million \nrecovery effort in 2004 after Hurricane Ivan devastated Alabama. This \nhighly complex operation included providing emergency power, ice, \nwater, housing, debris collection and reduction, roofing, and technical \nassistance to the citizens of Alabama following the storm, which made \nlandfall 700 miles from the district headquarters. Hundreds of Corps of \nEngineers employees from all over the Nation were brought in to this \nwell executed operation.\n  Colonel Alexander's leadership and commitment in the global war on \nterror is evident in his ability to motivate more than 20 team members \nto volunteer to serve abroad as members of South Atlantic Division's \nForward Engineer Support Teams, Task Force Restore Iraqi Electricity, \nthe Gulf Region Division, and the Afghanistan District. The number \ncontinues to grow and several members have served on multiple \ndeployments.\n  In closing, generations of North Carolinians who have never met \nColonel Alexander will benefit from the results of his work. At this \nspecial time in his career, I wish him all the best and thank him for a \njob well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/13/senate-section/article/S8212-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n.\n\n\n                LIEUTENANT COMMANDER ELIZABETH J.

She serves as the department head for the \ninpatient obstetrics department at the hospital. U.S. Navy Captain \nRichard C. Welton presented Commander French with a Letter of \nCommendation for her ``dedication to this Command and continual support \nof superb family centered maternal and childcare services in the \nObstetric Department sets the standard.''\n  I am proud of Elizabeth French's outstanding service and I ask \nunanimous consent that Captain Welton's Letter of Commendation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                         Letter of Commendation\n\n       The Commanding Officer, Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune takes \n     pleasure in commending Lieutenant Commander Elizabeth J. \n     French for service as set forth in the following citation: \n     Upon the occasion of her selection as the Officer of the \n     Year, Calendar Year 2004, Commander French is commended for \n     her dedicated and outstanding performance of duty while \n     serving as the Department Head, Inpatient Obstetrics \n     Department, Naval Hospita1, Marine Corps Base, Camp Lejeune, \n     North Carolina from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2004. \n     Commander French's dedication to this Command and continual \n     pursuit of superb family centered maternal and childcare \n     services in the Obstetric Department sets the standard. She \n     expertly led 70 military, civilians, and contract personnel \n     in providing quality and safe care for 1,500 births and 4,800 \n     outpatient visits. She chaired the Lactation Council and \n     coordinated lactation services. Commander French implemented \n     a lactation consult call schedule to provide 24/7 lactation \n     services for 300 beneficiaries, which reduced infant \n     readmissions for hyperbilirubinemia and dehydration by 80 \n     percent. Clinically proficient, Commander French provides \n     daily hands-on care to patients in addition to covering \n     critical staffing shortages during off-duty hours. She \n     coordinated the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery's, Family \n     Centered Care training for more than 40 medical and nursing \n     personnel. Commander French saved the Command $5,000 in \n     Temporary Additional Duty costs when she established a \n     regional testing site for the Maternal Newborn and Inpatient \n     Obstetric Nursing National Certification exam, allowing 10 \n     military and civilian nurses to locally obtain certification. \n     She coordinated the $5 Million Labor and Delivery, Recovery, \n     and Postpartum renovation project, continuously interacting \n     with Facilities Department personnel, contractors, news media \n     and multiple hospital departments to ensure the project \n     remained within contractual agreements and maintained patient \n     safety and workload. Commander French's professionalism, \n     initiative, and total devotion to duty reflected great credit \n     upon herself and were in keeping with the highest tradition \n     of the United States Naval Service. On behalf of the entire \n     staff, she is extended the traditional Navy ``Well Done.''\n\n                                            Richard C.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a community \nin North Dakota that is celebrating its 100th anniversary. On July 1-3, \n2005, the residents of Fordville, ND, past and present, gathered to \ncelebrate the community's centennial.\n  Fordville is a city in the northeastern part of my great State with \nabout 266 residents. Although its population is small, Fordville holds \nan important place in the history of North Dakota. Medford was founded \nin 1905 and was an important stop along the Soo Railroad line. Because \nof confusion caused as a result of other stations along the Soo line \nwith the name Medford, it was decided to combine its name with the \nrural post office of\n\n[[Page S8213]]\n\nBelleville. The combination of Medford and Belleville resulted in the \nnow familiar name of Fordville.\n  The people of Fordville are proud of their local public schools and \nthe railroad system, which helps to sustain the city. Additionally, the \ncity has a strong farming co-operative system featuring a new grain \nelevator. Their lively centennial celebration included a parade, street \ndance, musicals and a fireworks display.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Fordville, ND, and its \nresidents on their first 100 years and in wishing them well through the \nnext century. By honoring Fordville and all the other historic small \ntowns of North Dakota, we keep the pioneering tradition alive for \nfuture generations. It is places such as Fordville that shaped this \ncountry into what it is today, which is why this fine community \ndeserves our recognition.\n  Fordville has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/13/senate-section/article/S8213-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n.\n\n\n             100TH ANNIVERSARY OF TURTLE LAKE, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a community \nin North Dakota that is celebrating its 100th anniversary. From July 15 \nto 17, the residents of Turtle Lake, ND, will celebrate their history \nand the town's founding.\n  Turtle Lake is a small town in north-central North Dakota with a \npopulation of 580. Despite its small size, Turtle Lake holds an \nimportant place in North Dakota's history. The founder of Turtle Lake \nwas Peter Miller, the earliest homesteader in the region. Mr. Miller \nestablished the Turtle Lake post office in his farmhouse on January 25, \n1886, and subsequently formed the first Turtle Lake business by setting \nup a shop under a lean-to. As other businesses spread throughout the \narea, the Miller town site was formed. Over the next decade, the post \noffice moved to Wanamaker town site and then finally to the current \nlocation of Turtle Lake, north of the lake itself. The communities of \nthe area came together and were incorporated as the village of Turtle \nLake in 1907. Turtle Lake is a thriving community today, with a rapidly \ngrowing tourist industry that brings visitors to the turtle shaped lake \nfor which the town is named.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Turtle Lake, ND, and \nits residents on their first 100 years and in wishing them well through \nthe next century. I believe that by honoring Turtle Lake and all the \nother historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the pioneering, \nfrontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as \nTurtle Lake that have helped to shape this country into what it is \ntoday. I believe that the community of Turtle Lake is deserving of our \nrecognition.\n  Turtle Lake has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/13/senate-section/article/S8213-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n.\n\n\n                      IDAHO'S VERY OWN GUNFIGHTERS\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I would like to recognize a \nnontraditional Idaho community that although a Federal installation, is \nas much a part of our State as any other community. The Mountain Home \nAir Force Base Gunfighters support and execute our military air mission \nworldwide while devoting time and energy to improve the quality of life \non base and off.\n  In the 1940s, Mountain Home Air Force Base was established and over \nthe next few decades took on many different Air Force missions \nincluding bombers, fighters, tankers, and even intercontinental \nballistic missiles for a short time. As the needs and overall mission \nof the Air Force has evolved over the years, Mountain Home has followed \nsuit, proven to be a site of flexibility and superior support, \noperations, and training. Wings based at Mountain Home have provided \nair support all around the world and, in times of need like September \n11, here at home. The capabilities of the personnel, facilities, \nresources and organizations at Mountain Home have always been \ncharacterized by flexibility, readiness and immediate and forceful \nglobal deployment in a tightly controlled and effective command and \ncontrol environment. Exercising their skills and military \nprofessionalism, Gunfighters have not only fought the battles but \nparticipated in reconstruction and humanitarian missions in the current \nconflict in the Middle East as well as other places around the globe \nwhere innocent people are suffering from the evils of poverty, economic \noppression, and the tragedies of natural disasters.\n  In a similar way, Gunfighters have proven to be able to ``deploy'' to \nthe community on base and off at a moment's notice when duty calls. \nLast year alone, volunteers worked on base more than 100,000 hours \nvalued at $1.5 million. Many of these individuals already have more \nthan full-time work in the military but have found the time to make a \ndifference to others expecting no compensation. Stories abound of \nemergency assistance given by members of the military to civilians in \nIdaho. Recently, two jet fighters escorted a disabled civilian aircraft \nto safety, averting a possible crash and fatality. Another form of \ngiving that is particularly important to the troops who are deployed is \ndonating blood. I am proud to say that in the recent Armed Forces blood \ndrive, Mountain Home Air Force Base more than doubled its goal and \ndonated a total of 265 units of blood that was shipped directly to \nIraq. In addition, the base sent 60 units of a special blood product \ndesigned to promote quick clotting to our mobile medical units. What a \nterrific example of fellow soldiers and families lending aid and \ncomfort to our military men and women across the world.\n  I offer my sincere thanks and gratitude to our very own Idaho \nGunfighters, both at Mountain Home and deployed. You make Idaho \nproud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/13/senate-section/article/S8213-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8213-S8214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n.\n\n\n             HONORING THE CITY OF CHAMBERLAIN, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to honor and \npublicly acknowledge the 125th anniversary of Chamberlain, SD, a small \ncity nestled on the eastern bluffs of the Missouri River marking the \ndivide between eastern and western South Dakota.\n  Chamberlain, located in Brule County in central South Dakota, was \nfounded in 1880. The land on which the town is located was obtained \nfrom the Federal Government by means of Civil War script. Once the \nproperty was acquired, a small group of men, for whom the streets of \nthe city are now named, established the town. Soon thereafter, it was \nannounced that the railroad would pass through the area, thus bringing \na flood of pioneers to the city in search of a new home on the \nfrontier.\n  The town of Chamberlain grew rapidly. Within weeks, it was home to \nthe Merchant's Hotel, the Brule County Bank and the Dakota Fire and \nMarine Insurance Company. Chamberlain's post office was established in \nMay of 1881, and the Dakota Register, the town's first newspaper, was \nfounded later that year.\n  The first church in Chamberlain was the Congregational Church, \nestablished under the leadership of Reverend W.H. Thrall. Built in \n1881, the structure was donated by Selah Chamberlain, an officer of the \nMilwaukee railroad and the man for whom Chamberlain was named. The \nchurch still stands today as a symbol of unity in this small city. \nOther denominations, including the Methodists, Catholics, \nEpiscopalians, Lutherans, and Seventh Day Adventists, also established \ntheir respective churches in Chamberlain's early years.\n  Ask any of its residents about the history of Chamberlain and they \nwill probably recount the story of Theodore Roosevelt's campaign visit. \nRoosevelt and his band of Rough Riders arrived from the west on a very \nwindy day when the air was so full of dust that people could barely see \neach other as they made their way around the town. Consequently, two \ncowboys collided on the street and one of the horses was killed in the \naccident. Roosevelt asked Mr. Lockwood, marshal of the day, if a local \ncowboy would lend him a horse. The request was overheard by a nearby \nrancher who promptly offered up one of his. Roosevelt, proud of his new \nacquisition, rode the horse around town with local boys until he left \nto continue his campaign elsewhere.\n  Chamberlain is also known as one of the many places the Louis and \nClark Expedition passed through. In mid-September of 1804, the team was \ngreeted by exotic animals, such as jackrabbits, antelopes, mule deer \nand black-billed magpies, as well as the enormous herds of buffalo, \ndeer, elk and antelope. The path the expedition traveled is now a \npopular hiking destination for outdoorsmen and history buffs alike.\n  Like most young communities in the Dakotas, Chamberlain was not \nwithout\n\n[[Page S8214]]\n\nits share of tragedy and hardship. In the first two years of \nChamberlain's existence, the pioneers of the area experienced two of \nthe hardest winters on record. Also, few can forget the typhoid \nepidemic in 1932. Towns upstream believed an old tale that the water in \nthe river cleansed itself every 20 feet due to its saturation of mud \nand sand. As a result, many residents diverted their sewage into the \nriver. Unfortunately, this resulted in a widespread typhoid outbreak. \nIn a matter of months, the disease claimed the lives of 33 Chamberlain \nresidents.\n  Anyone who has traveled the State of South Dakota can attest to the \nbeautiful vistas from the eastern bluffs of the Missouri River. This \npicture of the river stands as a warm welcome to western South Dakota \nand is a lasting reminder of the unique treasures and beauty of our \nState. Perhaps it was this panorama which inspired an early pioneer to \nwrite, ``I've reached the land of wealth and kine, a home in it may yet \nbe mine.''\n  I take this opportunity to recognize the achievements of the small \ncity of Chamberlain and to congratulate its 2,260 residents as they \ncelebrate their vibrant 125 year history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/13/senate-section/article/S8214-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n.\n\n\n               HONORING THE CITY OF MADISON, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, it is with great honor that I wish \ntoday to publicly recognize the 125th anniversary of the founding of \nthe city of Madison, SD. It is at this time I would like to draw my \ncolleagues' attention to the achievements and history of this charming \ncity that stands as an enduring tribute to the moral fortitude and \npioneer spirit of the earliest Dakotans.\n  Located in the eastern part of South Dakota, Madison is one of the \noldest towns in Lake County. The present town of Madison is actually \nthe result of the merging of two cities, Madison and Herman. Lake \nCounty was established in January of 1873, and in the fall of that \nyear, the county commissioners selected Madison to serve as the county \nseat. Interestingly, the town of Madison was not platted until July of \n1875, 2 years after receiving its county seat title. The nearby town of \nHerman was founded in 1878 and a rivalry quickly developed between the \ntwo communities.\n  In 1880, the southern Minnesota division of the Milwaukee Railroad \ndecided to extend the rail line through the region. The area chosen for \nthe tracks, however, missed Madison by three miles but passed through \nHerman. Herman's close proximity to the trains put Madison's status as \ncounty seat in jeopardy. Consequently, Madison residents decided to \nrelocate their town to a new 320 acre plot owned by Mr. and Mrs. C.B. \nKennedy, which was in the railroad's path. When railroad officials \nfavored Madison over Herman, the two communities decided to merge into \none, thus forming the present city of ``new'' Madison.\n  Madison grew rapidly. The move to the new town began in August, 1880, \nwhen the J.H. Law building was transported from old Madison into new \nMadison. Dyer Hardware and the P.H. Harth General Store quickly \nfollowed. By the end of 1880, Madison boasted two general stores, a \ndrug store, a livery barn, a blacksmith shop, a carpenter shop, three \nsaloons, and a millinery store.\n  The area's first newspaper, the Lake County Leader, was established \nby F.C. Stowe in Herman. In 1880, Stowe moved the printing press to \nMadison, and in the spring of 1881, Stowe sold the Leader. After \npassing through a few hands, James F. Stahl eventually purchased the \npaper. Stahl converted the weekly paper into a daily publication in \n1890. Madison's second paper, the Madison Sentinel, began in old \nMadison in April, 1879 by Joe H. Zane and F.L. Fifield. The Leader and \nSentinel were competitors until 1937, when the two combined to form the \nMadison Daily Leader. Since 1947, the Hunter family has published the \nMadison Daily Leader, and to this day the paper continues to provide \nresidents with accurate and reliable news coverage.\n  Among Madison's notable attributes is its public library. In 1905, \ntown residents held a meeting and decided to create the facility. \nQuickly thereafter, the community raised money, donated books, and \nsecured a room in the building of Mr. John Warren's new bank. The \nMadison Free Public Library opened its doors in December of that year. \nMeanwhile, George R. Farmer had been working with Andrew Carnegie to \nsecure additional funds for a library. One month after the opening of \nthe Madison Free Public Library, Farmer received word from Carnegie's \nprivate secretary that Carnegie would donate $10,000 to erect a public \nlibrary if the city would provide and maintain a suitable site for the \nbuilding. A site was selected and construction quickly began. On \nThursday, November 12, 1907, the new Madison Library opened. In 1960 \nand 1980, improvements were made to the building. Yet these \nmodifications pale in comparison to the major renovations undertaken in \n1994, when the size of the library was increased by 400 percent with a \nstriking architecturally compatible addition. The facility now houses \n48,055 books and more than 3,500 audiovisual materials.\n  Like most communities in the Dakotas, Madison's history is not \nwithout its share of tragedy and hardship. On July 4, 1919, ``The \nReliance,'' a touring boat used to take people around Lake Madison, set \nout with a group of 32 passengers to view the fireworks from the water. \nThe ship headed across the lake to hug the shoreline as it always did. \nSadly, it struck a sunken tree about 80 to 100 feet off shore. The \npassengers on board panicked and rushed to one side of the vessel, \ncausing it to capsize. Nine people, including the engineer, drowned in \nthat tragic accident.\n  Similarly, on the night of April 11, 1980, the Hotel Park caught fire \nand burned for nearly 8 hours, killing four people. The blaze was so \ndifficult to contain that the National Guardsmen, who were on their \nweekend drill in Madison, were called in to assist the exhausted \nfirefighters the following morning. Despite these adversities, this \nresilient community has always managed to recover, rebuild and prosper.\n  Madison is home to Dakota State University, DSU, founded in 1881 by \nWilliam H. Beadle. DSU is recognized nationally as a leader in computer \nand information systems. Additionally, Karl Mundt was a notable DSU \nfaculty member. Not only was Mr. Mundt an extraordinary speech and \nsocial science teacher, but he also served in Congress longer than any \nother South Dakotan. Elected to the House of Representatives in 1938, \nhe remained a Congressman until 1948, when he took office as U.S. \nSenator from South Dakota. Senator Mundt held that post until 1972, \nhaving served 34 years in Congress.\n  The sense of community, moral fortitude, perseverance, and enduring \nwork ethic that is evident in the people and the history of Madison \nstands as a testament to the integrity of all South Dakotans. It is my \nhonor to acknowledge the proud residents of Madison, as they celebrate \n125 years of history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/13/senate-section/article/S8214-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8214-S8215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n.\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN JAMES C. STEIN\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor \nCaptain James C. Stein, United States Navy, as he retires from the \nNaval Service. Captain Stein is a Naval Officer of the finest caliber \nwho has established an impeccable reputation in the Navy and with the \nSenate through his distinguished tour as deputy director of the Navy \nSenate Liaison Office.\n  He is a 1982 graduate of the University of Notre Dame. As the \nmidshipman achieving the highest 4-year academic average in the NROTC \ncurriculum, he received the Notre Dame Reverend Hugh J. O'Donnell \nAward.\n  A Captain's List flight student, he was designated a Naval Aviator in \n1984. His initial squadron tours were with Patrol Squadron 26, Patrol \nSquadron 30 as a Fleet Replacement Squadron Instructor Pilot, and as a \ndepartment head with Patrol Squadron 10. He served as the Assistant \nNavigator in USS Ranger, CV-61, during Operation Desert Storm, was \nselected as the 1991 Pacific Fleet Shiphandler of the Year, and \nultimately earned designation as a Surface Warfare Officer.\n  While ashore, Captain Stein earned a master of arts degree in \nnational security and strategic studies from the Naval War College. He \nserved on the chief of Naval Operations' staff as the\n\n[[Page S8215]]\n\nassistant Maritime Patrol Aviation Requirements Officer, and deputy \nexecutive assistant to the director, Air Warfare.

    By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 1388. A bill to amend chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code \n(commonly known as the Regulatory Flexibility Act), to ensure complete \nanalysis of potential impacts on small entities of rules, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as Chair of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I have fought to ensure that small \nbusinesses across the country are treated fairly by Federal Government \nregulations. Unfortunately, in far too many cases, Federal agencies \npromulgate regulations without adequately addressing the economic \nimpacts on small businesses.\n  The Regulatory Flexibility Act, RFA, was enacted in 1980 and requires \nFederal Government agencies to propose rules that keep the regulatory \nburden at a minimum on small businesses. The RFA requires agencies to \nanalyze the economic impact of proposed regulations when there is \nlikely to be a significant economic impact on a substantial number of \nsmall entities.\n  In 1996, I was pleased to support, along with all of my colleagues, \nthe Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, SBREFA, which \namended the RFA. The intent of SBREFA was to further curtail the impact \nof burdensome or duplicative regulations on small businesses, by \nclarifying key RFA requirements. In September we will celebrate the \n25th Anniversary of the RFA--a law that is largely working as Congress \nintended.\n  Unfortunately, there remain a number of loopholes in the RFA that \nundermine its effectiveness in reducing these regulatory burdens. To \nclose these loopholes, today I introduce the Regulatory Flexibility \nReform Act of 2005, RFRA. This bill would ensure that Federal agencies \nconduct a complete analysis of the impacts of Federal regulations, \nthereby providing small businesses, which represent more than 99 \npercent of all firms in America and provide up to 75 percent of new \njobs each year, with much needed regulatory relief.\n  Under my legislation agencies must consider the indirect effects of \nan ``economic impact.'' Rules with indirect effects are currently \nexempt from RFA coverage according to well-established case law. This \nhas serious consequences for small businesses. It means a Federal \nagency can avoid the various analyses required under the RFA by either \nrequiring the States to regulate small entities or regulating an \nindustry so rigorously that it has a negative trickle down impact on \nother industries.\n  For example, rules can regulate a handful of large manufacturers in \nthe\n\n[[Page S8221]]\n\nsame industry. Yet, a foreseeable, indirect effect of these rules--not \npresently considered under RFA analyses--is that small distributors \nwould no longer have the right to sell the product produced by the \nlarger manufacturers. In one case 100,000 small distributors were \nprevented from distributing their products.\n  This indirect economic effect had a significant impact on a \nsubstantial number of small businesses because their ability to compete \nin the marketplace--and create jobs--has and will continue to be \nharmed.\n  In addition, this large loophole amounts to an ``unfunded mandate'' \nbecause many States do not have a requirement to conduct an RFA-type \nanalysis of regulations. And even when there is such a statute on the \nbooks, those States frequently do not have the resources to conduct the \nanalysis themselves. Worse still, for States with no requirement to \nconduct RFA-type analyses, the impact of the Federal regulation upon \nsmall businesses is never properly assessed either at the Federal or \nState level.\n  This situation demands reform.\n  Second, my legislation requires Federal agencies to consider comments \nprovided by the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy. The \nSBA's Office of Advocacy does not receive the public attention it \ndeserves. It should. In case after case it has been the last, best hope \nfor small businesses faced with burdensome, duplicative and nonsensical \nFederal regulations.\n  The Office of Advocacy serves two critical roles: No. 1, it \nrepresents small business' interests before the Federal government in \nregulatory matters, and No. 2, it conducts valuable research to further \nour understanding of the importance of small businesses and their job \ncreating potential in our economy.\n  My legislation would also amend the RFA to include a provision for \nagencies to specifically respond to comments filed by the Chief Counsel \nfor Advocacy. Codifying this necessary change would ensure that \nagencies give the proper deference to the Office of Advocacy, and \nhence, to the comments and concerns of small businesses. This is a \nstraightforward and simple reform that could have major benefits.\n  Finally, the RFRA would clarify the circumstances for a periodic \nreview of Federal rules. If there is a significant impact on a \nsubstantial number of small entities, a review would be required. It \nwould also clarify the requirement that agencies review all 10-year-old \nrules to avoid confusion over which rules to review. In addition, \nagencies would be required to review rules every 10 years and not just \nthe first 10 years. That's because rules can have unintended and \nnegative consequences in our changing global, information-age economy.\n  This legislation is absolutely necessary. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport my bill so we can ensure that our Nation's small businesses and \ntheir employees are provided with much needed regulatory relief.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1388\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Regulatory \n     Flexibility Reform Act of 2005''.\n       (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act \n     is as follows:\n\nSec. 1. Short title; table of contents.\nSec. 2. Findings.\nSec. 3. Clarification and expansion of rules covered by the Regulatory \n              Flexibility Act.\nSec. 4. Requirements providing for more detailed analyses.\nSec. 5. Periodic review of rules.\nSec. 6. Clerical amendments.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) A vibrant and growing small business sector is critical \n     to creating jobs in a dynamic economy.\n       (2) Regulations designed for application to large-scale \n     entities have been applied uniformly to small businesses and \n     other small entities, even though the problems sought to be \n     solved by such regulations are not always caused by these \n     small businesses and other small entities.\n       (3) Uniform Federal regulatory and reporting requirements \n     in many instances have imposed on small businesses and other \n     small entities unnecessary and disproportionately burdensome \n     demands, including legal, accounting, and consulting costs.\n       (4) Since 1980, Federal agencies have been required to \n     recognize and take account of the differences in the scale \n     and resources of regulated entities, but have failed to do \n     so.\n       (5) Alternative regulatory approaches that do not conflict \n     with the stated objectives of the statutes the regulations \n     seek to implement may be available and may minimize the \n     significant economic impact of regulations on small \n     businesses and other small entities.\n       (6) Federal agencies have failed to analyze and uncover \n     less-costly alternative regulatory approaches, despite the \n     fact that the chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code \n     (commonly known as the Regulatory Flexibility Act), requires \n     them to do so.\n       (7) Federal agencies continue to interpret chapter 6 of \n     title 5, United States Code, in a manner that permits them to \n     avoid their analytical responsibilities.\n       (8) The existing oversight of the compliance of Federal \n     agencies with the analytical requirements to assess \n     regulatory impacts on small businesses and other small \n     entities and obtain input from the Chief Counsel for Advocacy \n     has not sufficiently modified the Federal agency regulatory \n     culture.\n       (9) Significant changes are needed in the methods by which \n     Federal agencies develop and analyze regulations, receive \n     input from affected entities, and develop regulatory \n     alternatives that will lessen the burden or maximize the \n     benefits of final rules to small businesses and other small \n     entities.\n       (10) It is the intention of Congress to amend chapter 6 of \n     title 5, United States Code, to ensure that all impacts, \n     including foreseeable indirect effects, of proposed and final \n     rules are considered by agencies during the rulemaking \n     process and that the agencies assess a full range of \n     alternatives that will limit adverse economic consequences or \n     enhance economic benefits.\n       (11) Federal agencies should be capable of assessing the \n     impact of proposed and final rules without delaying the \n     regulatory process or impinging on the ability of Federal \n     agencies to fulfill their statutory mandates.\n\n     SEC. 3. CLARIFICATION AND EXPANSION OF RULES COVERED BY THE \n                   REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT.\n\n       Section 601 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(9) Economic impact.--The term `economic impact' means, \n     with respect to a proposed or final rule--\n       ``(A) any direct economic effect on small entities of such \n     rule; and\n       ``(B) any indirect economic effect on small entities which \n     is reasonably foreseeable and results from such rule (without \n     regard to whether small entities will be directly regulated \n     by the rule).''.\n\n     SEC. 4. REQUIREMENTS PROVIDING FOR MORE DETAILED ANALYSES.\n\n       (a) Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.--Section 603 \n     of title 5, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking subsection (b) and inserting the following:\n       ``(b) Each initial regulatory flexibility analysis required \n     under this section shall contain a detailed statement--\n       ``(1) describing the reasons why action by the agency is \n     being considered;\n       ``(2) describing the objectives of, and legal basis for, \n     the proposed rule;\n       ``(3) estimating the number and type of small entities to \n     which the proposed rule will apply;\n       ``(4) describing the projected reporting, recordkeeping, \n     and other compliance requirements of the proposed rule, \n     including an estimate of the classes of small entities which \n     will be subject to the requirement and the type of \n     professional skills necessary for preparation of the report \n     and record;\n       ``(5) describing all relevant Federal rules which may \n     duplicate, overlap, or conflict with the proposed rule, or \n     the reasons why such a description could not be provided;

A bill to reauthorize and improve the USA PATRIOT Act; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to introduce, along \nwith my colleagues Senator Feinstein and Senator Kyl, the USA PATRIOT \nImprovement and Reauthorization Act of\n\n[[Page S8223]]\n\n2005, a bipartisan bill to reauthorize provisions of the landmark anti- \nterrorism legislation we adopted in the wake of September 11, 2001. We \ncontinue to give tools to law enforcement to protect our security; and, \nat the same time, we make important improvements to the law to ensure \ngreater protection of civil liberties and to require greater \naccountability through enhanced reporting and oversight.\n  In recent months, the political rhetoric about the PATRIOT Act has \nreached a fever pitch. Not surprisingly, however, the reality fails to \nmatch the rhetoric. As the Washington Post has editorialized, \n``[a]lthough the PATRIOT Act has become a catch phrase for civil \nliberties anxieties, it in fact has little connection to the most \nserious infringements on civil liberties in the war on terrorism.'' At \nthe same time, it would be unwise to credit the act with all of our \nhard-won successes in the effort to combat terror. As evidenced by the \ngrisly attacks in London last week, no law or surveillance regime can \nprevent every terrorist attack.\n  Nevertheless, as last week's attacks remind us, the danger of \ninternational terrorism remains real, and has not abated in the years \nsince 9/11. So, we must remain vigilant, and we must be cautious not to \nrecreate the legal circumstances that arguably contributed to \nsignificant intelligence failures before 9/11. Reauthorizing the \nPATRIOT Act, while incorporating improvements designed to safeguard our \nliberties and enhance oversight, is the right thing to do. To quote the \nPost again, ``there is little evidence of abuse--and considerable \nevidence that the law has facilitated needed cooperation. Based on \nwhat's known, it merits reauthorization with minor modifications.''\n  The bill we introduce today is the result of careful consideration. \nWe have listened both to the concerns of critics and the arguments of \nthe administration. We have probed and prodded both for information. \nAnd, we have consulted with both sides of the political aisle to \nfashion language designed to maintain the Government's ability to \neffectively investigate--and hopefully preempt--terrorist attacks, \nwhile making changes to reassure the American people that the law will \nbe used responsibly, consistent with the rights enshrined in our \nConstitution.\n  Mr. President, I would like to focus on the changes we have made to \nthose PATRIOT Act provisions that have generated the most controversy.\n  The PATRIOT Act modified electronic surveillance authority under the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, or FISA, to permit \nmultipoint wiretaps of suspected terrorists or spies; but only upon a \njudicial finding of probable cause to believe the target is an agent of \na foreign power and a further finding that the target's actions could \nthwart efforts to identify a single phone company or similar \ncommunications provider upon whom to serve the order. The principle \nbehind this authority, which parallels similar authority in the \ncriminal law, is that surveillance of a suspected terrorist or spy \nshould be permitted to continue, uninterrupted, when the target changes \nphones. By definition, a multipoint wiretap order does not identify the \nspecific phone to be tapped, because the order allows the Government to \ntrack the person not a single device. This was a change made necessary \nby the advent of cell phones, which are easily purchased and then \ndiscarded. After passage of the PATRIOT Act, however, this authority \nwas further modified, so that a FISA surveillance order only had to \nspecify the identity of the target ``if known.'' If the identity was \nunknown, the order had to include a ``description of the target,'' but \nthere was no further requirement about how detailed the description of \nsuch ``John Doe'' targets had to be--raising concerns that the \nGovernment could conduct roving surveillance of a broadly described \ntarget. Our bill corrects this shortcoming and makes other improvements \nto the roving authority under FISA.\n\n  First, the bill responds to concerns that so-called John Doe roving \nwiretaps could be used against someone described generically as a \n``Middle Eastern male'' or ``Hispanic female'' by requiring such orders \nto include ``sufficient information to describe a specific target with \nparticularity.'' This makes it clear that, although such orders may \n``rove'' from one phone to another when the target changes devices, the \nGovernment cannot ``rove'' from one investigative target to another, \nseeking to identify the right person. Through this change, we avoid \nrewarding terrorists or spies who successfully conceal their \nidentities, but we also protect innocent Americans from unwarranted \nsurveillance.\n  The bill further minimizes the chance that ``roving'' wiretaps could \nbe used indiscriminately against multiple devices by requiring the \nGovernment to notify the court every time it begins surveillance of a \nnew device. This notice must be made within 10 days of the initiation \nof surveillance, and must include a description of the new device, as \nwell as the ``facts and circumstances'' indicating that each new phone \nor similar device is ``being used, or is about to be used,'' by the \ntarget. The notice must also update the techniques being used to \nminimize the interception and retention of unrelated communications. \nFinally, the bill adds new reporting requirements and extends the \nsunset date until December 31, 2009, allowing Congress to revisit the \nneed for this surveillance tool.\n  I would next like to turn to the bill's modification of section 215 \nof the PATRIOT Act, perhaps the most controversial provision of the \nact, and one that is frequently misidentified as the ``library'' \nprovision.\n  Prior to the PATRIOT Act, FISA authorized the FBI to obtain orders \nfor the production of certain types of business records, including \nthose of hotels, car rental agencies and storage facilities, in limited \ncircumstances. Under the pre-PATRIOT standard, however, the FBI could \nnot even seek the records of someone observed in the presence of a \nsuspected spy or terrorist, unless it had specific reasons to suspect \nthe associate was himself a spy or terrorist. Strangely, this standard \nwas significantly higher than the standard applicable to similar \nrecords requests in criminal cases. Accordingly, section 215 of the \nPATRIOT Act amended FISA to permit orders for any records or tangible \nthings sought in connection with an authorized investigation to obtain \nforeign intelligence not concerning a U.S. person or to protect against \ninternational terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities.\n  As enacted, however, section 215 did not require the FBI to establish \nthe factual basis for the requested order. According to critics, \nsection 215 rendered the FISA court little more than a rubber stamp for \nthe Government's requests. Moreover, section 215 included no explicit \nright for recipients to confer with legal counsel. And, despite oft-\nrepeated comparisons to grand jury subpoenas, orders under section 215 \nincluded no explicit right to judicial review akin to a motion to quash \na subpoena. Indeed, in testimony before the Judiciary Committee earlier \nthis year, Attorney General Gonzales conceded these shortcomings in the \nlaw, and expressed a new willingness to consider modifications of \nsection 215.\n  Our bill addresses these issues, and adds still more protections to \nensure the provision is used responsibly. First, the bill eliminates \nthe mere certification of relevance required by current law and \nenhances the factual showing that must be made by the Government to \nobtain records. It also requires the court to agree with the adequacy \nof the Government's factual showing, and adds several procedural \nprotections including heightened approval requirements and increased \nreporting for orders seeking sensitive materials, like library or \nmedical records. Specifically, the bill requires the Government to \nsubmit ``a statement of facts'' showing ``reasonable grounds to believe \nthat the records or other things sought are relevant'' to an authorized \ninvestigation. The bill then addresses concerns about the FISA judge \nacting as a ``rubber stamp'' by requiring the court to find that the \nfacts establish ``reasonable grounds to believe'' the items sought are \nrelevant. The bill also adds an explicit right to consult counsel; \nprovides for judicial review; requires approval of the FBI Director or \nDeputy Director for orders concerning library records and other \nsensitive materials; and adds annual reports to Congress regarding use \nof the provision to obtain library records, book sales records, \nfirearms sales records, health information or tax information. This \nreporting feature is important because it enables\n\n[[Page S8224]]\n\nthe Congress to monitor the Justice Department's activities.\n\n  In addition to the foregoing, the bill also requires an annual report \non the number of times FISA orders for records and tangible things have \nbeen issued, modified, or denied. At our April 5 hearing, the Attorney \nGeneral declassified the fact that, as of March 30, 2005, the FISA \ncourt had ``granted the department's request for a 215 order 35 \ntimes.'' He further noted that section 215 had not been used to obtain \nlibrary or bookstore records, medical records or gun sale records. \nAccording to the Attorney General, section 215 had been used only to \nobtain driver's license records, public accommodation records, \napartment leasing records, credit card records and subscriber \ninformation, such as names and addresses for telephone numbers captured \nthrough court-authorized pen register devices. It is our hope that \nregular public reporting, together with enhanced congressional \nreporting, will bolster public confidence in the law without \ncompromising sensitive investigations. Finally, as with the multipoint \nsurveillance authority, we have extended the sunset date for section \n215 of the PATRIOT Act until December 31, 2009, so Congress must \nrevisit the continuing need for this tool.\n  Another PATRIOT Act provision that has inspired significant criticism \nis section 213 of the act, which authorized delayed notice or so-called \nsneak & peek search warrants. Unlike the other sections I have \ndiscussed, section 213 is not scheduled to sunset later this year. \nNevertheless, in recognition of the concerns raised about this \nprovision, we have made several changes to this authority as well.\n  Prior to the PATRIOT Act, three Federal circuits had approved the \npractice of delayed notice search warrants. Supreme Court precedent \nalso supported the legality of judicially authorized covert entries. \nIndeed, in Dalia v. United States, a 1979 case involving the analogous \nsituation of a covert entry to install a listening device, the Supreme \nCourt described as ``frivolous'' the argument that ``covert entries are \nunconstitutional for their lack of notice.'' Nevertheless, in the 1995 \ncase of Wilson v. Arkansas, which focused on whether officers must \n``knock and announce'' their presence before serving a warrant, the \nCourt held that, ``in some circumstances an officer's unannounced entry \ninto a home might be unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.'' But, \nthe Court did not address sneak and peek warrants directly, and it left \n``to the lower courts the task of determining the circumstances under \nwhich an unannounced entry is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.''\n  The PATRIOT Act sought to create a unified standard for delayed \nnotice searches. Under the PATRIOT Act, notice of a search may be \ndelayed if a court finds reasonable cause to believe immediate notice \nmay have an adverse result, including: (A) endangering the life or \nphysical safety of an individual; (B) flight from prosecution; (C) \ndestruction of, or tampering with, evidence; (D) intimidation of \npotential witnesses; or (E) otherwise seriously jeopardizing an \ninvestigation or unduly delaying a trial. Notice must be provided \nwithin a ``reasonable period'' of time, which may be extended for good \ncause. As noted by critics, however, the period of delay could be \nindefinite. And, in at least six instances reported by the Department \nof Justice, courts have authorized unspecified periods of delay--such \nas delays until the conclusion of an investigation.\n  Over the last 3 months, at the Judiciary Committee's request, the \nDepartment of Justice has furnished new information about its use of \ndelayed notice search warrants. This data shows that delayed notice \nwarrants account for less than 0.2 percent of the warrants handled by \nFederal district courts. Moreover, delayed notice warrants based solely \non seriously jeopardizing an investigation account for less than 1 in \nevery 1,500 warrants--mitigating concerns that the ``catch-all'' \nprovision is being overused. DOJ has also now supplied summaries of 15 \ncases--out of a total of 22 where the delay was based solely on the \n``catch-all.'' In these cases, the delay was based on the substantial \nrisk of comprising a title III wiretap or frustrating efforts to \nidentify the full scope of a complex criminal enterprise. Accordingly, \nthe draft bill does not eliminate seriously jeopardizing an \ninvestigation as a basis for delay. Instead, the bill enhances \nreporting requirements--including the addition of new public reporting \nrequirements--to ensure that DOJ continues to use this authority \nresponsibly. The bill also requires the court to set a ``date certain'' \nfor notice to be provided, eliminating concerns about indefinite \ndelays. The bill permits extensions of the delay period, but requires \nthat extensions be granted only ``upon an updated showing of the need \nfor further delay.'' Finally, the bill limits extensions to 90 days \neach, which parallels the notice requirements for criminal wiretaps and \n``bugs'' which are arguably more invasive that a one-time search, \nbecause they may require covert entries and they continue to collect \npersonal data for extended periods of time.\n\n  As these changes illustrate, while reauthorizing the PATRIOT Act, we \nhave emphasized enhanced oversight through reporting. This bill adds \nreporting requirements to several PATRIOT provisions, including the \naforementioned public reporting on delayed notice search warrants and \nFISA business records orders. The bill also adds public reporting on \nFISA pen registers and the emergency authorization of FISA electronic \nsurveillance. Moreover, throughout FISA, the draft bill adds the Senate \nand House Judiciary Committees to reporting provisions currently \nlimited to the Senate and House Intelligence Committees.\n  In addition, we have made adjustments to other provisions of the \nPATRIOT Act. These include:\n  Section 203, sharing criminal information with intelligence agencies: \nThe bill requires notice to the authorizing court when foreign \nintelligence information gathered via a court-authorized criminal \nwiretap is disclosed to intelligence agencies.\n\n  Section 207, Duration of FISA surveillance of non-U.S. persons: The \nbill extends surveillance periods for non-U.S. persons under FISA, 120 \ndays for original orders, and up to 1 year for extensions. Also, it \nextends the duration of FISA pen registers for non-U.S. persons, up to \n1 year.\n  Section 212, emergency disclosure of electronic communications: The \nbill adds new reporting requirements to ensure the government is using \nthis authority appropriately. The bill also makes technical corrections \nto harmonize the language permitting the emergency disclosure of \ncontents and records.\n  Section 505, national security letters: The bill incorporates \nlegislation introduced by Senator Cornyn to address a 2004 Federal \ndistrict court decision holding a national security letter, or NSL, \nserved on an Internet service provider unconstitutional. This \nlegislation permits disclosure to legal counsel; allows court \nchallenges; and permits judicial enforcement of NSLs.\n  Sunsets: As I have noted, the bill retains sunsets for PATRIOT \nsections 206, multi-point wiretaps, and 215, FISA orders for business \nrecords and tangible things. The bill also extends the sunset date for \nthe ``Lone Wolf'' provision added to FISA by last year's Intelligence \nReform and Terrorism Prevention Act until December 31, 2009.\n  Taken together, these changes provide important checks on the \ngovernmental authorities contained in the PATRIOT Act. At the same \ntime, these amendments honor President Bush's call for Congress to \nreauthorize the act without weakening the tools used to combat \nterrorism. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Feinstein and Kyl in \nintroducing this measure, and I look forward to securing the support of \nother Judiciary Committee members as we move to consider this bill.\n  Mr. President, I would ask that the Washington Post editorial \nmentioned in my remarks, as well as three letters from the Department \nof Justice on the use of delayed notice warrants, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 13, 2005]\n\n                           Patriot Second Act\n\n       Congress passed the USA Patriot Act in haste after the \n     Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Critics predicted that the act would \n     deal a blow to liberty, while proponents insisted it was \n     essential to the fight against al Qaeda. A wise compromise \n     gave the administration new powers but had them expire at the \n     end of 2005, giving Congress a chance to take a second look. \n     Consequently, various congressional committees are \n     considering whether\n\n[[Page S8225]]\n\n     the Patriot Act should be reauthorized, rolled back or \n     expanded--and whether this time it should be made permanent, \n     as the administration wishes, or renewed only temporarily.\n       Although the Patriot Act has become a catch phrase for \n     civil liberties anxieties, it in fact has little connection \n     to the most serious infringements on civil liberties in the \n     war on terrorism. It has nothing to do with the detention of \n     Americans as enemy combatants, the abuse of prisoners \n     captured abroad or the roundup of foreigners for minor \n     immigration violations. The law's key sections were designed \n     to expand investigative powers in national security cases and \n     permit more information-sharing between intelligence and law \n     enforcement agencies. These have sparked controversy more \n     because of abuses they might permit than because of anything \n     that is known to have happened. Indeed, there is little \n     evidence of abuse--and considerable evidence that the law has \n     facilitated needed cooperation. Based on what's known, it \n     merits reauthorization with minor modifications.\n       But first more ought to be known. Far from regularly \n     releasing information about its use of the law, the \n     administration has generally hidden even basic information--\n     only to release it when politically convenient. Neither in \n     the Patriot Act nor in the surveillance statute it amended \n     did Congress require the sort of routine public reporting \n     that would offer Americans a useful ongoing sense of the law \n     in operation. And while the administration has, in recent \n     months, released a good deal of information to support its \n     request for reauthorization, the public still lacks a full \n     picture. Before reauthorizing the Patriot Act, Congress needs \n     to demand and release sufficient information. And in revising \n     the law, Congress should make it more transparent, so the \n     public is not at the mercy of the administration's sense of \n     openness.\n       Nor should reauthorization be permanent. Knowing it had to \n     return to Congress for reauthorization was one of the few \n     incentives for the administration to release information; \n     it's useful to maintain that incentive. And it's not overly \n     burdensome to ask the executive branch to periodically \n     justify its need for such powerful investigative tools.\n       Finally, the Senate intelligence committee has included as \n     part of its reauthorization package a broad authority for the \n     FBI to collect information from businesses in intelligence \n     matters using an administrative subpoena the FBI can issue on \n     its own. This should not become law. Administrative subpoenas \n     make sense in regulatory matters have made their way into \n     certain criminal and security investigations. But the Justice \n     Department already can get the records it needs using the \n     traditional, wide-ranging investigative powers of the grand \n     jury or another provision of the Patriot Act. Administrative \n     subpoenas are more secretive than grand jury subpoenas, and \n     they involve less scrutiny from prosecutors; they strip away \n     a layer of oversight. The administration may well make a \n     persuasive case for Patriot Act renewal, with increased \n     oversight. But this particular power should not be granted.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, Apr. 4, 2005.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We have indicated in some of our \n     responses to questions for the record, including those \n     recently submitted on April 1, 2005, that we would supplement \n     our responses to some questions. This letter is intended to \n     supplement previous information we have provided regarding \n     the usage of section 213 of the USA PATRIOT Act (``the \n     Act''), relating to delayed-notice search warrants. We \n     believe the information contained herein completely answers \n     all the Committee's questions submitted to date regarding \n     section 213 and we look forward to working with you on this \n     and other issues related to the reauthorization of the USA \n     PATRIOT Act.\n       As you know, the Department of Justice believes very \n     strongly that section 213 is an invaluable tool in the war on \n     terror and our efforts to combat serious criminal conduct. In \n     passing the USA PATRIOT Act, Congress recognized that \n     delayed-notice search warrants are a vital aspect of the \n     Department's strategy of prevention; detecting and \n     incapacitating terrorists, drug dealers and other criminals \n     before they can harm our nation. Codified at 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3103a, section 213 of the Act created an explicit \n     statutory authority for investigators and prosecutors to ask \n     a court for permission to delay temporarily notice that a \n     search warrant was executed. While not scheduled to sunset on \n     December 31, 2005, section 213 has been the subject of \n     criticism and various legislative proposals. For the \n     following reasons, the Department does not believe any \n     modifications to section 213 are required.\n       To begin with, delayed-notice search warrants have been \n     used by law enforcement officers for decades. Such warrants \n     were not created by the USA PATRIOT Act. Rather, the Act \n     simply codified a common-law practice recognized by courts \n     across the country. Section 213 simply created a uniform \n     nationwide standard for the issuance of those warrants, thus \n     ensuring that delayed-notice search warrants are evaluated \n     under the same criteria across the nation. Like any other \n     search warrant, a delayed-notice search warrant is issued by \n     a federal judge only upon a showing that there is probable \n     cause to believe that the property to be searched for or \n     seized constitutes evidence of a criminal offense. A delayed-\n     notice warrant differs from an ordinary search warrant only \n     in that the judge specifically authorizes the law enforcement \n     officers executing the warrant to wait for a limited period \n     of time before notifying the subject of the search that a \n     search was executed.\n       In addition, investigators and prosecutors seeking a \n     judge's approval to delay notification must show that, if \n     notification were made contemporaneous to the search, there \n     is reasonable cause to believe one of the following might \n     occur: (1) notification would endanger the life or physical \n     safety of an individual; (2) notification would cause flight \n     from prosecution; (3) notification would result in \n     destruction of, or tampering with, evidence; (4) notification \n     would result in intimidation of potential witnesses; or (5) \n     notification would cause serious jeopardy to an investigation \n     or unduly delay a trial.\n       To be clear, it is only in these five tailored \n     circumstances that the Department may request judicial \n     approval to delay notification, and a federal judge must \n     agree with the Department's evaluation before approving any \n     delay.\n       Delayed-notice search warrants provide a crucial option to \n     law enforcement. If immediate notification were required \n     regardless of the circumstances, law enforcement officials \n     would be too often forced into making a ``Hobson's choice'': \n     delaying the urgent need to conduct a search and/or seizure \n     or conducting the search and prematurely notifying the target \n     of the existence of law enforcement interest in his or her \n     illegal conduct and undermine the equally pressing need to \n     keep the ongoing investigation confidential.\n       A prime example in which a delayed-notice search warrant \n     was executed is Operation Candy Box. This operation was a \n     complex multi-year, multi-country, multi-agency investigative \n     effort by the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force, \n     involving the illegal trafficking and distribution of both \n     MDMA (also known as Ecstasy) and BC bud (a potent and \n     expensive strain of marijuana). The delayed-notice search \n     warrant used in the investigation was obtained on the grounds \n     that notice would cause serious jeopardy to the investigation \n     (see 18 V.S.C. Sec. 2705(a)(2) (E)).\n       In 2004, investigators learned that an automobile loaded \n     with a large quantity of Ecstasy would be crossing the U.S.-\n     Canadian border en route to Florida. On March 5, 2004, after \n     the suspect vehicle crossed into the United States near \n     Buffalo, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Special Agents \n     followed the vehic1e until the driver stopped at a \n     restaurant. One agent then used a duplicate key to enter the \n     vehicle and drive away while other agents spread broken glass \n     in the parking space to create the impression that the \n     vehicle had been stolen. The ruse worked, and the drug \n     traffickers were not tipped off that the DEA had seized their \n     drugs. A subsequent search of the vehicle revealed a hidden \n     compartment containing 30,000 MDMA tablets and ten pounds of \n     BC bud Operation Candy Box was able to continue because \n     agents were able to delay notification of the search for more \n     than three weeks.\n       On March 31, 2004, in a two-nation crackdown the Department \n     notified the owner of the car of the seizure and likewise \n     arrested more than 130 individuals. Ultimately, Operation \n     Candy Box resulted in approximately 212 arrests and the \n     seizure of $8,995,811 in U.S. currency, 1,546 pounds of MDMA \n     powder, 409,300 MDMA tablets, 1,976 pounds of marijuana, 6.5 \n     pounds of methamphetamine, jewelry valued at $174,000,38 \n     vehicles, and 62 weapons. By any measure, Operation Candy \n     Box seriously disrupted the Ecstasy market in the United \n     States and made MDMA pills less potent, more expensive and \n     harder to find. There has been a sustained nationwide \n     eight percent per pill price increase since the \n     culmination of Operation Candy Box; a permanent decrease \n     of average purity per pill to the lowest levels since \n     1996; and currency seizures have denied traffickers access \n     to critical resources--preventing the distribution of \n     between 17 and 34 million additional Ecstasy pills to our \n     Nation's children.\n       Had Operation Candy Box agents, however, been required to \n     provide immediate notification of the search of the car and \n     seizure of the drugs, they would have prematurely revealed \n     the existence of and thus seriously jeopardized the ultimate \n     success of this massive long-term investigation. The dilemma \n     faced by investigators in the absence of delayed notification \n     is even more acute in terrorism investigations where the \n     slightest indication of governmental interest can lead a \n     loosely connected cell to dissolve. Fortunately though, \n     because delayed-notice search warrants are available, \n     investigators do not have to choose between pursuing \n     terrorists or criminals and protecting the public--we can do \n     both.\n       It is important to stress that in all circumstances the \n     subject of a criminal search warrant is informed of the \n     search. It is simply false to suggest, as some have, that \n     delayed-notice search warrants allow the government to search \n     an individual's ``houses, papers, and effects'' without \n     notifying them of the search. In every case where the \n     government executes a criminal search warrant, including \n     those issued pursuant to section 213, the subject of the \n     search is told of the search. With respect to delayed-notice \n     search warrants, such notice is simply delayed for a \n     reasonable period of time--a time period defined by a Federal \n     judge.\n\n[[Page S8226]]\n\n       Delayed-notice search warrants are constitutional and do \n     not violate the Fourth Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court \n     expressly held in Dalia v. United States that the Fourth \n     Amendment does not require law enforcement to give immediate \n     notice of the execution of a search warrant. Since Dalia, \n     three Federal courts of appeals have considered the \n     constitutionality of delayed-notice search warrants, and all \n     three have upheld their constitutionality. To our knowledge, \n     no court has ever held otherwise. In short, long before the \n     enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act, it was clear that delayed \n     notification was appropriate in certain circumstances; that \n     remains true today. The USA PATRIOT Act simply resolved the \n     mix of inconsistent rules, practices and court decisions \n     varying from circuit to circuit. Therefore, section 213 had \n     the beneficial impact of mandating uniform and equitable \n     application of the authority across the Nation.\n       The Committee has requested detailed information regarding \n     how often section 213 has been used. Let us assure you that \n     the use of a delayed-notice search warrant is the exception, \n     not the rule. Law enforcement agents and investigators \n     provide immediate notice of a search warrant's execution in \n     the vast majority of cases. According to Administrative \n     Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC), during a 12-month period \n     ending September 30, 2003, U.S. District Courts handled \n     32,539 search warrants. By contrast, in one 14-month period--\n     between April 2003 and July 2004--the Department used the \n     section 213 authority only 61 times according to a Department \n     survey. Even when compared to the AOUSC data for a shorter \n     period of time, the 61 uses of section 213 sti1l only \n     accounts for less than 0.2% of the total search warrants \n     handled by the courts. Indeed, since the USA PATRIOT Act was \n     enacted on October 26, 2001, through January 31, 2005--a \n     period of more than 3 years--the Department has uti1ized a \n     delayed-notice search warrant only 155 times.\n       We have been working with United States Attorneys across \n     the country to refine our data and develop a more complete \n     picture of the usage of the section 213 authority. We have \n     manually surveyed each of the 94 United States Attorneys' \n     Offices for this information which, we understand, is not in \n     a database. We are pleased to report our additional findings \n     below.\n       In September 2003, the Department made public the fact that \n     we had exercised the authority contained in section 213 to \n     delay notification 47 times between October 2001, and Apri1 \n     1, 2003. Our most recent survey, which covers the time frame \n     between April 1, 2003, and January 31, 2005, indicates we \n     have delayed notification of searches in an additional 108 \n     instances. Since April 1, 2003, no request for a delayed-\n     notice search warrant has been denied. It is possible to \n     misconstrue this information as evidence that courts are \n     merely functioning as a ``rubber stamp'' for the Department's \n     requests. In reality, however, it is an indication that the \n     Department takes the authority codified by the USA PATRIOT \n     Act very seriously. We judiciously seek court approval only \n     in those rare circumstances--those that fit the narrowly \n     tailored statute--when it is absolutely necessary and \n     justified. As explained above, the Department estimates that \n     it seeks to delay notice of fewer than 1 in 500 search \n     warrants issued nationwide. To further buttress this point, \n     the 108 instances of section 213 usage between April 1, 2003, \n     and January 31, 2005, occurred in 40 different offices. And \n     of those 40 offices, 17 used section 213 only once. Looking \n     at it from another perspective over a longer time frame, 48 \n     U.S. Attorneys' Offices--or slightly more than half--have \n     never sought court permission to execute a delayed-notice \n     search warrant in their districts since passage of the USA \n     PATRIOT Act.\n       To provide further detail for your consideration, of the \n     108 times authority to delay notice was sought between April \n     1, 2003, and January 31, 2005, in 92 instances ``seriously \n     jeopardizing an investigation'' (18 U.S.C. Sec. 2705(a)(2)(E) \n     was relied upon as a justification for the application. And \n     in at least 28 instances, jeopardizing the investigation was \n     the sole ground for seeking court approval to delay \n     notification, including Operation Candy Box described above. \n     It is important to note that under S. 1709, the ``SAFE Act,'' \n     which was introduced in the 108th Congress, this ground for \n     delaying notice would be eliminated. Other grounds for \n     seeking delayed-notice search warrants were relied on as \n     follows: 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2705(a)(2)(A) (danger to life or \n     physical safety of an individual) was cited 23 times; 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2705(a)(2)(B) (flight from prosecution) was cited \n     45 times; 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2705(a)(2)(C) (destruction or \n     tampering with evidence) was cited 61 times; and 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2705(a)(2)(D) (intimidation of potential witnesses) was \n     cited 20 times. As is probably clear, in numerous \n     applications, U.S. Attorneys' Offices cited more than one \n     circumstance as justification for seeking court approval. \n     The bulk of uses have occurred in drug cases; but section \n     213 has also been used in many cases including terrorism, \n     identity fraud, alien smuggling, explosives and firearms \n     violations, and the sale of protected wildlife.\n       Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have also been \n     concerned about delayed notification of seizures and have \n     requested more detailed explanation of the number of times \n     seizures have been made pursuant to delayed-notice warrants. \n     The Department is pleased to provide the following \n     information.\n       Seizures can be made only after receiving approval of a \n     Federal judge that the government has probable cause to \n     believe the property or material to be seized constitutes \n     evidence of a criminal offense and that there is reasonable \n     necessity for the seizure. (See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3103a(b)(2)). \n     According to the same survey of all U.S. Attorneys' Offices, \n     the Department has asked a court to find reasonable necessity \n     for a seizure in connection with delayed-notice searches 45 \n     times between April 1, 2003, and January 31, 2005. In each \n     instance in which we have sought authorization from a court \n     during this same time frame, the court has granted the \n     request. Therefore, from the time of the passage of the USA \n     PATRIOT Act through January 31, 2005, the Department \n     exercised this authority 59 times. We previously, in May \n     2003, advised Congress that we had made 15 requests for \n     seizures, one of which was denied. In total, since the \n     passage of the USA PATRIOT Act, the Department has therefore \n     requested court approval to make a seizure and delay \n     notification 60 times. Most commonly, these requests related \n     to the seizure of illegal drugs. Such seizures were deemed \n     necessary to prevent these drugs from being distributed \n     because they are inherently dangerous to members of the \n     community. Other seizures have been authorized pursuant to \n     delayed-notice search warrants so that explosive material and \n     the operability of gun components could be tested, other \n     relevant evidence could be copied so that it would not be \n     lost if destroyed, and a GPS tracking device could be placed \n     on a vehicle. In short, the Department has sought seizure \n     authority only when reasonably necessary.\n       The length of the delay in providing notice of the \n     execution of a warrant has a1so received significant \n     attention from Members of Congress. The range of delay must \n     be decided on a case-by-case basis and is always dictated by \n     the approving judge or magistrate. According to the survey of \n     the 94 U.S. Attorneys' Offices, between April 1, 2003 and \n     January 31, 2005, the shortest period of time for which the \n     government has requested delayed-notice of a search warrant \n     was 7 days. The longest such specific period was 180 days; \n     the longest unspecified period was until ``further order of \n     the court'' or until the end of the investigation. An \n     unspecified period of time for delay was granted for six \n     warrants (four of these were related to the same case). While \n     no court has ever rejected the government's request for a \n     delay, in a few cases courts have granted a shorter time \n     frame than the period originally requested. For example, in \n     one case, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Arizona \n     sought a delay of 30 days, and the court authorized a shorter \n     delay of 25 days.\n       Of the 40 U.S. Attorneys' Offices that exercised the \n     authority to seek delayed-notice search warrants between \n     April 1, 2003, and January 31, 2005, just over half (22) of \n     the offices sought extensions of delays. Those 22 offices \n     together made approximately 98 appearances to seek additional \n     extensions. In certain cases, it was necessary for the \n     Offices to return to court on multiple occasions with respect \n     to the same warrant. One case bears note. The U.S. Attorney \n     in the Southern District of Illinois sought and received \n     approval to delay notification based on the fifth category of \n     adverse result--that immediate notification would seriously \n     jeopardize the investigation. The length of the delay granted \n     by the court was 7 days. However, the notification could not \n     be made within 7 days and the office was required to seek 31 \n     extensions. So, each week for almost eight straight months, \n     the case agent was made to swear out an affidavit, and the \n     Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) then had to reappear \n     before the judge or magistrate to renew the delay of notice.\n       In the vast majority of instances reported by the U.S. \n     Attorneys' Offices, original delays were sought for between \n     30 to 90 days. It is not surprising that our U.S. Attorneys' \n     Offices are requesting up to 90-day delays. Ninety days is \n     the statutory allowance under Title III for notification of \n     interception of wire or electronic communications (see 18 \n     U.S.C. 2518(8)(d). In only one instance did a U.S. Attorney's \n     Office seek a delay of a specified period of time longer than \n     90 days (180 days), and the court granted this request. In \n     another instance, an office sought a 90-day delay period, and \n     the court granted 180 days. In seven instances, the \n     Department sought delays that would last until the end of the \n     investigation. In only once instance was such a request \n     modified. In that matter, the court originally granted a 30-\n     day delay. However, when notification could not be made \n     within 30 days, the U.S. Attorney's Office returned to the \n     judge for an extension, and the judge granted an extension \n     through the end of the investigation, for a total of 406 \n     days. This is, according to our survey, the longest total \n     delay a court authorized. However, most extensions were \n     sought and granted for the same period as the original delay \n     requested.\n       In one case, a court denied a U.S. Attorney's Office's \n     request for an extension of the delay in providing notice. \n     This matter involved three delayed-notice search warrants--\n     all-stemming from the same investigation. The original period \n     of delay sought and granted was for 30 days on all three \n     warrants. The Office then sought 30-day extensions on all \n     three warrants out of concern that the multiple targets of \n     the investigation might flee to a foreign country if \n     notifie.d The court denied our request. The judge in the \n     matter reasoned that the need to delay notification warranted \n     only a 30-day stay of service, particularly in light of the\n\n[[Page S8227]]\n\n     fact that one of the targets of the investigation was, by \n     this time, in Federal custody in California on an unrelated \n     matter. At some point after notification was made, however, \n     the other targets fled to Mexico.\n       In sum, both before enactment of section 213 and after, \n     immediate notice that a search warrant had been executed has \n     been standard procedure. Delayed-notice search warrants have \n     been used for decades by law enforcement and, as demonstrated \n     by the numbers provided above, delayed-notice warrants are \n     used infrequently and scrupulously--only in appropriate \n     situations where immediate notice likely would harm \n     individuals or compromise investigations, and even then only \n     with a judge's express approval. The investigators and \n     prosecutors on the front lines of fighting crime and \n     terrorism should not be forced to choose between preventing \n     immediate harm--such as a terrorist attack or an influx of \n     illegal drugs--and completing a sensitive investigation that \n     might shut down an entire terror cell or drug trafficking \n     operation. Thanks to the long-standing availability of \n     delayed-notice warrants in these circumstances, they do not \n     have to make that choice. Section 213 enables us to better \n     protect the public from terrorists and criminals while \n     preserving Americans constitutional rights.\n       As you may be aware, the Department published a detailed \n     report last year that includes numerous additional examples \n     of how delaying notification of search warrants in certain \n     circumstances resulted in beneficial results. We have \n     enclosed a copy for your convenience.\n       If we can be of further assistance regarding this or any \n     other matter, please do not hesitate to contact this office.\n     Sincerely,\n                                             William E. Moschella,\n     Assistant Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 3, 2005.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: During the closed session of the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee on April 12, 2005, you requested \n     additional information regarding Section 213 of the USA \n     PATRIOT Act. Specifically, you inquired about examples of \n     where the ``seriously jeopardizing an investigation'' prong \n     was the sole ``adverse result'' used to request delayed \n     notice. In addition to Operation Candy Box, which was \n     detailed in our April 4, 2005, letter to the Committee, we \n     have described seven additional cases below. It is important \n     to note that the twenty-eight instances cited in our April 4 \n     letter do not equate to twenty-eight investigations or cases. \n     For example, some of the cases that used delayed-notice \n     search warrants utilizing the ``seriously jeopardize'' prong \n     involved multiple search warrants.\n       As we are sure you will agree, the following examples of \n     the use of delayed-notice search warrants illustrate not only \n     the appropriateness of the Department's use of this important \n     tool, but also its criticality to law enforcement \n     investigations.\n       Example #1: Western District of Pennsylvania:\n       The Justice Department obtained a delayed-notice search \n     warrant for a Federal Express package that contained \n     counterfeit credit cards. At the time of the search, it was \n     very important not to disclose the existence of a federal \n     investigation, as this would have revealed and endangered a \n     related Title III wiretap that was ongoing for major drug \n     trafficking activities. Originally, the Department was \n     granted a ten-day delay by the court; but the Department \n     sought and was granted eight extensions before notice could \n     be made.\n       An Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force \n     (``OCDETF''), which included agents from the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration (DEA), the Internal Revenue Service, and the \n     Pittsburgh Police Department, as well as from other state and \n     local law enforcement agencies, was engaged in a multi-year \n     investigation that culminated in the indictment of the \n     largest trafficking organization ever prosecuted in the \n     Western District of Pennsylvania. The organization was headed \n     by Oliver Beasley and Donald ``The Chief'' Lyles. A total of \n     fifty-one defendants were indicted on drug, money laundering \n     and firearms charges. Beasley and Lyles were charged with \n     operating a Continuing Criminal Enterprise as the leaders of \n     the organization. Both pleaded guilty and received very \n     lengthy sentences of imprisonment.\n       The Beasley/Lyle organization was responsible for bringing \n     thousands of kilograms of cocaine and heroin into Western \n     Pennsylvania. Cooperation was obtained from selected \n     defendants and their cooperation was used to obtain \n     indictments against individuals in New York who supplied the \n     heroin and cocaine. Thousands of dollars in real estate, \n     automobiles, jewelry and cash have been forfeited.\n       The case had a discernible and positive impact upon the \n     North Side of Pittsburgh, where the organization was based. \n     The DEA reported that the availability of heroin and cocaine \n     in this region decreased as the result of the successful \n     elimination of this major drug trafficking organization. In \n     addition, heroin overdose deaths in Allegheny County declined \n     from 138 in 2001 to 46 in 2003.\n       While the drug investigation was ongoing, it became clear \n     that several leaders of the drug conspiracy had ties to an \n     ongoing credit card fraud operation. An investigation into \n     the credit card fraud was undertaken, and a search was made \n     of a Fed Ex package that contained fraudulent credit cards. \n     Had the search into the credit card fraud investigation \n     revealed the ongoing drug investigation prematurely, the drug \n     investigation could have been seriously jeopardized. The \n     credit card investigation ultimately resulted in several \n     cases including US v. Larry Goolsby, Sandra Young (Cr. No. \n     02-74); US v. Lasaun Beeman, Derinda Daniels, Anna Holland, \n     Darryl Livsey and Kevin Livsey (Cr. No. 03-43); US v. Gayle \n     Charles (Cr. No. 03-77); US v. Scott Zimmerman, Lloyd Foster \n     (Cr. No. 03-44). All of the defendants charged with credit \n     card fraud were convicted except one, Lloyd Foster, who was \n     acquitted at trial. These cases have now concluded.\n       Example #2: Western District of Texas:\n       The Justice Department executed three delayed notice \n     searches as part of an OCDETF investigation of a major drug \n     trafficking ring that operated in the Western and Northern \n     Districts of Texas. The investigation lasted a little over a \n     year and employed a wide variety of electronic surveillance \n     techniques such as tracking devices and wiretaps of cell \n     phones used by the leadership. The original delay approved by \n     the court in this case was for 60 days. The Department sought \n     two extensions, one for 60 days and one for 90 days both of \n     which were approved.\n       During the wiretaps, three delayed-notice search warrants \n     were executed at the organization's stash houses. The search \n     warrants were based primarily on evidence developed as a \n     result of the wiretaps. Pursuant to section 213 of the USA \n     PATRIOT Act, the court allowed the investigating agency to \n     delay the notifications of these search warrants. Without \n     the ability to delay notification, the Department would \n     have faced two choices: (1) seize the drugs and be \n     required to notify the criminals of the existence of the \n     wiretaps and thereby end our ability to build a \n     significant case on the leadership or (2) not seize the \n     drugs and allow the organization to continue to sell them \n     in the community as we continued with the investigation. \n     Because of the availability of delayed-notice search \n     warrants, the Department was not forced to make this \n     choice. Agents seized the drugs, continued our \n     investigation, and listened to incriminating conversations \n     as the dealers tried to figure out what had happened to \n     their drugs.\n       On March 16, 2005, a grand jury returned an indictment \n     charging twenty-one individuals with conspiracy to \n     manufacture, distribute, and possess with intent to \n     distribute more than 50 grams of cocaine base. Nineteen of \n     the defendants, including all of the leadership, are in \n     custody. All of the search warrants have been unsealed, and \n     it is anticipated that the trial will be set sometime within \n     the next few months.\n       Example #3: District of Connecticut:\n       The Justice Department used section 213 of the USA PATRIOT \n     Act in three instances to avoid jeopardizing the integrity of \n     a pending federal investigation into a Connecticut drug \n     trafficking organization's distribution of cocaine base and \n     cocaine. The provision was used to place a global positioning \n     device on three vehicles.\n       These applications were submitted in the case of United \n     States v. Julius Moorning, et al. That case was indicted at \n     the end of April 2004, and 48 of 49 individuals charged have \n     been arrested. As of this date, 38 of the defendants have \n     entered guilty pleas, and several more are being scheduled. \n     The trial of the remaining defendants is scheduled to begin \n     on July 15. All defendants with standing to challenge any of \n     the orders obtained have entered guilty pleas.\n       The Justice Department believed that if the targets of the \n     investigation were notified of our use of the GPS devices and \n     our monitoring of them, the purpose of the use of this \n     investigative tool would be defeated, and the investigation \n     would be totally compromised. As it was, the principals in \n     the targeted drug-trafficking organization were highly \n     surveillance-conscious, and reacted noticeably to perceived \n     surveillance efforts by law enforcement. Had they received \n     palpable confirmation of the existence of an ongoing federal \n     criminal investigation, the Justice Department believed they \n     would have ceased their activities, or altered their methods \n     to an extent that would have required us to begin the \n     investigation anew.\n       In each instance, the period of delay requested and granted \n     was 90 days, and no renewals of the delay orders were sought. \n     And, as required by law, the interested parties were made \n     aware of the intrusions resulting from the execution of the \n     warrants within the 90 day period authorized by the court.\n       Example #4: Western District of Washington:\n       During an investigation of a drug trafficking organization, \n     which was distributing cocaine and an unusually pure \n     methamphetamine known as ``ice,'' a 30-day delayed-notice \n     search warrant was sought in April 2004. As a result of \n     information obtained through a wiretap as well as a drug-\n     sniffing dog, investigators believed that the leader of the \n     drug distribution organization was storing drugs and currency \n     in a storage locker in Everett, Washington. The warrant was \n     executed, and while no drugs or cash was found, an assault \n     rifle and ammunition were discovered. Delayed notice of the \n     search warrant's execution was necessary in order to protect \n     the integrity of other investigative techniques being used in \n     the case, such as a wiretap. The investigation ultimately led \n     to the indictment of twenty-seven individuals in\n\n[[Page S8228]]\n\n     the methamphetamine conspiracy. Twenty-three individuals, \n     including the leader, have pled guilty, three are fugitives, \n     and one is awaiting trial.\n       Example #5: Southern District of Illinois:\n       The Justice Department used section 213 of the USA PATRIOT \n     Act in an investigation into a marijuana distribution \n     conspiracy in the Southern District of Illinois. In \n     particular, in November 2003, a vehicle was seized pursuant \n     to authority granted under the provision.\n       During this investigation, a Title III wiretap was obtained \n     for the telephone of one of the leaders of the organization. \n     As a result of intercepted telephone calls and surveillance \n     conducted by DEA, it was learned that a load of marijuana was \n     being brought into Illinois from Texas. Agents were able to \n     identify the vehicle used to transport the marijuana. DEA \n     then located the vehicle at a motel in the Southern District \n     of Illinois and developed sufficient probable cause to apply \n     for a warrant to search the vehicle. It was believed, \n     however, that immediate notification of the search warrant \n     would disclose the existence of the investigation, resulting \n     in, among other things, phones being ``dumped'' and targets \n     ceasing their activities, thereby jeopardizing potential \n     success of the wiretaps and compromising the overall \n     investigation (as well as related investigations in other \n     districts). At the same time it was important, for the safety \n     of the community, to keep the marijuana from being \n     distributed.\n       The court approved the Department's application for a \n     warrant to seize the vehicle and to delay notification of the \n     execution of the search warrant for a period of seven days, \n     unless extended by the Court. With this authority, the agents \n     seized the vehicle in question (making it appear that the \n     vehicle had been stolen) and then searched it following the \n     seizure. Approximately 96 kilograms of marijuana were \n     recovered in the search. Thirty one seven-day extensions to \n     delay notice were subsequently sought and granted due to \n     the ongoing investigation.\n       As a result of this investigation, ten defendants were \n     ultimately charged in the Southern District of Illinois. \n     Seven of these defendants have pled guilty, and the remaining \n     three defendants are scheduled for jury trial beginning on \n     June 7, 2005.\n       Example #6: Eastern District of Wisconsin:\n       In a Wisconsin drug trafficking case, a delayed-notice \n     search warrant was issued under section 213 because immediate \n     notification would have seriously jeopardized the \n     investigation. In this case, the Department was in the final \n     stages of a two-year investigation, pre-takedown of several \n     individuals involved in the trafficking of cocaine. The \n     Department initially received a delayed-notice search warrant \n     for seven days, and thereafter received three separate seven-\n     day extensions. For each request, the Department showed a \n     particularized need that providing notice that federal \n     investigators had entered the home being searched would \n     compromise the informant and the investigation.\n       On February 14, 2004, the United States Attorney's Office \n     for the Eastern District of Wisconsin requested a search \n     warrant to look for evidence of assets, especially bank \n     accounts, at a suspect's residence as well as to attach an \n     electronic tracking device on a vehicle investigators \n     expected to find in the garage. The purpose of the device \n     would be to track the suspect and observe his meetings in the \n     final weeks before the takedown. The warrant also requested \n     delayed notice, based on the particularized showing that \n     providing notice that federal investigators had entered the \n     home would compromise an informant and the investigation. The \n     court issued the search warrant and granted the delayed \n     notification for a period of seven days. On February 15, \n     2004, authorized officers of the United States executed the \n     search warrant on the subject premises. However, agents were \n     unable to locate the vehicle to install the electronic \n     tracking device.\n       Before the expiration of the initial delayed-notice period, \n     the Department sought an extension of the delay based on the \n     showing that notice would compromise the informant and the \n     investigation. The court granted a seven-day extension, but \n     investigators were still unable to locate the suspect's \n     vehicle during this time. During this period, however, five \n     suspects were charged with conspiring to possess more than \n     five kilograms of cocaine, and arrest warrants were issued \n     for each of the individuals.\n       After the issuance of the arrest warrants, the Department \n     sought its third delay of notice to allow agents to endeavor \n     to install the electronic tracking device and to attempt to \n     locate the five suspects. Once again, the request was based \n     on the showing that notice would compromise the informant and \n     the investigation. The court granted another seven-day \n     extension, and agents were able to find a location where one \n     suspect appeared to be staying. After locating the suspect, \n     and before the expiration of the delayed-notice period, the \n     government requested a separate warrant for this location and \n     for other locations used by the conspirators. The Department \n     also requested its fourth and final delay in the notice \n     period to allow agents to execute the search warrants sought, \n     and to arrest the suspects. The court granted all requests \n     and the suspects were subsequently arrested. As required by \n     law, notice of the searches was given upon arrest.\n       Example #7: Eastern District of Washington:\n       In a drug trafficking and money laundering case in the \n     State of Washington, a delayed-notice search warrant was \n     issued under section 213 because immediate notification would \n     have seriously jeopardized the investigation. In this case, a \n     district judge had authorized the interception of wire and \n     electronic communications occurring over four cellular \n     telephones that were being used in furtherance of drug \n     trafficking and/or money laundering activities. On December \n     18, 2004, more than one month after the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration (DEA) began surveillance, DEA agents \n     administratively seized a black Ford Focus owned by one of \n     the suspects based on the determination that the vehicle \n     likely contained controlled substances.\n       On December 21, 2004, the DEA requested a warrant to search \n     the seized vehicle for drugs, and the court issued the \n     warrant based on the DEA's articulation of probable cause. On \n     the same day, the search warrant was executed on the \n     suspect's vehicle, which was still in the DEA's possession \n     pursuant to the administrative seizure. During the search, \n     agents located approximately two kilograms of suspected \n     cocaine and three pounds of suspected methamphetamine. At the \n     time, the service copy of the search warrant was ``served'' \n     on the vehicle.\n       Due to the nature of the investigation, which included the \n     orders authorizing the interception of wire and electronic \n     communications to and from a number of cellular telephones, \n     the DEA believed that both the continued administrative \n     seizure of the vehicle and notice of the execution of the \n     search warrant would greatly compromise the investigation. \n     Therefore, the DEA requested an order allowing them to remove \n     the served copy of the warrant from the vehicle, and delay \n     notice to the owner for sixty days in order to avoid \n     jeopardizing the ongoing criminal investigation. The court \n     granted the order, concluding that immediate notification \n     would compromise a major drug trafficking and money \n     laundering investigation.\n       Approximately twenty-five individuals have been indicted as \n     a result of this investigation (eight of whom are still \n     fugitives), and trial is scheduled for this October.\n       In closing, the Department of Justice believes it is \n     critical that law enforcement continue to have this vital \n     tool for those limited circumstances, such as those discussed \n     above, where a court finds good cause to permit the temporary \n     delay of notification of a search.\n       We hope the information provided above is helpful. Should \n     you require any further information, please do not hesitate \n     to contact this office.\n       Sincerely,\n                                             William E. Moschella,\n     Assistant Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 28, 2005.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter responds to your request for \n     more information regarding the use of section 213 of the USA \n     PATRIOT Act (``the Act''), which relates to delayed-notice \n     search warrants. The Department of Justice has provided the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee two letters detailing the specific \n     usage of delayed-notice search warrants. Those letters were \n     sent to the Committee on April 4, 2005, and May 3, 2005, \n     respectively. This letter is intended to supplement the \n     previous information we have already provided the Committee.\n       As you know, the Department believes very strongly that \n     section 213 is an invaluable tool in the war on terror and \n     our efforts to combat serious criminal conduct. In passing \n     the USA PATRIOT Act, Congress recognized that delayed-notice \n     search warrants are a vital aspect of the Department's \n     strategy of prevention: detecting and incapacitating \n     terrorists, drug dealers and other criminals before they can \n     harm our nation. Codified at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3103a, section \n     213 of the Act created an explicit statutory authority for \n     investigators and prosecutors to ask a court for permission \n     to delay notice temporarily that a search warrant was \n     executed.\n       Delayed-notice search warrants have been used by law \n     enforcement officers for decades. Such warrants were not \n     created by the USA PATRIOT Act. Rather, the Act simply \n     codified a common-law practice recognized by courts across \n     the country. Section 213 simply established a uniform \n     nationwide standard for the issuance of those warrants, thus \n     ensuring that delayed-notice search warrants are evaluated \n     under the same criteria across the nation. Like any other \n     search warrant, a delayed-notice search warrant is issued by \n     a federal judge only upon a showing that there is probable \n     cause to believe that the property to be searched for or \n     seized constitutes evidence of a criminal offense. A delayed-\n     notice warrant differs from an ordinary search warrant only \n     in that the judge specifically authorizes the law enforcement \n     officers executing the warrant to wait for a limited period \n     of time before notifying the subject of the search that a \n     search was executed.\n       In addition, investigators and prosecutors seeking a \n     judge's approval to delay notification must show that, if \n     notification were made contemporaneous to the search, there \n     is reasonable cause to believe one of the following adverse \n     results might occur: (1) notification would endanger the life \n     or physical safety of an individual; (2) notification would \n     cause flight from prosecution; (3) notification would result \n     in destruction of, or tampering with, evidence; (4) \n     notification would result in intimidation of potential \n     witnesses;\n\n[[Page S8229]]\n\n     or (5) notification would cause serious jeopardy to an \n     investigation or unduly delay a trial.\n       To be clear, it is only in these five tailored \n     circumstances that the Department may request judicial \n     approval to delay notification, and a federal judge must \n     agree with the Department's evaluation before approving any \n     delay.\n       Delayed-notice search warrants provide a crucial option to \n     law enforcement. If immediate notification were required \n     regardless of the circumstances, law enforcement officials \n     would be too often forced into making a ``Hobson's choice'': \n     delaying the urgent need to conduct a search and/or seizure \n     or conducting the search and prematurely notifying the target \n     of the existence of law enforcement interest in his or her \n     illegal conduct and undermine the equally pressing need to \n     keep the ongoing investigation confidential.\n       It is important to stress that in all circumstances the \n     subject of a criminal search warrant is informed of the \n     search. It is simply false to suggest, as some have, that \n     delayed-notice search warrants allow the government to search \n     an individual's ``houses, papers, and effects'' without \n     notifying them of the search. In every case where the \n     government executes a criminal search warrant, including \n     those issued pursuant to section 213, the subject of the \n     search is told of the search. With respect to delayed-notice \n     search warrants, such notice is simply delayed for a \n     reasonable period of time--a time period defined by a federal \n     judge.\n       Delayed-notice search warrants are constitutional and do \n     not violate the Fourth Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court \n     expressly held in Dalia v. United States that the Fourth \n     Amendment does not require law enforcement to give immediate \n     notice of the execution of a search warrant. Since Dalia, \n     three federal courts of appeals have considered the \n     constitutionality of delayed-notice search warrants, and all \n     three have upheld their constitutionality. To our knowledge, \n     no court has ever held otherwise. In short, long before the \n     enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act, it was clear that delayed \n     notification was appropriate in certain circumstances; that \n     remains true today. The USA PATRIOT Act simply resolved the \n     mix of inconsistent rules, practices and court decisions \n     varying from circuit to circuit. Therefore, section 213 had \n     the beneficial impact of mandating uniform and equitable \n     application of the authority across the nation.\n       The Department has provided the Committee with detailed \n     information regarding how often section 213 has been used. \n     Let us assure you again that the use of a delayed-notice \n     search warrant is the exception, not the rule. Law \n     enforcement agents and investigators provide immediate notice \n     of a search warrant's execution in the vast majority of \n     cases. According to Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts \n     (AOUSC), during the 36-month period ending September 30, \n     2004, U.S. District Courts handled 95,925 search warrants. By \n     contrast, in the 39-month period between the passage of the \n     USA PATRIOT Act and January 31, 2005, the Department used the \n     section 213 authority only 153 times according to a \n     Department survey. Even when compared to the AOUSC data for a \n     shorter period of time, the 153 uses of section 213 still \n     only account for less than 0.2% of the total search warrants \n     handled by the courts.\n       Specifically, you have inquired about examples of where the \n     ``seriously jeopardizing an investigation'' prong was the \n     sole ``adverse result'' used to request delayed notice. From \n     April 1, 2003, to January 31, 2005, the ``seriously \n     jeopardizing an investigation'' prong has been the sole \n     ground for requesting delayed notice in thirty-two instances. \n     Contrary to concerns expressed by some, this prong is not a \n     ``catch-all'' that is used in run-of-the-mill cases. The \n     Department estimates that fewer than one in 500 of the search \n     warrants that have been obtained since the passage of the \n     PATRIOT Act have been delayed-notice search warrants. In \n     other words, in over 499 of 500 cases, immediate notice was \n     provided. Moreover, fewer than one in three delayed-notice \n     search warrants obtained by the Department in the last two \n     years solely relied on the fact that immediate notification \n     would seriously jeopardize an investigation. Thus, fewer than \n     one in 1,500 search warrants relied solely on this prong, a \n     fact hardly consistent with the concern that the Department \n     will obtain a delayed-notice search warrant in the typical \n     case.\n       Of those thirty-two instances, delayed-notice search \n     warrants were used in a total of twenty-two investigations. \n     The thirty-two instances do not equate to thirty-two \n     investigations or cases because some of the cases that used \n     delayed-notice search warrants utilizing the ``seriously \n     jeopardize'' prong involved multiple search warrants. The \n     Department of Justice has provided the Committee detailed \n     descriptions of eight of the twenty-two investigations where \n     the ``seriously jeopardizing an investigation'' prong was the \n     sole ``adverse result'' used to request delayed notice. The \n     descriptions already provided include Operation Candy Box, \n     which was detailed in our April 4, 2005, letter to the \n     Committee, and seven additional cases described in a May 3, \n     2005 letter to the Committee. This letter is intended to \n     supplement the previous information we have provided by \n     detailing the seven remaining investigations that have been \n     unsealed, and identifying the seven remaining investigations \n     that are currently sealed. Two of the seven investigations \n     that remain under seal are terrorism-related.\n       As we are sure you will agree, the following examples of \n     the use of delayed-notice search warrants illustrate not only \n     the appropriateness of the Department's use of this vital \n     tool, but also its importance to law enforcement \n     investigations.\n       Example #9: Southern District of Illinois:\n       The United States Attorney's Office for the Southern \n     District of Illinois used a delayed-notice search warrant \n     pursuant to Title 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3103a in the investigation \n     of an OCDETF (Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force) \n     case. Although the Southern District of Illinois handled the \n     investigation, the search warrant application was filed by \n     the United States Attorney's Office in the Eastern District \n     of Missouri because the apartment to be searched was located \n     there. The search warrant was sought because a Title III \n     wiretap revealed that the house to be searched was being used \n     as a safehouse for those trafficking in drugs, and it was \n     believed that the notification of the search warrant would \n     seriously jeopardize the ongoing investigation into the drug \n     organization and its numerous members and frustrate the \n     identification of additional sources of supply. The search \n     warrant was issued by a Magistrate Judge in the Eastern \n     District of Missouri on April 6, 2004, for a period of 7 \n     days. No extensions were requested or authorized. The case \n     was indicted on November 18, 2004. One defendant has pled \n     guilty and thirteen defendants are awaiting trial.\n       Example #10: Northern District of Georgia:\n       The United States Attorney's Office for the Northern \n     District of Georgia used section 213 in a drug investigation \n     to delay notice of three search warrants in three locations. \n     A Title III wiretap had revealed that a drug dealer had three \n     stash locations, and the United States Attorney's Office \n     wanted to search those locations without tipping off the drug \n     dealers. A federal judge approved three delayed-notice search \n     warrants that yielded several kilos of cocaine, pounds of \n     ICE, a very pure form of methamphetamine, and firearms. The \n     agents were also able to photograph documentary evidence such \n     as ledgers. The use of the delayed-notice search warrant was \n     successful in cementing the case against the defendant, who \n     was indicted in April 2005.\n       Example #11: Northern District of Georgia:\n       The United States Attorney's Office for the Northern \n     District of Georgia also used section 213 in another drug \n     investigation. The DEA had obtained court approval to install \n     and monitor wiretaps of several cellular phones used by high-\n     level members of a Mexican cocaine and methamphetamine \n     distribution cell operating in Atlanta. While monitoring the \n     phones, the targets' conversations showed that they were \n     delivering 100 kilograms of cocaine to a purchaser. \n     Surveillance identified one of the stash houses from which \n     the targets obtained 14 kilograms of the cocaine, and the \n     conversations indicated that more of the cocaine was located \n     in the stash house. At that time, however, the investigation \n     and interceptions on the cell phones had not identified the \n     highest-level members of the cell, so the agents were not in \n     a position to make arrests and take down the organization. \n     The agents therefore needed to seize the cocaine while trying \n     to minimize the chances that the seizure would cause the \n     targets to cease usage of their cellular phones. \n     Investigators decided it was appropriate to seek a \n     delayed-notice warrant that would allow them access to the \n     stash house. A federal judge approved the warrant that \n     resulted in the seizure of 36 kilograms of cocaine, some \n     methamphetamines, and two weapons including a sawed-off \n     shotgun, without having to leave a copy of the warrant and \n     provide confirmation to the targets that they were being \n     watched by law enforcement. Since the subsequent arrests \n     of sixteen individuals for various drug-trafficking \n     charges in this investigation, two have pled guilty, three \n     have been sentenced, five are set for sentencing and six \n     are currently awaiting trial.\n       Example #12: Western District of New York:\n       Operation Trifecta was a Title III wiretap investigation \n     being conducted in the United States Attorney's Office for \n     the Southern District of New York, the Western District of \n     New York (WDNY OCDETF Operation Next of Kin) as well as in \n     U.S. Attorney's Offices in California, Ohio, and Arizona and \n     by law enforcement authorities in Mexico. As part of this \n     multi-district and international investigation, Title III \n     wiretap orders were obtained in each of the jurisdictions \n     involved in the investigation. In May 2003, information was \n     received as a result of a Title III interception order that \n     the targets of the investigation were arranging the \n     transportation of a vehicle (``load vehicle'') that was \n     believed to conceal a substantial quantity of cocaine by \n     transporting it on a car carrier. Once it was determined that \n     the car carrier would transport the load vehicle through the \n     Western District of New York, an application was made to \n     search the load vehicle. The magistrate judge that issued the \n     warrant also authorized delay in giving notice of the \n     execution of the search warrant pursuant to section 213 of \n     the USA PATRIOT Act.\n       Once the car carrier transporting the load vehicle arrived \n     in the Western District of New York, a local Sheriff's \n     Department deputy executed a traffic stop. It was discovered \n     that the VIN plate on the dashboard of the load vehicle \n     appeared to have been tampered with or replaced. As a result \n     of the suspect VIN plate, the load vehicle was removed\n\n[[Page S8230]]\n\n     from the car carrier, impounded and the car carrier was \n     allowed to proceed on its way. Thereafter, a delayed-notice \n     search warrant was executed on the load vehicle, resulting in \n     37 kilograms of cocaine being seized from it. After the \n     seizure of the load vehicle, conversations regarding efforts \n     to re-obtain the load vehicle were intercepted between the \n     subjects of the investigation. These efforts continued until \n     July 30, 2003, which was the takedown date for all aspects of \n     the investigation. Extensions of the order delaying notice \n     were obtained until the takedown date. Until they were \n     arrested, the subjects of the investigation were completely \n     unaware as to the actual reason why the load vehicle was \n     seized, and that the cocaine secreted in the load vehicle had \n     been located.\n       Obviously, had the subjects of the investigation received \n     notice that a search warrant had been obtained for the load \n     vehicle, this investigation would have been seriously \n     compromised. Delayed notice allowed the investigating \n     agencies to make a significant seizure of cocaine while at \n     the same time allowing the investigation, which had national \n     and international ramifications, to continue to its \n     successful conclusion. Twenty defendants were charged in the \n     Western District of New York, and all have pled guilty.\n       Example #13: Western District of New York:\n       As a result of investigations in the Western District of \n     New York, the Eastern District of California, and Canada, \n     including wiretaps in all three locations, information was \n     obtained that several defendants were involved in smuggling \n     large quantities of ephedrine, a listed chemical, from Canada \n     into the United States. There were four delayed-notice search \n     warrants issued in the case, which were all justified by the \n     ``seriously jeopardizing an investigation'' prong only; two \n     for premises that were believed to be ``stash houses'' for \n     ephedrine and money; and two for packages sent through the \n     U.S. and Canadian mail which were believed to also contain \n     contraband. All delayed-notice search warrants were issued \n     for 10 days on the grounds that providing notice would \n     adversely affect the investigation of this multi-district \n     case in that the Canadian wiretaps were still up, and a \n     series of arrests were planned for the week following the \n     search in a related drug case in the Eastern District of \n     California. The prosecution in this case is currently \n     pending.\n       Example #14: Western District of New York:\n       A delayed-notice search warrant was obtained for the \n     District of Maryland to open and photograph the contents of a \n     safe deposit box that the target, a Canadian citizen, was \n     allegedly using to store his proceeds of drug trafficking. \n     Following the sale of heroin by the target to undercover law \n     enforcement in Maryland, the target was followed back to the \n     U.S./Canada border and observed going to a bank in Niagara \n     Falls, New York before entering Canada. A search warrant was \n     obtained for the safe deposit box, and the money (identified \n     through prerecorded serial numbers) from the purchase of the \n     drugs was found in the box. The contents were photographed \n     but not seized. The notification was delayed until arrests \n     could be made in the case--a period of six months. This \n     target is currently a fugitive while other subjects of the \n     investigation were arrested in August 2003.\n       Example #15: Western District of Michigan:\n       The defendant in United States v. Eason was charged on \n     numerous drug-trafficking counts in indictments returned in \n     1995 and 1996, and was a fugitive until his arrest in July \n     2004. While the defendant was incarcerated and his case was \n     pending, information was discovered that the defendant was \n     corresponding with associates and family members through the \n     mail at the Kalamazoo County Jail in an attempt to intimidate \n     witnesses, obstruct justice or even contract for the murder \n     of a federal prosecutor. It was determined that the only way \n     to effectively obtain information about these threats was to \n     use a delayed-notice search warrant, which allowed agents to \n     copy the defendant's ingoing and outgoing mail and envelopes, \n     reseal the mail, and then forward the mail to the intended \n     recipient. The judge determined that notifying the defendant \n     of these actions would have seriously jeopardized the \n     investigation. Additional information concerning the \n     underlying threat investigation cannot be disclosed at this \n     time. The defendant was convicted on January 18, 2005 on \n     numerous drug-trafficking counts and faces a statutory range \n     of 20 years to life. His advisory United States Sentencing \n     Guideline range is life imprisonment.\n       Example #16: District of Maryland--Sealed.\n       Example #17: Northern District of Georgia--Sealed.\n       Example #18: Southern District of Iowa--Sealed. Two \n     delayed-notice search warrants were issued in this \n     investigation.\n       Example #19: Southern District of Ohio--Sealed.\n       Example #20: Southern District of Ohio--Sealed.\n       Example #21: Southern District of Texas--Sealed.\n       Example #22: Western District of New York--Sealed.\n       In sum, delayed-notice search warrants have been used for \n     decades by law enforcement and, as demonstrated by the \n     numbers and examples provided above, delayed-notice warrants \n     are used infrequently and scrupulously--only in appropriate \n     situations where immediate notice likely would harm \n     individuals or compromise investigations, and even then only \n     with a judge's express approval. The investigators and \n     prosecutors on the front lines of fighting crime and \n     terrorism should not be forced to choose between preventing \n     immediate harm--such as a terrorist attack or an influx of \n     illegal drugs--and completing a sensitive investigation that \n     might shut down an entire terror cell or drug trafficking \n     operation. Thanks to the long-standing availability of \n     delayed-notice warrants in these circumstances, they do not \n     have to make that choice. Section 213 enables us to better \n     protect the public from terrorists and criminals while \n     preserving Americans constitutional rights. The Department of \n     Justice believes it is critical that law enforcement continue \n     to have this vital tool for those limited circumstances, such \n     as those discussed above, where a court finds good cause to \n     permit the temporary delay of notification of a search.\n       We hope the information provided above is helpful.

A bill to reauthorize the Coral Reef Conservation Act of \n2000, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Coral Reef \nConservation Amendments Act of 2005, legislation to reauthorize and \nupdate the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000. I am pleased to be \njoined in this endeavor by Senator John Sununu, the new Chairman of the \nCommerce Committee's National Ocean Policy Study, who is also greatly \nconcerned about the fate of coral reefs and the future well-being of \nour coastal regions and resources.\n  Coral reefs, often called the ``rainforests of the sea,'' are among \nthe oldest and most diverse ecosystems on\n\n[[Page S8234]]\n\nthe planet. Covering less than one percent of the Earth's surface, \nthese fragile resources provide services worth billions of dollars each \nyear to the United States economy and economies worldwide. Coral reef \nresources provide economic and environmental benefits in the form of \nfood, jobs, natural products, pharmaceuticals, and shoreline \nprotection. In Hawaii, reef-related activities generate $360 million \neach year for the State's economy, and the overall worth of our reefs \nhas been estimated at close to $10 billion.\n  However, these reefs are also under pressure from some 1.2 million \nresidents and the seven million tourists visiting each year. Threats \nrange from land-based sources of pollution, overfishing, recreational \noveruse, alien species introduction, marine debris, coral bleaching and \nthe increased acidity of our oceans. Despite these impacts, there are \nstill remote coral reefs that are largely intact, such as those in the \nNorthwestern Hawaiian Islands. The continued conservation and study of \nthese isolated reefs is necessary for understanding healthy coral reef \necosystems and restoring impacted ecosystems.\n  The reefs of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands are an important \nnesting and breeding site for many endangered and threatened species. A \nFederal public designation process is underway to manage these areas as \na National Marine Sanctuary, under a science-based management scheme \nthat will accommodate multiple uses while achieving the necessary \nconservation goals. Increased funding and expanded Federal, State and \nlocal partnerships in this area have resulted in monitoring, mapping, \nand research programs have improved our understanding of the spatial \nand temporal dynamics of Hawaiian reefs which can be used to guide \nconservation and management decisions.\n  Through this reauthorization, we can build upon lessons learned in \nHawaii and other areas and apply them throughout the United States. A \nmere five years ago, Congress took its first step toward addressing \ncoral reef declines by authorizing legislation that provided targeted \nfunding to advance our understanding and capacity to address threats to \ncoral reefs. Since then, strong support for these programs around the \ncountry, as well as focused funding, have given us much information \nthat will help us strengthen and refocus the legislation. The report of \nthe U.S. Ocean Commission has further underscored the urgent need to \nimprove management and conservation of coral reefs from a variety of \nthreats. Our hearing on coral threats last month provided additional \nrecommendations for changes to move from monitoring to action to \nimprove coral conservation.\n  The Coral Reef Amendments Act of 2005 responds to these \nrecommendations by increasing annual authorizations under the Coral \nReef Conservation Act, starting at $30 million in fiscal year 2006, and \nincreasing to $35 million in fiscal year 2009 to 2012. This roughly \ndoubles the authorization levels in the existing act. It also gives \npriority attention to local action strategies and territorial needs, as \nwell as on prevention of physical damage from vessel impacts. A new $8 \nmillion Community-Based Planning Grants program is included to \nencourage and enhance on-the-ground efforts to develop and implement \ncoral management and protection plans, working through appropriate \nFederal and State management agencies. I am particularly pleased that \nthis grant program will encourage adoption of traditional and island-\nbased management approaches, many of which have a long history in the \nPacific region.\n  The bill also fills a gap in authority needed for NOAA to respond to \nvessel groundings on coral reefs, damage that compounds over time if \nleft unaddressed. Grounded vessels have remained on reefs, and have \nbeen a particular problem, when there is no viable owner or when the \ngrounding occurs under circumstances that do not allow for response \nunder authorities such as the National Marine Sanctuaries Act or the \nOil Pollution Act. The July 2, 2005, grounding of the survey vessel \nCASITAS in the remote Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, and the damage \ncaused in American Samoa several years ago when a typhoon drove 9 \nabandoned fishing vessels onto reefs in Pago Pago harbor, highlight the \nvulnerability of coral reefs to groundings, and limitations of existing \nlaw and funding.\n  The bill responds to these needs by giving NOAA statutory authority \nto respond on an emergency basis to prevent or mitigate coral reef \ndestruction from vessel or other physical impacts, including damage \ncaused by natural disasters. The bill also authorizes NOAA to use Coral \nReef Conservation Funds for these purposes, and encourages leveraging \nresources and assistance from other Federal agencies, as well as \nprivate sources. To assist in preventing future groundings, the bill \nauthorizes NOAA to establish a vessel grounding inventory, identify \nreefs outside National Marine Sanctuaries that are at risk, and \nrecommend measures that may be used to prevent future groundings, such \nas navigational aids or beacons to warn mariners.\n  Finally, the bill specifically directs NOAA to coordinate on the \nfederal, state, and local levels to implement the U.S. National Coral \nAction Strategy.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1390\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Coral Reef Conservation \n     Amendments Act of 2005.''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Toxic Substances Control Act to reduce \nthe exposure of children, workers, and consumers to toxic chemical \nsubstances; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Child, \nWorker and Consumer Safe Chemicals Act of 2005. Senators Jeffords, \nBoxer, Kerry, Corzine, Clinton and Kennedy are cosponsors of this \nlegislation.\n  Every day, Americans use household products that contain hundreds of \nchemicals. Most people assume that those chemicals have been proven \nsafe for their families and children. Unfortunately, that assumption is \nwrong. Many chemicals that have been in use for decades have never been \ntested for their health effects.\n  Over 40 years ago Rachel Carson, in her book Silent Spring, warned \nabout the danger of using chemicals that had not been fully tested. \nToday, nearly all of those same chemicals are still being used--yet to \nthis day most of them have never been tested for their health effects.\n  Many of these chemicals perform amazing services and make our lives \neasier. But in recent years study after study has raised concerns about \nsome of the chemicals that are used in thousands of products.\n  For instance, take the common baby bottle. Many baby bottles contain \nthe chemical ``Bisphenol A'' which at very low doses has been shown to \naffect reproduction, the immune system, brain chemistry, behavior and \nmore. How great is the risk of using Bisphenol A in baby bottles, water \nbottles and other everyday products? The answer is ``we don't know.''\n  Mothers have every right to expect their babies to be safe from \nexposure to toxic chemicals--before and after birth. We have laws to \nmake sure that pesticides and medicines are safe--and even toys. But we \nfail to require similar assessments for the chemicals used in baby \nbottles, water bottles, food packages and thousands of other products. \nThis is inexcusable.\n\n[[Page S8236]]\n\n  But the current law, known as ``Toxic Substances Control Act'' (TSCA) \nactually sets up roadblocks to EPA getting the vital information it \nneeds to determine whether these chemicals are safe. So last year, I \nasked the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to assess TSCA to \ndetermine how effective it has been in doing the job of protecting \npublic health and the environment.\n  In the GAO report released today, Chemical Regulation: Options Exist \nto Improve EPA's Ability to Assess Health Risks and Manage its Chemical \nReview Program, we learn that TSCA is such an ineffective and \nburdensome law that it often fails to protect our children, workers and \nthe general population from exposure to carcinogens such as asbestos--\nfor which there is no safe level of exposure.\n  According to the GAO, only five chemicals that existed 29 years ago \nwhen Congress passed TSCA have ever been restricted by EPA. In 29 \nyears, the agency has formally requested health and environmental \neffects information on just 200 chemicals--out of about 80,000.\n  The GAO reports, ``EPA does not routinely assess existing chemicals \nand has limited information on their health and environmental risks.'' \nIt adds, ``EPA lacks sufficient data to ensure that potential health \nand environmental risks of new chemicals are identified.''\n  Children are the most sensitive population to chemical pollutants and \nwe must protect that sacred bond between a mother and her child. Again, \nit is inexcusable that our laws require extensive data to approve \npesticides and pharmaceuticals as safe--but fail to require similar \nanalysis for the chemicals used in baby bottles, water bottles, food \npackages and thousands of other products.\n  That is why today I am introducing The Child-Safe Chemicals Act. My \nbill will establish a safety standard that each chemical on the market \nmust meet. It shifts the burden for proving that chemicals are safe \nfrom EPA to the chemical manufacturers. Under my bill, the \nmanufacturers must provide the EPA with whatever data it needs to \ndetermine if a chemical use meets the safety standard. And the bill \nstrengthens EPA's authority to restrict the use of chemicals which fail \nto meet that standard.\n  I have ten grandchildren . . . and I believe we have a sacred duty to \nprotect the health of infants and children. I agree with Daniel \nMaguire, a professor of religious ethics at Marquette University who \nstated, ``As a principle of ethics, whatever is good for kids is good; \nwhatever is bad for kids is ungodly.''\n  My bill has been endorsed by the American Public Health Association \nand many of the nation's leading pediatricians. The American people \nhave a right to assume that the products they use are safe. This bill \nwill help guarantee that right.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Kid Safe \nChemicals Act with Senators Lautenberg, Boxer, Kerry, Corzine, Clinton \nand Kennedy. The purpose of the bill is simple--improve children's \nhealth by reducing exposure to harmful toxic chemicals in everyday \nconsumer products.\n  Synthetic chemicals play an integral role in the US economy and in \nenhancing our quality of life. Yet--like most Americans--I assumed \nbasic safeguards were in place to ensure that chemicals widely used in \nhousehold products were first determined to be safe. Sadly, this \nassumption is false.\n  A new report, issued today by the Government Accountability Office, \nshows that most chemicals used in consumer products today have never \nundergone any Federal safety review. Further, the report demonstrates \nthat EPA lacks the necessary legal tools to protect our children from \nharmful chemicals. The report, which I requested along with Senators \nLautenberg and Leahy, is titled ``Chemical Regulation: Options Exist to \nImprove EPA's Ability to Assess Health Risks and Manage its Chemical \nReview Program.''\n  To all people who care about our children's health, GAO's conclusions \nshould be a call to action. Three findings merit particular attention.\n  First, GAO found that ``EPA does not routinely assess the human \nhealth and environmental risks of existing chemicals and faces \nchallenges obtaining the information necessary to do so.'' For example, \nthe Agency has required testing for fewer than 200 of the 62,000 \nchemicals used in commerce since EPA began reviewing chemicals in 1979.\n  Additionally, GAO found that ``EPA's reviews of new chemicals provide \nlimited assurance that health and environmental risks are identified \nbefore the chemicals enter commerce.'' According to the report, \nchemical companies generally do not test new chemicals for toxicity or \ngauge human exposure levels before they are submitted for EPA review, \nforcing the Agency to rely on predictive modeling that ``does not \nensure that the chemicals' risks are fully assessed before they enter \ncommerce.''\n  Finally, even when EPA has toxicity and exposure information on \nchemicals showing significant health risks, GAO found that the Agency \nhas difficulty overcoming the legal hurdles needed to take action. As a \nresult, in almost three decades, EPA has issued regulations to ban or \nlimit the production or restrict the use of only five chemicals.\n  Our toxic ignorance would be less alarming if it wasn't coupled with \noverwhelming evidence of widespread human exposure. Study after study--\nincluding those by the Centers for Disease Control--have found a \ncocktail of synthetic chemicals in the blood and tissue of most people \ntested. For example, bio-monitoring studies have found Bisphenyl A, a \nchemical used in plastic baby pacifiers, water bottles, and food and \nbeverage containers, in 95 percent of people tested. Similarly, \nchemicals such as P-FOA, which is used in non-stick Teflon pans, and \npolybrominated diphenyl ethers, used as flame retardants, are regularly \nfound in breast milk and fetal liver tissue.\n  To be clear, the health effects of these chemicals are unknown. \nUnknown because no one is required to look. We do know, however, that \nmost of us are carrying in our bodies dozens--if not hundreds--of \nsynthetic chemicals to which our grandparents were never exposed. We \nalso know that the incidence of certain cancers and neurological and \ndevelopmental disorders linked to chemical exposure are on the rise.\n  The Kid Safe Chemical Act would fundamentally overhaul the nation's \nchemical management framework. First, it would protect kids by \nrequiring chemical manufacturers to perform basic testing of their \nproducts. Second, it would reduce our toxic ignorance by providing much \nneeded hazard and exposure information to EPA and the public. Third, \nusing a science based, worst-first priority system, EPA would be \nrequired to determine the safety of 300 chemicals within the next five \nyears. By 2020, all chemicals distributed in commerce would need to \nmeet the safety standard.\n  To avoid imposing an undue burden on industry, the Kid Safe Chemicals \nAct relies on essentially the same safety standard as the Food Quality \nProtection Act, which passed the Gingrich-Lott Congress unanimously and \nwhich chemical manufacturers themselves have complied with for the past \ndecade. In short, chemical manufacturers would need to establish to EPA \nthat there was ``a reasonable certainty of no harm'' before \ndistributing their chemicals in commerce. A ten-fold safety factor \nwould be built in to account for the unique sensitivity of children.\n  Finally, the Kid Safe Chemicals Act encourages innovation of less \ntoxic chemicals by removing existing disincentives and initiating a \nsafer alternatives and green chemistry program.\n  As a result, the bill has been endorsed by a wide array of public \nhealth groups, such as the Breast Cancer Fund, the Center for \nChildren's Environmental Health, and the American Public Health \nAssociation.\n  I believe that the Kid Safe Chemicals Act represents a rational, \ncommon sense approach to reducing children's exposure to toxic \nchemicals.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 1392. A bill to reauthorize the Federal Trade Commission; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Dorgan to \nintroduce the FTC Reauthorization Act of 2005.\n  As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Trade, Tourism, and\n\n[[Page S8237]]\n\nEconomic Development, I am pleased to have Senator Dorgan, the ranking \nmember of the subcommittee join me to introduce this important bill. \nOur subcommittee has jurisdiction over the Federal Trade Commission and \nits missions and this legislation would reauthorize the FTC from fiscal \nyear 2006 through 2010.\n  The FTC reauthorization bill is important for the FTC to carry out \nits critical mission of preventing unfair competition and protecting \nconsumers from unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the \nmarketplace.\n  The responsibility to protect consumers is quite broad and includes a \nwide array of deception and unfair business practices, including price \nfixing, telemarketing fraud, Internet scams, and consumer identity \ntheft.\n  As a product of its responsibilities, the FTC plays a vital role in \nmaintaining integrity in the marketplace and strengthening our economy.\n  This legislation authorizes appropriations to fund the FTC's \noperations including moneys for efforts to secure data privacy and to \ncombat spyware and identity theft. These are areas that have posed an \nincreased threat to consumers recently, affecting millions of consumers \nwith a pricetag to society in the billions of dollars.\n  The services and protections the FTC performs for consumers are \ninvaluable and we need to pass an authorization bill, which it has \noperated without since 1998.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and its expeditious \npassage through the Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1392\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representative of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``FTC Reauthorization Act of \n     2005.''\n\n     SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION.\n\n       The text of section 25 of the Federal Trade Commission Act \n     (15 U.S.C. 57c) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out the \n     functions, powers, and duties of the Commission not to exceed \n     $213,000,000 for fiscal year 2006, $241,000,000 for fiscal \n     year 2007, $253,000,000 for fiscal year 2008, $264,000,000 \n     for fiscal year 2009, and $276,000,000 for fiscal year \n     2010.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VITTER:\n  S. 1393. A bill to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act to provide for reimbursement of certain for-\nprofit hospitals; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Hospital Emergency \nReimbursement Act of 2005. This bill will help ensure the safety of \nmany patients, elderly residents, and those who require critical care \nduring the event of a hurricane or other disaster.\n  Each year, natural disasters place millions of Americans in harm's \nway. Hurricanes, floods, and other hazards pose a particular danger to \npeople with special needs. Many patients depend on technology to keep \nthem alive. For them, electricity is a necessity that makes lengthy \nevacuations a life-threatening race against the clock. These patients \nmust be sheltered in medical facilities with reliable power generators \nthat will perform during a severe storm and during the immediate \nrecovery period after the storm.\n  Providing for their safety is precisely why I am introducing the \nHospital Emergency Reimbursement Act. This bill will enable the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, under certain circumstances, to reimburse \nprivate for-profit hospitals that shelter special needs patients during \nfederally declared disasters.\n  Currently, FEMA only has the authority to reimburse a hospital for \nsheltering if it is a public or nonprofit institution. However, the \nnumber of these facilities is shrinking in many communities. The \nguidelines for providing assistance must acknowledge this reality. Last \nyear in Louisiana, two people with critical needs died in transit from \nNew Orleans to a temporary public facility in Baton Rouge in the \nevacuation for Hurricane Ivan. With every storm or evacuation order, \ntens of thousands of families with relatives in critical condition \nscramble to make arrangements to protect their loved ones.\n  By allowing reimbursement to additional private facilities, the \nHospital Emergency Reimbursement Act of 2005 would promote the safety \nof Americans around the Nation by allowing greater flexibility during \nan emergency. The amount of reimbursement provided by FEMA under this \nbill would be limited to the same amount available to public and \nnonprofit facilities. Furthermore, funds would be available to for-\nprofit hospitals when public and nonprofit facilities within a 30-mile \nradius have met or exceeded their capacity. Under this measure, public \nand non-profits still are used first for emergency needs, with private \nfor-profit hospitals available as backup to ensure that everyone in a \nmedically critical condition is covered.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Hospital Emergency Assistance Act \nof 2005.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/13/senate-section/article/S8237-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n.\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 197--TO COMMEMORATE THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n TRINITY TEST, THE CULMINATION OF THE MANHATTAN PROJECT, AND TO HONOR \n                    THE PEOPLE WHO MADE IT POSSIBLE\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Crapo) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, next week, on Saturday, July 23, people of \nall ages will gather for a special 5K race in Alliance, OH. This race \nwill benefit the Megan Adelman-Tenny Foundation, which was set up in \nmemory of Army PFC Megan Adelman-Tenny, who was killed in an airborne \ntraining accident on January 25, 2005, when her parachute failed to \nopen. She was 19 years old.\n  This foundation will award an annual scholarship to a high school \nstudent who has participated in cross-country, has lettered in the \nsport, and who possesses the same attributes that made Megan such a \nspecial person. I rise today to pay tribute to Megan and to celebrate \nthose attributes--her zest for life, her zeal for organization, and her \nunmatched competitiveness.\n  According to her mother Melissa, Megan grew up as a ``tomboyish'' \ngirl. She was always outside, riding her bike or rollerblading. She \nnever backed down from her older siblings and twin- brother, Matt. She \nwas always speaking her mind and asserting her will. Her sister, Tina, \ndescribes her as ``energetic and full of life. She was a kick-butt \ngirl. She took no prisoners. She didn't let anything hold her back.''\n  Indeed, Megan was someone who lived her life to the fullest. At \nAlliance High School, Megan played the violin, sang in the choir, and \nran on the cross-country team. Starting her sophomore year, Megan also \nworked part-time at McDonald's. Her involvement in all these activities \nleft her just enough time to spend with her junior high and high school \nsweetheart--the love of her life--Joshua Tenny.\n  As a testament to Megan's penchant for living in the moment, she and \nJoshua eloped on December 22, 2004. Her older brother, Marcus, \nremembers the surprising elopement:\n\n       I picked Megan and Joshua up, and we were driving to the \n     Best Buy store in Canton, and Megan told me they needed to \n     make a stop first because they wanted to get married. So, we \n     went to the municipal building in Canton. They filled out all \n     the paperwork for their marriage license and were getting \n     excited. . . . It was spur-of-the-moment, but they wanted to \n     get married and be together.\n\n  While Megan lived her life as it came to her, she was also the type \nof person who made plans, set goals, and did her best to fulfill them.\n  As a member of the cross-country team, Megan took responsibility for \npacking the medical bag, organizing meets, and taking care of her twin- \nbrother. According to their mom, Megan acted as another mother to Matt. \nShe cooked for him, cleaned his room, and packed his cross-country bag \nbefore meets.\n  In addition to being exceptionally organized, Megan was also a fierce \ncompetitor. In junior high school, she faced the choice between two \nsports: basketball and cross-country. Megan decided to join the cross-\ncountry team, an individual sport in which the athletes must compete \nwith other runners, as well as their own bodies.\n  Megan excelled. She was a fantastic runner, qualifying for the State \nmeet three times. She was a leader on her team and inspired others to \ndo their best. Her track coach, Al Eibel, remembers Megan as a hard \nworker who never complained. During the 2002 season, Megan was clipped \nby a car mirror while on a practice road-run. Though she didn't break \nit, her arm was badly bruised and swollen. Even though she could barely \nmove her arm, Megan competed a few days later. Coach Eibel recalls \nMegan's perseverance:\n\n       I know she was in pain, but she didn't say a word. She ran, \n     and by districts, she was fine. Everyone knew we'd always be \n     able to count on Megan.\n\n  Upon graduating from high school, Megan knew that it wasn't the right \ntime for her to go to college. She didn't feel particularly drawn to it \nand, with two siblings already attending Ohio University, Megan knew it \nwould be a financial hardship for her family. Instead of college, Megan \nmade a plan to serve 4 years in the Army, with her husband Joshua, and \nthen start a family. She reserved a place for college at a later time, \nif she felt inclined to go.\n  Her mother remembers Megan's decision to join the Army:\n\n       She thought about it and came to the conclusion she was \n     going to do it. And, she went in and did it with gusto.\n\n  Megan completed advanced individual specialty training in human \nresources and was part of the 82nd Airborne at Fort Bragg, NC. Megan's \norganizational skills and attention to detail allowed her to breeze \nthrough basic training. At one point, she even mentioned to her mother \nthat she might want to become a drill sergeant. Her mother said:\n\n       Well, you're bossy and you're organized--I don't see what \n     would keep you from doing it.\n\n  It didn't surprise anyone when Megan was the strongest woman and \nfastest person in her basic training unit. She earned the nickname \n``Speedy Gonzales'' from others in her unit because of her running \nability. Megan was not someone who held back when it came to \ncompetition and she never backed down from anyone or anything.\n  Her brother, Marcus remembers Megan crying during boot-camp, not \nbecause it was difficult, but because she felt others were not taking \nit as seriously as she was. That's just the type of person Megan was. \nShe was passionate about the things and the people she cared about.\n  Marcus talked to his sister after she had completed her first \ntraining jump with the 82nd Airborne. Megan, who was always something \nof a daredevil, had ``loved the jump.'' She told her brothers and \nsister that they would have to try sky diving with her. Megan was also \nextremely excited about her next jump and her career in the Army. \nFrankly, Megan was just excited about life.\n  Any person who devotes a large part of their time and effort to \ncompetitive running has probably seen the movie ``Chariots of Fire.'' \nIn the film, one of the characters asks the question: ``[W]here does \nthe power come from to see the race to its end?'' The answer to this \nquestion is, ``From within.''\n  Megan Adelman-Tenny had that power, that passion, that drive from \nwithin, which allowed her to accomplish anything she set her mind to. \nShe was someone who, like any good runner, took things step by step, \nwhile also keeping the finish line in sight.\n  On July 23, many people will run and walk 5 kilometers in memory of \nMegan. And, with each step taken, they honor her life.\n  As I think about Megan's short, but full life, I am reminded of a \nvery familiar passage from the Bible, a passage from St. Paul's second \nletter to Timothy, in which St. Paul said:\n\n       [T]he time of my departure has come. I have fought the good \n     fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith.\n\n  There is no question, Megan Adelman-Tenny fought the good fight. She \nfinished the course. She kept the faith. Megan was truly a wonderful \nyoung woman, whom we will never forget.\n  My wife, Fran, and I continue to keep Megan's husband, Joshua, her \nparents, Mark and Melissa, her sister Tina, and brothers Marcus and \nMatt in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/13/senate-section/article/S8239-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8239-S8240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n.\n\n\n                  MARINE CORPORAL RICHARD GILBERT, JR.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Marine Cpl \nRichard Gilbert, Jr., from Dayton, OH, who gave his life in the defense \nof freedom on January 26, 2005. Richard lost his life in a helicopter \naccident near the town of Rutba, Iraq. Thirty-one service members lost \ntheir lives in this tragic accident.\n  Having just completed major operations in Fallujah, Richard and his \nunit were on their way to help secure Iraq for the upcoming elections. \nThey sacrificed their lives standing up for freedom and standing \nagainst terror and tyranny. Like his comrades who perished with him, \nRichard Gilbert gave his body, will, and soul to his country and for \nhis country. For that I wish to honor him this evening.\n  Richard Gilbert was born on May 12, 1978. He was a caring boy, who \nloved animals and being outdoors. He hated when people cried. His \nmother, Helen, recalls that if Richard saw anyone around him crying, he \nwould go over to them, throw one of his small arms\n\n[[Page S8240]]\n\naround their shoulders, and tell them it was ``ok.''\n  As Richard grew up, he made friends, played Little League, and \nfollowed his favorite sports teams. He was an avid fan of the \nUniversity of Dayton Flyers basketball team and The Ohio State \nUniversity football team. His support of the Buckeye's football team, \nhowever, caused a bit of tension in the Gilbert home every year in the \nlate fall. It seems Richard's brother was a Michigan Wolverines fan and \naccording to their mother, when the Wolverines and the Buckeye's \nsquared off, ``You didn't even want to be near the house when those \nboys watched the game!''\n  When Richard wasn't discussing football with his brother, he was \noften found discussing something with somebody. He was an incredibly \narticulate and intelligent young man, able to spout facts about \nanything from sports to religion to politics. His friends would often \ncall Richard over if they were having a dispute and needed someone with \nthe knowledge to settle it.\n  Richard also loved music. He was a self-taught guitarist, who \ncomposed his own music. According to friends, he loved heavy metal and \nhe was always at peace when composing or playing his guitar.\n  Of all his interests, however, Richard's greatest love was of \npolitics. After discovering that President Harry Truman was one of his \ndistant cousins, Richard made it his goal to ascend one day to that \nsame office. His passion for politics earned him the nickname ``The \nGovernor'' from his friends, and his mother jokingly recalls that, \n``[h]e was a natural-born politician. When you asked him a question, \nhe'd talk for a half-hour and never give you an answer!''\n  Richard had hopes of running either for Mayor of Dayton or the Dayton \nCity Commission after he returned from Iraq. I remember being at \ncalling hours and talking with people who told me about his \naspirations, and how they thought he would be a great politician, a \ngreat public servant. He would have been great in either position.\n  Richard was, like many of our service men and women, deeply affected \nby the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Prior to the attacks, \nhe was working on the assembly line at Behr Dayton Thermal Products. He \nhad just purchased a house, not far from his mother. Richard was also \nstudying political science at Sinclair Community College. He had \nthought about joining the military, but had held back because he didn't \nwant to cut his long hair.\n  After September 11, however, Richard saw a clear duty to his country \nand to protecting all of us from future threats. In December 2001, he \njoined the Marines, where he was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 3rd \nMarine Regiment, of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit based in Hawaii. \nHis lifelong friend, Marine SSgt Lonnie McMurchy, remembers the phone \ncall he got from Richard. Lonnie tried to talk him out of the Marine \ninfantry, telling Richard that his intelligence would be more valuable \nin another area that might also be less dangerous, but, according to \nLonnie, ``He wanted it. He wanted the infantry. He wanted to go fight \n[and] defend our country.''\n  In joining the Marines, Richard stood up for freedom, leaving behind \na good paying job, a new house, and his beloved friends and family. He \nput his life on hold so that we could safely go on with our own.\n  Richard served our Nation with a dedication and fervor that was \nnoteworthy even to one of his fellow Marines. According to JJ Holmes, \nwho wrote in an email message on an Internet tribute to Richard:\n\n       I served with Gilbert, and we became very good friends, \n     which is saying a lot, because I didn't make many good \n     friends while I was in the Marines. I guess it's because I'm \n     picky about the company I keep. And it doesn't get much \n     better than Gilbert to have as a friend. We had very \n     different religious and political views, yet it never \n     hindered our relationship, because we had a mutual respect \n     for each other.\n       I know this though, out of all the Marines in our Company, \n     Gilbert never complained once about his duty to his country. \n     I could see every day I spent with him how proud he was to \n     serve. Not to diminish the belief of all the other Marines in \n     their duty, Gilbert shined a little more. His dedication was \n     unwavering. [He was] an example to all Marines. I know \n     without a doubt through our conversations we had sitting on \n     the backs of our packs waiting to move out, that if Gilbert \n     had to go, he wanted to leave us the way he did--fighting for \n     the country he believed in more than anything.\n\n  As a child, Richard wrote an essay about his father, Richard Gilbert, \nSr., who was a Vietnam veteran. In the essay, Richard described his dad \nas a hero. Today, Mr. Gilbert says this of his son: ``[H]e was my hero, \nand he was the bravest person I ever met.''\n  This sentiment was echoed by his friend, Lonnie McMurchy: ``He was a \nwarrior. He was a son, a brother, an uncle, a friend, and a U.S. \nMarine. He wanted nothing more and nothing less.''\n  Richard Gilbert wanted our country to be safe from the dangers of \nterrorism, and he wanted the Iraqi people to be safe and free. He gave \neverything he had for those things, as they were the things in which he \nso firmly believed. Richard stood so that freedom could flourish. We \nwill never forget his service and his sacrifice.\n  My wife, Fran, and I continue to keep his family and friends in our \nthoughts and in our prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/13/senate-section/article/S8240-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8240-S8241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n.\n\n\n                  ARMY SERGEANT CHARLES ``CHUCK'' WEBB\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this evening I honor the life of Army SGT \nCharles ``Chuck'' Webb, from Hamilton, OH. Chuck was a member of \nCompany A, 82nd Engineering Battalion, 1st Infantry, Division, based \nout of Bamberg, Germany. On November 3, 2004, Sergeant Webb was killed \nnear Salman Pak, Iraq, when a roadside bomb detonated. He was 9 days \nshy of his 23rd birthday.\n  Days before his death, Chuck had told his squad that he didn't want \nthem in harm's way if he could help it and that he would be taking the \nlead whenever possible. That was the kind of person Chuck was--always \nlooking out for others, always giving them strength, always keeping \nthem safe.\n  Chuck was born in San Antonio, TX, on November 12, 1981. He moved \nwith his family to Hamilton when he was in sixth grade. Chuck was an \neasy going, likable kid. He had a passion for history, especially World \nWar II history. He and his father, Conley, could talk at length on the \nsubject, and Chuck was known for his ability to recall facts and \nfigures from specific battles.\n  Conley, a veteran of Vietnam and Desert Storm, was also the source of \nChuck's interest in the military. Chuck's sister, Teresa, remembers \nwhen Chuck was 5 years old, and the family dressed him up in his \nfather's BDU's and gave him a plastic machine gun. They took pictures \nof Chuck dressed up in his father's uniform in front of a large \nAmerican flag. Teresa says he looked like a ``miniature G.I. Joe.''\n  Chuck was proud of his military heritage, and his family and friends \nwere proud of the person Chuck became. His junior high school \nprincipal, Tom Alf, remembers Chuck as ``a fine young man--quiet and \npolite. I remember his smile .  .  . he always had a smile.''\n  Chuck also always had an eye out for others. His sister, Teresa, \nremembers a phone call she got from her brother in the dead of winter a \nfew years ago. ``Teresa,'' Chuck said, ``I need a huge favor.'' \nApparently, Chuck had been approached by a homeless man asking for \nmoney. The man had no coat and instead of money, Chuck gave him the \ncoat off his back. He then struck up a conversation with the man and \nfound out that he was trying to get to the other side of the city to \nmeet his wife and kids. That's when Chuck called his sister to come and \npick up his new friend and give him a ride.\n\n  ``That's just the kind of guy Chucky was,'' Teresa recalled, ``He'd \ngive you the coat off his back if you needed it.''\n  In 2000, Chuck graduated from Hamilton High School. He still had a \npassion for history and had determined he wanted to become a teacher. \nChuck decided to take advantage of the G.I. Bill, while also following \nin his father's footsteps. Just weeks after graduation, the boy who had \nonce posed as a ``miniature G.I. Joe,'' became the real thing when he \nenlisted in the Army.\n  During basic training, Chuck broke his foot. He was also, at this \ntime, set to marry his high school sweetheart, Stephanie. Chuck wanted \neverything to be perfect on that day and had his tuxedo specially \naltered so that the cast on his foot would be unobtrusive.\n\n[[Page S8241]]\n\nFriends remember Chuck being incredibly happy on his wedding day, \nshedding tears as he said his vows. Chuck was a very sensitive person, \nwho wore his emotions on his sleeve.\n  The same qualities that made Chuck an exceptional human being made \nhim an exceptional soldier. He was beloved by his fellow service men \nand women. In a deployment to Kosovo, Chuck earned the nickname \n``Cabbage Patch,'' because of, what his sister Teresa describes as, \n``his chunky face, deep blue eyes, and blonde hair.'' His buddies made \na gift of a modified cabbage patch kid to Chucky by giving the doll a \n``high and tight'' hair cut, adding some tattoos, and dressing it in \ntiny BDU's. Chuck's mother still has that doll. It sits in a room \ndedicated to her son in Alexandria, AL.\n  In Iraq, Chuck led a squad of 10 men. They specialized in mine \nclearing, bridge building, and in assisting the Iraqi patrols. Their \nmission was one of rebuilding and security. In carrying out this \nmission, Chuck was known for protecting his men, putting their safety \nbefore his own. He often led patrols, ``on point,'' meaning he was out \nfront in combat formations, leaving himself the most exposed to danger. \nThis leadership style led to a Purple Heart, when Chuck was wounded by \nshrapnel from a previous roadside explosive, and earned him the \nadmiration of his fellow soldiers.\n  SSG Scott Swanson speaks for many of those who knew Chuck when he \nsaid this:\n\n       [He] was a great NCO--one who soldiers looked up to for \n     knowledge, strength, and most of all, courage. I'm honored to \n     be able to call [Chuck] my brother in arms.\n\n  In an email posted on an Internet tribute to Chuck, fellow serviceman \nSergeant Shane Uras, wrote the following:\n\n       Chuck--it's been two months now, and I'm still having \n     trouble getting it through my head that you're gone. I love \n     you bro, and there's not a day that goes by that your memory \n     doesn't make me a stronger person. You were my best friend \n     and godfather to my son Luca. . . . We are having a huge \n     party when we get back in your memory and were going to send \n     the video of it and other videos to your parents so they \n     understand how big a part you played in our lives while you \n     were away from them. I love you man, and I'm proud to have \n     known you. Your country is grateful for your sacrifice--I \n     know my family and I are. God bless you Chuck!\n\n  It is hard to lose someone like Chuck Webb. He was the anchor of his \nunit. His comrades looked to him for strength and depended on him to \nkeep them safe. Such a role was not new for Chuck. His life was one of \nservice to others. He was a caring, sensitive, devoted person who, \nquite literally, would--and did--give the ``coat off his back.''\n  The following lines, from Emily Dickinson, seem, in a way, to have \nguided Chuck's life. She wrote:\n\n     ``If I can stop one heart from breaking,\n     I shall not live in vain.\n     If I can ease one life the aching,\n     Or cool one pain,\n     Or help one fainting robin unto his nest again,\n     I shall not live in vain.''\n\n  Chuck Webb was a good person, who cared so much--so deeply--about \nothers. We owe it to him to celebrate his life--a life devoted to \neasing the aches and cooling the pains of so many others. It is in \nthese good deeds that his memory lives on.\n  My wife, Fran, and I continue to keep Chuck's family and in our \nthoughts and in our prayers.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/13/senate-section/article/S8241-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8241-S8243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n.\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will make some remarks on an amendment \nI have offered--S.A. 1140--along with Senators Hatch and Grassley that \nis dealing with the appropriation of $5 million, with that amount \nequally divided between two purposes. One, facilitating the Department \nof Homeland Security entering into memorandums of understanding with \nStates and localities under section 287(G) of the Immigration and \nNaturalization Act. That is, the ability to enter into memorandums or \nagreements with States and localities in order that they may \nparticipate in a positive way in helping enforce the immigration laws \nof the United States. And, two, reimbursing States and localities for \nthe costs they incur in training their law enforcement officers under \nthese memorandums of understanding. Reimbursement would be permitted \nfor expenses such as those related to travel and transportation to the \ntraining location, subsistence payments or per diem allowance and costs \nfor securing temporary replacements for law enforcement personnel who \nare participating in the Federal training.\n  I am pleased Senators Hatch and Grassley have cosponsored the \namendment. I hope each of my colleagues will carefully consider it and \nvote for its passage.\n  The amendment is needed to confront two issues currently prohibiting \nthe nationwide advancement of agreements under INA section 287(G). This \nis a provision in the Immigration Code that provides for cooperative \nagreements to be entered into--it is a section that is not being \nadequately utilized.\n  First, there is a lack of Department of Homeland Security personnel \ntasked with negotiating and overseeing the entry into 287(G) training \nagreements with the States. There is also a shortage of DHS resources \nand trainers to conduct State and local training courses in a timely \nmanner, including annual refresher courses for States such as Alabama \nthat have already entered into 287(G) MOU.\n  Second, States that enter into MOUs must currently absorb the cost \nrelated to pulling their law enforcement officers off duty and sending \nthem to an intensive 5- to 6-week training course. They are extensively \ntrained under these agreements. If a State does not have the money to \npay for these extended leaves of absence or to hire replacements for \nthe law enforcement officers wanting to receive immigration enforcement \ntraining, then costs related to the training under the MOU can prohibit \nStates from being able to participate.\n  If costs are prohibitive, many States will simply choose to go \nforward in the realm of immigration law enforcement either without \ntraining, or generally not participate in any meaningful way.\n  Immigration training for State and local officers is important to \nmany of my colleagues. I hope they will recognize that this amendment \nis the way to show their support for such training.\n  In the realm of immigration law enforcement, the State of Alabama \nstruggled for years to achieve effective cooperation between Federal \nenforcement entities and our State and local law enforcement officers. \nAll too often I heard the same story from our Alabama sheriffs and \npolice chiefs: We call Immigration and Naturalization Service when we \narrest an illegal alien, and they say they do not have the time to pick \nthem up. They tell us to let them go. They have told me, on occasion, \nthat INS told local officers unless they had 15 or 18 individuals at \none time, don't bother to call them.\n  As a result, Alabama requested that additional Federal immigration \nagents be assigned to the State, Alabama advocated that extra \nimmigration detention bedspace be established in the state, and Alabama \nrequested the Immigration and Naturalization Service be responsive to \nrequests that illegal aliens be taken into Federal custody. Though some \nprogress was made, most of the requests were only partially met, at \nbest.\n\n  To address the problems, I arranged for an Immigration and Customs \nenforcement officer to travel to the State of Alabama for 2 weeks to \ntrain all of our State troopers on cooperation with the Federal \nGovernment in the enforcement of Federal immigration laws. State \ntroopers reviewed fake documents, were taught about different \ncategories of aliens, legal and illegal, and were shown how to use a \ncomputer database at the Law Enforcement Support Center (LESC), a \ndatabase that had been used only three times in the State of Alabama \nthe year before the training because the officers simply did not know \nhow to use it.\n  In September of 2003, Alabama followed in the footsteps of the State \nof Florida and became the second State in the Nation to enter into an \nINA 287(G) agreement with the Federal Government. This law has been on \nthe books\n\n[[Page S8242]]\n\nfor over a decade, but was not used until after 9-11. It is a tragedy \nwe fail to take now advantage of the opportunity this law provides. \nThat agreement allowed for a select group of 21 Alabama State troopers \nto receive extensive immigration enforcement training and gave them the \nauthority to perform immigration and enforcement functions which \nresulted in their active communication with the Federal immigration \nagents stationed in the State--these agreements ought to be done \nroutinely in every State in America.\n  After the MOU was negotiated and signed, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity sent personnel to Alabama to train the first class for a 5-\nweek period. I thought 2 weeks was more than sufficient to my way of \nthinking. A deputy sheriff or city police officer can arrest a Senator \nfor committing crimes in his community, but I suppose we have to have a \n5-week training before they can arrest somebody who is not a citizen \nfor violation of our immigration laws.\n  They were trained in how to identify fraudulent immigration \ndocuments, and in how to work together with federal agents to enforce \nimmigration laws. I strongly believe that the MOU has been the most \nimportant step in Alabama in the realm of immigration enforcement. As a \nresult of the MOU, Alabama State troopers have performed close to 200 \ncriminal and illegal alien apprehensions, largely of aliens involved \nwith document fraud, drug trafficking, and human smuggling, and have \nseized close to $750,000 in drug, document and human trafficking \nrelated cash.\n  Because of the MOU, new Federal immigration agents have been assigned \nto the State of Alabama, dramatically increasing the Federal \nimmigration enforcement presence in the State. This February, DHS \nannounced the Alabama MOU would not only be continued but would be \nexpanded, a second class of 25 State troopers is scheduled to be \ntrained by DHS this October. The MOU Alabama entered into has added to \nthe knowledge and resources available to Alabama's Department of Public \nSafety and has changed the level of cooperation we receive from the \nFederal immigration enforcement entities on a daily basis.\n  I am certain the State of Alabama will seek to continue the agreement \nfor many years to come. I am hopeful other States will follow the lead \nof Alabama so that they, too, can benefit from the cooperative \npartnerships fostered by 287(G) MOUs.\n  Why is this important? It is important for one reason. We have just \nover 2,000 federal agents nationwide who are not on the borders of our \ncountry and charged with the responsibility of apprehending and \nenforcing immigration laws throughout the heartland of America.\n  There is no way those 2,000 officers can ever adequately patrol our \nstreets for immigration violators and do a good job of handling these \nproblems. But we have 750,000 State and local law enforcement officers \nwho are on our streets and in our communities every single day, \napprehending people for DUIs, apprehending people during fights, \napprehending people for other activities that bring them to the notice \nof law enforcement. In the course of that, they often discover these \npeople are here illegally. They, as a result, should be subject to the \nenforcement of immigration laws by the State and local officers that \ndiscover them. If we have any respect for law in this country at all \nthat is what should happen, but that is not occurring.\n  So how do we get to that point? They tell us they have to have all \nthis training to be qualified. OK, let's give them training. I do not \nknow that we need a full 5 weeks for every officer out there, but I \nthink it is quite helpful that some of these officers have a good and \nsincere training to be more effective. If we train them and clarify \ntheir authority, we will have thousands of new officers patrolling our \nstreets all over America at no cost to the Federal Government, watching \nout on our streets and in our communities for those who violate our \nlaws. That is what we ought to be doing if we are serious at all about \nenforcing the laws of this country. I think the American people are. I \nthink those of us in Congress need to get serious about it.\n  I think MOUs under 287(G) of the INA are a good place to start and \nneed to be expanded. Under these MOUs, officers receive good training. \nThe program creates good cooperation between local law enforcement and \nFederal agents. They learn how each others' systems work, and they \ndevelop memoranda as to what will happen if somebody is apprehended, \nwhom they should call, how they should be detained, how long they \nshould be detained, where they should be taken, and who is going to be \ncompensated for that effort.\n  In conclusion, I think this amendment will make it financially \nattractive for more States to participate in these agreements. After \nall, they are helping enforce Federal immigration law. Why shouldn't we \nassist them in paying for the training we want them to receive? State \nand local police forces can make a difference in these efforts. I am \nexcited we will perhaps be moving forward with this amendment. It will \nmake a big difference.\n  I understand the managers are not here tonight and will not call up \nthe amendment or attempt to do so, but I have talked with the manager \nand, hopefully, we can make some progress on that.\n  Mr. President, I will share briefly that also tomorrow I expect to \ncall up the S. 629, the mass transportation bill I have offered and \nbelieve strongly in. We had a hearing on it in the Judiciary Committee. \nI will seek unanimous consent to call up and to adopt S. 629. I \nunderstand there may be an objection. There is not an objection on the \nRepublican side. There may be an objection on the Democratic side, \nalthough it did come out of our Judiciary Committee with bipartisan \nsupport. I am hopeful we can move this important bill forward.\n  We have seen now in Spain and in London that there are people who \ndesire to attack our mass transit transportation systems. What the \nDepartment of Justice tells us is that we have gaps and loopholes in \nour current laws that deal with those that would attack our mass \ntransit systems, and that those laws need to be tightened up. If we do \nso, it will help the investigators and prosecutors be more effective in \nprosecuting those who may seek to do us harm.\n  I think it is time to move on that legislation. After all, we have \nbeen working on it for over a year. I think everybody has had good \nopportunity to review it. I think it is in every way professional and \nfair and ought to be passed. I look forward to moving it. If there is \nsome objection from Members, and they would like to share that with me, \nperhaps we can solve those difficulties and reach an accord and move \nthis important piece of legislation forward. We absolutely do not need \nto have an attack on our mass transportation system in America and not \nhave the tools for our prosecutors and investigators to prosecute it \nadequately. That bill, as I noted, the mass transportation bill, is S. \n629. It is not an amendment to the appropriations bill on the floor \ntomorrow, but a piece of legislation that I expect to be offering.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I will also be offering tomorrow and would be \ncalling up an amendment to this appropriations bill that deals with \nmaking sure our Federal officials enter into the National Crime \nInformation Center the names and identifying factors of people who have \nabsconded after having been arrested for illegal immigration. That \namendment is S.A. 1139.\n  We have hundreds of thousands of absconders, people who have been \napprehended in our country for being here illegally. Amazingly, this is \nwhat happens: They are apprehended, they are given a date for a \ndeportation hearing, and they are released on bail prior to that \nhearing. Or sometimes they have the hearing and are to be deported on a \ngiven date, and they are released on bail at that time, with the order \nto show up for deportation.\n  For those who have been ordered deported and released on bail, to \nshow up for deportation, we now have learned that over 87 percent of \nthem do not show up to be deported and in some counties over 90 percent \nnever show up for their initial hearings, these percentages really make \na mockery of the law. It has to be discouraging to the agents who have \ngone out and worked these cases, just to see them released on bail, and \nnobody even enters their names in the National Crime Information Center \ndatabase.\n\n[[Page S8243]]\n\n  What is the National Crime Information Center database? This is the \ndatabase that every police officer in America accesses when they \napprehend someone to see if the person is wanted anywhere in the \ncountry. If you had a DUI in Washington State, and you did not show up \nfor your trial, and they catch you in Mobile, AL, and you are entered \nin the NCIC because of your DUI in Washington State, the officers in \nMobile will hold you, and send you back to Washington State for your \ntrial. But if you jump bail and do not show up for your immigration \nhearing or for your deportation proceeding, you are not treated the \nsame way, your information is not currently being entered into the \nNCIC.\n\n  So I have been raising this and talking about it for quite some time \nnow, and I have raised it with top officials in the Department of \nHomeland Security, and they say they are working on it and trying to \nenter the names faster. I know they as of December of last year they \nonly had about 15,000 names entered into the Immigration Violators File \nof the NCIC which is really pathetically small. We ought to have them \nall of the absconder immigration violator files entered in there. This \namendment would provide $1 million to make sure those names are entered \ninto the system.\n  Tomorrow we will proceed, hopefully, to call that amendment up and I \nwill seek to have it made a part of the appropriations bill that is \nmoving forward.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for your time tonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/13/senate-section/article/S8243-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n.\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Objection having been heard, the bill will \nreceive its second reading on the next legislative day.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the issue of United \nNations reform. This year marks the 60th anniversary of the founding of \nthe United Nations. As you know, the U.N. emerged from the ashes of the \nSecond World War with a mandate to save succeeding generations from the \nscourge of war and to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights and in \nthe dignity and worth of human beings.\n  These basic principles embodied in the U.N. charter are still \nsignificant in today's changed strategic environment. Yet, the scandals \nand mismanagement that has engulfed the organization threaten both its \nreputation and its relevance.\n  These scandals have resulted in a consensus that the U.N. must be \nreformed. Three major reports have been released in the past 7 months, \nincluding one by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, that outline the need \nfor specific reforms to make the U.N. more efficient, more accountable, \nmore transparent, and more effective in responding to the challenges we \nface today. I am pleased to see that there is agreement on this need. \nYet, I remind my colleagues that when the current Secretary-General \ntook office in January 1997, he vowed to make the hard decisions \nnecessary to reform the institution.\n  But 8\\1/2\\ years have gone by, and he has been unwilling or unable to \ndo so. In fact, reprehensible dealings and scandalous behavior at the \nU.N. has continued unabated.\n  Furthermore, the U.N. budget has grown by leaps and bounds. Over the \npast 4 years, the U.N. regular budget has increased by more than $1.1 \nbillion over a 2-year period--from $2.5 billion to $3.6 billion.\n  The U.S. is handed a bill from the U.N. for 22 percent of the cost, \nand whether or not we agree with the way the U.N. spends its money, we \nare expected to pay. And this does not take into account the costs of \npeacekeeping operations, which are expected to be over $5 billion this \nyear alone.\n  The Constitution gives to Congress the power of the purse and as \nsuch, it is our duty to monitor how the American taxpayers' money is \nspent. In the case of the massive waste, fraud, and abuse at the U.N., \nwe must take action to rectify an untenable situation.\n  As the recent report issued by the USIP Task Force on the United \nNations said, ``Americans are vested in a United Nations that embodies \nvalues of honesty, decency, and fair play.''\n  Yet, the U.N. is hardly a model for these basic values.\n  The appalling kickbacks, bribes, and financial mismanagement of the \nOil-for-Food program are the most obvious illustration of an \ninsufficient oversight system within the U.N. The design of the program \nand the failure of the U.N. to properly monitor it allowed Saddam \nHussein to pocket billions of dollars in money that was meant for the \nIraqi people suffering under his brutal regime.\n  Sexual exploitation and abuse by U.N. peacekeepers serving in \nmissions around the world is an intolerable abuse of trust by those who \nare supposed to be contributing to a peaceful resolution to conflict \nsituations.\n  Embezzlement and extravagant personal spending have been documented \nat U.N. programs such as UNICEF, the United Nations Development \nProgramme, and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.\n  Countries such as Zimbabwe, Cuba, and Sudan--known violators of the \nbasic human rights of their citizens--have been included as members of \nthe U.N. Commission on Human Rights and have used their position to \nmanipulate its agenda to prevent resolutions that condemn their human \nrights records.\n  If the U.N. does not act boldly, and act now, it will have little \ncredibility to serve as an organization that promotes the values in its \nCharter. As a European diplomat told me recently, however, the U.N. is \nincapable of reforming itself. It is quite good at issuing reports, \nhaving meetings, appearing contrite, and then resolutely promising to \nchange when news reports publicize the details of the problems within \nthe organization. But history has shown that U.S. leadership is \ncritical to ensuring that meaningful reform is implemented at the U.N.\n  Last month, the House of Representatives passed comprehensive \nlegislation that provides a framework for implementing U.N. reform. \nThis effort was led by the Chairman of the House International \nRelations Committee, Mr. Hyde, who worked diligently to produce a \nresponsible bill that addresses the need for serious, meaningful, and \npractical reform.\n  Today I am introducing this legislation in the Senate. I recognize \nthat the method used in this bill to compel the U.N. to make these \nreforms may not be popular with some of my colleagues. But I feel that \nthere is no other way to proceed.\n  This legislation requires that 50 percent of the U.S. contribution to \nthe United Nations regular budget be withheld if specific reforms are \nnot implemented. Before dismissing this approach, I urge my colleagues \nto examine the reforms mandated and the flexibility inherent in the \nlegislation.\n  First, the reforms. Title I requires management and budgetary reforms \nto create a more streamlined, efficient,\n\n[[Page S8244]]\n\nand effective organization. It shifts funding mechanisms for 18 \nprograms of the U.N. from the regular assessed budget to voluntarily \nfunded programs in an effort to make these programs more accountable to \nthose who fund them. It calls for budgetary practices that would allow \nus to measure the effectiveness and relevance of programs. And it \ncreates an Independent Oversight Board, an Office of Ethics, and a \nChief Operating Officer to increase the accountability of the U.N.\n  This Title also addresses the shameful anti-Semitism inherent in U.N. \nstructures by calling for Israel to have a permanent seat in one of the \nregional groups, with all the accompanying rights and privileges. And \nit requires the State Department to review U.N. agencies that focus \nexclusively on the Palestinian agenda.\n  Title II deals with the human rights mandate of the U.N. It \nestablishes basic criteria that member states must meet to be eligible \nto serve on U.N. human rights bodies and requires the U.N. entity that \nselects members on these bodies to abide by these criteria.\n  Title III mandates reforms of the International Atomic Energy Agency \nso that it can better focus on the key issues of nuclear safety and \nsecurity, and nuclear verification activities.\n  Title IV calls for a review of U.N. peacekeeping operations and \nrequires that the U.S. deny support for new or expanded missions until \nprocedures are in place to prevent further sexual exploitation by U.N. \npeacekeepers.\n  These measures, including adopting a Code of Conduct for all \npersonnel participating in these operations, and establishing a data \nbase so that past abusers are not able to participate in future \noperations, have been specifically endorsed by the Secretary General's \nspecial advisor on sexual exploitation and abuse and should be in place \nby this summer. Yet it is incumbent upon us to ensure that they are not \nstalled by member states that don't see this tragic situation as a \nserious problem.\n  Title V puts forward ways to improve budget practices by requiring \nmore details about the U.N. budget, including proposed increases, to be \npresented to Congress.\n  And finally Title VI provides the leverage.\n  If I could come up with a better way, I would pursue it \nwholeheartedly. But even the strongest supporters of the U.S.-U.N. \nrelationship acknowledge that the only way the U.N. pays attention to \ncalls for reform is when its budget is threatened. Experience has shown \nthat the U.N. will institute needed improvements only when Congress \nthreatens to withhold U.S. funding.\n  This is not meant to be draconian. These reforms, if implemented, \nwill increase the credibility, the legitimacy, and the effectiveness of \nthe U.N.\n  In fact, I want to underscore the importance I place on a United \nNations that can fulfill its core objective--to serve as an institution \nthat supports the preservation of international peace and security. I \nfeel this objective is at risk.\n  Finally, it is important to highlight the flexibility that is built \ninto this legislation. It allows the administration 2 years to work \nwith the U.N. to make these necessary reforms before the withholding \nprovision is triggered. Even after 2 years, it does not insist that \nevery one of the reforms be implemented, but allows an additional year \nfor the U.N. to complete the job. If the U.N. adopts measures that \nachieve the same purpose as those outlined in this bill, it allows the \nfull U.S. contribution to be expended. And if the U.N. chooses not to \nimplement these needed reforms, the legislation authorizes the \ncontributions that are withheld from expenditure to remain available \nuntil the U.N. acts.\n  In 1949, Dean Acheson said that the United States must work actively \nto make the United Nations an effective instrument of international \ncooperation. There is, and always will be, a role for America in \nensuring that the U.N. lives up to the ideals of its charter. By \npushing for these critical reforms, I believe that we can forge the \nU.N. into the effective instrument of international cooperation that we \nall hope it can be.\n  It is my belief that this legislation is the instrument to get the \njob done--to make the U.N. the organization that its founders \nenvisioned 60 years ago.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/13/senate-section/article/S8244-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n.\n\n\n            CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES EXPORT REFORM ACT of 2005\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Res. 173) expressing support for the Good \n     Friday Agreement of 1998 as the blueprint for lasting peace \n     in Northern Ireland.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n\n[[Page S8245]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support S. Res. \n173, which Senators Collins, Dodd, McCain, Biden, Leahy and I \nintroduced to express support for the 1998 Good Friday Agreement as the \nblueprint for lasting peace in Northern Ireland. All of us are hopeful \nthat a constructive way forward will be found, and the best way to do \nso is by continuing to implement the Good Friday Agreement.\n  The 1998 Agreement was endorsed in a referendum by the overwhelming \nmajority of people in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The \nparties to the Agreement made a clear commitment to ``partnership, \nequality, and mutual respect'' as the basis for moving forward to end \nthe longstanding conflict and achieve lasting peace for all the people \nof Northern Ireland. The parties affirmed their ``total and absolute \ncommitment to exclusively democratic and peaceful means'' to achieve \nthe goal of peace.\n  Our resolution reiterates our support for the Good Friday Agreement \nas the way forward in Northern Ireland. It rejects the statement of \nDemocratic Unionist leader Ian Paisley, who said in May that the \nAgreement ``should be given a reasonable burial.'' Inclusive power \nsharing based on the defining qualities of the Agreement is essential \nto the viability and success of the peace process.\n  The resolution calls on the Irish Republican Army to immediately \ncomplete the process of decommissioning, cease to exist as a \nparamilitary organization, and end its involvement in any way in \nparamilitary and criminal activity. We know that discussion of the \nissue is underway within the IRA, and we all await a final, positive, \nand decisive action.\n  In addition, the resolution calls on the Democratic Unionist Party in \nNorthern Ireland to share power with all the other parties, according \nto the democratic mandate of the Good Friday Agreement, and commit to \nwork in good faith with all the institutions established under the \nAgreement, including the Executive and the North-South Ministerial \nCouncil, for the benefit of all the people of Northern Ireland.\n  It calls on Sinn Fein to work in good faith with the police service \nof Northern Ireland.\n  It also calls for justice in the case of Robert McCartney, the \nBelfast citizen who was brutally murdered there in January.\n  Finally, the resolution calls on the British Government to \npermanently restore the democratic institutions of Northern Ireland, \ncomplete the process of demilitarization in Northern Ireland, and \nadvance equality and human rights in Northern Ireland.\n  The United States Government continues to strongly support the peace \nprocess in Northern Ireland. The Government of the United Kingdom and \nthe Government of Ireland continue to strongly support the Good Friday \nAgreement as the way forward.\n  The Good Friday Agreement is the only way forward in Northern \nIreland, and it deserves our strong support. I urge my colleagues to \napprove this resolution.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate, \nand that any statements relating to the resolution be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 173) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 173\n\n       Whereas in 1998, the Good Friday Agreement, signed on April \n     10, 1998, in Belfast, was endorsed in a referendum by the \n     overwhelming majority of people in Northern Ireland;\n       Whereas the parties to the Good Friday Agreement made a \n     clear commitment to ``partnership, equality, and mutual \n     respect'' as the basis for moving forward in pursuit of \n     lasting peace in Northern Ireland;\n       Whereas the parties to the Good Friday Agreement also \n     affirmed their ``total and absolute commitment to exclusively \n     democratic and peaceful means'' in pursuit of lasting peace \n     in Northern Ireland;\n       Whereas inclusive power-sharing based on these defining \n     qualities is essential to the viability and advancement of \n     the democratic process in Northern Ireland;\n       Whereas paramilitary and criminal activity in a democratic \n     society undermines the trust and confidence that are \n     essential in a political system based on inclusive power-\n     sharing in Northern Ireland;\n       Whereas the United States Government continues to strongly \n     support the peace process in Northern Ireland; and\n       Whereas the Government of the United Kingdom and the \n     Government of Ireland continue to strongly support the Good \n     Friday Agreement as the way forward in the peace process, and \n     have committed themselves to its implementation: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate reiterates its support for the Good Friday \n     Agreement, signed on April 10, 1998, in Belfast, as the \n     blueprint for a lasting peace in Northern Ireland; and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) the Irish Republican Army must immediately--\n       (i) complete the process of decommissioning;\n       (ii) cease to exist as a paramilitary organization; and\n       (iii) end its involvement in any way in paramilitary and \n     criminal activity;\n       (B) the Democratic Unionist Party in Northern Ireland \n     must--\n       (i) share power with all parties according to the \n     democratic mandate of the Good Friday Agreement; and\n       (ii) commit to work in good faith with all the institutions \n     of the Good Friday Agreement, which established an inclusive \n     Executive and the North-South Ministerial Council, for the \n     benefit of all the people of Northern Ireland;\n       (C) Sinn Fein must work in good faith with the Police \n     Service of Northern Ireland;\n       (D) the leadership of Sinn Fein must insist that those \n     responsible for the murder of Robert McCartney and those who \n     were witnesses to the murder--\n       (i) cooperate directly with the Police Service of Northern \n     Ireland; and\n       (ii) be protected fully from any retaliation by the Irish \n     Republican Army; and\n       (E) the Government of the United Kingdom must--\n       (i) permanently restore the democratic institutions of \n     Northern Ireland;\n       (ii) complete the process of demilitarization in Northern \n     Ireland; and\n       (iii) advance equality and human rights agendas in Northern \n     Ireland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/13/senate-section/article/S8245-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n.\n\n\n  PERMITTING THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS, DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS, AND \n  GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE OFFICE OF COMPLIANCE TO SERVE ONE ADDITIONAL \n                                  TERM\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.
