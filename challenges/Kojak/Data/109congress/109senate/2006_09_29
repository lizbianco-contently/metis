Mr. President, while the distinguished majority leader is \non the floor, let me make a couple of comments.\n  First, if I can ask the Parliamentarian: What time will the vote take \nplace on final passage on the border security bill?\n  Mr. FRIST. It should be 3 a.m.\n  Mr. REID. That is a fairly good estimate, Mr. President--about 3 \no'clock on Saturday morning?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, while you are checking that out, it is my \nunderstanding, based on discussions last night, that we started at 9 \no'clock last night. That is when the time officially started, and it \nwould be 30 hours from 9 o'clock last night, which will be about 3 a.m.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on the bill that is now before this body, I \nhope that if there are going to be amendments, one of the amendments we \nneed to take into consideration--I am sure the leader has heard from \nhis Members, as I have heard from mine--is disaster relief. I hope we \nhave this vehicle moving through here today and that we do something \nregarding agricultural disaster assistance legislation. We passed it \nthree times in this body, and it has never made it out of the House.\n  It is not just the Midwestern States that we know produce a lot of \nfood. We have had natural disasters all over. The State of Nevada has \nhad raging fires. In California, there is one fire that has been \nburning since the 1st of September and they still haven't put it out. \nSo I hope the leader will consider that legislation.\n  Also, I wasn't able to respond to my friend, the distinguished \nmajority leader, last night, but on the India nuclear bill legislation, \nthe reason this matter hasn't been to the floor much earlier is there \nwas a provision put in this legislation by Senator Lugar. I agree with \nit. I support the legislation. But on the majority side, there are \npeople who have held up the legislation because of that provision.\n  This is important legislation. I have said on a number of occasions \nthat I strongly support this legislation. It is important we find time \nto consider this bill before this Congress comes to an\n\n[[Page S10498]]\n\nend. I think this legislation will be strongly supported by a \nbipartisan majority in the Senate. It was reported out of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee in June on a strong bipartisan basis.\n  We must understand, it has been many months since the committee \naction took place. I hope we can take a limited number of amendments \nwith very short time agreements and have it set up so that when we get \nback here, when the elections are over, this would be the first order \nof business we move to. We could set it up that we can finish the \nbill--it will be a very long day--but do it in 1 day.\n  I believe we should do this, this important legislation. Passage \nmeans a lot to our vitally important United States--India relationship. \nI pledge to do what I can to ensure that we do just that. I hope before \nwe leave here today, tomorrow, or Sunday--whenever it might be--that we \nwill have this bill on so-called automatic pilot, that we can take this \nup when we get back. I hope that will be the case.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3994\n\n  Finally, on the Iran matter, I hope we can do something on that bill. \nAs the Republican leader said last night, I couldn't think of a worse \ntime for this Iranian matter to lapse. So I now ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. 3994, a bill to \nextend the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 until November 17, \n2006; that the bill be read a third time, passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  If we did this, it would put everything in order until that date. It \nwould extend this matter until then. The House has put a lot of other \nstuff in this bill very recently. There have been no hearings on it. I \nthink it would be in the best interest of the country if we did this. I \nhope we can. If the leader cannot agree to this request now, I hope we \ncan do it at a subsequent time before we leave in the next few days.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, did the Senator make a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Reserving the right to object, and I will object, I saw \nfor the first time 10 seconds ago what the minority leader has \nproposed.\n  I had a unanimous consent request that we proceed to the bill the \nHouse passed last night when we started the discussion, and this is a \ncontinuation and a response to the fact that we do have to act today.\n  What I prefer to do is work through the bill the House already \npassed, H.R. 6198, which has been received from the House. But what we \ncan do is for us to get together and see how best to address this \nmatter, either with the approach the Democratic leader put forward or \nthe approach that I think is much better and much more complete, the \nHouse bill.\n  So I object to his unanimous consent request. Rather than go through \nthe formal unanimous consent request on the House bill, which I have \nbefore me, why don't we try to address it.\n  Mr. REID. I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The request is withdrawn.\n  Mr. FRIST. On the India Nuclear Act, it is something we are working \non. I believe we do need, before we leave, to put together a package, \nas the Democratic leader and I have been working toward, something \nalong the order of a day, as he mentioned. Both of these issues are \nvery important. I brought them up last night and we do need to act on \nthose today.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I wish to say this is a good example. \nThere is going to be a lot happening over these next 24 hours. If we \ncan work through these matters and we can receive the final legislation \nto be considered on the floor, legislation such as homeland security \nand port security, I think we will be able to act in a fairly \nexpeditious manner. The clock will run on the border fence bill until 3 \na.m. That is when the vote would occur. If, through working together, \nwe are able to manage things in a more orderly way, we will be able to \ndo that.\n  Following that vote, we have one more vote on child custody \nprotection. Again, these are issues that are very important, but we \nwill do our best working together to get things as coordinated as we \npossibly can, given some legislation isn't quite ready yet for the \nfloor.\n  With that, I hope everybody will be very patient over the next 24, 36 \nhours, and then we will have everybody out and have our Nation's \nbusiness done.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10498-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10498-S10499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                VETERANS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to seek \nrecognition to speak about something that is very important to Congress \nand the American people, and that is the issue of the state of veterans \naffairs in this country.\n  The Senate on Wednesday heard from the Senator from Washington an \nepisode so designed and delivered by her that would suggest that this \nCongress has ignored and done little to help America's veterans, both \ncurrent and in the sense of Afghanistan and Iraq, those future \nveterans. I simply do not agree and take issue with her \ncharacterization of the record of the Bush administration and this \nRepublican-led Congress when it comes to caring for America's veterans. \nIn my capacity as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I take \nissue with her suggestion that Congress has done nothing in its job to \ndemand accountability out of the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  I must suggest it is not surprising that a month removed from a \nmidterm election our Democratic colleagues are leveling accusations \nagainst a Republican-led Congress that it has failed to hold the Bush \nadministration accountable for a host of issues. Let's remember, it is \na political season and the statements made on the floor Wednesday about \nveterans and veterans affairs is very politically charged.\n  I have no trouble with tough oversight and accountability and finding \nanswers to serious problems, but to consistently suggest that the sky \nis falling while leaving out any whiff of praise or any good that has \nbeen accomplished is very political at best and it is a disservice to \nour veterans and the thousands of dedicated VA employees who care for \nthem.\n  The speech of the Senator from Washington regarding VA provides a \nvery clear example of what I mean. During her speech, the Senator from \nWashington highlighted a recently released GAO report that confirmed \nthe problems VA encountered in its formulation and execution of its \nbudgets in fiscal years 20005 and 2006 that ultimately led to the Bush \nadministration--that is right, this administration--and this Congress \nasking for a supplemental funding of $3 billion.\n  From that report, she drew her own conclusions--in my view \nunsubstantiated conclusions--that the VA had misled and even lied to \nCongress about the veracity of its budget requests. Then she demanded \naccountability, as if it were nonexistent. I am here to tell my \ncolleagues of the steps that have been taken to establish that \naccountability that is there and very clear today.\n\n  As soon as we learned of last year's budget shortfall, I called \nhearings and we got answers. The answers all of us received from the VA \nat that hearing and then in subsequent oversight hearings were what the \nGAO reported--that they were following much of what was being done to \nestablish greater credibility. More importantly, what the Senator from \nWashington left out of her rendition of the GAO's report was that VA \nhad already implemented nearly all of the GAO's recommendations prior \nto submission of its fiscal year 2007 budget in February.\n  Solutions to a problem were identified and implemented long ago, and \nthat is why our VA is functioning as well as it is today. Also, based \nupon when we learned during our oversight hearings, we required VA to \nsubmit quarterly reports on budget execution. We have received three \nsuch reports this year. VA officials made themselves available to \nMembers, to the staff, Republicans and Democrats alike.\n  We have historically operated the Veterans' Affairs Committee in a \nvery bipartisan way, and it is beyond the pale that it appears we are \nnow into partisan attacks just prior to the election.\n  Furthermore, for anyone interested in learning the facts about how VA \nis holding itself accountable for performance, you need to look at the \nrecord.\n\n[[Page S10499]]\n\nJust open up the VA's budget documents and you will see a host of \nperformance measures that show a degree of institutional accountability \nthat is the envy of other Government agencies and roundly praised by \nindependent observers. Let me tick off a few of those performance \nmeasures, and as I am doing so, please be mindful of how the \nimprovements in these areas during the Bush years have impacted the \nlives of veterans.\n  The percentage of patients who report being seen within 20 minutes of \nscheduled appointments by the VA care facilities has improved from 65 \npercent in 2002 to 73 percent through the end of last year.\n  The percentage of primary care appointments scheduled within 30 days \nof the desired date has improved from 89 percent in 2002 to 96 percent \nthrough the end of last year.\n  The percentage of specialty care appointments scheduled within 30 \ndays of the desired date have improved from 86 percent in 2002 to 93 \npercent this year.\n  The number of veterans the VA treats in noninstitutional, long-term \ncare settings has increased by 50 percent since 2002.\n  And the list goes on and on and on.\n  In 2004, the Rand Corporation examined why VA patients get better \nchronic preventative care than similar U.S. audits. The answer? Rand \nconcluded that the VA's edge is linked to improved information \ntechnology, tracking of performance, and accountability. And that is \nwhen in these charts this kind of recognition began to take over. All \nof this was ignored in the speech by the Senator from Washington. So \nlet's look at some of those facts.\n  Washington Monthly is not necessarily a publication that constantly \npraises the Bush administration, but it says VA care is the ``best care \nanywhere''--a tremendous statement and a very fine article about the \nphenomenal increases in quality health care delivered by the Veterans' \nAdministration over the last number of years.\n  That is not the end of that story. Here is another part of that \nstory, and this comes from not a Washington publication but from Time \nmagazine. It goes on to say in this article how VA hospitals have \nbecome the best in the Nation. It says that for the sixth year in a \nrow--let's backtrack to the Bush administration. I think they have been \naround a few years, maybe 6 or more. VA hospitals last year scored \nhigher than private facilities on the University of Michigan's American \nCustomer Satisfaction Index. The VA scored 83 out of 100. Private \ninstitutions scored 71 out of 100. That is a pretty good record. In \nfact, it is the best record in the United States.\n  Now, what did BusinessWeek magazine say about it? They said something \nvery similar. They said that 154 hospitals and 871 clinics run by the \nVeterans' Administration have been ranked best in class by a number of \nindependent groups on a broad range of measures from chronic care to \nheart disease treatment, and on and on. The VA's prescription for \naccuracy rates is greater than 99.97 percent. That is the rest of the \nstory, and it is a mighty important story.\n  Now, let me talk just a few minutes about money because I think that \nis part of why we are as successful as we are, but it is also a \nphenomenal statement of this Congress--yes, a Republican-led Congress--\nand this administration's commitment to America's veterans. What are \nthose accomplishments during the Bush years? Let me list a few.\n  With enactment of the 2007 budget, VA's health care budget will have \nincreased 70 percent during the Bush years. Look at the numbers. Here \nthey are. Those are undeniable. Those, in fact, are facts. They are \nbudgetary facts. It is one of the fastest growth rates and increases in \nbudget in any other area except defense in a time of war in this period \nof budgeting of the U.S. Government. Has a Republican-led Congress \nturned its back on American veterans? Quite the opposite.\n\n  The GI bill educational benefits for veterans has been boosted by 65 \npercent, raising the lifetime benefit from $23,400 to $38,700.\n  A new educational program was created for members of the Guard and \nReserve activated after September 11, 2001, providing up to $39,960 in \nlifetime benefits.\n  The educational benefit for survivor and dependents of vets has been \nincreased by 46 percent.\n  The maximum VA home loan guarantee has been increased by 107 percent.\n  The largest expansion of the National Cemetery System since the Civil \nWar is currently underway.\n  Historic legislation was enacted to permit certain disabled veterans \nto receive their disability and military retirement benefits \nconcurrently.\n  Comprehensive legislation was enacted to update and strengthen \ncivilian protection available to members of the Armed Forces.\n  Comprehensive legislation was enacted to improve job training and \nplacement services for veterans.\n  A new insurance program was created to provide immediate benefits--\npayments of between $25,000 to $100,000 to servicemembers who have been \ntraumatically injured since the beginning of the war on terror. Mr. \nPresident, 2,700 injured veterans have received that benefit.\n  That is the record. That is the record, and that is the one this \nCongress and this President have responded to in a most timely and, \nmore importantly, responsible fashion.\n  Now that I think the record is clear, what are some of the other \nanswers?\n  Well, some on the other side would say it is money, money, money, and \nmore money. We have found it is quite the opposite. It is making the \nsystem we have work more efficiently, more responsibly. We are now \nreshaping VA to handle the high-tech problems it has had, or the \ninformational problems it has had, to make sure we secure the names and \nthe lists and the informational flow of our veterans and their \nbackgrounds. I am extremely proud of the work we have done, and we have \ndone it in a bipartisan way.\n  So why now, in the late hours of this year, are we all of a sudden \nhearing all of these things that are what I believe to be improper \nstatements about the Veterans' Administration? Well, I think we have to \nrecognize what is at hand. It is a political year. But there is \nsomething we have never done; that is, politicize veterans or \npoliticize our military. And we shouldn't start now.\n  Our record is strong. Our support of veterans has always been there. \nI have given my colleagues the facts and the numbers. I am proud of the \naccomplishments we have made this year alone, a near 14 percent \nincrease in veterans health care or veterans budgets in general. There \nis no other agency of our Government except Defense that has had that \nkind of an increase.\n  So let's recognize what the year is all about. It is politics and it \nis political. What I have given my colleagues is a factual accounting \nof the great successes we have had in veterans affairs, with veterans, \ndelivering service to veterans. That doesn't mean we are perfect and it \ndoesn't mean every veteran got exactly what they wanted the moment they \nasked for it. That will never exist. But we will be responsive. We do \ncare. And the expression on the part of this Congress, this President, \nand the American taxpayer in relation to the support of our veterans \nis, in fact, unprecedented.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Under the previous order, the hour of 10 a.m. \nhaving arrived, the Senate will resume\n\n[[Page S10500]]\n\nconsideration of H.R. 5631, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference Report to accompany H.R. 5631, an Act making \n     appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal \n     year ending September 30, 2007, and for other purposes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today we are considering the conference \nreport on the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year \n2007. The funding provided in this legislation is crucial for the \nongoing war on terror. It is imperative that critical resources \ncontinue to be provided for the brave men and women who have answered \ntheir Nation's call. It is our duty to support those who defend our \nfreedom and for that reason I will vote in favor of this legislation. \nHowever, while I will support passage, I note with concern the billions \nof dollars in wasteful earmarks that have again found their way into \nboth the conference report and the joint explanatory statement.\n  Of equal importance to the legislation we are considering today is \nthe National Defense Authorization Act for 2007. I am encouraged by \nlast night's report that an agreement has been reached between Chairman \nWarner and Chairman Hunter. With bipartisan cooperation, I am confident \nthat the conference report will be filed soon and its final passage can \nbe achieved before we leave this week. It is a matter of national \nsecurity and imperative in fulfilling our duty to defend the Nation.\n  An important provision contained in the Senate-passed Defense \nAuthorization Act would require regular budgeting for the ongoing \nmilitary operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is necessary because \neven though we have been fighting the war on terror for nearly 5 years, \nwe continue to fund it through emergency supplemental spending bills \nthat have become the rule, rather than the exception as would be \nexpected for unanticipated expenditures. Fortunately, the provision to \nrequire budgeting for the war was adopted by a vote of 98 to 0, and I \nam very hopeful that this important budgetary requirement will remain \nintact in the conference report. The next budget submission will be \nexpected to include funding to conduct the ongoing conflict for the \nnext year.\n  The appropriations conference report before us today appropriates \nover $447 billion dollars for the Department of Defense. While this is \nconsiderable funding, it is more than $4 billion below what the \nPresident requested. Not only does this legislation provide less than \nthe President's request, but many of the President's programs have been \nstripped out and replaced with earmarks for favored projects. These are \nserious times that require serious people to make serious decisions--\ntough decisions that may go against the special interests. I need not \nremind my colleagues that we are at war. Supporting the President's \nbudget and the troops it sustains should be our primary focus, not \nparochial interests.\n  The issues we face as a Nation require all of us to make sacrifices. \nThe service members who defend our Nation interests around the globe \nare making great sacrifices. The families who wait for them back home \nare making sacrifices. Because we ask these heroes to forfeit so much, \nwe in the Congress should also be ready to make sacrifices. By doing \nso, a message can be sent that our Nation's security and the welfare of \nour service members are higher priorities than earmarks inserted to \ngain favor from special interests or the opportunity to send out a \npress release touting the bacon we are bringing home.\n\n  The practice of earmarking has reached epic proportions, and the harm \nit has caused in some cases has been clearly exposed. In the last 2 \nyears alone we have had ample evidence of the corrupting influence of \nthese earmarks on the Congress. It is clear that they detract from the \ntrust and confidence the American taxpayer has placed in their elected \nofficials. How high will we let the Federal deficit climb before we \ntake our fiscal responsibilities seriously? What is it going to take \nfor us to finally say, enough is enough? We should pass a Defense \nAppropriations Bill which mirrors the authorization bill and fulfills \nthe requirements of our military as requested by the President.\n  The American taxpayer has a right to expect us to get the most out of \neach and every defense dollar, especially at a time when those dollars \nare so critical. The money that is being diverted to unauthorized \nprojects should instead be used to address the needs of our services. \nIt is the service chiefs who are in the best position to advise \nCongress of their priorities. Unauthorized earmarks drain our precious \nresources and adversely affect our national security.\n  Here is a sampling of nondefense related earmarks in the conference \nreport or the joint explanatory statement we are considering: $12.8 \nmillion for Alaska Land Mobile Radio; $4 million for the Northern Line \nExtension of the Alaska Railroad; $1.4 million for the South Carolina \nCenter for Excellence in Educational Technology; $10 million for the \nPort of Anchorage Intermodal Marine Facility Project; and $3.2 million \nfor the Lewis Center for Educational Research, which houses a school \nand science center, but no known military application.\n   One of the more egregious add-ons in the legislation currently on \nthe floor is the addition of over $2 billion for 10 C-17 cargo planes \nthat were not requested by the administration. The Air Force is not \nasking for these additional C-17s and the Quadrennial Defense Review \nclearly states a need for a total of only 180 aircraft. Why are 10 \nadditional aircraft now part of a bridge fund that is designed to \nprovide necessary resources for our conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan? \nAnother reason I find this add-on particularly objectionable is that \ngoing into conference, the House had approved only three additional C-\n17s and the Senate had approved only two. At a minimum, seven \nadditional C-17 aircraft were added by the conferees, and that was \noutside of the matter they were tasked to resolve. I simply find this \nto be outrageous. The practice of adding unrequested, unauthorized, and \nunneeded projects onto wartime spending bills must be put to an end. \nOther unrequested earmarks include $117 million for T-AGS oceanographic \nsurvey ships; $60 million for weapons industrial facilities equipment; \n$10 million for Earthmoving Scrapers; $12.7 million for aircraft \nweapons range support equipment; $10.6 million for ``Other Aircraft'' \nin the Air Force procurement category; $22.5 million for human factors \nengineering technology; $1.3 million for the RAND Arroyo Center; $14.9 \nmillion for industrial preparedness; and $44.5 million for the Maui \nSpace Surveillance System.\n\n  This list goes on and on. In fact, there are hundreds of such add-ons \nthat total over $5 billion. I am not arguing that some of these \nearmarks could be used for good causes. But I do protest the process by \nwhich Congress ignores priorities of the armed services so that they \ncan deliver Federal tax dollars for local programs, some of which have \nnothing to do with the defense of our Nation.\n  I am also concerned about our restrictive trade policies and the \npotentially negative impact they have on our readiness and \ninteroperability with our allies. Every year, so-called ``Buy America'' \nrestrictions cost the Department of Defense and the American taxpayers \nbillions. I oppose these types of protectionist policies and \neconomically they just don't make sense. Free trade improves relations \nbetween nations and promotes economic growth. ``Buy America'' \nrestrictions could seriously impair our ability to compete freely in \ninternational markets and risks existing business from our longest \nstanding trade partners and allies.\n  This conference report includes language to prohibit the procurement \nof foreign carbon or steel armor plate, ball and roller bearings, ship \ncranes and propellers. These ``Buy America'' restrictions may cost the \ntaxpayers more than purchasing the same items on the international \nmarket, and by imposing them, we risk denying our warfighters the best \navailable technology. Though I oppose these protectionist provisions, I \nappreciate that the conferees have provided for appropriate waivers \nbased on case-by-case certifications. But these are really issues of \nacquisition policy, not appropriations matters, and should be addressed \nduring the defense authorization process. Let's leave the authorizing \nof acquisition policy to the authorizers and debate these types of \nissues on authorization bills.\n  Mr. President, the appropriations measure before us is critical to \nour\n\n[[Page S10501]]\n\nfight against terror. Ideally, I would not need to criticize this \nlegislation, but we owe it to the American taxpayers to inform them of \nhow their money is being spent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there are only 2 days--2 days--remaining in \nthe fiscal year, and the Senate has passed only 2--only 2--of the 12 \nappropriations bills. The Senate just adopted a continuing resolution \nto continue the operations of Government for 14 of the 15 Departments.\n  This dismal performance is not the result of the work of the \nAppropriations Committee. The Appropriations Committee did its work \nand, on a bipartisan basis, reported all 12--all 12--of its bills by \nJuly 26. Chairman Cochran did an outstanding job, a remarkable job in \nleading the Appropriations Committee.\n  Yes, the Appropriations Committee did its work, did it well. Yet, \nhere we are, just 2 days--2 days--away from the new fiscal year, and \nnot one--not one--appropriations bill has been signed into law. And as \neveryone knows, the most vital bills that have to be done before we go \nhome are the appropriations bills or the Government will stop running. \nOnly two are likely to be sent to the President before the majority \nleader recesses the Senate for the elections.\n  The appropriations process has once again fallen victim to politics. \nThe majority leadership designated September national security month. \nAs a result, conferees have completed actions on the Defense bill and \non the Homeland Security conference report. These are good, bipartisan \nbills. But not one other appropriations bill has come before this body, \nthe Senate of the United States.\n  When it comes to the funding bills for domestic agencies, with the \nexception of Homeland Security, the majority leadership is apparently \nsatisfied with a mindless continuing resolution. When it comes to the \neducation of our children, when it comes to the health of the elderly, \nwhen it comes to the ability of our deteriorating infrastructure to \nsustain a growing economy, and the fiscal health of our farms, the \nmajority leadership wants no debate--no debate--no debate--just a \nrubberstamp of a formula-based continuing resolution for 13 of the 15 \nDepartments.\n  The majority leadership made a specific choice to delay bringing the \ndomestic appropriations bills to the floor because it wished to avoid \nan open debate in the Senate--in this forum, where debate is free and \nopen and one may speak as long as his or her feet will sustain him or \nher--it wished to avoid an open debate in the Senate about the many \nissues confronting Americans in their daily lives. That is what we are \ntalking about.\n  The President submitted a budget for domestic programs that cut \nfunding by $14 billion below the level necessary to keep pace with \ninflation. The President's proposal to increase fees on our veterans \nfor their health care is indefensible. The White House proposed cuts in \neducation, cuts in programs to fight crime. The President's budget is \nnot sustainable. Yet, once more behind closed doors, the majority \nleadership inserted a cap on spending at the level proposed by the \nPresident's budget. This was done by jamming a cap on spending in an \nunamendable conference\n\n[[Page S10502]]\n\nreport--unamendable conference report--intended to provide disaster \nrelief for the victims of Hurricane Katrina and to fund the efforts of \nour valiant troops serving so heroically, yes, so heroically in Iraq \nand in Afghanistan.\n  To avoid debate--get that: to avoid debate; to avoid free and open \ndebate--on the domestic appropriations bills, the Senate majority \nleadership has kept the Senate operating at a snail's pace all summer--\nall summer.\n  In July, the Senate had rollcall votes on only 9 days. In August, we \nvoted on only 3 days. In September, we have had votes on just 10 days. \nSo in the 3 months in which the Senate should be in overdrive to finish \nthe appropriations bills, we have had votes on only 22 days. That is a \npathetic--that is a pathetic--sorrowful performance.\n  Why? Why? The majority wants to avoid debate. The majority wants to \navoid free and open public debate about its broken promises concerning \nthe No Child Left Behind Act. The President's budget proposed the \nlargest cut--hear me now--the President's budget proposed the largest \ncut to education funding in the 26-year history of the Education \nDepartment--I was here--the 26-year history of the Education \nDepartment, a $2.1 billion, or 4 percent, reduction. How about that.\n  This is a nonsensical squandering of the future of our children. Hear \nme. This is a nonsensical squandering of the future of our children. \nThe Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill underfunds the title I \nprogram--the cornerstone of the No Child Left Behind Act--by a whopping \n$12.3 billion. Mr. President, $12.3 billion--that is $12 and 30 odd \ncents for every minute since Jesus Christ was born. Get that: a \nwhopping $12.3 billion; the cornerstone of the No Child Left Behind \nAct, by a whopping $12.3 billion.\n  It freezes funding for this program, even though the law calls for an \nincrease of $2.25 billion--$2\\1/4\\ billion. As a result, this bill \nwould leave behind 3.7 million students who could be fully served by \ntitle I if the program were funded at the level promised by the No \nChild Left Behind Act.\n  I offered an amendment in the committee markup to increase title I \nfunding by $6.1 billion--half of this year's shortfall--but the \nRepublican majority rejected it. Was the Senate given an opportunity to \ndebate the need to invest in the education of our children? No.\n  In June, the FBI released its violent crime figures. The FBI found \nthat murders in the United States jumped 4 percent last year and, \noverall, crime, violent crime--violent crime--was up by 2.5 percent for \nthe year, the largest annual increase in crime in the United States \nsince 1991. Yet the President proposed to cut law enforcement grants to \nState and local governments by $1.2 billion and to eliminate the COPS \nhiring program.\n  Was the Senate given an opportunity to debate how best to respond to \nthe largest annual increase in crime in 15 years? No. No.\n  More than 30 farm groups--ranging from the National Farmers Union and \nthe American Farm Bureau Federation to the American Sugar Alliance, the \nNational Association of Wheat Growers, the National Cotton Council, and \nthe Independent Community Bankers of America--are pressing the Senate \nto enact agriculture disaster relief. Sixty-six percent--66 percent--of \nall counties in the United States have been declared disaster areas by \nthe Agriculture Department this year, and 88 percent--88 percent--of \nthe counties were declared disaster areas in 2005.\n  The Appropriations Committee, on a bipartisan basis, adopted a $4 \nbillion disaster relief package back in June--back in June. Has the \nSenate had an opportunity to debate whether that relief package meets \nthe needs of our farmers for disaster relief? No. No.\n  On July 19, the Commissioner of Social Security wrote me a letter in \nwhich she stated that the level of funding in the Labor-HHS bill: `` . \n. . would require employee furloughs of approximately 10 days Agency-\nwide.''\n  Has the Senate had a chance to debate whether our elderly citizens \nwant long lines at our Social Security offices? No. American seniors--\nyes, American senior citizens, the elderly--are dealing with a serious \nhealth crisis. At issue is how to cope with the burden of high \nprescription drug prices. Seniors should not be asked to skip doses. \nSeniors should not be asked to split pills in half. Seniors should not \nbe asked to choose between food and medicine in order to make ends \nmeet. No. Never. Never, I say.\n  According to a research report released by the AARP, the average \nannual increase in the cost of a senior's medication is $300. Has the \nSenate had an opportunity to debate a provision in the House version of \nthe Agriculture bill to allow drug reimportation? Has it? No. No.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency projects that our communities \nneed in excess of $200 billion for clean and safe drinking water \nsystems. Yet the Interior appropriations bill would cut funding from a \nlevel of $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2005 to $687 million in fiscal \nyear 2007, a cut of 38 percent. Has there been any debate? No. Has \nthere been any debate? No. Has there been any debate about the need for \nsafe and clean drinking water in our communities? Has there been any \ndebate on the Senate floor, in this forum of free speech--free, \nunlimited speech and debate? No. No. No.\n  If there is one lesson we all should have learned from Hurricane \nKatrina, it is that there are consequences to starving Federal \nagencies. FEMA, which performed marvelously after the Northridge \nearthquake, the Midwest floods, and the 9/11 attacks, simply was no \nlonger up to the task when Hurricane Katrina hit the gulf coast last \nyear. I wonder which other Federal agencies could be the next FEMA. \nCould it be the Food and Drug Administration? Has the Senate had the \nopportunity to debate whether the FDA has the resources and leadership \nnecessary to make sure we have safe food and safe drugs? No.\n  The cost of attending a public 4-year college has increased 32 \npercent since the beginning of this administration. Yet the maximum \nPell grant award has not been increased since 2002. Has the Senate \ndiscussed the wisdom of making it harder for our children to afford a \ncollege education? No.\n  The Labor-HHS bill cuts funding for the Centers for Disease Control's \nimmunization program--one of the most cost-effective tools in \npreventing disease. For every dollar spent on vaccines, we save up to \n$27 in medical and societal costs. Has the Senate had the opportunity \nto debate the value of investing in the health of our children? No.\n  On the heels of the first cut to funding for the National Institutes \nof Health since 1970, the President proposed level funding of NIH in \nfiscal year 2007. As a result, the total number of NIH-funded research \nproject grants would drop by 642, or 2 percent below last year's level. \nThe President's budget would cut funding for 18 of the 19 institutes. \nFunding for the National Cancer Institute would drop by $40 million, \nand funding for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute would \ndrop by $21 million. Has there been a debate about the wisdom of these \ncuts? No.\n  The summerlong hiatus from our legislative duties makes us wonder why \nwe bothered to keep the lights on in this Chamber.\n  After the coming recess, when the Congress returns in November, the \nprospect for the domestic bills is just as grim. Last week, under a \nveto threat from the White House, the majority agreed to carve another \n$5 billion out of the domestic bills. Nothing but another monstrous \nomnibus bill or a long-term continuing resolution is on the horizon for \nall of the remaining domestic bills.\n  When I was chairman of the Appropriations Committee, from 1989 to \n1994 and in 2001, the Senate debated and passed every bill but one. It \ntakes persistence, it takes determination, and it takes a commitment to \nthe U.S. Senate to debate and approve all of those bills. Chairman \nCochran of Mississippi has that determination, and he was successful \njust last year in bringing every bill to the Senate floor. However, the \nmajority leadership does not, apparently, value that persistence and \nhard work. He does not value that persistence and hard work and \ndetermination. In an election year, the only thing of value is spend \nand win.\n  Mr. President, I regret that we have, once again, so markedly \ndemonstrated in the Senate that keeping our jobs far outweighs the \ndesire to do our jobs and do those jobs well for the American people. \nMake no mistake, the American people will judge us accordingly.\n\n[[Page S10503]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about a couple of issues \nthat I think are very important. One I will get to in a minute, the \npending legislation before us, the issue of immigration, illegal \nimmigration, and what we are trying to do to combat that in the Senate.\n  Today, I am very hopeful that with the proper cooperation, we can get \nthis done today and over to the President in the next 48 hours to begin \nthe process of securing the border and dealing with an issue that may \nbe the No. 1 issue in my State right now. I probably hear about this \nissue of illegal immigration from casual contact with my constituents \nin grocery stores, the train station, et cetera. I have more people \nasking me about the issue of illegal immigration than any other issue \nwe deal with.\n  It is remarkable in the sense that if you talk to folks here in \nWashington and the ``experts'' in the media, this is not important to \npeople. Particularly, you would think in a State such as Pennsylvania, \nwhich is miles away from the southern border but not too far from the \nnorthern border, this would not be an important issue. But it is an \nimportant issue. It is one that I am very pleased the Senate is going \nto deal with today after, I think, making a misstep in the previous \nconsideration of illegal immigration legislation. We have now taken a \nstep in the right direction, a step where we put the horse before the \ncart instead of the cart before the horse. So I am very excited about \nthat. I will mention that in a moment.\n  There is one issue I wanted to get to. It is an issue the leader \nspoke about last night, the issue of Iran and the Iran Freedom and \nSupport Act, which was passed in the House of Representatives \nyesterday. The House negotiated--and many of us in the Senate were \ninvolved, as well as the White House--and worked on an extension of the \nIran-Libya Sanctions Act, to update that act, which needed to be done, \nand to take into consideration the change in dynamics in Libya and the \nchange in dynamics with respect to Iran.\n  There is no country that I see on the horizon that is more dangerous \nto the national security of this country, in my opinion, than the \ncountry of Iran--not just to the national security of this country but \nthe safety and security of the world. We need to have a better regime \nof sanctions as well as a better overall policy for dealing with Iran \nthan what we have today in the ILSA, or Iran Libya Sanctions Act.\n  The House of Representatives, on a bipartisan basis, worked on the \nlegislation, again, with the administration, which previously had \nopposed the Iran Freedom and Support Act, a bill that has 61 cosponsors \nhere in the Senate, which we debated earlier this year. They took \nelements of that bill and the companion bill in the House, offered by \nIleana Ros-Lehtinen from Florida. Working together with several House \nand Senate committees and with the administration, they were able to \ncome up with a compromise and, again, many of us in the Senate worked \nwith the administration and the House in crafting this. We were able to \npass a bill that got so much support, they didn't even have to take a \nrecord vote on it. It passed by consent over there. That tells you the \nkind of strong support the bill enjoys. It was a bill authored by Tom \nLantos and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and the chairman and ranking member of \none of the committees of jurisdiction, the International Relations \nCommittee, were on the legislation and, again, it passed yesterday \nunanimously. That bill now is sitting on the floor of the Senate, at \nthe desk.\n  The leader mentioned last night that it is our intent to bring this \nlegislation up and to try to pass it in the Senate. We did not, last \nnight, ask consent to do that because we were made aware there might be \nconcerns on the other side of the aisle with respect to some of the \nprovisions. We wanted to give ample opportunity to have the other side \ngo through the legislation.\n  Again, I state that this is not a new issue. I know the Democratic \nleader got up today and suggested that there have been no hearings on \nthe bill and there hasn't really been a discussion on the bill. I will \ntell you that just within the last year, the following hearings were \nheld:\n  There was an ILSA reauthorization hearing in the Banking Committee, \nJune 22; a terrorist threat hearing in the Homeland Security Committee, \nNovember 15 of last year; a nuclear Iran hearing, Foreign Relations \nCommittee, March 2; response to nuclear Iran, Foreign Relations, \nSeptember 19 of this year; Iran's nuclear and political ambitions, a \ntwo-part hearing, May 17 and 18 of this year; Iran's nuclear program/\nintelligence, Foreign Relations Committee, May 11.\n  In addition, as I mentioned, the Senate fully debated for 3 days the \namendment I had offered to the National Defense Authorization Act back \nin June of this year. We debated that amendment for 3 days. We had a \nvote on the Senate floor. We had a full discussion of all of the \nprovisions in the act, many of which, as I mentioned before, have been \ndropped. But many of the provisions that were debated were added to \nthis bill--the ones that were noncontroversial. Things that were \ncontroversial were adapted to make them noncontroversial.\n  To suggest that somehow this is a brandnew piece of legislation, we \nhaven't seen this before, there haven't been any hearings, we don't \nknow anything about it, is just not accurate. We have had a full \ndebate.\n  This is an important issue. For the United States Senate, for the \nCongress, the President to speak out on the issue of Iran at this time \nis critical as we confront, as we saw from a couple weeks ago, the \nmachinations at the United Nations and President Ahmadinejad up there \nsaber rattling as he does a little bit at the United Nations, but he is \nrattling sabers and all other types of weaponry in front of the people \nof Iran when he goes home and he speaks in his native language.\n  This is a very serious and dangerous threat. It is without question \nthe principal reason we are having increased problems in Afghanistan \nand Iraq, because of the influence of Iran. Iran is there with fighters \nfrom Iran, with money and support, weaponry from Iran to foment \nsectarian violence. One of the reasons we are having the level of \nsectarian violence that we see there is because of Iran and its stated \nintention of being the dominant view in the Islamic world. The clash \nbetween Shia and Sunni is front and center in the ideology of the \nruling mullahs of Iran and the President of Iran, Ahmadinejad. This is \nwhat their objective is. It is part and parcel of their own war within \ntheir religion, but it is also part of their strategy of destabilizing \nIraq so democracy cannot flourish because if democracy flourishes, then \nit is an opportunity for moderate Islam to win the day over the \nfanatics who are trying to destroy that religion and destroy the world.\n  This is a vitally important issue for the Senate to bring up, I think \nno more important issue than for us to deal with this real threat, as I \nsaid on the floor a couple of weeks ago, I think the greatest threat \nthat has ever faced this country and the world. If we do not act now \nwhen this threat is in its nascent stage, we risk cataclysmic \nconsequences by not confronting this evil in time. We risk cataclysmic \nconsequences if we don't, as this legislation permits, put increased \nsanctions on companies that do business with Iran and their nuclear \nprogram.\n  This is a very important piece of legislation, one that is so \nimportant that we were able, as I mentioned before, to get this kind of \nvery quick consideration on the floor of the House of Representatives, \nand it passed unanimously. People in the House understand the threat of \nIran. I hope the Senate does so also.\n  I will submit for the record the provisions of what this bill does. \nSome have suggested that it is a watered-down version of the Iran \nFreedom and Support Act. So to that degree I say, yes, it is, but it is \nwatered down for the purpose of arriving at a consensus so we can speak \ninto the moment.\n  It does make major changes particularly with respect to the \nPresident's waiver. We have had ILSA now for 10 years. We have a \nsituation where a waiver has only been utilized, to my recollection, \none time because there is no requirement the President has to\n\n[[Page S10504]]\n\nuse his waiver authority. The President can look at these issues and \ndecide yes or no sanctions, but there is no trigger, there is no force \nfor the President to actually do something.\n  This compromise bill would encourage him to actually do something, to \nactually look at this information, make a decision, and if sanctions \nare warranted as a result of the investigation, then the President \neither has to impose those sanctions or waive them for six months. \nRight now he doesn't have to waive them. He simply keeps investigating. \nThat is an important point to highlight.\n  That is an important pressure point that Iran needs to know that we \nare ratcheting up--albeit slightly compared to the original Iran \nFreedom and Support Act--we are ratcheting up the pressure on this \nillicit regime in Iran to do something. It is very important for the \nfuture security of our country.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a fact sheet on the \nbill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Fact Sheet on Santorum Iran Bill\n\n       Senator Santorum and Majority Leader Frist worked with \n     House counterparts, House leadership, and Administration \n     officials to craft a new bill that provides for key \n     enhancements to the soon to expire Iran-Libya Sanctions Act \n     (ILSA).\n       The bill also contains provisions that authorize assistance \n     to pro-democracy groups inside and outside Iran, and provides \n     additional authorities in the way of tools to curb money \n     laundering efforts that support WMD proliferation.\n       The bipartisan House bill, H.R. 6198, was just passed by \n     the House by voice vote.\n       This Santorum-Frist/Ros-Lehtinen-Lantos bipartisan Iran \n     Freedom and Support Act contains several crucial elements \n     that advance U.S. policy towards Iran:\n       First, it codifies sanctions, controls and Executive Orders \n     in place against Iran. This was an important part of S. 333, \n     the Iran Freedom and Support Act. This is a way Congress can \n     make these important Executive Branch actions and measures \n     part of our laws.\n       Second, the bill addresses the issue of investigating \n     foreign investments in Iran's energy sector and revises the \n     current waiver for the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act. The \n     bipartisan bill strongly urges the Administration to \n     investigate investment activity in Iran and report to \n     Congress within 180 days on an investment. Instead of \n     continuing with the open-ended waiver in current law, the \n     bipartisan bill authorizes the President to avoid sanctioning \n     foreign companies that invest in Iran's energy sector only if \n     use of the waiver is vital to the national security interests \n     of the United States. This is a six-month waiver, not an \n     open-ended waiver. The bill permits the President to renew \n     this waiver for six month periods. The bill also extends \n     ILSA, due to expire on Friday, September 29, 2006, until the \n     end of 2011.\n       Third, the bill directs the President to impose sanctions \n     on foreign entities that export, transfer or provide Iran \n     with WMD or WMD-related technologies or destabilizing \n     conventional weapons. The President must impose these \n     sanctions if a transfer occurs. This provision was also a key \n     component of S. 333, the Iran Freedom and Support Act.\n       Fourth, and perhaps most important, the bill authorizes \n     assistance for pro-democracy forces inside and outside Iran. \n     These funds are authorized for groups that are committed to \n     democratic ideals, respect for human rights, and equality of \n     opportunity, among other things. Activities such as radio and \n     television broadcasting into Iran are examples of activities \n     that could be funded under this bill.\n       Fifth, the bill states that Congress declares it should be \n     the policy of the U.S. to support the efforts of the people \n     of Iran to exercise self-determination over the form of their \n     government, and to support independent human rights and \n     peaceful pro-democracy forces inside Iran. This provision is \n     central to our efforts to successfully effect peaceful change \n     inside Iran.\n       Sixth, there are provisions that enhance current money \n     laundering sanctions available to the government. Current law \n     is enhanced to enable Treasury to target entities that are \n     involved in money laundering related to the proliferation of \n     WMD and missiles.\n       In all, the bill takes many of the provisions found in S. \n     333 and H.R. 282, the House companion, and blends them \n     together in a bill that has earned Administration support.\n       The bill is supported by outside stakeholders such as the \n     American Israel Political Affairs Committee (AIPAC).\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am hopeful today that the leaders will \nbe able to get together and will be able to get consent to move forward \non this bill. I assure you, this is a bill we must pass. This is ``the \nextension'' of ILSA with some very well thought out, negotiated \ncompromises between Republicans and Democrats in the Congress, as well \nas the administration. I am hopeful that we can get a successful \nconclusion to that bill. The security of our country demands it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10504-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10504-S10505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to move to another topic, \nand that is back to the issue of immigration and the fence bill with \nwhich we are dealing.\n  A lot of people have talked about a variety of implications of this \nlegislation. To my mind, one of the principal considerations is the \nissue of national security.\n  The 9/11 Commission stated in the preface of its report that:\n\n       It is perhaps obvious to state that terrorists cannot plan \n     and carry out attacks in the United States if they are unable \n     to enter the country.\n\n  That is obvious, but it is an important statement to be made that one \nof the things we must do to help secure this country is to make sure we \nhave a better immigration policy, whether it is a legal immigration \npolicy and people coming here legally, properly screened for legal \nimmigration, or people who are coming in.\n  One of the things we are hearing is there are a lot more people \ncoming across the southern border who are being picked up who are not \nMexicans, who are not from Latin America. They are coming from other \ncountries, other places around the world. This becomes an increasing \nconcern with the porous southern border.\n  I commend the House for putting forth this bill. This is a very \nimportant part of an initiative that I have been talking about since \nthe Senate passed an immigration bill which I said was, in my opinion, \na misstep. I offered a package of legislation called the border \nsecurity first approach, which is: Let's focus on the border. Let's \nfocus on first things first. If we have a problem with 11 million \npeople and growing, people who are in this country illegally, the first \nthing we should do is stop the growth. We should take a problem that \nnow looks to be an infinite problem, an ever-growing problem, and make \nit a finite problem with a specific number of people who are here. But \nthe idea that we are going to solve the problem of illegal immigrants \nby dealing with this, as the Senate bill did, by legalizing people who \nare here illegally without solving the problem of more and more people \ncoming--in fact, being another beacon for more people to come because \nif they do come, and they get here illegally, we are going to legalize \nthem at some point--it just, in my mind, is putting the cart before the \nhorse. We need to put the horse out there, and the horse is stopping \nthe problem from getting worse. That means border security.\n\n  A key element of border security that I think is obvious--certainly \nobvious to the American public; it is an 80-20 issue in my State--is to \nconstruct more physical barriers. That is what this legislation does.\n  It is important not just from the standpoint of the 9/11 Commission \nand terrorists, but what we are seeing in our State--again, we are far \nfrom the border--is an-ever increasing problem of illegal immigrants in \nillegal activity in our Commonwealth. We had the U.S. attorney for the \neastern district at a press conference where I announced a $2.5 million \ngrant to deal with the 222 corridor from Lancaster leading up into the \nLehigh Valley. We have an explosion of gang activity there, much of it \ndriven by illegal immigrants and a whole new crop of gangs from south \nof the border that are causing problems in that 222 corridor. We were \nable to get a Justice Department grant to help, but I think it points \nout the problem.\n  Hazleton, a sleepy little town, the wonderful little town of Hazleton \nhas gotten on the map because of the problems illegal immigrants--\ncriminal problems, drug problems, gang problems--have brought into that \ncommunity.\n  It is a continuing problem. Just last week, Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement arrested 100 criminals who were illegal aliens and other \nfolks who were immigrants out of status living throughout Pennsylvania, \nall the way from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh.\n  Among those arrested were sex offenders, people who have committed \nburglaries, larcenies, robberies, criminal trespass, weapons \nviolations, narcotics violations, aggravated assaults, resisting \narrest, fraud, et cetera. All of\n\n[[Page S10505]]\n\nthese people were wanted on these charges. So this is not just a \nnational security problem, but it is also a personal security problem \nwhen we are not regulating the people coming into this country, when we \nare allowing anyone with any record or with any intent to come into \nthis country.\n  Again, that is the right of every country to do: to make sure our \ncitizens are safe, and we have a way to accomplish that. I think this \nfence bill will be a step in the right direction.\n  Other ways in which people in this country are violating Americans, \nnot just through potential terrorist activity and criminal activity, \nbut another criminal activity that we are seeing more and more of--and \nwe heard some cases during the debate--is identity theft.\n  A woman came to my attention. A constituent contacted us by the name \nof Laurie Beers who had her Social Security number stolen by an illegal \nimmigrant. She is a nurse who, as part of her job, is constantly \ntraveling. She learned her information had been stolen and misused. She \ndid everything she was supposed to do: contacted the FTC, reported it \nto the identity theft hotline, contacted the credit bureaus, on and \non--obviously, contacted the FBI.\n  In response she found out, yes, she was a victim of identity theft. \nShe contacted the IRS. She was told that the man using her Social \nSecurity number is an illegal immigrant. After talking to the FBI and \nSecret Service, they confirmed the person is an illegal immigrant who \nhas been working for an employer in New York City and has been filing \nincome tax returns under her Social Security number.\n  Obviously, she was upset that a man working in New York was using her \nSocial Security number to file income taxes for 3 years. She contacted \nthe employer of that man who has been anything but cooperative in \nresolving this situation. In fact, she has reported they have been \ndownright nasty.\n  She is lucky her credit hasn't been destroyed. But this man has, \nunfortunately, with her Social Security number passed some bad checks, \nand now she can't use checks at Wal-Mart and other stores because of \nher Social Security number being linked to the passage of bad checks.\n  That is just one example. Is it a big deal in the security of \nAmerica? No, but it is a big deal if you are the person who is a victim \nof identify theft. So we see this as one ``small example,'' but big in \nher life, as well as thousands of other Americans who have been \naffected by the stealing of Social Security numbers.\n  This is an issue we need to address. We need to get this bill done \nthis year. We need to step away from the bad provisions that the Senate \npassed, which I can go into in great detail, but they have been \ndiscussed over and over, everything, again, from legalizing people who \ncommitted illegal activity by first stepping into this country, to the \nSocial Security issue, and a lot of others.\n  My time has expired. I thank, again, the leadership, Bill Frist, for \nmoving and pushing this bill. Let's hope for Senate passage today and a \nstart to dealing with the issue of illegal immigration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I believe I have 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10505-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10505-S10507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AGRICULTURAL WORKERS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, we have an opportunity today with the \nborder fence bill and with the concurrence of Members of this body to \nhelp an industry that right now is in deep trouble, and that industry \nis American agriculture.\n  The reason it is in deep trouble is because it does not have the \nworkforce to harvest the crops. This is true whether it is Florida, the \nState of Washington, Iowa, Idaho, California, Arizona, or any other \nagricultural State. The reason for the shortage of workers is because \nagriculture dominantly depends on what is an undocumented or illegal \nworkforce. The reason that is the case is because it has been found \nover the years that American workers simply will not do this work. \nTherefore, agriculture, the huge industry that we have in America, has \ncome to depend on an undocumented workforce.\n\n  Just to give one example--and I wish I had a big chart--but this is \nthe pear crop in Lake County, a farm owned by Toni Scully, and these \nmounds are rotting pears on the field because they cannot be harvested \nin time.\n  California is the largest agricultural State in the Nation. It is a \n$34 billion industry. It has 76,500 farms. California produces one-half \nof all of the Nation's fruits, vegetables, and nuts from only 3 percent \nof the Nation's farmland. If these products cannot be harvested--and it \nis late in the harvest season today--the price of fresh produce all \nover this Nation is going to rise.\n  We have an opportunity to do something about it. I am joined on the \nfloor by Senator Larry Craig of the State of Idaho who is the main \nauthor of the AgJOBS Program. In the Judiciary Committee in the \nimmigration bill, we revised AgJOBS and it was part of the Senate-\npassed immigration bill. Along with AgJOBS, we have reformed the \nagricultural guest worker program called H-2A. These two programs \ncombine to give the farmers of America the certitude they need that \nthere will, in fact, be a workforce able to harvest their crops, plant \ntheir crops, prune, cut, pack, and sort crops in this great country.\n  In my State we have roughly 350 different crops: lemons, tomatoes, \nraisins, lettuce, prunes, onions, cotton, and many others that are \ngrown all across the State. Growers are reporting that their harvest \ncrews are 10 to 20 percent of what they were previously. It is a \ndisaster, and it will be a very costly disaster for the farm community \nas well as for the consumers of America. And it can be solved. We could \nmove today to put the AgJOBS bill on the border fence bill. We all \nrecognize it isn't germane postcloture, but the body could agree to \ninclude it because of the emergency circumstances that exist in \nagriculture States throughout the Nation today.\n  In my State we employ at least 450,000 people in the peak of the \nharvest, with farm workers progressing from one crop to the next, \nstringing together as much as 7 months of work. The estimate is that \nthe season is falling short by 70,000 workers.\n  It is a very serious situation. Fields in Pajaro Valley in Santa Cruz \nCounty are being abandoned. Farmers can't find workers to harvest \nstrawberry, raspberry, and vegetable crops. In the Pajaro Valley, one \nfarmer reports he has been forced to tear out 30 acres of vegetables. \nHe has about 100 acres compromised by weeds because there is nobody to \nweed the field. He estimates his loss so far to be $200,000. California \nand Arizona farmers say they need 77,000 workers during December to May \nto harvest vegetables, and they estimate the shortage will be 35,000 \nworkers.\n  It is amazing to me that we can't do something about this by passing \na bill that has been heard in the Judiciary Committee, that has been \namended, that has been discussed over a period of years.\n  I would ask, if I might, the Senator from Idaho a series of \nquestions, through the Chair. The first question is how long the \nSenator from Idaho has been working on the AgJOBS bill?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator asking the \nquestion. I began to work with American agriculture and specifically \nwestern growers in the Pacific Northwest and in the Senator's State of \nCalifornia starting in about 1999 when they came to me and recognized, \nas they now clearly know, that they were beginning to rely on an \nillegal workforce of undocumented workers who were coming in because \nthe law that exists, the H-2A, was so complicated and so bureaucratic, \nit was simply failing them. So it has been now at least 7 years that we \nhave worked to comprise and build the AgJOBS legislation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if I may, through the Chair, is there \na crisis in the State of Idaho?\n  Mr. CRAIG. There is a growing crisis in the State of Idaho. I would \nlike, if the Senator from California doesn't mind, to submit for the \nRecord a ``Dear Colleague'' letter that the Senator from California and \nI sent out late this month. It speaks of California and Idaho and \nWashington and Oregon. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n[[Page S10506]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 22, 2006.\n       Dear Colleague: Earlier this week, we went to the floor to \n     highlight the desperate need for agricultural workers. In our \n     colloquy, we discussed how American farmers are suffering, \n     not because they don't have the crops and inventory, but \n     because they don't have the workers to bring their crops to \n     the market.\n       In fact, just this morning, a New York Times front page \n     story proclaimed ``Pickers Are Few, and Growers Blame \n     Congress.'' (copy attached) To be honest, we agree with their \n     sentiment.\n       Farmers across this country have every reason to be angry \n     and frustrated. There is simply no reason AgJOBS has not been \n     enacted, and no reason it could not be passed now. The New \n     York Times article is just one of dozens that have been \n     written this summer highlighting the plight our farmers are \n     facing.\n       California is the single largest agriculture state in the \n     nation with over $34 billion in annual revenue and \n     approximately 76,500 farms. And this year, growers in \n     California are reporting that their harvesting crews are 10 \n     to 20 percent of what they were previously. As the Times \n     reported, ``California farms employ at least 450,000 people \n     at the peak of the harvest, with farm workers progressing \n     from one crop to the next, stringing together as much as \n     seven months of work. Growers estimate the state fell short \n     this harvest season by 70,000 workers.'' The impact is \n     devastating ``fields go untended, and acres have to be torn \n     up because there is no one to harvest them.'' (San Jose \n     Mercury News 8/9/06)\n       Agricultural labor shortages affect not just California; in \n     fact, they are impacting farms across the country, including \n     harvesting of citrus in Florida, apples in New Hampshire, \n     strawberries in Washington, and cherries in Oregon. In \n     Wyoming, it has been reported that the labor shortage played \n     a central role in the imminent closure of the $8 million Wind \n     River Mushroom farm. The Idaho Department of Commerce and \n     Labor reports that the number of farm workers in Idaho is \n     down by 18 percent, and the Potato Growers of Idaho believes \n     ``appropriate legislation, such as AgJOBS, is needed to keep \n     the industry growing.'' (PGI news release, 9/12/06)\n       According to Cox News Service, ``One farmer in Cowlitz \n     County in Washington state reported one-third of his \n     blueberry crop rotted in the field for want of enough \n     pickers,'' and a farmer in Oregon complained ``farmworkers \n     should have been harvesting 25 tons of fruit per day from \n     his Polk County cherry orchard. Instead, he could only \n     hire enough temporary farmworkers to pick 6 tons.''\n       Most shocking, the American Farm Bureau has found ``that if \n     Congress enacts legislation that deals only with border \n     security and enforcement, the impact on fruit and vegetable \n     farmers nationwide would be between $5 billion and $9 billion \n     annually. Net farm income in the rest of the agricultural \n     sectors would decline between $1.5 billion and $5 billion a \n     year.''\n       Yet this is a problem we know how to solve, and can solve \n     with your help. We have both introduced the AgJOBS bill as an \n     amendment to the border fence bill now before the Senate. The \n     AgJOBS program, previously passed by the Senate, is a \n     bipartisan solution that would create a pilot program to \n     allow certain longtime, trusted agricultural workers to \n     legalize their immigration status in the United States while \n     at the same time fixing the H2A visa program so farmers \n     needing new temporary workers can bring them into this \n     country through legal channels.\n       The time is long overdue to help American farmers get the \n     labor they need. The opportunity is before us, and we must \n     not turn our backs on this real problem that could be fixed \n     with the enactment of the AgJOBS legislation. We urge you to \n     support our efforts to get AgJOBS added to the border fence \n     legislation and help American farmers get the assistance they \n     need to bring their crops to market.\n           Sincerely,\n     Dianne Feinstein,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Larry Craig,\n       U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 22, 2006]\n\n              Pickers Are Few, and Growers Blame Congress\n\n                           (By Julia Preston)\n\n       Lakeport, CA--The pear growers here in Lake County waited \n     decades for a crop of shapely fruit like the one that adorned \n     their orchards last month.\n       ``I felt like I went to heaven,'' said Nick Ivicevich, \n     recalling the perfection of his most abundant crop in 45 \n     years of tending trees.\n       Now harvest time has passed and tons of pears have ripened \n     to mush on their branches, while the ground of Mr. \n     Ivicevich's orchard reeks with rotting fruit. He and other \n     growers in Lake County, about 90 miles north of San \n     Francisco, could not find enough pickers.\n       Stepped-up border enforcement kept many illegal Mexican \n     migrant workers out of California this year, farmers and \n     labor contractors said, putting new strains on the state's \n     shrinking seasonal farm labor force.\n       Labor shortages have also been reported by apple growers in \n     Washington and upstate New York. Growers have gone from \n     frustrated to furious with Congress, which has all but given \n     up on passing legislation this year to create an agricultural \n     guest-worker program.\n       Last week, 300 growers representing every major \n     agricultural state rallied on the front lawn of the Capitol \n     carrying baskets of fruit to express their ire.\n       This year's shortages are compounding a flight from the \n     fields by Mexican workers already in the United States. As it \n     has become harder to get into this country, many illegal \n     immigrants have been reluctant to return to Mexico in the \n     off-season. Remaining here year-round, they have gravitated \n     toward more stable jobs.\n       ``When you're having to pay housing costs, it's very \n     difficult to survive and wait for the next agricultural \n     season to come around,'' said Jack King, head of national \n     affairs for the California Farm Bureau Federation.\n       California farms employ at least 450,000 people at the peak \n     of the harvest, with farm workers progressing from one crop \n     to the next, stringing together as much as seven months of \n     work. Growers estimate the state fell short this harvest \n     season by 70,000 workers. Joe Bautista, a labor contractor \n     from Stockton who brings crews to Lake County, said about \n     one-third of his regular workers stayed home in Mexico \n     this year, while others were caught by the Border Patrol \n     trying to enter the United States.\n       With fewer workers, Mr. Bautista fell behind in harvests \n     near Sacramento and arrived weeks late in Lake County. \n     ``There was a lot of pressure on the contractors,'' he said. \n     ``But there is only so much we can do. There wasn't enough \n     labor.''\n       For years, economists say, California farmers have been \n     losing their pickers to less strenuous, more stable and \n     sometimes higher-paying jobs in construction, landscaping and \n     tourism.\n       ``If you want another low-wage job, you can work in a hotel \n     and not die in the heat,'' said Marc Grossman, the spokesman \n     for the United Farm Workers of America. The union calculates \n     that up to 15 percent of California's farm labor force leaves \n     agriculture each year.\n       As they sum up this season's losses, estimated to be at \n     least $10 million for California pear farmers alone, growers \n     in the state mainly blame Republican lawmakers in Washington \n     for stalling immigration legislation that would have \n     addressed the shortage by authorizing a guest-worker program \n     for agriculture. Many growers, a dependably Republican group, \n     said they felt betrayed.\n       ``After a while, you get done being sad and start being \n     really angry,'' said Toni Scully, a lifelong Republican whose \n     family owns a pear-packing operation in Lake County. ``The \n     Republicans have given us a lot of lip service, and our crops \n     are hanging on the trees rotting.''\n       Tons more pears that were harvested were rejected by Mrs. \n     Scully's packing plant because they were picked too late. The \n     rejects were dumped in a farm lot, mounds of pungent fruit \n     swarming with bees, left to be eaten by deer. ``The anthem \n     about the fruited plain,'' Mrs. Scully said sadly, ``I don't \n     think this is what they had in mind.''\n       Some economists and advocates for farm workers say the \n     labor shortages would ease if farmers would pay more. Lake \n     County growers said that pickers' pay was not low--up to $150 \n     a day--and that they had been ready to pay even more to save \n     their crops. ``I would have raised my wages,'' said Steve \n     Winant, a pear grower whose 14-acre orchard is still laden \n     with overripe fruit. ``But there weren't any people to pay.''\n       The tightening of the border with Mexico, begun more than a \n     decade ago but reinforced since May with the deployment of \n     6,000 National Guard troops, has forced California growers \n     to acknowledge that most of their workers are illegal \n     Mexican migrants. The U.F.W. estimates that more than 90 \n     percent of the state's farm workers are illegal.\n       Most California growers gave up years ago on recruiting \n     workers through the seasonal guest-worker program currently \n     in place. Known as H-2A, the program requires employers to \n     prove they tried to find American workers and to apply well \n     in advance for relatively small contingents of foreign \n     workers for fixed time periods.\n       ``Our experience with the current H-2A program has been a \n     nightmare,'' said Luawanna Hallstrom, general manager of \n     Harry Singh & Sons, a vine-ripe tomato grower based in \n     Oceanside, near San Diego.\n       Ms. Hallstrom said her company tried to use the program in \n     the months after the Sept. 11 attacks, when security checks \n     forced it to fire illegal migrant employees who were working \n     in tomato fields on a military base. Her company lost $2.5 \n     million on that 2001 crop, she said.\n       Over the years, occasional programs to draw American \n     workers to the harvests have failed. ``Americans do not raise \n     their children to be farm workers,'' Ms. Hallstrom said.\n       The failure of Congress to approve a new guest-worker \n     program surprised California growers because a proposal that \n     the Senate passed stemmed from a rare agreement between \n     growers' organizations, the U.F.W. and other advocates for \n     farm workers, and legislators ranging from conservative \n     Republicans to liberal Democrats.\n       Known as AgJobs, the proposal would create a new temporary-\n     resident status for seasonal farm workers and give them the\n\n[[Page S10507]]\n\n     chance to become permanent residents if they work intensively \n     in agriculture for at least three years. It was included in a \n     bill that passed the Senate in May. The House has passed \n     several bills focused on border security, and has avoided \n     negotiations with the Senate on a broader immigration \n     overhaul. [Three of the House bills were passed Thursday.]\n       Mr. Ivicevich, a 69-year-old family farmer, is not given to \n     displays of emotion. But he paused for a moment, overwhelmed, \n     as he stood among trees sagging with pears that oozed when he \n     squeezed them. His nighttime sleep, in his cottage among his \n     122 acres of orchards, is disrupted by the thud of dropping \n     fruit and the cracking of branches.\n       For decades, Mr. Ivicevich said, migrant pickers would \n     knock on his door asking for work climbing his picking \n     ladders. Then about five years ago they stopped knocking, and \n     he turned to a labor contractor to muster harvest crews. This \n     year, elated, he called the contractor in early August. Pears \n     must be picked green and quickly packed and chilled, or they \n     go soft in shipping.\n       ``Then I called and I called and I called,'' Mr. Ivicevich \n     said.\n       The picking crew, which he needed on Aug. 12, arrived two \n     weeks late and 15 workers short. He lost about 1.8 million \n     pounds of pears.\n       His neighbor, Mr. Winant, standing in his drooping orchard \n     with his hands sunk in his jeans pockets, said he would \n     rather bulldoze the pear trees than start preparing them for \n     a new season.\n       ``It's like a death, like a son died,'' said Mr. Winant, \n     45, who cares for the small orchard himself during the \n     winter. ``You work all year and then see your work go to \n     ground. I want to pull them out because of the agony. It's \n     just too hard to take.''\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, clearly what is happening--and the Senator \nhas said it so well--is this a failure of American agriculture or is \nthis a failure of Congress? It is clearly a failure of Congress and the \nGovernment.\n  We have known our borders are porous for a long time, and we are \nclosing them now, and we should close them. There is nothing wrong with \ndoing that. In fact, for national security and to build an orderly \nprocess in immigration, it is critical that we do close them or control \nthem. But we also knew that immediately attached to it had to be the \ncreation of a legal guest worker program. That is where Congress is \nfailing. We believe and in the letter we submitted the losses by the \nend of the harvest season could go anywhere from $1 billion--and they \nare well beyond that now--to $5 billion or $6 billion at farm gate, \nmeaning as it leaves the farm, which means to the consumer in the \nsupermarkets of America, it will be a much higher price to pay.\n  I thank the Senator for asking the question.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his response.\n  The fact is we have a pilot program that is part of the immigration \nbill that would provide over a 5-year period 1.5 million undocumented \nworkers the opportunity to become documented, and provided they do \nagricultural work for a period of time, over time, to earn a green \ncard. In discussing this with some Members they said they would agree \nif it were a temporary program. Well, it is a temporary program, \nbecause it sunsets in 5 years. I believe, and the Senator from Idaho \nwill correct me if I am wrong, we would be prepared to change that \nsunset from 5 years to 2 years, or a time that would bring about \nconcurrence from the Members.\n  But the point is there is a crisis out there. The point is we can \nsolve that crisis now with this legislation. And the point is it is not \nnew legislation. It has been authored, debated, discussed, heard now \nover a 6-year period. It has been refined. Both Senator Craig and I are \nconvinced it will work. It was part of the immigration bill.\n  So what we are asking this body to do is essentially suspend the rule \nand allow this program to go into law at this time so the remainder of \nthe harvest season and, more importantly, the planting season for \nwinter vegetables and crops can be handled. If we do not do this, we \nwill go well into next year without the agricultural labor present to \nsustain an agricultural industry in America in an adequate way, and the \ncosts will be enormous.\n  I think somebody around here should begin to think of the consumer. I \ndon't want to say to California families they are going to go in and \nbuy heads of lettuce at $4 a head or more or broccoli at $5 a head or \nanything else because of a dramatic shortage, because farmers won't \nplant, because farmers can't pick, because farmers can't harvest, they \ncan't sort, they can't pack, they can't can. That labor is needed, and \nyear after year it has been documented that Americans will not do this \nkind of difficult, hot, stooped labor.\n  So this is an opportunity. It is an opportunity for us to respond to \nan industry of which we are all proud, and an industry which is in deep \ntrouble at the present time.\n  Let me go on with a few other examples. I mentioned that California \nand Arizona farmers say they need 77,000 workers during the December to \nMay to harvest, and they estimate they may be 35,000 workers short. The \nestimates from my State are that illegal immigrants make up at least \none-fourth of the workforce and as high as 90 percent of the farm labor \npayroll. It is also estimated that for every agricultural job lost, we \nlose three to four other related jobs. I am told that in the Senator's \nState, farm workers are down 18 percent, and the potato growers of \nIdaho want AgJOBS passed to keep the industry growing.\n  In the State of Washington, in Cowlitz County, one-third of one \nfarmer's blueberry crop rotted in the field because there were no \npickers. Apple growers in the central part of the State were scrambling \nto find someone--anyone--to do the work of thinning the apple crop. \nAlso in Washington, production at Bell Buoy Crab in Chinook, Pacific \nCounty is down 50 percent since April.\n  In Florida, Citrus Mutual notes: ``There is very little doubt we will \nleave a significant amount of fruit on the tree.'' Orange production in \nthe State has been predicted to be the lowest since 1992 if the worst \nprojections are realized. Six million boxes of oranges may well go \nunharvested in Florida this year because of a shortage of fruit \npickers.\n  In Wyoming, they face the imminent closure of the $8 million Wind \nRiver Mushroom farm.\n  And in Oregon, farm workers should be harvesting 25 tons of fruit per \nday from the Polk County cherry orchards.\n  This is some indication. We have a bill, and that bill would provide \nthe opportunity for an undocumented worker who has worked in \nagriculture for a substantial period of time--there are two different \nformulas in the bill--to go in to register, to pay a fine, to show \ntheir tax returns, to agree to pay taxes in the future, to get a \ntemporary work card called a blue card, which would be biometric so \nthat that worker is identified; it would eliminate fraud, and it would \nenable that worker, if they continue to work in agriculture for a \nperiod of years, to then gain a green card. It is a sound program. It \nwill give farmers certainty. They will know there is an agricultural \nworkforce, and it will involve people already in this country who are \nskilled, who are professional at farm work.\n  I don't know what it takes to show that there is an emergency. I \nthink next year we would be ready, willing, and able to do this, but we \nwill have lost another agricultural season, we will have lost a spring \nseason, a summer season. I hope that someone will listen, that the \nleadership of this body will allow us, and I will call up--well, I \ncan't do it now, but at an appropriate time I will call up the \namendment that is at the desk.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask to speak for 7 minutes as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 7 minutes.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. DeMINT related to the introduction of S. 3995 are \nprinted in today's Record under ``Statements On Introduced Bills and \nJoint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10507-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10507-S10511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PROTECTING THE PUBLIC HEALTH\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am rising in support of the motion of my \ncolleague from North Carolina to pass the bioterrorism and BARDA \nlegislation. It is vital we pass this bill before we adjourn because \nour Nation's biopreparedness should be strengthened now and not put off \nuntil some distant time in the future. I urge all Members to support \nthis motion and the bipartisan bill.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions, I know this issue has been a priority of both Democrats and \nRepublicans on the committee. Senator Burr\n\n[[Page S10508]]\n\nis the chairman of the committee's Subcommittee on Bioterrorism and \nPublic Health Preparedness. It has been clear to me that he has \ndirected a very open process that sought to get input from all \nstakeholders. In the past 2 years he has held at least eight hearings \nand roundtables on this subject, with witnesses representing a wide \nrange of views and opinions. I also know that he held a lot of meetings \nwith stakeholders, people who had an interest in this bill and ideas on \nthis bill. He also hired some extremely professional staff with a lot \nof experience who could provide input and work to find those third ways \nof doing things when things were difficult. I have been pleased with \nthe bipartisan effort and bicameral effort that he has made on this \nbill: to keep the House folks educated on what we were doing, to try to \nkeep the Senate educated on what we were doing.\n  The substance of this bill, accordingly, represents a consensus of \nwhat public health officials, experts, and public policy groups from \naround the Nation believe needs to be done immediately to protect the \npublic health of our Nation's families and workers. While we have made \nremarkable strides in our efforts to identify and address our Nation's \nweaknesses to biological threats, the fact remains that our defense on \nthese fronts is far from perfect. Despite our best efforts in Congress, \nand the administration's efforts, there are holes we must fill if we \nare going to adequately ensure our safety. Senator Burr has worked \ntirelessly in a bipartisan fashion in the HELP Committee to examine \nthese conditions and construct a solution to appropriately address the \ncurrent shortcomings of our biodefense. The product of that work is now \nthe subject of this motion, and it deserves our support.\n  Before we go home we all want to be able to tell our families and \nworkers that we are taking all steps necessary to protect us from a \nnatural, an accidental, or a deliberate public health threat. \nSupporting Mr. Burr's motion this morning is an essential step toward \nenacting these protections.\n  The bill has two distinct parts. The first part is the creation of a \nnew authority built upon the highly successful Department of Defense's \ndefense advanced research projects. This authority would encourage the \ndevelopment of new bioterrorism countermeasures. It is a look into the \nfuture; a way to figure out, before it happens, what needs to be \ndeveloped using experts who can then encourage people to develop those \nproducts.\n  The second part is the reauthorization of the Bioterrorism Act. Both \nparts are necessary to ensure our Nation's biodefense security. A few \nyears ago we had hoped that, through the creation of the bioshield \nfund, the pharmaceutical industry would create the drugs necessary to \nprotect Americans. We cannot close our eyes and pray they have done \nwhat we hoped. They have not. The pharmaceutical industry is not \ncommercializing enough drugs to fight infections diseases, whether they \nare spread naturally or through the effort of man.\n\n  The rise in the incidence of antibiotic-resistant strains of diseases \nand the possible specter of bird flu is very disturbing and demands our \nimmediate attention. It is clear that without the passage of this \nlegislation little will change.\n  The bill before us addresses this deficiency in a very similar \nstrategy and process that we have seen to be effective with the Army \nthrough DARPA. By applying the successes of the DARPA programs to \nbioterrorism, we hope we can spur the industry to address this urgent \nneed.\n  It is not clear if this step is enough, but it is clear if we do \nnothing, nothing will change.\n  The second portion of this bill also is vital to our biodefense \npreparedness. This part would reauthorize the Bioterrorism Act. To be \nclear, the Bioterrorism Act, which we passed after the anthrax attacks, \nwas a giant step forward. The law has done a tremendous amount to help \nState and local governments prepare. However, at the same time, the \nspecter of a pandemic bird flu was not on the horizon. In addition, we \nhave learned a lot from the biohazard experience after the effects of \nHurricane Katrina in the gulf coast.\n  More needs to be done to assure that State and local public health \nagencies know exactly what needs to be done and how they should be \nprepared.\n  The bill strengthens what we have already started to do and gives us \nthe flexibility to prevent biological events from happening in the \nfuture. We cannot put off for another day the vital biodefense \npreparedness provisions contained in this bill. Our families and \nworkers need this help today.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the motion. I support my colleague \nfrom the State of North Carolina as he tries to address this \nlegislation immediately. I thank him for all of his hard work to get us \nhere today.\n  I have not seen anybody dig into an issue to the level that he has, \nto get the expertise that he has in a very difficult area. We were \npleased when he came over from the House to be part of the Senate and \nbrought the expertise on this kind of bill with him. He has done a \ntremendous job, and I appreciate the way he has reached out to get \nsomething done.\n  It is my understanding that there might be an objection to going \nahead and doing this today. Normally, at this point we would read a \nunanimous consent request to get on the bill, but it is my \nunderstanding that no one is going to come down from the other side of \nthe aisle to object, and I can tell you I am not going to object to \nthat on anybody's behalf.\n  Civility in the Senate says if the other side doesn't show up to \nobject, somebody is supposed to object on their behalf. I am not going \nto do that. Instead, I am going to put off the request until later, \nuntil somebody can actually be here to object because I have difficulty \nimagining that people would object to this kind of national security at \nthis point in the history of the United States.\n  So with that announcement, I will allocate the remainder of the time \nto the chairman, who has been working diligently on this bill, and let \nhim give a few more informational views and comments and allocate the \nrest of the time.\n  I thank Senator Burr for his tremendous efforts, the tremendous work \nthat has gone on up to this point. We do need to finish it now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized. There is 12 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee, and I \nalso thank the ranking member, Senator Kennedy, who has been extremely \nhelpful throughout this whole process. If it were left up to the three \nof us, this bill would have become law and would have been signed by \nthe President months ago, because in fact 50 percent of this bill was \npassed unanimously in the House of Representatives. But as you begin to \nsee now the interest of my colleagues who think this is a vehicle \nleaving the Senate, some of the amendments that have popped up are not \neven germane to the issue of what we are here to talk about.\n\n  More importantly, I think we need to focus on why we are here--\nbecause of the threat of terrorism, the power of Mother Nature, what we \nhave learned from the destruction of Katrina, what we continue to hear \nfrom the voices of individuals whose intent is every day to kill \nAmericans.\n  This morning, the World Health Organization confirmed that the H5N1 \nbird flu strain has mutated. As you know, we don't have a vaccine \ntoday, but we are desperately trying to get there.\n  This Congress has made some exceptions as it relates to our \ndevelopment of a vaccine for pandemic flu because of the urgency. Yet, \nthey do not see the same urgency as it relates to e. coli, or smallpox, \nor anthrax, or the ability to genetically modify any of them to \novercome anything that we might have in our arsenal to defeat them \ntoday. Yet this morning the World Health Organization announced that in \nareas of China they have established that bird flu has mutated. That \nmutation means we do not have a vaccine; it means that the antivirals \nTamiflu and Relenza that we have don't protect against this strain. It \nmeans we are completely unprotected.\n  In addition to that, reported today by the head of al-Qaida in Iraq, \nhe put out an audio message that said this: ``We are in urgent need for \nyou as American bases are the perfect place for nonconventional \nexperiments of biologic and dirty warfare.''\n\n[[Page S10509]]\n\n  But some argue that is not a real threat, that al-Qaida never \nparticipated in that. However, this quote is from the head of al-Qaida \ncalling on his brothers, his scientists, to bring their research and \ndevelopment and see how well it works. If it can be used there, it can \nbe used here.\n  In this bill, our attempt was to make sure that we have in place a \nrobust research and development process that is focused on threats that \nmight be intentional, threats that might be accidental, or threats that \nare natural. We certainly saw the power of the natural threats 1 year \nago with Hurricane Katrina. As we sit here almost on the fifth \nanniversary of the anthrax attacks on the Congress, I think it is worth \nreminding our colleagues that this threat hasn't gone away. This threat \ncontinues yet today, and 5 years later we do not have the vaccines and \ndrugs to defeat these threats. And if in fact terrorists have spent any \ntime to genetically modify it, we have to question whether we have an \nantiviral capability to treat individuals who are infected and reverse \nthat course and make sure there is no loss of life.\n  We are headed into a new season of pandemic flu. As that season \nstarts and we detect those infected birds, how long will it be before \none bird finds the shore of the United States, be it through Canada or \nAlaska?\n  We need to continue. We need to pass this legislation, We need to \ncatch up with what the House did this week.\n  Members will come to the floor and say, ``We didn't debate it enough; \nwe didn't have enough hearings; my voice wasn't heard.'' Let me assure \nyou I have reached out to every Member of this body. I have \ncontinuously solicited their input, and most of that is incorporated \ninto this bill. I will assure you there has been some input that I \ncould not accept in the bill because it wouldn't maintain what we tried \nto accomplish; that is, to assure the American people we are doing \neverything within our power to make sure they are safe.\n  The legislation we have developed focuses on strategies to address \npublic health and medical needs of at-risk individuals. Every person in \nthis body learned after Hurricane Katrina that we have to better \nprepare to meet the needs of at-risk individuals, children and older \nAmericans, in a totally different way than our current response plans. \nIn our bill, we require that to be part of our national preparedness \ngoals. We set up an at-risk individuals advisory committee to \ncontinually remind those responsible for responding to disasters of \nwhat in fact they need to do for at-risk populations.\n  In addition, we require of every State emergency response plan to \nincorporate at-risk individuals into their plans. We have not left them \nbehind. We have made them a centerpiece of our focus in this \nlegislation.\n  We also strengthen the State and local public health infrastructure \nin this bill by reauthorizing over $1 billion a year in Federal funding \nfor grants from Health and Human Services for public health and medical \npreparedness.\n  The last thing we do, which I will focus on, is the single most \nimportant thing in this bill. We put somebody in charge. We made one \nindividual responsible for the health care response of the Federal \nGovernment. And where we had those responsibilities fragmented before, \nwith the help of the chairman of the Department of Homeland Security \nAppropriations Committee, we began to move those things. And where \nthere needed to be greater consultation with agencies such as the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, we built in that \nconcentration.\n  I am convinced that with one person in charge when there is another \ndisaster in America, we will not have fingerpointing. We will know \nexactly who to go to and who to hold responsible for execution of the \nplan, for creation of the plan, but, more importantly for how that plan \ndovetails with 50 State plans, thousands of communities, regardless of \nwhat the threat is, whether it be natural, intentional, or accidental.\n  We truly have lived up to what the chairman of the committee asked us \nto do--that was create the ability for an all-hazards response. Don't \nput us in a situation where we create something for a known threat only \nto have to go back and recreate the wheel when all of a sudden a threat \nappears that we didn't anticipate. This sets up a framework that allows \nus to do that.\n  It is my hope that later today the chairman will offer a unanimous \nconsent request. I believe it will be objected to, but we will continue \nto try to improve our security level and put in place these changes so \nthat the American people have that comfort of knowing we are doing our \njob.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is advised that under the \nunanimous consent order currently only a member of the majority who is \nallocated time without a unanimous consent request is Senator Craig of \nIdaho. The Senator could be recognized by virtue of another unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I commend the chairman of the HELP \nCommittee, Chairman Enzi, and Senator Burr, who is the energy and \nauthor of this bill.\n  I don't think there is a bill that comes to this floor that isn't \nimportant. Obviously, it wouldn't make it to this point in legislation. \nSo calling something ``important'' becomes sort of a common phrase \naround here. But when you are talking about the issue of whether \nAmerica is prepared for either a pandemic flu, or a terrorist attack \nusing a biological agent which could threaten thousands and thousands--\npotentially tens of thousands--of Americans, you are talking about \nsomething that is really important. Senator Burr has focused on this \nissue.\n  We have in place laws that Senator Enzi and I helped structure a few \nyears ago on Bioshield, to try to get this process started of getting \nready for that kind of a biological attack. But the process didn't work \nthe way it was supposed to work. It wasn't getting the industry \ninvolved, which has been devastated in our country--literally wiped out \nfor all intents and purposes--by lawsuits. It was not willing to get \nstarted up again because they didn't feel there was, first, an adequate \nsource of resources in the area of dealing with a biological attack \nand, secondly, they feared the huge potential liability that might fall \non them for the production of what would be not a major item within \ntheir market.\n  Senator Burr has spent a year addressing these issues: How do we get \nmore manufacturers and more entrepreneurs and more medical specialists \ninto the business of developing and being positioned to develop \nvaccines which will deal with potential pandemic flu or a terrorist \nattack.\n  In addition, he recognized that is not enough, that you have to get \nthe communities--especially State and local communities--thinking about \nhow they will handle a situation where they may have literally tens of \nthousands of people they have to care for all at once, that type of a \nsurge, or that they have to isolate from the community. The Federal \nGovernment clearly wasn't orchestrated correctly. It was diffused, as \nSenator Burr pointed out, as to who was responsible and how these plans \nwere going to be developed.\n  This piece of legislation has evolved here through a superior \nexercise in legislative activity by Senator Burr and Senator Enzi, \nchairman of the full committee, in a bipartisan effort, a bicameral \neffort to address these very significant problems which we have found \nwithin our health care delivery system when it comes to dealing with a \npotential threat of a pandemic event or biological event.\n  This legislation should be passed. There is no reason it shouldn't \npass. It passed in the House overwhelmingly. It came out of our \ncommittee unanimously. There is no reason it should not move across \nthis floor. The other side of the aisle may have a couple of \nreservations about it. There is plenty of time to go back and address \nthose if those reservations have any legs. But the point is the basic \nlegislation here is excellent, it is agreed to, it is bipartisan but, \nmost importantly and most significantly, it is needed now.\n  Obviously, we hope we don't get hit with a pandemic flu, but we have \nto start getting ready now if that happens. We can never predict when a \nterrorist attack is going to occur. Should\n\n[[Page S10510]]\n\nit occur with biological weapons, we need to get ready now for that. \nThis bill does that.\n  I congratulate the Senator from North Carolina, and I congratulate \nthe chairman of the committee, a superb chairman, who did a great job. \nBut the smartest thing he did was to turn it over to the Senator from \nNorth Carolina to straighten it out. This is a good bill and should be \npassed. I hope the Senate will pass it today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, first, I thank Senator Burr. Senator Burr \nand I served on the Commerce and Health committees in the House \ntogether. He also served on Intelligence in the House, and we have his \nexpertise, his experience, and his tremendous insight into what needs \nto be done, and the risks.\n  I find it ironic that since we talk about all the issues that face \nour country in terms of risk, this is potentially one of the most \ndeadly risks our country faces--not just from a natural occurrence such \nas bird flu but from the intentional use of manipulating biological, of \nmanipulating viruses and bacteria. We know the intent of the people we \nare now fighting. It is to use fully any means at any time in any way \nto cause great disruption not only to the lives of Americans but on the \neconomy of America.\n  The fact that someone would hold up this bill to give us the \ncapability to direct resources to become prepared says one of two \nthings: Either they don't believe there is a real threat either from \nMother Nature or the leaders of the ``Islamo-fascist'' terrorists who \nwant to attack us today or that they think we are prepared. And we are \nnot prepared.\n\n  We heard Senator Gregg talk about the vaccine industry. We need a \nprogram to redevelop our capabilities. I am a practicing physician. \nWhat we do know is vaccine costs are higher today because we have no \nindustry. We have a limited supply of vaccine manufacturers. We need \nresearch into vaccines at every area of every virus and every bacteria \nthat could possibly be used against us, and then we need a way to get \nthat out and a way to utilize it. We need research into new antiviral \ndrugs for many of the viruses that could be posed as a biological \nweapon against this country.\n  I find it ironic, kind of like last night, we are trying to do \nsomething for victims of HIV, and those who want to object will not \ncome to the floor and object; they want to hide in secrecy. They do not \nwant to say what is really wrong. What they want to do is stop the \nprocess, hold up the process, and not accept the responsibility. There \nis no one in this Senate who holds up more things than I do, but \neverybody knows that I am the person doing it and they know why I do \nit.\n  This is within the responsibility of the Federal Government. It is \nwithin the priority of making a decision on where we spend money and \nwhat should be spent first. Protecting this country should be one of \nthe No. 1 things we do. Protecting the lives of American citizens \nshould be one of the No. 1 things we do.\n  To not come here and defend why we think this bill is not \nappropriate, to not come here and stand up and take credit for stopping \nprevention of accidents and terrorism in this country says a whole lot \nabout the lack of transparency in this Senate. They should come to the \nSenate and say what is wrong and why they object. We should have a \ndebate. If they want to object after that, let them do it. But to not \ncome to the floor to make a formal objection as a courtesy to Senator \nEnzi, who does respect the rights of other Members of this Senate, it \nmeans those Members who will not come hide in the shadows, and the \nAmerican people do not get to know what others might think is wrong \nwith proceeding. That does an injustice to the country and to this \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I don't see additional Members in the \nSenate, so I will take the opportunity to ask unanimous consent to \naddress the Senate for 5 minutes. If I do see additional Members \nseeking recognition, I will certainly accommodate them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I was reminded, as Dr. Coburn spoke, that we \ndo have a blueprint that guides us as it relates to pandemic flu. It is \n``The Great Influenza.'' Most of us in the Senate were not here in \n1918. I daresay we have few Members who were here at that time. This \nbook is the greatest recap of what happened at that time and the \nsignificant impact on the lives of the American people and how many \nindividuals died. Unlike what we might expect in a flu season, those \naffected were not the old and at risk. They were the young and healthy. \nThey were the ones who were attacked with this case of pneumonia which \nwas a strain which could not be overcome with any medicine they had \navailable.\n  One walks away from this historical lesson realizing, if we think it \ncould happen--which nobody questions--then we should do everything \nwithin our means to make sure we are not left in the same position we \nwere in 1918 with no stable of products to defeat this virus.\n  What do we do in this bill? We develop a partnership between the \nFederal Government and private companies, between the Federal \nGovernment and academic institutions, between the Federal Government \nand any researcher who might have research that leads us to believe \nthey might hold the key to a cure. We enter into that partnership with \nthe belief that as long as the research and development shows promise \nin the right direction, we will continue to be a good partner, but if \nat any point, in real time, we see it is not headed where we want, we \nstop our funding. We are fiscally responsible.\n  We make sure one person is in charge of the health response in the \nUnited States versus a multitude of individuals at multiple agencies. \nFor the first time, this country would have an approach to our health \nresponse and to our development of antivirals and vaccines to defeat \nthese agents that is not limited to one area but covers all hazards.\n  We build on the State preparedness plans. We do not trump the State \nplan. We do not create two separate plans. We integrate into that State \nplan to make sure we are there to support the replenishment of \nsupplies, with the logistic needs. We have to make sure, in fact, that \nin the first 72 hours after a disaster, individuals feel the full \neffects of local, State, and Federal resources.\n  We rebuild the public health infrastructure in America. I challenge \nanyone to look at the community they live in and compare the public \nhealth infrastructure they grew up with to the one they have today. It \nis impossible to believe we can have a nationwide plan of response if, \nin fact, our public health infrastructure varies as greatly as it does \ntoday from the inoculation point for low-income children to the only \nplace, in some cases, where health care can be delivered.\n  We strengthen our surveillance, which, as we look at the bird flu, is \nabsolutely crucial, our ability to identify at the earliest possible \npoint whether, in fact, an infection and a threat is alive and well.\n  We allow for the surge capacity of health care professionals. I see \nmy colleague from Louisiana is in the Senate. She would be the first to \nknow that one of the challenges when Katrina dramatically affected this \ncountry was that health care professionals around the country who \nintended to go to Louisiana and supply that very important medical \nsurge capacity had a licensing problem in Louisiana. I forget the exact \nreason. But the question is, How can we overcome this challenge in the \nfuture? We create in this bill a voluntary network that health care \nprofessionals can sign in to get their credentials verified ahead of \ntime, where the United States can then deploy these approved health \ncare professionals on a moment's notice without any additional hurdles.\n\n  I see my colleagues. Since we do have individuals who could execute \ntheir objection, it would probably be an appropriate time to offer the \nunanimous-consent request.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S10511]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina controls the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous-consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Unanimous-Consent Request--S. 3678\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous-consent that the HELP \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 3678 and the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration. I also ask unanimous-\nconsent that the substitute at the desk be agreed to; the bill, as \namended, be read the third time and passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask \nunanimous-consent that the majority leader, with the concurrence of the \nDemocratic leader, may at any time turn to the consideration of S. \n3678; that it be considered under the following limitations: that the \nmanagers' amendment be withdrawn and a managers' amendment that has \nbeen agreed to by both managers and both leaders be agreed to for \npurposes of the original text; that the first-degree amendments deal \nwith similar subject matter as contained in the text of the bill, \nexcept where noted; and that relevant second-degree amendments be in \norder thereto. The amendments are as follows: Durbin, single food \nagency; Conrad, national emergency telehealth task force; Lieberman, \nat-risk populations; Lautenberg, mass-transit preparedness; Wyden, \nFOIA; Leahy, compensation fund; Dorgan, one amendment; Leahy, two \namendments; Obama, one amendment; Levin, one amendment; that in \naddition to any time limits on amendments, there be 6 hours of debate \non the bill--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's unanimous-consent request is out \nof order by merely reserving the right to object. The Senator has to \nobject to the pending unanimous-consent request by the Senator from \nNorth Carolina.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask \nunanimous-consent to modify the request of the Senator from North \nCarolina with another unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. As the Chair understands it, the Senator from \nWashington would still have to object to the pending unanimous-consent \nrequest in order to make it a substitute.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I believe the other Senator will have to object to my \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator would pause, is the Senator's \nsecond request to modify the pending unanimous-consent request of the \nSenator from North Carolina?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be in order.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask consent to modify the unanimous-consent request of \nthe Senator from North Carolina to the extent I just outlined, and also \nI add that there be 6 hours for debate on the bill to be equally \ndivided between the two leaders or their designees; and that upon the \ndisposition of these amendments and the use or yielding back of time, \nthe Senate bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to vote on \npassage of the bill.\n  I ask unanimous-consent that the Senator from North Carolina modify \nhis request to include this consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the motion?\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, as Members \nmay have missed the over 30 minutes many of us have been in the Senate \nChamber, a significant amount of time and effort has gone into this \nbill. A very general solicitation and at times a very specific \nsolicitation for input has been sought from my colleagues, without a \nresponse.\n  Yesterday, a list of possible amendments was supplied. Most of those \namendments were not even applicable to what is in the bill. We are not \nin a position right now to know what the specific modifications are \nthat are being suggested, since we have not seen the actual amendments. \nTherefore, I object to the unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Knowing they would object to our asking for a number of \nour Senators to be allowed to have amendments, I object to the \nSenator's request as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard to both the \nmodification and the original unanimous-consent request.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10511-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10511-S10514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            OFFSHORE ENERGY\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, we are trying to wrap up many important \nissues before we leave. One issue that has remained elusive at this \npoint is the solution for our offshore energy bill. The House has \npassed a version; the Senate has passed a version. I am here to talk \nabout the benefits of the Senate approach to this subject since there \nseems to be some real confusion on the part of some of the House \nmembers about the Senate approach. I have had many private \nconversations and many meetings, but I thought I might try to clarify a \nfew things as we seek to understand each other a little better.\n  I have great respect for many Members on the House side. Chairman \nPombo and others have worked very hard. I know they are very sincere \nabout trying to find new avenues for domestic production. It is most \ncertainly a goal I share and that many Senators in the Senate share, \nRepublicans and Democrats.\n  We have had our arguments, knockdown, drag-out arguments about ANWR. \nI am clearly on the side that supports production in ANWR. I happen to \nbe in a minority of Democrats on that, and we could never pass that in \nthe Senate, or have not to date. We have been debating it now for 30 \nyears. But there is consensus--there is consensus--in the Senate about \nopening a significant area in the Gulf of Mexico to help bring much-\nneeded oil and natural gas to this country.\n  I wish to put into the Record from the Consumer Alliance for Energy \nSecurity what they say about natural gas:\n\n       Natural gas is used to make fertilizer for ethanol.\n\n  For those who are arguing for more ethanol, ethanol needs sugarcane, \nethanol needs corn. We need fertilizer to grow sugarcane and corn.\n\n       Natural gas is used as a substitute for diesel fuel in our \n     buses and fleet vehicles.\n       Electric utilities use natural gas to generate clean power.\n       Natural gas is a raw material that goes into lightweight \n     cars for fuel efficiency, wind power blades, solar panels, \n     building insulation and other energy efficient materials.\n       Natural gas is used to make hydrogen fuel necessary for \n     fuel cells.\n\n  They say:\n\n       In the face of declining natural gas production, consumers \n     are hungry for a solution to our energy crisis.\n\n  The Senate has provided a solution. Democrats and Republicans agree--\nwe need more natural gas. So we have carved out an area. Shown on this \nmap, is an area that is under leasing moratoria right now and which has \nbeen under leasing for the last 15 or 20 years. It has been closed off \nto production--8 million acres.\n  But this Senate, in a historic vote, has decided that we need the \nnatural gas. We believe in what the Consumer Alliance and thousands of \norganizations have stepped up to say. We need natural gas. We are \nprepared to open this section--8 million acres.\n  To put this in perspective, ANWR is only 2,000 acres. So when critics \nof our approach say the Senate bill does not do anything, then, why did \nwe debate for 30 years over nothing? If we debated 30 years only 2,000 \nacres, why is 8 million acres nothing? I do not think that is true. It \nis obviously incorrect. Eight million acres is a great many more than \n2,000 acres. The reserves here are thought to be substantial.\n  Shown on this map is the oil discovery that was announced 3 weeks or \n4 weeks ago announced: the Jack well, as it is commonly known, \ndiscovered by a Chevron partnership. This one well, drilled 28,000 \nfeet--10,000 feet of water and 18,000 feet of land--will double the \nreserves of oil and gas in the\n\n[[Page S10512]]\n\nUnited States of America. This one little square, right here.\n  So when people in the House of Representatives say, opening up 8 \nmillion acres here will do nothing, they are dead wrong. We might find \nfour or five ``Jack'' wells in here. We could find 100. How would we \nknow? Because no one will let us go look. And if we do not pass this \nbill, which the Presiding Officer helped to pass and helped to craft, \nwe will never know, and our industries will continue to lose jobs and \nlose their competitive edge. We are losing thousands of jobs.\n  Experts estimate that there is enough gas in this section alone to \nrun 1,000 chemical plants for 40 years. That lessens the need to go \ndrilling in ANWR. But this bill is not about ANWR. And the good news \nabout this is, the States of Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, \nand Texas are all in agreement. Republicans and Democrats are in \nagreement. They understand the need. They want to step up and help \nAmerica. This money generated by this bill will go to support these \ncoastal communities and reduce the deficit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 more minutes. I see my \ncolleague from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. No problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I appreciate that.\n  Instead, the House of Representatives has proposed a bill that is \nbreathtaking in its reach, and then wonders why we cannot pass it. In \nthe House bill, the House committee decided to open up drilling along \nthe entire Atlantic seaboard, and they took it upon themselves to \nredraw state boundary lines. Very few people have seen these state \nboundary lines, so I decided I would go ahead and show this map so \npeople can see it.\n  These lines have not been approved by the Commerce Department. They \nhave not been approved by the Interior Department. They have not been \nseen by the Defense Department. And MMS does not certify these lines. \nThere are 200 years of maritime law that went into developing the \noriginal lines that looked like this, as shown on this official \nInterior Department map. The lines shown on this Interior Department \nmap are the lines that we are all governed by now. But the House \ncommittee decided to go into a room and redraw the lines without \ntalking to the Governors of these States, the Senators from these \nStates, and I am not even sure the House Members from these States ever \nsaw these lines.\n  They ask me why I can't pass this bill on the floor of the Senate. \nWhat is wrong with Senator Domenici and Senator Landrieu. They can't \nget this bill passed. I would suggest it is going to take a few \nhearings, a few public meetings, and a little bit of work over there \nbefore we can get something such as this passed. I will help them. I \nactually believe in what they want to do. I may be in the minority over \nhere. I will help. But I do not think I can get this done this weekend. \nBut what I can get done this weekend--what we can get done this \nweekend--is to open up 8 million acres filled with the natural gas and \noil this country desperately needs. We can send a positive signal and a \nnecessary signal to the marketplace that America is serious about \nfinding more domestic reserves for oil and gas. And we can send a \nhopeful signal--as the Saints did when they carried that ball across \nthe goal line earlier this week several times; an extraordinary game--\nto the people of the gulf coast that we still know they are suffering, \nand we are going to pass a bill that helps to generate jobs in this \nregion, saves their wetlands, builds their levees, and reduces the \nFederal deficit.\n  Our bill respects the coast of Florida, it reduces the deficit, it \nsaves the wetlands, it builds levees, and it gives everybody in America \nnatural gas--and there is a problem with this bill?\n  I do not know what the problem is. We had 72 Senators who worked all \nyear on it. I respect the House of Representatives. I understand what \nthey want to do. But it is too broad of a reach.\n  The Senator from California is on the floor, and she has been very \ngracious, and I will only take 1 more minute. I did not have time to go \nget the model they have for the west coast, of which their bill wants \nto open up west coast drilling. With all due respect to Congressman \nPombo, he does not even have the support of his own Governor in his own \nparty. And he wonders why Senator Domenici cannot get his bill passed? \nHe cannot get it past his California legislature. How am I supposed to \nget it past the Senate?\n  So I am asking the House colleagues, please be reasonable. Take this \na step at a time. Some people object to drilling on the Atlantic coast. \nI do not happen to be one of them. I will help them, but we cannot get \nthat done this weekend. And it may never happen because you have to get \npolitical support from these States.\n  But I will conclude with this: We have a great coalition in the gulf \ncoast. The people of the gulf coast know how to drill for oil and gas. \nThe technology is superb. We minimize the environmental footprint. We \nknow where the gas is. Let us go get it. Then we can use that money to \ncontinue to help us restore our coast.\n  So I am pleading with my colleagues. I will work with you. I will \ncontinue to work with you. So will Senator Domenici. And I think I can \nspeak for the Senators from Florida, as well as the Senators from \nMississippi, Alabama, and Texas. We will put our shoulders to the wheel \nto do what we can, but let us go forward.\n  In the Senate, the Gulf Coast States came together and created a \nformula that is fair to all. Each coastal-producing State shares in the \nrevenues received according to the length of their coastline, their \nproximity to oil and gas development--and the likely impacts from that \ndevelopment.\n  Also, the Senate formula recognizes that some of the Gulf States have \nprovided oil and natural gas to the country for decades, receiving the \nbrunt of the impacts, and few of the benefits. For that reason, States \nthat have hosted the industry for the longest would have secured \nmarginally more of the revenues by way of compensation.\n  The Senate bill also recognizes that the minerals of the Outer \nContinental Shelf are a national resource--belonging to the Nation as a \nwhole. That is why every State receives the majority share of the \nrevenues: 50 percent would go directly to the Federal Treasury; 12.5 \npercent would go into the Land and Water Conservation Fund--a \nconservation royalty that benefits all 50 States.\n  Arriving at a formula that was fair and equitable was not easy: each \nof the Senators from the four gulf-producing States met on a daily \nbasis over a series of weeks.\n  Ultimately, the gulf coast was able to stand united: all ten Senators \nfrom the Gulf States voted in favor of the Senate bill. But it was not \nan easy feat.\n  Agreement among neighboring States is critical--and difficult to \nachieve. What is at stake are billions of dollars and the Nation's \nenergy security.\n  The House bill creates State boundary lines that would divide the \nFederal OCS into zones controlled by the closest State. Under the House \nproposal, States have the power to authorize or halt energy development \nactivities within this zone. They also have claim to the lion's share \nof the revenues generated within this zone.\n  The Senate and the House take fundamentally different approaches to \ntwo key issues:\n  The Domenici-Landrieu bill would open 8.3 million acres in the Gulf \nof Mexico--a region that has continuously been one of the most \nproductive oil and natural gas basins in North America.\n  Since the world's first offshore oil well was drilled near Creole, \nLA, in 1933, the Gulf of Mexico has provided the Nation with more than \n15 billion barrels of oil and 165 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.\n  Each year, offshore production from the Gulf of Mexico offshore \naccounts for more than 560 million barrels of oil and 4 trillion cubic \nfeet of natural gas. If you add in the onshore production from the \nneighboring Gulf States, this region produces more than 1 billion \nbarrels of oil each year. That is more than the imports from Saudi \nArabia and Venezuela combined.\n  Conservative estimates show that the Senate bill will increase the \nNation's supply of affordable, domestically produced energy by 1.3 \nbillion barrels of oil and 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.\n  That much crude oil will produce enough gasoline to drive 1.7 billion \ncars\n\n[[Page S10513]]\n\nfrom DC to New York--with plenty left over to heat 1.2 million homes \nfor more than a decade.\n  These lines were drawn without any input from the coastal States, \nwithout input from the Minerals Management Service, the Coast Guard, or \nother stewards of America's oceans.\n  In fact, the Minerals Management Service had painstakingly crafted \n``State Administrative Boundaries'' in an effort to clarify which State \nhas the most interest in the area seaward of its coastline because of \nthe increasing number of commercial activities on the Federal OCS.\n  These boundary lines--which were crafted in consultation with the \nMMS, the National Ocean Service, the Department of State, as well as in \naccordance with past Federal and Supreme Court decisions, and \nsignificant public input--were disregarded in the House bill.\n  States that were deemed more likely to drill off their coasts seem to \nhave been granted more territory. States that have made their \nopposition to OCS activity well known, seem to have had their \nterritories trimmed down significantly.\n  Virginia's gain was Maryland's and North Carolina's loss. Georgia's \ngain was Florida's loss.\n  I support increased access to the Nation's offshore energy resources. \nI believe strongly that we need to make this Nation more energy \nindependent and less reliant on foreign sources of oil.\n  But I am also a pragmatist and know that we cannot overturn 30 years \nof poor energy management policy overnight--without consulting the \nStates, without consulting our Federal natural resource managers.\n  I encourage our neighbors on the east and west coasts to re-examine \ntheir failed policy on moratoria on developing energy resources from \nthe Federal Outer Continental Shelf. But I cannot force them to do so. \nInstead, we need to have an open dialogue on this issue and work to \nimprove U.S. policy in this critical arena.\n  That much natural gas will sustain 1,000 chemical plants for 40 \nyears--and those plants would provide jobs for about 400,000 Americans.\n  The potential of future drilling in the Gulf was recently underscored \nby a massive oil discovery miles of the coast of Louisiana.\n  Some analysts believe that this single find in the deepwater Gulf of \nMexico could produce more than 15 billion barrels of oil.\n  By 2012, daily production from this single prospect could total \n800,000 barrels of oil per day of light, and more than 1 billion cubic \nfeet per day of natural gas.\n  This discovery effectively increased the total proven oil reserves of \nthe United States by 50 percent.\n  While the ``Jack'' discovery is not directly adjacent to the 181 and \n181 South area, some geologists have speculated that these mineral-rich \nridges could extend eastward into the 181 and 181 South area.\n  This find shows that the Gulf of Mexico remains one of the most \npromising oil and natural gas regions in North America and the world.\n  It is likely that major finds such as the ``Jack'' prospect will spur \nan increase in exploration and production activity in the ultradeep \nwaters of the Gulf of Mexico.\n  It is highly likely that this discovery--and other major finds in the \nGulf of Mexico--will cause bonus bids to escalate at future lease \nsales, and increase revenues flowing to the Federal Treasury.\n  In contrast to the bounty available in the Gulf of Mexico, the MMS \nanticipates that the total production off Virginia will be about 560 \nmillion barrels of oil and 327 billion cubic feet of natural gas.\n  Compare this to the resources opened by the Senate's Domenici-\nLandrieu bill in the Gulf of Mexico which the MMS estimates will total \n1.3 billion barrels of oil and 5.7 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. \nThe Virginia proposal has 4.7 million acres.\n  Domenici-Landrieu is adjacent to existing infrastructure--pipelines, \nports, and refineries. The area off Virginia is not adjacent to \nindustrial infrastructure.\n  Virginians may want to open their shores to offshore oil and gas \nproduction--a goal that I share and support--but Virginia's waters are \nquite close to the shores of North Carolina, Maryland, and Delaware.\n  Why is this a problem? In 1990, the State of North Carolina \nsuccessfully forced several oil companies to cease all activity and \nrelinquish their rights to drill more than 50 miles from shore, far out \nof sight from shore.\n  Similarly, California, Maine, and Florida have repeatedly proven that \nthey can shut down production, even when it is far from their shores.\n  Today, the President has acquiesced to his brother's request that no \nnew drilling be allowed within 100 miles of Florida. As a result, no \nnew leases are allowed off Alabama--despite the fact that their oil and \ngas has been safely produced in that region for more than 30 years.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that excerpts of document from \nthe Consumer Alliance for Energy Security and other relevant material \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From Consumer Alliance for Energy Security]\n\n                       Vote on an OCS Energy Bill\n\n\n                                  why?\n\n       A vote for an Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) energy bill is \n     a vote for clean, alternative energy. America must develop \n     alternative and clean sources of energy. But it can't happen \n     without natural gas. Congress can make it happen by safely \n     accessing the abundant supplies of American natural gas on \n     the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).\n       Natural gas is used to make fertilizer for ethanol.\n       Natural gas is used as a substitute for diesel fuel in our \n     buses and fleet vehicles.\n       Electric utilities use natural gas to generate clean power.\n       Natural gas is a raw material that goes into lightweight \n     cars for fuel efficiency, wind power blades, solar panels, \n     building insulation and other energy efficient materials.\n       Natural gas is used to make hydrogen fuel necessary for \n     fuel cells.\n       If Congress is serious about pursuing alternative energies, \n     then it must get serious about safely accessing America's own \n     natural gas supplies. We urge you to send an OCS bill to \n     President Bush this month. Doing so, Congress can reverse a \n     more than 25-year `Just Say No' energy policy. Congress holds \n     the key to ending the current energy crisis in the U.S.\n       In the face of declining natural gas production, consumers \n     are hungry for a solution to our energy crisis. Both H.R. \n     4761 and S. 3711 break new ground. Time is running out. We \n     strongly urge you to get the job done.\n       American consumers are counting on your action.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Business Roundtable,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 2006.\n       To Members of the Senate: . . . S. 3711 represents a \n     crucial building block for our long-term vision of greater \n     energy security and economic vitality. As you know, our \n     country is blessed with abundant supplies of deep-water oil \n     and natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico, much of which is \n     currently off-limits to development. S. 3711, which reflects \n     a strong bipartisan consensus, would open more than eight \n     million acres of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) to leasing \n     within one year. Estimates suggest that such action would \n     make nearly six trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 1.25 \n     billion barrels of oil newly available for production. The \n     availability of new supplies of natural gas, in particular, \n     would be a boon for industrial companies who rely on natural \n     gas as a critical raw material, and I consumers, who depend \n     on natural gas for home heating and electricity. . . .\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael G.

The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you so much.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleague Senator Landrieu, I think she \nmade a very clear statement about where we stand on oil drilling in \nthis country. And she is so right. A narrow bill passed here that is \ngoing to help her State. It is going to help the country. It stays away \nfrom the hot-button issues. It stays away from the California \ncoastline, which Republicans and Democrats in our State are united in \nsaying we need that coastline protected for our economy. It is quite \ndifferent than my friend's. We respect each other, and we understand \nit.\n  So what she is simply saying to the House is: We want to do \nsomething. We do not want to be a do-nothing Congress. Let's do \nsomething. Let's do the bill the Senate crafted, which again, I say to \nthe Presiding Officer, you were involved in.\n  Just before she left the Chamber, I wanted to say how strongly I \nappreciate her explanation of where we are.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10514-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10514-S10515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         AGRICULTURAL EMERGENCY\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, Mr. President, we have a very narrow bill before \nus, the border fence bill, which we cannot broaden; and that is why I \nopposed cloture on that bill. I do not oppose building a fence where \nyou need to do it, where the border is porous. I do not have a problem \nwith that. What I have a problem with is this narrow approach to the \nimmigration issue which precludes us from truly fixing our problems.\n  We are ignoring a lot of problems in this Congress, but I will tell \nyou what is emerging as an enormous problem, and that is, the problem \nthat farms are having all across this country because we have neglected \nto take care of the issue of farm labor.\n  In California, our farm community is in serious trouble. I sat with \nmy dairy folks, my ranchers, my farmers. We grow over 80 crops in our \nState. Senator Feinstein was eloquent in laying out how huge an \nindustry it is. These are folks who never come to me with fear in their \neyes. They are frightened because their crops are dying on the vine and \nin the fields across the State of California, and from what I have \nheard, in other States as well.\n  This is tragic for us. We could lose these farmers. We could lose \nagriculture. And we have a chance--Senator Craig, Senator Feinstein, \nand I, and others, have teamed up and said: Let's use this opportunity \nto broaden our approach. Senator Kennedy, of course, was the first to \ncraft a comprehensive piece of legislation, which we voted out of here.\n  Now, I do not understand--I spoke with Senator Frist, and he seemed \nto acknowledge there is a problem--why we cannot permit as part of this \nfence bill a very simple emergency piece of legislation that will \nsunset but just says let's make sure our agriculture community can \nsurvive, can continue.\n  Let me show you a photograph of one of my constituents looking at her \ncrop of pears, which is rotting on the ground. You look at her face, \nand you see what this means to her.\n  Let me tell you what it means to the people of our Nation. We export \nthese fruits and vegetables all throughout the Nation and, of course, \nthroughout the world. It is going to mean higher prices, that decreased \navailability of products. But this Congress will not let us address \nthis issue.\n  To the Republican leadership, I beg you one more time--and even some \nin your own party are begging you--we have to do more than one thing at \na time. You have to take the problem and solve it. So this whole notion \nof we will take care of the fence first, and in a few years we will \ntake care of something else--let me tell you, these farmers cannot \nlast. They are facing economic disaster.\n  As I said before, this is not a Democratic or Republican issue. I can \nassure you that the people who have come to see me are part of the \nRepublican base. They are perplexed. They do not understand it. They \nare the owners, entrepreneurs, the family farmers, the large farmers, \nand they have come together with labor. It was intense to get the two \nsides together. It started in the late nineties.\n  I remember when Senators Craig and Kennedy came with great excitement \nand said that we have a deal between labor and management, everyone \nsupports AgJobs. We went out to the floor and we have more than 60 \nvotes for this. Yet because of the maneuvers on the floor by the \nRepublican leadership, we cannot offer the AgJobs bill. No one can \nexplain it to me.\n  Republicans are facing the charge of being a do-nothing Congress. We \nwant to do something for our farmers. We want to help you. Let's please \ntake care of our farmers. Take care of this woman who is looking at her \nwhole life disappear in front of her because she doesn't have enough \nlabor to pick these pears.\n  The United Fresh Produce Association wrote Senator Frist a letter. It \nhas a headline that I have never seen in a letter:\n\n       Farmers to Congress: Support a Safe and Secure American \n     Food Supply, Pass an Immigration Fix Before the Election of \n     2006.\n\n  These are people who don't really get that involved in politics, but \nthey get it. They know an election is coming, and they are sending us a \nmessage to fix this. Further, they say:\n\n       A safe and domestic food supply is a national priority at \n     risk. With real labor shortages emerging, agriculture needs \n     legislative relief now. The choice is simple: Import needed \n     labor, or import our food.\n\n  What they are saying is, at the end of the day, we will not have a \nsafe, secure, and healthy food supply. This is not the time, it seems \nto me, that we want to lose that. With all of the talk about \nterrorism--and we all fear it--we want a safe food supply. We don't \nwant to have to depend on food coming in from other places. We want to \ndepend on our farmers and their great history and their great legacy.\n  We also will lose three to four American jobs for every farm worker \njob. Mr. President, I will say that again. We will lose three to four \nAmerican jobs for every farm worker job.\n  They say:\n\n       Any solution must recognize agriculture's uniqueness--\n     perishable crops and products, rural nature, significant \n     seasonality, and nature of the work.\n\n  Building a fence is not going to help our people. I am not against \nit; I voted for it. It is not a problem to me to build a fence. But \ndon't come out here and say: Aren't we great and doing something; we \nare building a fence and now everything is fine. That is hogwash.\n  We must pass an AgJOBS bill, and we can do it today. Our farmers and \nour\n\n[[Page S10515]]\n\nranchers are begging us to do it. They need a solution. Our farm \neconomy in some areas is becoming paralyzed. I showed you Toni Skully. \nThey were unable to harvest 35 percent of their crop. This is what is \nhappening all over California. I have been told it is also happening to \nmy lemon growers in San Diego. They are experiencing a 15- to 20-\npercent harvest loss. Avocado farmers in Ventura County are worried \nabout workers for the December planting season. Tree fruit growers in \nFresno County have seen the labor force decrease by as much as 50 \npercent. In Sonoma, as many as 17,000 seasonal farm workers have not \nreturned to work in the fields.\n  Again, I don't have a problem with the fence. We need to build it \nwhere we have a porous border. But that doesn't help our people.\n  Agriculture is a $239 billion-a-year industry, and if we refuse to \nprovide a solution to labor shortages now, we are jeopardizing our \ndomestic economy and our foreign export market. We are driving up \nproduction costs that get passed on to consumers. Our consumers are \nalready having trouble with health care costs, with gasoline costs, \nwith college tuition--oh, and now they are going to have problems \nputting food on the table.\n  This is not the time to turn away from our farmers. All of this is \nhappening for absolutely no reason. There is no problem in allowing us \nto proceed with this amendment to offer AgJOBS. I have been on the \nAgJOBS bill, probably since 2000, 2001, and we continue to have strong \nsupport for it. But, again, because this Republican Congress can, \napparently, only do one thing at a time, when it comes to immigration, \nwe are precluded from offering this amendment.\n  Mr. President, my farmers are proud, as are yours. My ranchers and my \ndairy families are proud. They don't ask for much. But when they came \nto meet with me--and they have come several times--and I saw the look \non their faces.\n  I said: What is it?\n  They finally said: You have to act.\n  I said: The fence bill is coming up.\n  They said: Maybe that is a chance now. We can get AgJOBS attached to \nit.\n  I went to Senator Kennedy, and I said to him at a caucus luncheon: \nThey are bringing up the fence bill, so why don't we move forward?\n  He said: I am working on it, and I hope we can have a comprehensive \napproach. A lot of people care about this.\n  Apparently, there are not enough Republican leaders who care about it \nbecause we are being told there won't be an amendment for AgJOBS. This \nis certainly a place where Democrats and Republicans should come \ntogether. I simply don't understand why they allow our farmers to \nsuffer, to worry, to wonder, to lose money, and then they have to come \nto us and ask for emergency help. They don't want emergency help.\n  AgJOBS is supported by United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association, \nthe Agricultural Coalition for Immigration Reform, the National Council \nof Agricultural Employers, the Western United Dairymen, the California \nGrape and Tree Fruit League, California Citrus Mutual, the California \nStrawberry Commission, the California Association of Wine-Grape \nGrowers, and the California Canning Peach Association.\n  The AgJOBS bill has pulled together both the owners and the workers. \nI thank Senators Craig and Kennedy for doing that. All they need is for \nus to do our job. The Senate is choosing to neglect a major sector of \nour Nation's economy--a bill supported by 62 Senators.\n  Again, the farm community has been a traditional Republican \nstronghold. So this isn't even good politics. I say to my friends it is \nbad politics, and it is bad policy. At the end of the day, we can still \ninsist that Senator Frist allow us to offer the Craig-Kennedy-\nFeinstein-Boxer measure, and all of us who care about this bill have a \nchance to do it. We don't want lip-service. We don't want calming talk. \nWe want action. We want action now. We want to help the farmers, the \nconsumers, the workers.\n  We don't want to see another industry fall apart right beneath our \nnoses. We have enough problems going on with people losing their health \ncare, they cannot afford college, and the housing market is in a \nprecarious situation. Why would we not come together and take care of \nthis important constituency?\n  In closing, a headline from last Friday's New York Times reads:\n\n       Pickers Are Few, and Growers Blame Congress\n\n  And they should blame Congress. Pretty soon it will be consumers \nblaming Congress, and they should. So let's get our act together. Let's \nget it done. Thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon as we go into the \nlast hours of this session, before we are apparently going to adjourn \nfor an entire 5 or 6 weeks, until after the election, to join with my \nleader on the Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, who spoke earlier \ntoday, and explain how the Republicans' failure to act on the annual \nfunding bills is going to hurt all of our communities.\n  As Senators, we have a job to do in passing the annual spending bills \nthat fund essentially all of our Government. It is one of the most \nbasic responsibilities we have. On the Appropriations Committee, under \nthe leadership of Chairman Cochran and Ranking Member Byrd, we have \ndone our job. But on the Senate floor, the Senate Republican leadership \nhas blocked our progress.\n  American families are going to pay the price. When I go home and talk \nto constituents in my State of Washington, they tell me they want our \ncountry to be strong again. The way that we can be strong again is to \ninvest at home. That is what I have been fighting to do on the \nAppropriations Committee. But now the Republican leadership is refusing \nto allow us to move forward on the investments that we have agreed on \nin a bipartisan way in the Appropriations Committee. In fact, they are \nnot even allowing us to debate making those investments. That is how \nwrong I see the priorities by this leadership.\n  Some people may suggest that if we pass this continuing resolution, \neverything is going to be fine. I hear the claims that there is no real \ndifference between passing the bills we have worked so hard to put \ntogether and just putting our Government on autopilot for a couple of \nmonths. Nobody should believe that. It is simply not true.\n  There is a real cost to failing to act on the appropriations bills. \nThis country is going to pay a price in airline safety. We are not \ngoing to be able to rapidly hire the air traffic controllers or safety \ninspectors we need. We are going to pay a price in highway safety \nbecause we are not going to be able to rapidly reverse the high \nincrease in traffic fatalities. We are going to pay a price in the \nfight against terrorism. We are not going to be able to fund the \nTreasury Department's efforts to stop terrorist financing. We are going \nto pay a price in educating our kids, improving our communities, and \ntraining our workforce.\n  Almost everywhere you look, we are going to pay a price if the \nRepublican leadership succeeds in blocking action on the annual \nappropriations bills.\n  I want to share some specific examples. First, I will say a word \nabout why this is happening. It is not because of partisan gridlock or \nbecause we have not had enough time to act. All of our bills have been \nready to go since August. It is because this Republican leadership does \nnot want to have a public debate about America's priorities just weeks \nbefore an election. I suspect it is because they realize their \npriorities are out of step with the American people.\n  There may be another reason to stall these bills. It hides the true \ncost of their wrong priorities. When we bring these bills up on the \nfloor, we have a chance--all of us in America--to see what is funded \nand what is not. We have a chance to offer amendments and debate about \npriorities that deserve more support. By blocking that debate,\n\n[[Page S10516]]\n\nthe Republican leadership is hiding the true cost of their policies. \nJust as they have used supplemental spending bills to hide the true \ncost of the war, they are failing to act on the annual spending bills \nto hide the cost of their misplaced priorities. They prefer to mask \nfrom the voters the tough funding choices their policies will require.\n  They prefer to deny almost three-quarters of this Senate the \nopportunity to have any input on the appropriations bills by sending \nthese bills directly from the committee to a conference. They prefer to \nset up an end-of-the-year train wreck that will require a massive \nOmnibus appropriations bill that will shortchange America's needs with \na minimum amount of debate.\n  I personally thank Senator Byrd for taking the time this morning to \ncall this issue to the attention of the entire Senate, as well as to \nthe entire Nation. I thank our committee chairman, Senator Cochran, for \nhis very capable leadership of our committee. I only wish Senator \nCochran was in power to control the floor schedule and not just the \ncommittee schedule.\n  Last year, Senator Cochran surprised many of us and earned the \nrespect of all of us in doing what seemed impossible: he succeeded in \nsending 11 appropriations bills to the White House for signature. He \nshowed us how it should be done.\n  This year, when it came to the management of our committee, Senator \nCochran actually improved on last year's record. Last year, the \nAppropriations Committee reported all but one appropriations bill to \nthe Senate floor before the August recess. This year, Chairman Cochran \nsaw to it that each and every one of our appropriations bills was \nreported to the Senate floor before the August recess. That involved a \nlot of very hard work and some very long markups. No one worked harder \nthan Chairman Cochran himself.\n  Unfortunately, this year, the Senate Republican leadership didn't \nshare Chairman Cochran's commitment. That is a change from last year. \nLast year, the Senate Republican leadership saw to it that all 12 \nappropriations bills were considered on the floor prior to adjournment. \nToday, we are just a few hours away from the beginning of a very long \nfall recess, and yet the Senate Republican leadership has seen fit to \ncall up only 2 of our 12 appropriations bills that the committee \nreported back in June and July. That record is shameful.\n  The full Senate has only debated two funding bills this year--Defense \nand Homeland Security. They are certainly really important, but they \nare just 2 of the 12 bills that we are charged with passing.\n  The others are critically important as well. Those bills ensure that \nthe care of our veterans returning home from Iraq is met. They ensure \nthat we educate our children, that we meet the housing needs of the \npeople we represent, and that we deal with the health care of all of \nour families, particularly our seniors. Those bills support our efforts \nto fight crime and drug abuse, provide disaster assistance to \nstruggling family farmers, and invest in our roads, our bridges, and \nour rail system.\n  It seems, as far as the Republican leadership is concerned, that \nthose issues this year can rot on the vine. According to their plan, \nthese functions of Government will be subjected to a continuing \nresolution that guarantees them only the lowest possible funding level.\n  I have had the privilege of serving on the Appropriations Committee \nfor every one of my 14 years in the Senate, and I am certainly aware \nthat Congress does not have a great track record when it comes to \nfinishing all the appropriations work before the beginning of a fiscal \nyear. But in my 14 years, I cannot remember a time when the Senate has \nmade so little progress in executing its most basic responsibilities. \nThe new fiscal year starts this coming Saturday, tomorrow. I had my \nstaff go back and check the record, and I can tell my colleagues that \nin the last 14 years, we have never begun a new fiscal year having \npassed as few as two of the appropriations bills out of the Senate. \nThis year, we have a deplorable record.\n  Looking forward, we are now hearing rumors that the other 10 \nappropriations bills are never going to come to the Senate floor for \ndebate. We are hearing rumors they are going to be sent straight to a \nconference with the House of Representatives to put together some kind \nof massive omnibus appropriations bill. I hope that is not the case. \nThat approach, frankly, is an insult to the 72 Members of this Senate \nwho do not serve on the Appropriations Committee. As a member of that \ncommittee, I had the opportunity to review each of those bills the \ncommittee reported. I had an opportunity to offer amendments in \ncommittee and full committee markups, but 72 of my Senate colleagues \nnever had that opportunity.\n  Those 72 Senators were elected by the people of their State to \noversee and influence decisions regarding the way their tax dollars are \nspent. By denying these 72 Senators the opportunity to debate these \nimportant bills, the Senate Republican leadership is denying those \nSenators' constituents the right to be heard. That is not the way this \nSenate ought to be doing its business.\n  Our country will pay a high price if we fail to act on these \nappropriations bills.\n  Some people are claiming it doesn't matter when we get around to \nactually finalizing the appropriations process. Mr. President, as the \nranking member on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, \nTreasury, the Judiciary, and HUD, I want to tell my colleagues that it \ndoes matter. I will give a couple of examples.\n  Last month, we experienced a tragic plane crash in Lexington, KY. The \nNTSB has not yet reported to us on the actual cause of that crash, but \nit was revealed that the air traffic control tower at Lexington had \nonly one controller on duty--one controller on duty--contrary to the \nFAA's own policy. When this incident occurred, it was discovered that \nseveral other towers were also operating with only one air traffic \ncontroller.\n  Everyone involved in aviation policy knows the FAA needs to hire more \ncontrollers. They have to fill the vacancies, and they have to replace \na growing number of retirees. There is money in the FAA budget to hire \nmore controllers. We put the money in the House and Senate \nappropriations bills to hire those controllers. But until the FAA \nAdministrator gets a final budget, she won't know how many controllers \nshe can hire or how quickly she can hire them. This is a basic issue of \nsafety and people's lives. But it is the safety issue that the Senate \nRepublican leadership is now happy to have wait on the back burner for \na few more months.\n  A similar situation existed in the hiring of more air traffic safety \ninspectors. We desperately need more safety inspectors to ensure that \nour financially strapped airlines are operating safely. An increasing \namount of airline maintenance for U.S.-flagged airlines is now being \nconducted overseas. We need inspectors to visit those foreign repair \nstations to make sure all of the appropriate procedures are being \nfollowed.\n  Just this week, the National Academy of Sciences reported that the \nFAA needs to modernize its system for determining how many inspectors \nthey need and whom to hire. But the FAA cannot address any of those \ndeficiencies until it gets its final budget for the year. This is just \nanother safety issue that the Senate Republican leadership is now happy \nto have wait on the back burner for a few more months.\n  The Republican leadership's failure to act could also hurt our \nefforts to fight terrorism. The Treasury Department has a critical role \nin combating terrorist financing. They are on the job morning, noon, \nand night trying to interrupt the cashflow between the terrorists \nand those who fund them.\n\n  Ever since 9/11, the Treasury Department has been seeking increased \nresources from our subcommittee to fight terrorist funding. Our \nsubcommittee has provided every dollar the Treasury Department has \nrequested, including the funding for increased personnel and \ninfrastructure for fiscal year 2007.\n  The Treasury Department is now being told that the increased funding \nthey had asked for will have to wait a few more months. Why? Because \nthe Senate Republican leadership doesn't want us to debate the \nTransportation-Treasury bill before the election.\n  One of the issues being discussed in the closing days of this session \nis the\n\n[[Page S10517]]\n\nsecurity of our courts and our judges. An effort is being made to \nprovide authorization for additional court security in the Department \nof Defense authorization bill. The brutal murder of a father and mother \nof a Federal judge in Chicago showed us the urgent need for better \nsecurity.\n  The Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill, as passed by the \nHouse and Senate committees, included sizable increases for that court \nsecurity. We are not talking about an authorization; we are talking \nabout cold, hard cash that will go out to better protect our judges. \nBut you know what. That money can't go out until our appropriations \nbill is signed into law, and that can't happen if the Senate Republican \nleadership slows this appropriations process to a crawl.\n  Finally, I want to talk about the critical need for improved safety \non our highways. One month ago, our Nation received a wake-up call from \nthe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n  For many years, our country was making steady progress in reducing \nthe overall fatality rate. But last month, the fatality rate on our \nhighways started to move back up. Deaths from motor vehicle crashes \njumped up 1.4 percent over the level in 2004. We had 43,443 deaths on \nAmerica's highways in 2005. That is the highest number since 1990.\n  We also have begun to see a number of road fatalities involving large \ntrucks head back up. We made progress between 1998 and 2002, but since \nthat time, the number of large truck fatalities is moving in the wrong \ndirection.\n  More and more people are dying on our highways, and Congress is \nworking to respond. There are increased levels of funding, consistent \nwith the SAFETEA-LU authorization law--both for highway safety and \nmotor carrier safety in both the House and Senate appropriations bills. \nBut those additional resources that save lives on our highways have to \nwait. Why? Because the Senate Republican leadership didn't want to \ndebate this Transportation appropriations bill before this election.\n  These decisions by the Senate Republican leadership to stall the \nappropriations process can and are having very real consequences.\n  I want to state today my deep disappointment that the Senate \nRepublican leadership has done such an abysmal job in fulfilling its \nmost basic responsibility to fund our Government.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it doesn't have to be this way. Rather \nthan spending the month of July and September debating bills for \npolitical reasons, we could have been debating these appropriations \nbills that are critically needed for the Nation's safety and security. \nWe could have been fighting for the people we represent. We could have \nbeen meeting their basic needs, protecting their livelihoods, and \nensuring their safety. But our leadership said no, and now our families \nare paying a price.\n  I think the Senate deserves better, but more importantly, the people \nwe represent deserve better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will be brief because I have already \nspoken on the issue with Senator Feinstein of California earlier before \nthe noon hour. I did want to come back and conclude my concerns.\n  My original cosponsor, Senator Kennedy, is in the Chamber. He and I \nworked collectively on the issue of a guest worker program for this \ncountry that would create a legality, a transparency, and a \nreasonableness to the management of it in a reformed H-2A worker \nprogram that he and I worked on and shaped and which became known as \nAgJOBS, along with how we dealt with the issue of those in the country \ntoday who are illegal and who remain a critical part of the American \nworkforce, and especially with agriculture, an industry that has become \nincreasingly dependent upon migrant workers, guest workers and, in this \ninstance, tragically enough, illegal workers. Let me cite a couple of \nexamples because I, like Senator Feinstein and others, Senator Boxer; \nthe State of California, the State of Idaho, the State of Oregon, the \nState of Washington; in fact, the State of the Nation where agriculture \nexists today--the Presiding Officer, Senator Martinez, has just gone \nthrough a situation in the State of Florida where literally millions \nand millions of dollars' worth of oranges have rotted simply because \nthey couldn't find the hands to pick them to put them through the \nprocess of packing and distribution.\n\n  America's agriculture is dependent on hand labor. When we think of \nagriculture in the Midwest, we think of large machines doing all the \nwork. It is simply not true. In the fruits and vegetables and nuts \nareas and many of the varieties of fruits we find abundant upon the \nsupermarket shelves of America, we are dependent on hand labor, and \nthat hand labor over the last many decades has become predominantly \nforeign labor and, tragically enough, it has become illegal foreign \nlabor. But because of a failure of government--and it is important I \nsay this: It is not American agriculture's fault. It is a failure of \ngovernment to appropriately and necessarily police our borders and \ndevise and cause to work a reasonable, flexible, transparent guest \nworker program that brings us to the crisis American agriculture is \nbeginning to experience as we speak.\n  The Senator from California spoke earlier of the literally billions \nof dollars' worth of crops that are going to be left in the fields of \nthe greater San Joaquin Valley of California this year because there is \nno one to pick them.\n  I am always frustrated when it happens in my State that some of my \ncitizens say: Larry, we have all these people on welfare. Get them out \nand get them to work. Well, we reformed the welfare program \ndramatically, and literally millions of people who were once on welfare \nare working. We are at full employment in our country today. That means \nthose who can and will are working. In my State of Idaho, we are almost \nbeyond full employment. Finally, finally, after fairly heavy criticism \nfor what I was doing to lead an area of immigration reform that was \ncritical to my State, and much of that criticism came from my State, \nnow Idaho agriculture is beginning to step up and say: My goodness, \nwhere are these workers we have grown to depend on?\n  We believe we are 18 to 20 percent underemployed in the State of \nIdaho. That means our packing sheds this fall and some of our produce, \nour fruits, and our vegetables have not and will not get harvested. Our \npotato industry is beginning to feel the impact of fewer people there \nto help them, and as a result their timely harvest and their timely \npacking simply will not occur.\n  So whether it is Idaho or California or Florida or anywhere else in \nthe Nation, American agriculture exists. Whether it is with the nursery \nindustry or the landscaping industry, they too are now experiencing the \ngreat difficulty of this country doing what it should have done a long \ntime ago; that is, control its borders.\n  The shortages today are a result of our southern border beginning to \nclose. We have made a commitment to the American people that we will \nsecure that border. Part of the debate which will occur this afternoon \nwhen we get back on the fence bill will be that kind of debate: how we \ncan further secure our borders. But if you only secure your borders and \nyou do not create a legal and transparent program by which foreign \nnationals can enter our country to enter our workforce legally, then we \nwill create an economic schism in this country that is, without \nquestion, real. It is showing up in agriculture today because \nagriculture has historically been a threshold economy\n\n[[Page S10518]]\n\nfor a foreign worker. They come here, they work in agriculture for a \ncouple years, they move out, and they move on to the service industry, \nthe construction industry, the homebuilding industry.\n  In part, with our borders now tightening and the nearly $2 billion a \nyear we are spending on that security and that increasing security, \nthey have moved out of agriculture and there is no one to move in. \nAlso, the displacement occurred after Katrina when many of that level \nof worker left the fields of agriculture and went south into \nMississippi and Louisiana to help with the cleanup down there. In fact, \nmany Mississippians and Louisianans will tell you that if it hadn't \nbeen for migrant workers and, in this instance, illegal workers, we \nwouldn't be as far along with the cleanup and the beginning of the \nrehabilitation of what has gone on in the tragic area affected by \nKatrina.\n  Mr. President, when we proceed to the fence bill, I am going to \nattempt to bring up AgJOBS. I am going to ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senate allow us to do that. I don't know that it will happen. It \nprobably won't. But I think it is important for America and agriculture \nto see we are trying. Because one of the quotes I handed in earlier \nwhen I asked unanimous consent for some material to go into the Record, \nalong with the letter Senator Feinstein and I sent out to our \ncolleagues, was, I thought, a necessary and appropriate headline from \nan article that talks about the impact of what is going on across \nagricultural America. It says: ``Pickers are Few, and Growers Blame \nCongress.'' And the growers ought to blame Congress. They ought to \nblame a government that has been dysfunctional in the area of \nimmigration for decades.\n\n  That is why I began to work on this issue back in 1999 when American \nagriculture came to me and said: Senator, we have a problem, and we \nknow it is a problem. We don't like it. We want to be legal. We want \nour workers to be legal, and we want to treat them justly. But the \nworkers, by their effort to get here, are being treated unjustly. We \nknow they are not legal, and yet we are nearly wholly dependent upon \nthem.\n  I had hopes that we could keep the cart and the horse connected \nappropriately. There is now a very real disconnect occurring--a \ndisconnect between the security of the border, which is critical and \nnecessary, and a legal process by which those workers can move through \nthat secured border to the farms and fields of American agriculture. I \ndon't know what it is going to end up like at the end of the harvest \nseason across America, but my guess is--and it is now being predicted--\nwe could lose $4 billion or $5 billion or $6 billion at the farm gate, \nand of course there is the multiplier then beyond the farm gate to the \nprocessing, to the distribution, and to the supermarket. We all know \nwhat happens when it gets to the supermarket and there is less of it: \nthe American consumer is going to pay double the price for that produce \nthat simply was left in the fields to rot.\n  Now, that is what is going on now. When we get back in November, we \nwill have accurate figures--this Congress isn't going to deal with it--\nand we will know whether it was $3 billion or $4 billion or $5 billion \nor $6 billion, and shame on us, because the Senator from California is \nright. We could deal with it today. The bill has been well heard. The \nbill has been appropriately vetted. It has been around a long time. It \nhas been accepted by 60 Members of this body. But we are now \npolitically bound up until after the American people speak in the \nelection, and then we will find out how much further we can move on \nthis issue.\n  So we will know in November about the harvest of September and \nOctober. What about the winter months? What about the farmer who is now \ngoing to go out into the field in January to plant for a February or \nMarch fresh vegetable crop across Florida, parts of the South, \ncertainly Arizona, the Imperial Valley of California, where last year \nwe left over $1 billion of fresh green vegetables in the field? I will \ntell my colleagues what the farmers are telling me, and it is a tragedy \nif it happens, but it probably is going to happen. Senator, they say, \nif we can't plant that fresh vegetable crop that requires hand labor, \nwe will plant winter grain. We will simply go to the fields and plant a \ncrop of phenomenally less value to the American agricultural market, in \nthe intensive sense, because we know it isn't going to require hand \nlabor. One farmer told me: If I can't have the labor come to me, I will \ngo where the labor is. So he is moving his operations out of \nCalifornia. He is headed to Brazil. He is headed to Argentina. There \ngoes that economy, there go those jobs, because this Congress could not \nunderstand and function in an appropriate fashion.\n  So be it. That is the tragedy of it. I had hoped we could think \ndifferently. We need a legal workforce. We need a reformed H-2A \nprogram. We need a guest worker program. We worked out those \ndifferences amongst ourselves. Some have agreed, some have not agreed, \nbut we have attempted to resolve the problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, in closing, I am going to give the Senate \none more opportunity to say no because it is important that the Record \nshow where we are because history and this month will dictate where we \nneed to go in November.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10518-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              BIOTERRORISM\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a short while ago on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate, my friends and colleagues on the Health, Education, Labor \nand Pensions Committee, our chairman, Senator Enzi, and Senator Burr \nbrought to the Senate's attention what we call the bioterrorism BARDA \nlegislation, S. 3678. I am a strong supporter of that legislation. I \nbelieve that legislation provides a rather unique process by which \noutstanding opportunities for breakthroughs in vaccines and other \nmedical technologies can be developed and furthered. This can be \nenormously valuable and helpful against any bioterrorist threats, \npandemic flu, or other kinds of diseases or pandemics we might face in \nthe future.\n  There are several of our colleagues who want to have an opportunity \nto improve and strengthen that legislation. Obviously, they are \nentitled to do so. But I want to underscore the strong work that has \nbeen done to date by our chairman, Senator Enzi and also by Senator \nBurr in developing this legislation. The BARDA concept is very close to \nwhat was done a number of years ago with DARPA, the Department of \nDefense's advanced research program, which has demonstrated enormous \nsuccess in finding new technologies that are used by the military. It \nis a very commendable concept and offers us great hope down the line.\n  This legislation also recognizes that we are going to develop \ncapacity to contain whatever danger there may be in local communities \nby strengthening support for hospitals, containment, and the public \nhealth infrastructure. Prevention, detection, containment, and support \nfor the health facilities, are all interrelated--they are enormously \nimportant.\n  So I hope that as soon as we return in the lame duck session, this \nwill be a first order of business. I have talked with our leader about \nthis issue. I look forward to, in the course of these next few weeks, \ntalking to some of our colleagues who have offered amendments to see \nhow we might be able to proceed, even in this limited amount of time, \nto ensure that we have effective legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10518-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10518-S10523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SECURE FENCE ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on a second matter, the issue which is \ncurrently before the Senate--I know we are in a period of morning \nbusiness, but the underlying issue is the Secure Fence Act of 2006.\n  I listened to my friend and colleague from Idaho speak very \neloquently about the AgJOBS bill. I enjoyed the opportunity to work \nwith him in helping to fashion that legislation. We worked very closely \ntogether and were able to convince our colleagues on the Democratic and \nRepublican side of the value of this legislation.\n  It demonstrates very clearly a problem we are facing with the \nunderlying bill, which is called the Secure Fence Act of 2006. Rather \nthan focusing on comprehensive legislation to deal with\n\n[[Page S10519]]\n\nthe immigration ordeal with the AgJOBS bill, as the Senator has \nmentioned, which would be valuable and very important in terms of the \nagriculture industry and also providing important protections for the \nworkers themselves--a compromise that was worked out over a period of \nyears--we are effectively saying no, we are not going to deal with \nthat. We are just not going to deal with it. The leadership has decided \nthey won't have an opportunity to deal with it, even though there are \nmore than 60 Members, Republicans and Democrats alike, who would like \nto deal with it.\n  I join comments that have been made by the Senator from Idaho, but \nalso by my friends Senator Boxer, Senator Feinstein, and others. We are \ngoing to have the time here this afternoon. As Senators pointed out, \nthis is legislation which is understood and which is very important. \nOne cannot pick up the newspapers without reading the adverse results \nof our failing to act. This is something we should be addressing as an \namendment--I think it is much more valuable than the underlying \nlegislation, but we certainly should have had the opportunity as an \namendment.\n  On the issue of the Secure Fence Act, immigration reform is one of \nthe most pressing issues we face today. It is a security issue, an \neconomic issue, and a moral issue. President Bush told us that it was a \ntop domestic priority.\n\n  Many Members in the Senate understood the importance of the issue and \ndevoted an unprecedented number of weeks to hearings, markups and \nextensive floor debate to this priority. In May, the Senate passed a \nhistoric bipartisan bill supported by 64 Senators.\n  The House however passed a very different bill last December one that \nhas been roundly condemned as cruel and ineffective by religious \nleaders, Latino leaders, and immigration and security experts. It \nfocuses only on enforcement and makes it a felony for any Good \nSamaritan to help immigrants. As one religious leader described it this \nweek, you could go to jail for giving an undocumented immigrant a cup \nof water in Jesus' name.\n  What's more, the bill does nothing about the 12 million undocumented \nimmigrants who are here already, and it does nothing about the Nation's \nfuture immigration needs both vital ingredients to an effective \nimmigration policy.\n  Common sense tells us that enforcement alone is not the solution to \ntoday's complex immigration challenges. We can build fences, but people \nwill come around them. We can put high tech devices on our borders and \nthey will deter some people, but we all know that many others still \nwill find a way to come. We can make criminals of the pastors and \npriests who help immigrants, but that is not only contrary to our \nvalues, it will have little impact on immigration.\n  The logical next step would have been for Congress to appoint \nconferees so we could begin negotiating a compromise. That is what we \ndo--pass a Senate bill and pass a House bill. Then conferees are \nappointed from both Houses to reconcile their differences on the bill. \nThat is what Congress does on critical issues.\n  But, instead of rolling up their sleeves and doing the work necessary \nto get legislation to the President's desk that deals with the key \nelements of the immigration problem--that will bolster national \nsecurity, ensure economic prosperity; and protect families--the \nRepublican leadership in the House frittered away the summer, \npreferring to embark on a political road show--featuring 60 cynical \none-sided hearings, and wasting millions of precious taxpayer dollars. \nAnd after the bunting came down and the klieg lights were removed, \nafter all the political hoopla and hot rhetoric, what did they produce? \nA fence.\n  Did they do anything about the millions of people who come here on \nairplanes with visas, and stay here illegally after their visas expire? \nNo. Just a fence.\n  Did they do anything to ensure that employers don't hire people who \nare here illegally? No. Just a fence.\n  Did they do anything about the 12 million undocumented immigrants who \nare here already, living in the shadows while working hard to support \ntheir families? No. Just a fence.\n  Yes, Republican leaders wasted time, opportunity, and your money. For \na $9 billion fence that won't do the job.\n  That is just a bumper sticker solution for a complex problem. It's a \nfeel good plan that will have little effect in the real world.\n  We all know what this is about. It may be good politics, but it's bad \nimmigration policy.\n  That is not what Americans want. They deserve something better than a \nfence.\n  Over and over and over again, the American people have told us that \nthey want our immigration system fixed, and fixed now. They have told \nus that this complex problem requires a comprehensive solution. The \nAmerican people want tough but fair laws that will strengthen our \nborders and crack down on employers who hire undocumented workers, but \nat the same time provide a practical solution that will allow \nundocumented immigrants to become taxpaying legal workers who perform \ntasks needed by our economy.\n  Today or tomorrow, this Republican Congress will recess for the \nelections, and leave this issue still unresolved.\n  I hope that we can use the next few weeks productively to work \ntogether on compromises that can be adopted when we return in November.\n  What is the solution? How do we control our borders effectively? How \ndo we restore the rule of law and make sure that immigrants come to \nthis country with a visa, not with a smuggler?\n  The bipartisan bill passed by the Senate is the only practical way to \ncure what ails us. The only way we can truly bring illegal immigration \nunder control and achieve border security is to combine enforcement and \nborder protection with a realistic framework for legal immigration.\n  It's obvious that we have insufficient legal avenues for immigrant \nworkers and families to come to this country, and no path to \ncitizenship for the 12 million undocumented workers and families \nalready here. The problem is fueling a black market of smugglers and \nfake document-makers, to the peril of citizens and immigrants alike.\n  Rather than saber-rattling, chest-thumping, and ranting, the American \npeople would like to see both parties and both Houses of Congress come \ntogether to negotiate a realistic and enforceable policy for \nimmigration.\n  Piecemeal proposals won't work. They will only make a bad situation \nworse. Those who are here illegally will not leave, but will go deeper \nunderground, and those seeking to enter will take even more dangerous \nroutes and be less likely to survive. Employers will have an unstable \nworkforce of men and women who are afraid to speak up when abused. The \ndysfunctions and pathologies of the current failed system will continue \nto worsen.\n  On this specific proposal for a fence, let's consider the facts:\n  Never mind that months ago the Senate voted to approve a 370-mile \nfence exactly what Secretary Chertoff said he needed for targeted urban \nareas.\n  Never mind that the Senate has voted to fund the fence Secretary \nChertoff requested. It is in the appropriations bill for the Department \nof Homeland Security that we will pass this afternoon.\n  Never mind that DHS has not requested additional fencing. Last week, \nin promoting his ``Secure Border Initiative'', Secretary Chertoff said, \n``What we are looking to build is a virtual fence, a 21st century \nvirtual fence .  .  . one that does not involve old-fashioned \nfencing.''\n  Never mind that fencing is manpower intensive--you need border patrol \nagents to continuously monitor them to apprehend illegal crossers. But \nthis bill will require DHS to construct up to 850 miles of fencing in \nremote, desolate areas, in desert and wilderness areas, and even across \nrivers--where it will serve no security purpose whatsoever.\n  Never mind that it will cost billions of dollars. The Congressional \nBudget Office estimate the cost at roughly $3 million a mile, which may \nbe on the low end--the first 11 miles of the San Diego fence cost $3.8 \nmillion a mile and the final 3.5 mile section cost approximately $9 \nmillion a mile.\n  As the Congressional Research Service recently noted, the costs may \nbe even higher. You need to take into account the terrain, land \nacquisition, environmental planning, private contractors, double \nlayering, fence design, procurement costs and a number of other \nfactors. We also can't forget the annual\n\n[[Page S10520]]\n\nmaintenance costs, which could be as high as $1 billion a year.\n  Never mind that fences don't work. Undocumented immigrant entries \nhave increased tenfold since the strategy of fencing was introduced in \nthe mid-1990s. Since that time, the probability of apprehending an \nunauthorized border crosser fell from 20 percent to 5 percent. The \nUnited States now spends $1700 per border apprehension, up from $300 in \n1992. San Diego's wall has been a boon for the smuggling industry, and \nincreased the loss of immigrant lives by shifting entry to the desert.\n  Never mind that fencing will do nothing to stop the 40-50 percent of \nthe people currently in the United States who entered the country with \nlegal visas and have now overstayed their visas.\n  Never mind that fences won't keep out criminals or terrorists. The 9/\n11 terrorists didn't come across the Mexican border illegally--they \nentered the U.S. with visas.\n  Never mind that fences won't stop immigrants from coming here to \nwork. As Governor Napolitano of Arizona recently said:\n\n       You show me a 50-foot wall and I'll show you a 51-foot \n     ladder at the border to get over it.\n\n  Narrow, shortsighted, enforcement-only proposals like a fence will \nnever fix our broken immigration system.\n  We should listen to Tom Ridge, former Secretary of Homeland Security, \nwho recently said:\n\n       Trying to gain operational control of the borders is \n     impossible unless our enhanced enforcement efforts are \n     coupled with a robust Temporary Guest Worker program and a \n     means to entice those now working illegally out of the \n     shadows into some type of legal status.\n\n  A group of former high-ranking government officials has said \nunequivocally:\n\n       The reality is that stronger enforcement and a more \n     sensible approach to the 10-12 million illegal aliens in the \n     country today are inextricably interrelated. One cannot \n     succeed without the other.\n\n  President Bush agreed. In May, he got it right when he declared:\n\n       An immigration reform bill needs to be comprehensive \n     because all elements of this problem must be addressed \n     together, or none of them will be solved at all.\n\n  What the Republican leadership doesn't seem to get, is that \ncomprehensive immigration reform is all about security: Homeland \nsecurity; economic security; family security.\n  That is what the vast majority of our people want. They want \nrealistic solutions that effectively protect our Nation. They don't \nwant piecemeal, feel-good measures that will waste billions of precious \ntaxpayer dollars and do nothing to correct the serious problems.\n  What can we expect in the next month?\n  The Republican leadership has two choices. They can bring us together \nto work out effective compromises for a comprehensive bill.\n  Or they can continue to use hard working immigrants as political \npawns for November's elections.\n  I hope that they will not choose the politically expedient choice--to \nembark on another slanderous campaign, featuring more political stunts, \nmisleading press releases, and glossy campaign ads about how tough they \nare on the border.\n  The Chicago Tribune editorial page understands this tactic. Earlier \nthis week they wrote that ``Immigrant bashing is so much easier than \nimmigration reform.''\n  Sacrificing good immigration policy for political expediency and \nhateful rhetoric is not just shameful--it is cowardly.\n  We have the bill to solve this problem now.\n  We owe the American people a serious answer on the issue, and our \nRepublican leadership should be held accountable for their inaction and \ntheir inability to address this pressing issue facing our Nation.\n  Let's stop this farce. Let's stop playing politics with immigration. \nWe know they are wrong. Their scheme will leave us weaker and less \nsecure. We can't allow them to derail our strong bipartisan reforms.\n  I urge my colleagues to choose good policy over political expedience \nand oppose this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na document that reflects the 50 organizations that are in opposition to \nthis particular proposal. They include the LUCAC, MALDEF, La Raza, a \ngreat number of the religious organizations and others that have \nexpressed their views about it.\n  Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent to have printed a \ndocument that includes a number of editorials in the newspapers, \neditorials about the fence from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Idaho \nStatesman, LA Times, and Orlando Sentinel. Then the Tucson Citizen, the \nWaco Tribune--a number of editorials from around the country.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator: The Senate will soon consider H.R. 6061 PCS, \n     the ``Secure Fence Act of 2006,'' which has erroneously been \n     referred to as the ``fence bill.'' This bill goes far beyond \n     the construction of border barriers. It provides \n     unprecedented authorities to the Secretary of the Department \n     of Homeland Security (DHS) ``to take all actions necessary \n     and appropriate to prevent all unlawful entries into the \n     U.S.''\n       The consequences of such an immense and vague mandate to \n     the Secretary could result in policies and procedures that \n     would adversely affect American communities at the Northern \n     and Southern borders, and maritime states--wherever \n     ``border'' might be defined. United States citizens and \n     lawful permanent residents would not be immune to the \n     consequences of the extraordinary powers granted DHS in this \n     bill. We must remember that the border is not simply a \n     delineation line; communities live along the border and their \n     rights must be respected. Moreover, DHS must be held \n     accountable for actions taken in these communities.\n       Finally, we question the wisdom of delegating such sweeping \n     authority to a government agency. Numerous GAO and CRS \n     reports to Congress cite accountability and management \n     problems at DHS, showing that DHS requires the same \n     Congressional and legal oversight as other agencies of the \n     government.\n       H.R. 6061 is a broad bill with potentially harmful \n     consequences for American communities. We strongly urge the \n     Senate to oppose H.R. 6061.\n       Signed by over 50 organizations.\n                                  ____\n\n\nEditorials Warn: No Hiding Behind Walls and Fences Voters Want Leaders \n                          With Spine, Not Spin\n\n     Atlanta Journal Constitution (Editorial): `Big fence' \n         blunder: Immigration bill won't root out ills, but it'll \n         fail voters.

September 27, 2006\n       With the Senate considering a proposal to build a 700-mile \n     fence along the southern border, the symbolism is obvious: \n     Our leaders are squeezing themselves into a corner regarding \n     serious immigration reform.

Bipartisan support is a good thing \n     when addressing viable solutions. This isn't one of them.\n       Several members of the Senate, including Mel Martinez of \n     Florida, have concerns about the cost of fencing and \n     mandating locations without consulting state and local \n     governments. Building a fence also endangers the chances for \n     comprehensive reform because the House will not be motivated \n     to move from its position. Meanwhile, the dicey issue of how \n     to effectively get a handle on an estimated 12 million \n     illegal immigrants in the United States remains unanswered.\n     Santa Fe New Mexican: Playing with figures to close our \n         borders, September 27, 2006\n       In its rush to pass a slam-the-door and fence-'em-out \n     immigration bill, some members of the House of \n     Representatives are touting the measure's fiscal \n     responsibility. One Senate version of immigration reform, \n     moribund for the moment amid the border-wall debate, but \n     still salvageable, includes provisions that would give \n     undocumented workers a chance to work here legally--a notion \n     also supported by President Bush, the former Texas governor.\n       We can't afford it, say representatives touting instead a \n     700-mile addition to the border fence, forgetting for a \n     moment that so much steel and concrete carries its own li'l \n     cost. Instead, they pull out a study by the Congressional \n     Budget Office saying that the Senate bill would set our \n     country back by more than $120 billion over 10 years. Even \n     that amount is chicken feed compared with the cost of our \n     Iraq invasion. But it turns out that they're fudging those \n     figures.

That means \n     creating guest worker programs and giving undocumented aliens \n     already in the country the opportunity to come out of the \n     shadows, pay a fine and eventually earn citizenship. Only by \n     relieving the pressure for more legal immigration can we ever \n     hope to regain control of our borders.\n       If Congress fails to revisit immigration after Election \n     Day, we'll be stuck with the illusion of reform. Millions of \n     hardworking immigrants will be treated as criminals rather \n     than as future citizens. And millions more will join them, \n     fence or no fence.\n     Arizona Republic: House fumbles reforms, September 22, 2006\n       But lawmakers get no prize for resurrecting--piecemeal--\n     some of the elements of the enforcement-only bill the House \n     passed late last year. That bill sparked national protests in \n     the spring.\n       If House leadership believed that approach was the \n     solution, the House should have joined in conference this \n     summer to resolve differences with the Senate's comprehensive \n     immigration reform bill. That's how Congress handles \n     competing bills.\n       Instead, the House rejected the hard and politically risky \n     work of negotiation, and held a series of lopsided \n     presentations around the country. In Arizona, the so-called \n     hearings were highly staged, excluded real debate and \n     relegated the public to the status of spectator.\n       Now we get a flurry of enforcement-only bills that let \n     House members crow about doing ``something.'' It is the wrong \n     ``something.''\n     Wall Street Journal: The Great Wall of America, Review & \n         Outlook, September 21, 2006\n       The only real way to reduce the flow of illegal Mexican \n     immigration is to provide a legal, orderly process to match \n     open American jobs with workers who want to fill them. Mr. \n     Bush is for that, and so is the Senate, but House Republicans \n     have concluded that they're better off building fences.

Addressing border \n     security alone won't fulfill the economy's need for a legal \n     supply of labor, and it will leave millions of illegal \n     immigrants already here hidden in a vast underground. And \n     fence or no fence, the 45% of illegal immigrants who overstay \n     legal visas instead of returning across the border would \n     continue to do so.\n       If the Senate passes piecemeal enforcement measures, it \n     will erode its ability to negotiate a more comprehensive \n     approach with House leaders who myopically insist on treating \n     immigration solely as a law enforcement issue\n     San Antonio Express-News: Fence along border only half a \n         solution, September 20, 2006\n       But until the House is willing to work out its impasse with \n     the Senate--and the White House--over a comprehensive \n     immigration overhaul, any suggestion that a fence alone will \n     stop the bleeding is merely wishful election-year thinking.\n     New York Times: Immigration's Lost Year September 19, 2006\n       Real immigration security means separating the harmful from \n     the hard-working. It means imposing the rule of law on the ad \n     hoc immigrant economy. It means freeing up resources so that \n     overburdened law-enforcement agencies can restore order at \n     the border and in the workplace. It means holding employers, \n     not just workers, responsible for obeying the law. And it \n     means tapping the energy of vast numbers of immigrants who \n     dream of becoming citizens and who can make the country \n     stronger.\n       These are huge tasks, and the anti-immigrant forces have \n     nothing to contribute.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 563, S. 3661.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3661) to amend section 29 of the International \n     Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979 relating to air \n     transportation to and from Love Field, Texas, which had been \n     reported from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation, with an amendment to strike all after the \n     enacting clause and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n        The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Dallas-Fort Worth region is served by two large \n     airports, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and Love \n     Field. American Airlines and Southwest Airlines each have \n     their headquarters, respectively, at these two airports.\n       (2) Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport ranks fourth \n     nationally and had more than 28 million enplanements in 2005. \n     Love Field ranks fifty-sixth and had nearly 3 million \n     enplanements in 2005.\n       (3) The history of the development and creation of the \n     Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and the subsequent \n     use of Love Field has been one of continuous disagreement, \n     frequent litigation, and constant uncertainty within the \n     local communities. As a result of these factors, this has \n     been the only time that Congress has intervened, with the \n     consent of the local communities, to promulgate specific \n     rules relating to the scope of a locally owned airport. \n     Having done so, the dispute cannot end without a change in \n     federal statutes. Therefore, Congress recognizes the \n     completely unique historical circumstances involving these \n     two airport and cities and the previous unprecedented history \n     of legislation. This legislation is based on the compelling \n     consensus of the civic parties to resolve the dispute on a \n     permanent basis, assure the end of litigation, and establish \n     long-term stability.\n       (4) In 1979, Congress intervened and passed legislation \n     known as the Wright Amendment which imposed restrictions at \n     Love Field limiting service from the airport to points within \n     the State of Texas and States contiguous to Texas. Congress \n     has since allowed service to the additional States of \n     Alabama, Kansas, Mississippi, and Missouri. At the urging of \n     Congressional leaders, local community leaders have reached \n     consensus on a proposal for eliminating the restrictions at \n     Love Field in a manner deemed equitable by the involved \n     parties. That consensus is reflected in an agreement dated \n     July 11, 2006.\n       (5) The agreement dated July 11, 2006, does not limit an \n     air carrier's access to the Dallas Fort Worth metropolitan \n     area, and in fact may increase access opportunities to other \n     carriers and communities. It is not Congressional intent to \n     limit any air carrier's access to either airport.\n       (6) At the urging of the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), the \n     communities originally intended to create one large \n     international airport, and close Love Field to commercial air \n     transportation. Funding for the new airport was, in part, \n     predicated on the closing of Love Field to commercial \n     service, and was agreed to by the carriers then serving Love \n     Field. Southwest Airlines, created after the local decision \n     was made, asserted its rights and as a result a new \n     international airport was built, and Love Field remained \n     open.\n       (7) Congress also recognizes that the agreement, dated July \n     11, 2006, does not harm any city that is currently being \n     served by these airports, and thus the agreement does not \n     adversely affect the airline industry or other communities \n     that are currently receiving service, or hope to receive \n     service in the future.\n       (8) Congress finds that the agreement, dated July 11, 2006, \n     furthers the public interest as consumers in, and accessing, \n     the Dallas and Fort Worth areas should benefit from increased \n     competition.\n       (9) Congress also recognizes that each of the parties was \n     forced to make concessions to reach an agreement. The two \n     carriers, Southwest Airlines and American Airlines, did so \n     independently, determining what is in each of their interests \n     separately. The negotiations between the\n\n[[Page S10524]]\n\n     two communities forced each carrier to respond, individually, \n     to a host of options, which ultimately were included, as part \n     of the agreement dated July 11, 2006.\n       (10) Nothing in the agreement dated July 11, 2006, is \n     intended to eliminate the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department \n     of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration and \n     the Transportation Security Administration with respect to \n     the aviation safety and security responsibilities of those \n     agencies.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to an immediate en bloc consideration of the following bills: \nCalendar No. 393 to 400, 403 to 410, 420, 533, and 584.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the Senate will proceed en bloc.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I do not intend to object in the final analysis on this, \nbut I think the American public needs to hear how this bill got here \nand the associated processes with it. I want to share my concerns over \nit. It will take me a few minutes to do that, but I think it is \nimportant that we do this.\n  Before I lift my objection to the authorization in this package, I \nthink it is important to know that this obligates the American people \nfor $1.5 billion. The majority leader originally sought consent for \nthis package in May and again in July. After carefully reviewing the \npackage, considering the oath that I took in January of 2005, I could \nnot give that consent.\n  I immediately sat down with the chairman of the Energy Committee. I \noutlined in detail my concerns with him. And I am committed by putting \nmy objections in writing, and I did so.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 2006.\n     Hon. Pete Domenici,\n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Chairman Domenici: I want to thank you for agreeing to \n     meet with me late last week. As follow-up to our conversation \n     and per my commitment to you, I am providing a more thorough \n     review of the concerns that prompted me to place a hold on \n     the committee package.\n       First and foremost, as we discussed during our meeting, I \n     want to underscore my concern that the package gives very \n     little consideration to the future impact on spending and the \n     growing deficit. With rare exception, each bill in the \n     package creates or expands' authorized spending levels, with \n     no consideration for finding similarly authorized programs \n     that have failed to meet Congressional intent or which have \n     outlived their\n\n[[Page S10527]]\n\n     usefulness. In other words, in creating these \n     authorizations--eventual recommendations for appropriations--\n     we have given little or no thought to finding offsets or \n     attempted to prioritize diminishing federal resources.\n       For example, S. 1913, ``the Indiana Dunes Visitors Center'' \n     would authorize the National Park Service to lease space and \n     construct a gift shop and theater at an estimated cost of \n     $1.2 million. H.R. 318, ``the Castle Nugent Farms study'' \n     would spend an estimated $500,000 to determine the \n     feasibility of designating the area a unit of the National \n     Park Service (NPS). Similarly, H.R. 1728 would study the \n     feasibility of establishing a NPS unit to preserve historic \n     homes in Ste Genevieve, Missouri. S. 200, S. 204, S 163, and \n     S 249 would establish National Heritage Areas (NHA) at an \n     estimated initial cost of $40 million. I am very concerned \n     about authorizing new spending on parks and associated \n     buildings when our nation already is more than $8 trillion in \n     debt and when we already have millions of acres of federal \n     lands that we are already unable to maintain properly.\n       I specifically question why there has been no attempt to \n     offset the new authorizations, or in any way review the \n     priorities of agency spending. The Department of the \n     Interior--where each of these new programs will be \n     administered--is replete with wasteful and ineffective \n     spending, and provides ample opportunity for this Congress to \n     prioritize its spending. Consider the following: In adding to \n     the 672 million acres that it currently. owns, the Department \n     of the Interior and related land management agencies have \n     spent over $1.1 billion on land acquisition since 2002, and \n     an estimated $113 million last year alone. Additionally, the \n     Administration estimates that the agency carries over $4.5 \n     billion in unobligated balances. Surely, we can find a way \n     to prioritize spending in these agencies, and to ensure \n     that these new authorizations don't add to the already \n     crushing debt that our children will inherit.\n       Furthermore, I am concerned that many of the bills lack \n     sufficient justification for federal involvement. For \n     example, S 1346 ``the Michigan Lighthouse and Maritime \n     Heritage Act'' would authorize $500,000 for the Department of \n     the Interior ``to study and report on Michigan maritime \n     heritage resource preservation and interpretation, including: \n     potential economic and tourism benefits of preservation of \n     these resources . . .'' The tourism industry in Michigan \n     already generates an estimated $16 billion, and while I do \n     not question the importance of these local preservation and \n     promotion efforts, I fail to see a federal responsibility.\n       Finally, I am concerned that a bill (S 1970) that I offered \n     to amend the Trail of Tears Historic Trail Act, was modified \n     from its original version. In the bill that I introduced, I \n     specifically prohibited any new federal appropriations for \n     the update of the trail study. First, the bulk of the study \n     has already been completed by researchers, and simply needs \n     updating. Second, I felt it was important that any \n     expenditures for the trail come from existing trail funding, \n     and not burden other NPS resources. In amending my bill, the \n     committee undermined a basic condition of my support for the \n     bill and opened up the possibility for new spending--\n     something I will aggressively oppose.\n       I am prepared to drop my objections to the hotlined package \n     if the committee is willing to consider other measures to \n     offset the proposed new authorizations. In briefly reviewing \n     offsetting measures within the Department of the Interior, I \n     have identified several billion dollars in potential offsets. \n     I am including an overview below:\n       The President has proposed the elimination or reduction of \n     several programs within the Department of the Interior. Total \n     savings are projected to be $260,000,000. http://\nwww.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/pdf/savings.pdf. These \n     savings will pay for all but one of the bills contained in \n     the hotlined package.\n       The Department of the Interior spent $218.7 million on \n     conferences and travel in FY 2004, up $12 million since FY \n     2000; Reducing these expenditures by 10% will entirely pay \n     for 9 of the bills included in this package.\n       The Department of the Inteior has over $4.5 billion in \n     unobligated funds already appropriated by Congress. We can \n     pay for the entire authorization package simply by requiring \n     that all future appropriations be paid for from the agency's \n     unobligated balances.\n       These suggestions are by no means exhaustive, and I am \n     certainly open to other alternative offsets. We can and we \n     should find a way to prioritize spending in these areas, and \n     I look forward to working with you to accomplish this goal.\n       Again, I want to thank: you for taking the time to meet \n     with me to hear my concerns, and for this opportunity to work \n     with you to preserve and protect the great heritage of \n     sacrifice that was given to us by our forefathers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Tom A. Coburn,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will repeat today what I said in person \nand in writing. It authorizes $1.5 billion spending with not one offset \nand zero consideration for prioritization of how we spend money in this \ncountry.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a unanimous-consent request pending \nbefore the Senate.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is the Senator required to register an objection or not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will try again, reserving my right to \nobject. I will finish this statement one way or the other; otherwise, I \nwill object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have the right to object \nupon reservation. It is an accommodation that exists only with the \nconsent of other Senators.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous-consent after the \nunanimous-consent on this bill that I be allowed 15 minutes to speak on \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will not object to that.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I respectfully ask the Senator from \nOklahoma if I could do the other two pending unanimous-consent requests \nand then allow the Senator from Oklahoma to speak for 15 minutes; and \nthen, after that allow either Senator Cornyn or Senator Leahy, or both, \nalong with myself, to speak on the previously agreed to bill for up to \n15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I object to that, unless we can have a more comprehensive \nagreement. I was told that a number of us concerned about drought could \ncome to the floor at 11:30 this morning. Then we were told 1:30. Now it \nis 1:45. It is fine with me if we can reach an agreement that extends \nto those of us who are from states suffering from a natural disaster. I \ntotally appreciate the Senator's right to at some point have a chance \nto express himself. As a matter of procedure, when a Senator has raised \nan objection, it is my understanding of the rules of the Senate that \nyou have to promptly object or not. It is not a time to speak. I would \nbe fully in agreement having a unanimous-consent agreement to give you \nthe right to express your views. You certainly have that right at some \npoint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I will object unless we have a chance to \nreach a more comprehensive agreement on what follows.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has the floor. Is there \nobjection to the en bloc consideration of the bills listed by the \nSenator from Texas?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we finish \nthe unanimous-consent requests that have been cleared on both sides, \nthat there be speakers recognized in the following order: Senator \nCoburn, Senator Chambliss, Senator Conrad, and a Republican slot; \nfurther, that Senator Cornyn and Senator Leahy and myself be allowed to \nhave 15 minutes following that to discuss legislation previously \npassed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I amend my unanimous-consent request \nto put Senator Dorgan following the Republicans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object. I \nunderstand the recognition is Senator Conrad and then a Republican slot \nat which point I would be recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I think it would be very important here to \nhave time specified for these names because that is the only way we can \nhave an understanding here. I will object unless we have time \nassociated with the names.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n[[Page S10528]]\n\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous-consent that the two \nagreed-to energy en bloc requests be granted first; following that, \nSenator Coburn for 15 minutes, Senator Chambliss for 10 minutes, \nSenator Conrad for up to 30 minutes, a Republican slot for 10 minutes, \nand Senator Dorgan for 20 minutes. I need to also have time reserved \nfor Senator Leahy, Senator Cornyn, and myself following that order for \nup to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I shall \nnot object--I believe the Senator from Texas is discussing time for a \ncolloquy that Senator Cornyn and I intend to do which will take about 5 \nto 10 minutes. When would we have our colloquy?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. It would be approximately an hour and half before \nthat would occur unless there would be a unanimous consent agreement \nthat the colloquy could be moved up.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I don't want to interfere with others who are on the floor \nalready planning things. I wonder if there would be a difficulty if \nSenator Cornyn and I did our colloquy. I can assure the Senate that I \nwill keep my time to 2 minutes. I do not know how much time the Senator \nfrom Texas would request.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I amend my unanimous consent to allow \nus to do the two energy en banc requests that have been agreed to by \nboth sides; Senator Cornyn and Senator Leahy for up to 5 minutes; \nSenator Coburn for 15 minutes; Senator Chambliss for 10 minutes; \nSenator Conrad for up to 30 minutes; a Republican slot for 10 minutes; \nSenator Dorgan for 20 minutes; and Senator Hutchison for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator may proceed with the en banc unanimous consent requests.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate en bloc consideration of the following \nbills: Calendar Nos. 393 to 400, 403 to 410, 420, 533, and 584.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendments at the desk be agreed to; the committee-reported amendments \nas amended, if amended, be agreed to; the bills as amended, if amended, \nbe read a third time and passed en bloc; the resolution be agreed to; \nand the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10528-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA LAND TRANSFER ACT OF 2005\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill (S. 476) to authorize the \nBoy Scouts of America to exchange certain land in the State of Utah \nacquired under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act, which had been \nreported from the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, with an \namendment to strike all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu \nthereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy \nwith Senators Domenici, Boxer, and Feinstein concerning a provision in \nH.R. 233, the Northern California Wild Heritage Wilderness Act. \nAlthough I strongly supported the Senate companion measure, S. 128, \nwhich passed the Senate last year, I am concerned with some of the \nchanges made by bill as passed by the House of Representatives. Of \nparticular concern is section 10, dealing with commercial fishing \npermits in Redwood National and State Parks in California. The section \ndirects the Secretary of the Interior to issue permits for authorized \nvehicle access for commercial surf fishing at designated beaches within \nboth the National and State Parks. The section provides that the number \nof permits\n\n[[Page S10538]]\n\nshall be limited to the number of valid permits that are held on the \ndate of enactment of this Act, and that the permits ``so issued shall \nbe perpetual and subject to the same conditions as the permits held on \nthe date of enactment of this Act.''\n  I understand from the National Park Service and the bill sponsors \nthat presently 15 permits are issued for commercial surf fishing within \nthe park. I was concerned that the language stating that the permits \nshall be perpetual might be construed as creating a right vesting in \nthe permit holder, which would be contrary to the way permits are \nissued throughout the National Park System. However, I understand that \nthe intent of this language is simply to ensure that the National Park \nService not reduce the number of permits issued below the current level \nof valid permits, assuming there is sufficient demand for the remaining \npermits. Furthermore, I understand that there is no intent for the \nrequirements of section 10 to be construed as an implied waiver of \napplicable laws, including the National Park Service Organic Act and \nthe Endangered Species Act, but rather a directive to the Park Service \nto discontinue its plan to completely phase out these permits. I would \nlike to ask Senator Domenici, the chairman of the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources, and Senators Boxer and Feinstein, the Senate \nsponsors, whether they agree with me that it is their intent that the \nlanguage in section 10 does not create a property right and whether \nthey also agree that the sole purpose of the language is to limit the \nnumber of permits to the number of valid permits in existence as of the \ndate of enactment of H.R. 233.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I agree with Senator Bingaman's understanding. It is not \nour intent to create any new right with respect to these permits.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I agree with the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICl. I agree.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The language in section 10 requires the Secretary of \nthe Interior to issue permits allowing for authorized vehicle access to \ndesignated beaches, including Gold Bluff Beach, within Prairie Creek \nRedwoods State Park, which is located within the broader national park \nboundary. This provision is unusual in that, on its face, it appears to \nrequire the Secretary to authorize access to a beach that is within a \nState Park and managed by the California Department of Parks and \nRecreation. However, I understand that nothing in this section is \nintended to override the responsibilities of the State of California \nand its management of state park. Is that the understanding of the \nchairman and bill sponsors as well?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I agree. The language in this bill does not impose \nrequirements on the State of California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I agree.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank my colleagues for helping to clarify this \nissue. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Congressman Thompson, \nthe sponsor of H.R. 233, be printed in the Record. His letter indicates \nhis agreement with our colloquy. Based on the common understanding of \nthe purpose and intent of section 10, I will support passage of the \nbill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 2006.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Energy and Natural Resources \n         Committee,\n     Dirksen Senate Offlce Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ranking Member Bingaman, Senator Feinstein and Senator \n     Boxer: I would like to take this opportunity to clarify my \n     intent on a provision in H.R. 233, the Northern California \n     Wild Heritage Act.\n       Section 10, which deals with commercial fishing permits in \n     Redwood National and State Parks in California, directs the \n     Secretary of the Interior to issue permits for authorized \n     vehicle access for commercial surf fishing at designated \n     beaches within both the National and State Parks. The section \n     provides that the number of permits shall be limited to the \n     number of valid permits that are held on the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and that the permits ``so issued shall \n     be perpetual and subject to the same conditions as the \n     permits held on the date of enactment of this Act.''\n       I want to clarify that this language should not be \n     construed as creating a right vesting in the permit holder, \n     which would be contrary to the way permits are issued \n     throughout the National Park System. The intent of this \n     language is simply to ensure that the National Park Service \n     not reduce the number of permits issued below the current \n     level of valid permits, assuming there is sufficient demand \n     for the remaining permits. Furthermore, there is no intent \n     for the requirements of Section 10 to be construed as an \n     implied waiver of applicable laws, including the National \n     Park Service Organic Act and the Endangered Species Act, but \n     rather a directive to the Park Service to discontinue its \n     plan to completely phase out these permits. The language in \n     Section 10 does not create a property right and the sole \n     purpose of the language is to limit the number of permits to \n     the number of valid permits in existence as of the date of \n     enactment of H.R. 233.\n       In addition, the language in Section 10 requires the \n     Secretary of the Interior to issue permits allowing for \n     authorized vehicle access to designated beaches, including \n     Gold Bluff Beach, within Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park, \n     which is located within the broader national park boundary. \n     However, nothing in this section is intended to override the \n     responsibilities of the State of California and its the \n     management of the state park.\n       Thank you very much for all your time and effort on this \n     very important bill. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify \n     this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Mike Thompson,\n                                               Member of Congress.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is a great day for California.\n  After years of hard work by my colleagues, Senator Feinstein and \nCongressman Mike Thompson and I, the Northern California Coastal Wild \nHeritage Wilderness Act passed the Congress today. It now goes to the \nPresident's desk for his signature.\n  I want to thank my colleague, Senator Feinstein, and Congressman Mike \nThompson for all of their great work on this bill. Without their \ntireless support, we would not have gotten to this point.\n  Anyone who has ever visited California or been fortunate enough to \nlive there is keenly aware of the State's natural beauty indeed, more \nthan most States, California's wild beauty--is an essential part of its \nidentity.\n  California's natural beauty and way of life has enticed millions to \ncome and live there but that very enticement is now threatened by \nexponential growth--35,900,000 people live in my State, according to \nthe 2004 U.S. Census estimate, and that figure is growing by leaps and \nbounds daily.\n  That is why so many Californians have come together to support this \nbill and protect some of the last great natural places in the State.\n  Thousands of average citizens and over 200 local businesses, outdoor \ngroups, and other interests support the bill these include Harwood \nIndustries, the Adventures Edge Mountain Bike Store, and K.B. Homes, \nthe largest homebuilder in California.\n  There have been 23 supportive votes or resolutions from city \ncouncils, county boards of supervisors, tribal councils, and other \nboards since 2001.\n  Our Governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, supports it, as do 40 former or \ncurrent local elected officials of both parties in Lake, Mendocino, \nNapa, and Humboldt Counties.\n  When one considers what we are trying to preserve, it is easy to see \nwhy Congressman Thompson and I have such broad support for our \nlegislation. I would like to share a few examples.\n  First and foremost is the spectacular King Range, the wildest portion \nof California's coast--it boasts the longest stretch of undeveloped \ncoastline in the lower 48 States. Next, I would like to share Cache \nCreek it is home to the second largest wintering bald eagle population \nin California and a herd of rare Tule elk, which is the world's \nsmallest elk. Cache Creek is popular with white water rafters for its \nrapids and scenery.\n  Next, the Middle Fork Eel River, which hosts 30 to 50 percent of the \nState's summer-run steelhead trout population, an endangered species, \nand critical to California's fishermen and tribes. It also has \nspectacular ancient forests of oak pine and fir. Our bill provides \nimproved protections for this pristine area.\n  These are but three of the dozens of examples I could show you today. \nCalifornians want to protect the sanctity of these lands, and our bill \ndoes just that.\n\n[[Page S10539]]\n\n  Before I conclude, there are some people I need to thank. First, I \nagain thank Senator Feinstein, my partner in the Senate on this bill. \nHer work on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee was invaluable, \nand John Watts of her staff helped greatly. Congressman Thompson \ntirelessly championed this bill in the House, and Jonathan Birdsong, \nhis legislative director, put in countless hours of work to accomplish \nthis.\n  I also thank Senators Bingaman and Domenici of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. They, along with Senators Craig and Wyden, have \nworked very well with me to protect these special places and helped me \nmove this bill forward. Finally I need to thank David Brooks and Frank \nGladics of the Energy Committee staff for working so carefully and \nconscientiously on this bill.\n  God has given Americans an exceptionally beautiful treasure in its \nwild landscape, and my State is blessed with some of its best.\n  We must be good stewards of that gift and share it with future \ngenerations that is what Theodore Roosevelt, John Muir, John Wesley \nPowell, Ansel Adams, and other great Americans did, and we have places \nlike Yosemite and Yellowstone to cherish because of their actions.\n  Mr. President, because the Congress passed this bill today, future \ngenerations will be thanking us for preserving places like the King \nRange and other parts of the stunning, wild, and unspoiled northern \nCalifornia coast.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10539-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CORRECTING THE ENROLLMENT OF S. 203\n\n  The concurrent resolution (H.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the State of New Jersey was critically important during \n     the American Revolution because of the strategic location of \n     the State between the British armies headquartered in New \n     York City, New York, and the Continental Congress in the city \n     of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;\n       (2) General George Washington spent almost half of the \n     period of the American Revolution personally commanding \n     troops of the Continental Army in the State of New Jersey, \n     including 2 severe winters spent in encampments in the area \n     that is now Morristown National Historical Park, a unit of \n     the National Park System;\n       (3) it was during the 10 crucial days of the American \n     Revolution between December 25, 1776, and January 3, 1777, \n     that General Washington, after retreating across the State of \n     New Jersey from the State of New York to the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania in the face of total defeat, recrossed the \n     Delaware River on the night of December 25, 1776, and went on \n     to win crucial battles at Trenton and Princeton in the State \n     of New Jersey;\n       (4) Thomas Paine, who accompanied the troops during the \n     retreat, described the events during those days as ``the \n     times that try men's souls'';\n       (5) the sites of 296 military engagements are located in \n     the State of New Jersey, including--\n       (A) several important battles of the American Revolution \n     that were significant to--\n       (i) the outcome of the American Revolution;

and\n       (C) marauding contingents of loyalist Tories and rebel \n     sympathizers;\n       (10) because of the important role that the State of New \n     Jersey played in the successful outcome of the American \n     Revolution, there is a Federal interest in developing a \n     regional framework to assist the State of New Jersey, local \n     governments and organizations, and private citizens in--\n       (A) preserving and protecting cultural, historic, and \n     natural resources of the period; and\n       (B) bringing recognition to those resources for the \n     educational and recreational benefit of the present and \n     future generations of citizens of the United States; and\n       (11) the National Park Service has conducted a national \n     heritage area feasibility study in the State of New Jersey \n     that demonstrates that there is a sufficient assemblage of \n     nationally distinctive cultural, historic, and natural \n     resources necessary to establish the Crossroads of the \n     American Revolution National Heritage Area.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this subtitle are--\n       (1) to assist communities, organizations, and citizens in \n     the State of New Jersey in preserving--\n       (A) the special historic identity of the State;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Western Reserve \n     Heritage Areas Study Act''.\n\n     SEC. 302. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE STUDY REGARDING THE WESTERN \n                   RESERVE, OHIO.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The area that encompasses the modern-day counties of \n     Trumbull, Mahoning, Ashtabula, Portage, Geagua, Lake, \n     Cuyahoga, Summit, Medina, Huron, Lorain, Erie, Ottawa, and \n     Ashland in Ohio with the rich history in what was once the \n     Western Reserve, has made a unique contribution to the \n     cultural, political, and industrial development of the United \n     States.\n       (2) The Western Reserve is distinctive as the land settled \n     by the people of Connecticut after\n\n[[Page S10556]]\n\n     the Revolutionary War. The Western Reserve holds a unique \n     mark as the original wilderness land of the West that many \n     settlers migrated to in order to begin life outside of the \n     original 13 colonies.\n       (3) The Western Reserve played a significant role in \n     providing land to the people of Connecticut whose property \n     and land was destroyed during the Revolution. These settlers \n     were descendants of the brave immigrants who came to the \n     Americas in the 17th century.\n       (4) The Western Reserve offered a new destination for those \n     who moved west in search of land and prosperity. The \n     agricultural and industrial base that began in the Western \n     Reserve still lives strong in these prosperous and historical \n     counties.\n       (5) The heritage of the Western Reserve remains transfixed \n     in the counties of Trumbull, Mahoning, Ashtabula, Portage, \n     Geagua, Lake, Cuyahoga, Summit, Medina, Huron, Lorain, Erie, \n     Ottawa, and Ashland in Ohio. The people of these counties are \n     proud of their heritage as shown through the unwavering \n     attempts to preserve agricultural land and the industrial \n     foundation that has been embedded in this region since the \n     establishment of the Western Reserve. Throughout these \n     counties, historical sites, and markers preserve the unique \n     traditions and customs of its original heritage.\n       (6) The counties that encompass the Western Reserve \n     continue to maintain a strong connection to its historic past \n     as seen through its preservation of its local heritage, \n     including historic homes, buildings, and centers of public \n     gatherings.\n       (7) There is a need for assistance for the preservation and \n     promotion of the significance of the Western Reserve as the \n     natural, historic and cultural heritage of the counties of \n     Trumbull, Mahoning, Ashtabula, Portage, Geagua, Lake, \n     Cuyahoga, Summit, Medina, Huron, Lorain, Erie, Ottawa and \n     Ashland in Ohio.\n       (8) The Department of the Interior is responsible for \n     protecting the Nation's cultural and historical resources. \n     There are significant examples of such resources within these \n     counties and what was once the Western Reserve to merit the \n     involvement of the Federal Government in the development of \n     programs and projects, in cooperation with the State of Ohio \n     and other local governmental entities, to adequately \n     conserve, protect, and interpret this heritage for future \n     generations, while providing opportunities for education and \n     revitalization.\n       (b) Study.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary, acting through the National \n     Park Service Rivers, Trails, and Conservation Assistance \n     Program, Midwest Region, and in consultation with the State \n     of Ohio, the counties of Trumbull, Mahoning, Ashtabula, \n     Portage, Geagua, Lake, Cuyahoga, Summit, Medina, Huron, \n     Lorain, Erie, Ottawa, and Ashland, and other appropriate \n     organizations, shall carry out a study regarding the \n     suitability and feasibility of establishing the Western \n     Reserve Heritage Area in these counties in Ohio.\n       (2) Contents.--The study shall include analysis and \n     documentation regarding whether the Study Area--\n       (A) has an assemblage of natural, historic, and cultural \n     resources that together represent distinctive aspects of \n     American heritage worthy of recognition, conservation, \n     interpretation, and continuing use, and are best managed \n     through partnerships among public and private entities and by \n     combining diverse and sometimes noncontiguous resources and \n     active communities;\n       (B) reflects traditions, customs, beliefs, and folklife \n     that are a valuable part of the national story;\n       (C) provides outstanding opportunities to conserve natural, \n     historic, cultural, or scenic features;\n       (D) provides outstanding recreational and educational \n     opportunities;\n       (E) contains resources important to the identified theme or \n     themes of the Study Area that retain a degree of integrity \n     capable of supporting interpretation;\n       (F) includes residents, business interests, nonprofit \n     organizations, and local and State governments that are \n     involved in the planning, have developed a conceptual \n     financial plan that outlines the roles for all participants, \n     including the Federal Government, and have demonstrated \n     support for the concept of a national heritage area;\n       (G) has a potential local coordinating entity to work in \n     partnership with residents, business interests, nonprofit \n     organizations, and local and State governments to develop a \n     national heritage area consistent with continued local and \n     State economic activity;\n       (H) has a conceptual boundary map that is supported by the \n     public; and\n       (I) has potential or actual impact on private property \n     located within or abutting the Study Area.\n       (c) Boundaries of the Study Area.--The Study Area shall be \n     comprised of the counties of Trumbull, Mahoning, Ashtabula, \n     Portage, Geagua, Lake, Cuyahoga, Summit, Medina, Huron, \n     Lorain, Erie, Ottawa, and Ashland in Ohio.\n\n           Subtitle B--St. Croix National Heritage Area Study\n\n     SEC. 311.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n[[Page S10560]]\n\n                                S. 3661\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for being \nhere so we can discuss briefly a bill that has just by unanimous \nconsent been passed.\n  The reason we are here is to help clarify some concerns which I know \nhe has with the legislation. I appreciate his willingness to work with \nSenator Hutchison and myself in expediting this passage.\n  This bill will ultimately repeal the Wright amendment, a law designed \nto reflect the compromise with respects to flights coming into and out \nof Love Field in Dallas, TX and, therefore, operating just a few miles \ndown the road from Dallas-Ft. Worth Airport but which has proved a \nhindrance to competition among airlines; and has resulted in increased \nfares to those who travel through DFW Airport.\n  The legislation before us recognizes that the city of Dallas is the \nentity responsible for operating Love Field, and will reduce the gates \nthere to 20 and will allocate those gates with existing commitments and \nobligations, including commitments to accommodate potential new \nentrants.\n  I point out that doing so will allow the city of Dallas to maintain \nan appropriate number of gates to address the critically important \nconsiderations of local noise, air pollution, congestion, and safety.\n  I yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate what the Senator from Texas \nhas said. I appreciate the colloquy and the days we spent trying to \nwork through this issue. He and I talked about this before the break in \nAugust. I knew working with him we would work out a solution. I believe \nwe have. It is a complicated solution for competition law and obviously \nimportant for Texas.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee is responsible for ensuring \ncompetition--and thereby protecting consumers--through enactment and \nenforcement of antitrust laws. I support repeal of the Wright \namendment, but the bill originally introduced by Senator Hutchison went \nwell beyond a simple repeal. It would have explicitly insulated from \ncompetition review private agreements among competitors. Such \ninsulation is inappropriate and unprecedented, and it is bad for \nconsumers.\n  I am sensitive to the hard work that the cities of Dallas and Fort \nWorth, and the airport authority there, have put in to craft a solution \nto the complicated web of problems created by the Wright amendment. It \nis more than unfortunate that Congress permitted such a clearly \nanticompetitive situation to exist in the first place, and it is \ncertainly our obligation to try to rectify that problem. Doing so in a \nway that creates a new set of anticompetitive issues--and the resulting \nharm to consumers--would only be to repeat the errors of the past.\n  I appreciate the changes we have been able to agree to, stripping the \nexplicit antitrust exemption from the bill, and speaking only to the \nobligations of the city of Dallas, rather than blessing the agreement \namong the cities, the airport authority, and two airlines. I am still \nconcerned, however, because while Congress is no longer explicitly \ndeeming the contract in compliance with competition laws, an implicit \nprotection from those important guardians of consumer welfare may \nremain.\n  The parties to the contract, both public and private, all assure me \nthat the contract is not anticompetitive, and that the statute should \nnot be read to create an exemption. I would prefer to be more precise \nin the statutory language, but I trust that they are correct. Senator \nCornyn and I share a concern about providing antitrust immunity to \nagreements involving private parties. While I would prefer greater \nclarity on this point in the bill, I am pleased that Senator Cornyn and \nI agree that this is an entirely unique situation, which should not be \nrepeated. I understand that in the view of the Senators from Texas, \nthis unique situation requires a unique, if inelegant solution. I \ndisagree and would have preferred a solution that more clearly \npreserves the antitrust laws. I have worked hard both with the affected \nparties and Senator Cornyn, to craft such a solution.\n\n  The similar respect Senator Cornyn and I have for preserving \ncompetition laws has made our conversations productive and moved the \nlegislative process forward. While my concerns remain about this \nlegislation, I am prepared to accept it. We have come a long way from \nwhere this process started with an explicit antitrust exemption.\n  I expect that in the future, legislation that may have \nanticompetitive effects will be referred to, and vetted by, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee so that concerns over competition can be handled in \nregular order and addressed early.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I know the Senior Senator from Vermont has genuine \nconcerns about the legislation. And while I do not take a position \nabout the creation of an antitrust exemption, implicit or otherwise, \nshare his view that this is a unique situation. I join him in saying \nthat the solution is not perfect. We do not agree on many issues, but \non some important ones--including intellectual property legislation--we \nshare a commitment to promoting free market principles--and the goal of \nany arrangement such as this should be to maximize those principles.\n  The legislation contemplated here should not be a model for any \nfuture arrangement. In no way can I imagine a situation arising with a \nset of facts remotely similar to that created in Dallas by the passage \nof the Wright amendment. It is entirely unique and is precisely the \nreason for this legislation--legislation that moves the ball forward \nconsiderably with respect to increasing competition in the Dallas-Fort \nWorth area.\n  In addition, the proposed legislation reflects a Congressional \nsanction for the city of Dallas to manage Love Field in a manner that \nit deems in the best interests of its citizens, and in accordance with \na hard fought local compromise, a sanction made necessary only by the \nexistence of the Wright amendment itself. By doing so, while not \nperfect by any means, I am hopeful that we will afford literally \nmillions of citizens in north Texas and elsewhere the enormous benefits \nof enhanced airline competition that they have long been denied because \nof the Wright amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to talk a little bit \nabout S. 3661 because I am the sponsor of the legislation and have \nworked for 12 years to try to explain the Wright amendment to every \ninterested party in Congress. It is so important to North Texas, to DFW \nAirport, and Love Field that we have an agreement, a plan to move \nforward beyond the Wright amendment in a way that is going to increase \ncompetition immeasurably.\n  Most people do not realize the history of the Wright amendment. When \nDFW Airport was forced on the cities of Dallas and Ft. Worth by a \nFederal mandate, the cities made agreements with airlines that DFW \nAirport would be the only functioning major airport in the region. It \nwas to be the international airport, and Love Field was to be closed. \nAfter litigation, Love Field was allowed to be an intrastate airport. \nThe Wright amendment later opened Love Field to serve the contiguous \nStates, but that became untenable as aviation traffic continued to \ngrow. The Wright amendment was very confining and was not the best \ncompetitive situation.\n  There have been many attempts to expand the Wright amendment. There \nhave also been attempts to repeal the Wright amendment. Many in \nCongress asked the mayors of the two cities to come up with a local \nsolution, rather than have Congress once again pass legislation that \nmay or may not take into consideration the interests of the people who \nlive and work and pay taxes in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area. The mayors \ndid just that.\n  Mayor Laura Miller and Mayor Mike Moncrief, the mayors of Dallas and \nFt. Worth, did an incredible job. They came together and made an \nagreement. Cities can make agreements. Under State law, cities can make \nagreements and there is never an antitrust issue when cities make \nagreements.\n  The antitrust issue was raised because two airlines became part of \nthe agreement. The cities brought them in because lease agreements that \nwere in place with those air carriers were going to have to be \ncompromised, they were going to have to be changed and broken.\n  Instead of pursuing condemnation, the parties were brought together \nto\n\n[[Page S10561]]\n\nget a consensus of their willingness to give up some rights in order to \nsettle this once and for all and open competition both at Love Field \nand at DFW Airport.\n  The cities did a great job. They made an agreement and they brought \nit to Congress. I have felt since the beginning, it was Congress's \nresponsibility to take that agreement, ratify it and mandate that the \nagreement be kept in its entirety because it is so balanced. And if you \ndid away with the Wright amendment, but you did not have the 20 gate \nlimit and the implementation of the 20 gates, it could have gone out of \nbalance.\n  So this act, regardless of anything else that has been said, \nauthorizes, mandates, and protects all aspects of performance of the \nlegislation's terms, including that the city of Dallas reduce and \nallocate gates according to this act, its contractual obligations as \ncontemplated by the act, and the local compromise and the balance it \nhas achieved.\n  This legislation will allow the DFW Metroplex to end decades of \nbitterness and infighting that have plagued the Wright amendment. It \nprovides a solution that all parties affected have agreed to. And just \nabout every party to this agreement has given something up for the good \nof the North Texas economy and the traveling public.\n  We can now move forward to allow immediate benefits to consumers and \nthe traveling public because airline prices are going to go down when \nthis bill is passed. Actually, the bill has already passed. I am very \npleased to say it has passed the Senate. It is going to the House now. \nAnd you will see, when the bill becomes law, that the prices of tickets \nfrom Dallas Love Field are going to go down to every destination. That \nis going to increase competition and interest in flying, which is going \nto be good for everyone.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter that was sent to four of the ranking \nmembers and committee chairs on September 28, 2006. It is addressed to \nSenator Specter, Senator Leahy, Congressman Sensenbrenner, and \nCongressman Conyers. And it is from the mayor of Dallas and the mayor \nof Fort Worth. I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record. It \ntells the history of the Wright amendment and how competition will be \nincreased.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 28, 2006.\n     Re Repeal of the Wright Amendment--S. 3661; H.R. 5830.\n\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Conyers, Jr.,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators and Representatives: We are writing in \n     response to letters from various detractors of the proposed \n     legislation to repeal the Wright Amendment. As the duly-\n     elected mayors and their city attorneys, and on behalf of the \n     citizens of Dallas and Fort Worth, we offer the following \n     observations for your consideration.\n       1. The suggestion by critics that the proposed legislation \n     is somehow anticompetitive and would lead to higher fares and \n     reduced service for consumers in the Dallas-Fort Worth area \n     is patently incorrect. Not surprisingly, these suggestions \n     are unaccompanied by any factual foundation or economic \n     analysis. On the contrary, the proposed Agreement would \n     enhance airline competition in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and \n     benefit consumers and airlines seeking to provide service to \n     the area. As we describe more fully below, independent \n     studies confirm that, in the short term, passage of the \n     proposed legislation would (1) increase the number of \n     passengers traveling to and from North Texas by two million \n     annually, (2) result in fare savings of approximately $260 \n     million per year, and (3) produce overall economic benefits \n     of $2.4 billion annually.\n       2. The detractors of the proposed legislation wholly fail \n     to address the critically important considerations of \n     aircraft noise, air quality, traffic congestion in the \n     airport vicinity, and economic activity in the region. With \n     few exceptions, airport operations reflect tradeoffs between \n     economic and environmental considerations. The proposed \n     legislation concerning Love Field is no different. The \n     legislation reflects a carefully crafted balance of these \n     considerations by the local governments principally \n     responsible for managing these issues. Unlike the \n     observations offered by certain critics, the compromise \n     reflected in the proposed legislation is not confined to the \n     issues of airline competition only, but rather reflects an \n     accommodation of a full range of economic and environmental \n     considerations that are important to Dallas and Fort Worth.\n\n\n   I. The Wright Amendment Compromise Was Forged By Local Government \n                   Leaders at the Urging of Congress\n\n       As an initial matter, it bears emphasis that a number of \n     Congressional leaders have long urged the cities of Dallas \n     and Fort Worth to work towards a local compromise to resolve \n     the longstanding controversies over the 1979 Wright Amendment \n     and its restrictions on commercial air service to and from \n     Dallas Love Field. Prompted by that Congressional call for \n     action, the mayors of Dallas and Forth Worth spearheaded \n     efforts to forge a compromise among local government leaders \n     and representatives of the Dallas-Fort Worth International \n     Airport Board (``DFW Board'').\n       The mayors and representatives of the DFW Board first \n     reached consensus among themselves on the propriety of a \n     local solution for repeal of the Wright Amendment. \n     Thereafter, the mayors and DFW Board persuaded Southwest \n     Airlines and American Airlines (as the principal tenants of \n     the main terminal at Love Field that would be called on to \n     give up property rights at Love Field) of the virtues of a \n     local solution, and that the solution the mayors and DFW \n     Board proposed likely would be favorably received by \n     Congress. As a consequence, Southwest and American each \n     decided to support the Wright Amendment compromise forged by \n     Dallas, Fort Worth, and the DFW Board.\n\n\nII. The Wright Amendment Compromise is Good for Airline Competition and \n                             for Consumers\n\n       After considerable study and examination, it is the view of \n     Dallas and Fort Worth that the Wright Amendment compromise \n     reflected in S. 3661 and H.R. 5830 would open the North Texas \n     market to considerably more competition in air \n     transportation.\n       To begin with, congressional approval of the Wright \n     Amendment compromise would enable Southwest and other \n     airlines serving Love Field immediately to begin selling \n     ``through tickets'' for travel to and from Love Field. This \n     would allow Love Field customers to travel on a one-stop \n     basis to and from cities nationwide. By contrast, under the \n     terms of the Wright and Shelby Amendments, airlines flying \n     out of Love Field are limited to a handful of nearby states.\n       Detractors maintain that the proposed legislation could be \n     anticompetitive, perhaps resulting in higher fares on many \n     routes. This is conjecture unsubstantiated by any facts. \n     Quite to the contrary, the Agreement, if implemented, would \n     result in a reduction in fares and hundreds of millions of \n     dollars in cost savings for consumers.\n       Two highly respected economic consulting firms, the \n     Campbell-Hill Aviation Group and SH International Air \n     Transport Consultancy, recently performed an economic \n     analysis of the Wright Amendment compromise. Their joint \n     findings show that ``through ticketing'' at Love Field would \n     increase the number of passengers traveling to and from North \n     Texas by two million, produce $259 million in fare savings, \n     and generate $2.4 billion in overall economic benefits--all \n     on an annual basis.\n       Equally unsupported are the arguments regarding the \n     proposed reduction of gates at Love Field. However, these \n     critics fail to acknowledge that the proposed reduction of \n     gates at Love Field from 32 to 20 would still leave more \n     gates in service than the 19 or fewer gates that airlines \n     have utilized since the inception of the Wright Amendment.\n       More fundamentally, besides ignoring the economic analysis \n     of the Wright Amendment Compromise set forth in the Campbell-\n     Hill and SH study, these commentators also fail to \n     acknowledge a study commissioned by the City of Dallas, which \n     was prepared by DMJM Aviation and released on May 31, 2006. \n     The DMJM Aviation study found that if the Wright Amendment is \n     repealed, the optimal number of gates at Love Field would be \n     20 in order to prevent excessive noise, emissions, and \n     traffic congestion in the local community. Repeal of the \n     Wright Amendment, which limits long-haul service to aircraft \n     of 56 seats or less, would result in more large aircraft \n     carrying more passengers to and from Love Field. Thus, the \n     study concluded a 20-gate limit without the Wright Amendment \n     would be equivalent in noise, pollution, and congestion to \n     the 32 gates now found at Love Field (again, only 19 of which \n     are currently utilized).\n       Just as the prognostication of an increase in airfares is \n     incorrect, so, too, is the speculation that the proposed \n     elimination of twelve gates at Love Field would bar \n     potential competitors from gaining access to the market. \n     In truth, carriers would not be prevented from obtaining \n     access to Love Field in the future. As set forth in the \n     July 31, 2001\n\n[[Page S10562]]\n\n     Airline Competition Plan submitted by the City of Dallas \n     for Love Field, ``the operational main terminal gates at \n     Love Field are all subject to scarce resource provisions \n     that, when invoked, render those gates preferential use \n     gates.'' Thus, the ``scarce resource'' provision allows \n     the City of Dallas to require incumbent airlines to share \n     gates that are not fully used at Love Field. This \n     provision is essentially the same as the procedures used \n     at most other major U.S. airports to accommodate new \n     entrant carriers.\n       The process for accommodating an airline seeking space \n     involves three stages, as outlined in the Love Field Airline \n     Competition Plan. First, if the City of Dallas has space \n     available to lease directly, it would do so. Second, in the \n     absence of space available for direct lease, the City of \n     Dallas would refer the requesting airline to parties who are \n     known to have gates or gate capacity available. Finally, if \n     neither of these approaches proves fruitful, the ``scarce \n     resource'' provisions of the lease permit the City of Dallas \n     to unilaterally require an incumbent airline to accommodate a \n     requesting airline in its premises. Thus, the assertion that \n     accommodation of new entrants resides solely within the good \n     graces of the incumbent airlines is false.\n       In fact, the City of Dallas regularly offers its support to \n     requesting carriers to assist in the negotiation of \n     reasonable sublease terms. Significantly, there have been no \n     cases in which an air carrier that was ready and willing to \n     begin or expand service to Love Field has been unable to do \n     so due to inability to secure reasonable access to needed \n     facilities.\n       Moreover, as previously recognized in an unsuccessful \n     antitrust case brought by the Department of Justice against \n     American, ``there are no structural barriers to entry at DFW, \n     which can accommodate any domestic carrier that seeks to \n     establish or expand service.'' United States v. AMR Corp., \n     140 F. Supp. 2d 1141, 1210 (D. Kan. 2001), aff'd, 335 F. 3d \n     1109 (10th Cir. 2003). DFW has 15 gates that are currently \n     available to be leased, and many other gates that are \n     underutilized. In fact, DFW has one of the most aggressive \n     Air Service Incentive Programs in the country. A carrier that \n     is willing to offer new domestic air service to one of DFW's \n     top 50 domestic markets is eligible to receive up to six \n     months free landing fees, up to $100,000 in marketing \n     support, and an additional $50,000 in marketing support if \n     the carrier is new to DFW. See also United States v. AMR \n     Corp., 140 F. Supp. 2d at 1210.\n       In sum, there is ready access to both Love Field and DFW, \n     and the proposed Wright Amendment compromise would ensure \n     continued access to the marketplace by carriers seeking to \n     provide service. Contrary to the suggestions of others, the \n     economic analyses conducted to date demonstrate that the \n     proposed legislation would foster competition among carriers, \n     enable consumers to save hundreds of millions of dollars in \n     air fares each year, and provide a carefully-constructed and \n     sensible solution to a decades-old problem.\n       In essence, these critics apparently contend that Congress \n     should simply repeal the Wright Amendment, while ignoring the \n     other important issues resolved by the proposed legislation. \n     That suggestion ignores the genesis and history of this \n     local compromise, the practical reasons for its detailed \n     terms, and the substantial tangible benefits this \n     legislation would provide not only for the people of \n     Dallas-Fort Worth, but for air travelers nationwide. The \n     proposed legislation is the result of a local government \n     initiative to forge a solution to a series of pressing and \n     inter-related regional transportation issues. The cities \n     of Dallas and Fort Worth spearheaded this effort not only \n     to repeal the Wright Amendment and thereby improve air \n     competition, but simultaneously to improve the regional \n     transportation infrastructure serving Dallas and Fort \n     Worth, to stimulate to the greatest extent possible \n     regional economic growth, and to address community \n     concerns about the noise, traffic, and air pollution \n     associated with increased service at these airports. \n     Balancing these interests was an enormously difficult \n     endeavor, requiring years of economic and environmental \n     study, planning, negotiation, and compromise. After much \n     study and consideration, we strongly believe the result is \n     a compromise that is good for the region and good for air \n     competition. In short, these detractors simply do not \n     recognize the complexity of the issues or the care with \n     which local officials and various constituencies have \n     addressed these important issues.\n       Again, thank you for your careful continued consideration \n     of the proposed legislation concerning the repeal of the \n     Wright Amendment. We stand ready to respond to any questions \n     you or members of your staffs might have.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Laura Miller,\n                                            Mayor, City of Dallas.\n                                           Thomas P. Perkins, Jr.,\n                                    City Attorney, City of Dallas.\n                                                    Mike Moncrief,\n                                                            Mayor,\n                                                    David L. Yett,\n                                City Attorney, City of Fort Worth.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. A lot of people--so many people--helped put this \nagreement together and hammer out the differences and views on the \nissues. We heard today that Senator Leahy has one view. Senator Cornyn \nhas a view. I have a view. Just about everybody in Congress who has \ndealt with this issue has a view.\n  But I think the law we are passing speaks for itself. The law is very \nclear in what it instructs the city of Dallas to do, as well as the FAA \nand the Department of Transportation in implementing this agreement. I \nthink it is a major piece of legislation that is absolutely right.\n  I agree with Senator Leahy and Senator Cornyn that this is not going \nto set a precedent. It is a unique situation that was brought on by a \nFederal mandate and then a Federal law. And the local community has had \nless input into its own aviation capabilities than maybe any other two \nmajor cities in America with major airports. I think today we have \nclarified the Wright amendment, and I do not think it is ever going to \nset a precedent because no other airport has a Wright amendment.\n  So as we phase it out gradually, in an orderly way, to protect the \nintegrity of the DFW Airport, as well as increasing competition in both \nDFW and Love Field, this is, for the taxpayers and the consumers and \nthe traveling public, a win all the way around.\n  I want to thank a few people because no one could have passed this \nbill alone. It took so much cooperation and so many things that were \nnecessary to bring everyone together.\n  I thank Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye, the chairman and ranking \nmember of the committee of jurisdiction, the Commerce Committee. I \ncould not have asked for more help. The bill passed out of the Commerce \nCommittee 21 to 1. Senator Rockefeller was the only one who voted no, \nbut he could not have been more accommodating and honorable in his \nobjection. Once we passed the bill out of committee, we worked with him \nto make sure he was a part of everything we did. He has been wonderful \nto work with.\n  I thank Senator Specter and Senator Leahy, who had concerns on the \nJudiciary Committee. I thank Senator Burns, Senator Frist, Senator \nReid, Senator Ensign, Senator McCain, former Speaker Jim Wright, who \nalso agrees the time has come to have an orderly repeal of the \namendment that he put in place, and, of course, Senator Cornyn. I also \nwant to say Senator Sununu was just a gentleman in these last couple of \ndays to help us in the ultimate solution of this bill.\n  I want to say that staff people, who are pro-progress, who have \ninnovation, and are willing to work so hard--which staff people in this \nSenate do on such a routine basis--I am so appreciative and so \nrespectful of them. I want to mention a couple because without them we \nwould never have gotten this done.\n  I thank Lisa Sutherland, Christine Kurth, Ken Nahagian, Sam \nWhitehorn, Jarrod Thompson, Gael Sullivan, and James Reid on the \nCommerce Committee. Every one of them had an immense impact on this \nlegislation. I thank Harold Kim, Joe Jacquot, and Ivy Johnson, from \nSenator Specter's staff; J.P. Dowd, Susan Davies, and Ed Pagano from \nSenator Leahy's staff;--all who were incredible and so helpful.\n  I want to take a moment to say that Senator Durbin and Senator \nSchumer also helped in many of the negotiations on this issue. Senator \nLott was there from the very beginning.\n  But I also want to take a moment of personal privilege about my \nstaff. I have never seen such dedication on such a tough issue as James \nChristoferson, Matthew Acock, Lindsey Dickinson, Dick Ribbentrop, and \nMarc Short made in contributing to this victory for my constituents in \nTexas. These five people worked on this bill, this negotiation, on a \ndaily basis for the last 6 months. There was never a day when we did \nnot have some item that we were trying to move forward to get this bill \nto the point that we could pass it on the Senate floor. I think the \npeople of Texas owe a great deal of gratitude to these dedicated \nmembers of my staff for never giving up, even when it was bleak from \ntime to time, and being as dedicated as I was to making sure the right \nresult for all parties to this agreement became a part of the solution.\n  When you work on something for so long, and you know how important it \nis, and how many people are counting on you, you just feel honorbound \nto do your best to make sure the people who have worked hard are \nrewarded. When Mayor Miller and Mayor Moncrief\n\n[[Page S10563]]\n\nmade this agreement, and when they got the support they needed from the \nDFW Airport, from American Airlines, and from Southwest Airlines--\nbecause their rights were affected--everybody gave a little in order to \ndo good for the populace.\n  I know in the coming years the traveling public in the North Texas \narea--in and out--are going to see the benefits of a great competitive \natmosphere. The DFW Airport gives the greatest service. They are the \nmid-country airport that really is the stopping off point for so many \ntravelers going to the rest of the world. That is going to increase, \nand it is going to increase with lower fares and more convenience. It \nis going to be more convenient even with the safety antiterrorism \nmeasures that are being taken, which we know can inconvenience the \ntraveling public.\n  DFW Airport is going to be the long-haul service carrier that will be \nthe window to the world for people who live in the middle part of our \ncountry. Love Field is going to be a dynamic, limited-use airport \nbecause it sits right in the middle of an area that is full of \nwonderful neighborhoods, schools, churches, and businesses. The right \nof the city of Dallas to protect the citizens who live in the area is \nwell recognized in the law, and they are invoking it. The city is doing \na great job of making sure we have more competition and better fares. \nLove Field, while a dynamic airport sitting in the middle of a \nneighborhood, also deserves the safety and the environmental \nprotections of all of our citizens.\n  So, Mr. President, I thank you for the time. I am very pleased this \nbill has passed. I look forward to seeing the benefits.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Oklahoma is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, hopefully, I will not take all that time. \nI think the American people need to pay attention to what we have just \ndone. The Energy bill, which was actually 41 bills wrapped into one, \nthat we agreed to through unanimous consent, is going to cost the \nAmerican taxpayer $1.5 billion.\n  The real question is, in light of where we find ourselves--fighting \nthe war, trying to help the people in Louisiana, Mississippi, and \nAlabama, and running in excess of a $300 billion real deficit this \nyear--should we be spending money on these priorities? A real problem \nin Washington is getting Congress to make tough decisions about what is \na priority.\n  I will spend a few minutes outlining what is in the bill because the \nAmerican people have no idea what was in the bill. The first thing is \n$500,000 to study lighthouses in Michigan for tourism. Tourism is \nalready a $16 billion industry in Michigan. There is nothing in the \nConstitution that would say that is a Federal responsibility. We will \ndo it anyway.\n  Indiana Dunes Visitor Center, $1.2 million to establish a building, \nconstruct a theater and a bookstore. Is that a priority right now when \nwe are spending our grandkids' money? We are going to build a bookstore \nand create a visitor center now when we cannot even pay for the war \nthat we are fighting and we are charging that to our children?\n  There are new national heritage designations. We have a backlog of \nover $4 billion in repairs to the National Parks we have today. We \ncannot even take care of the parks we have today, and we are going to \ncreate 10 new national heritage centers, spending over $100 million to \ndo so.\n  This bothers me on several fronts. Most important, it isn't a \npriority. It isn't something we ought to be spending money on right \nnow. We are getting ready to do it. We already have 30 national \nheritage centers. We are going to delete the resources that are going \nto those by adding 10 more.\n  Finally, the problem with national heritage areas is they undermine \nproperty rights because the money is used to change zoning laws to back \nthe people who have property rights around the national heritages. We \nare using Federal dollars to create national heritage areas that will \nundermine individual property rights. That is wrong.\n  The other thing that is in this bill is a study to assess creating \nfour more national heritages.\n  The process is broken under which we bring bills such as this to the \nSenate, at a time when we cannot afford to pay what we are doing today. \nWe spent a ton of our time on appropriations. After what I was told \nthrough all this process, after having written a letter raising \nobjections, meeting with the committee, meeting with our leadership, we \nhad a leadership meeting this week which basically said: If you don't \nlet all of these packages of spending of low priority and no priority \ngo through, the Senate will come to a standstill and we will see \neverything else blocked by the minority.\n  I believe we ought to be making choices about the right priorities \nfor our country. It is not that heritage areas are wrong. It is that we \ncannot afford them. We are going to spend money on things we cannot \nafford and borrow the money from our children and our grandchildren to \npay for things that we have to do.\n  It is cheating our children and our grandchildren. It also is beneath \nthe dignity of this Senate.\n  This process has to be fixed. We cannot continue to authorize, \nauthorize, and authorize more spending without doing the hard work, \nlooking at what we have authorized that is not working, is inefficient, \nor is duplicated. But we continue to do it, and I will continue to \nstand up for the next 4 years and raise this issue every time.\n  This is not a Democratic or Republican issue. This is an American \nissue that this Senate does not want to address. We seem to be blinded \nby the fact that we can just spend and authorize all the money we want \nand to have no impact. We do not authorize unless we expect it to get \nspent.\n  With this bill, through the chairman working with us, he agreed to \ndeauthorize over $150 million. That is a start. But other bills that \ncome to the Senate that have new spending in the future ought to meet a \ntest; that is, have we looked at everything else in that area? Is it \nworking well? Are we spending the money wisely? Are we spending it \nefficiently? Are there programs that are not working that we ought to \ndeauthorize so we can afford to authorize this as a better priority?\n  We are not doing that in this country. That is something the American \npeople deserve to have done rather than to hang our children and \ngrandchildren out to dry with debt.\n  This year, 8 percent of our budget is for interest. In 2035, 29 years \nfrom now, 25 percent of our budget is going to be interest. That is $1 \ntrillion. We spent $200 billion this year on interest because we will \nnot be frugal with the American taxpayers' money. There is over $200 \nbillion worth of fraud, waste, and abuse in the Government programs we \nhave today, and we will not go and fix it. Instead, we will spend \nanother $1.5 million because that is easy to do. It sounds good at \nhome, but we will not do what is necessary to secure the financial \nfuture of this country.\n  The notice I am placing today is there is a precedent established \nwith this bill. If you want to authorize new programs and you want this \nSenator not to object or to debate them on the floor, there better be \ndeauthorizations of programs of that committee's jurisdiction before \nthey can expect my vote on a unanimous consent agreement to spend into \nthe future and to undermine the future of the next generation of \nAmericans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nGeorgia is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10563-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10563-S10565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              H-2A PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I take a few minutes to respond to some \nof the comments made this afternoon by my colleagues from Idaho, from \nCalifornia, and Massachusetts. First of all, they are correct in \nstating the H-2A program, which is the existing temporary nonimmigrant \nworker program for agriculture, does not work the way it should.\n  However, what Senator Craig, Senator Feinstein, Senator Boxer, and \nSenator Kennedy propose to do, rather than make many of the necessary \nchanges to make the H-2A program viable nationwide is, first of all, to \ngrant an amnesty to virtually everyone who has passed through \nagricultural occupations in the past 2 years.\n  We all know that agriculture has been the traditional gateway \noccupation for illegal immigrants in the\n\n[[Page S10564]]\n\nUnited States. I strongly disagree to large-scale adjustment of status \nfor illegal aliens philosophically, particularly in the area of \nagriculture, but my objection has practical roots.\n  Agricultural work is the hardest, most backbreaking work in the \nUnited States today. As soon as we give illegal aliens who are \ncurrently working in agriculture lawful, permanent resident status, as \nthe AgJOBS bill will do, they will no longer choose to work in the \nfields, packing sheds, groves, or processing facilities.\n  I come from the heart of agriculture country in the southeastern part \nof the United States. I have talked to farmers in my area not just for \nthe 12 years I have been privileged to serve in Congress but even \nbefore that. Labor has been the most critical issue they have had to \ndeal with year in and year out in addition to disasters, to too much \nrain, to not enough rain, to high gas prices.\n  The immigration issue has the potential to be the answer if we do the \nright thing. We know these folks will leave agriculture and move into \nthe private sector because this is what happened in 1986 after Congress \npassed the Immigration Reform and Control Act. Included in that \nlegislation was the special agricultural worker program that gave \ntemporary legal status to illegal aliens who had worked a certain \nnumber of years in agriculture. Two years after obtaining a temporary \nstatus--and in some cases 1 year--those illegal workers were given \npermanent status. They soon left the fields and moved into the private \nsector in so many other areas where we find them today.\n  My position as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee has \nprovided me the opportunity to travel across the United States and talk \nwith farmers and ranchers. Recently, I have concluded eight field \nhearings from one end of the country to the other, from the east coast \nto the west coast. In every single hearing we held with farmers and \nranchers across America I had any number of farmers who came up to me \nduring the process of those hearings to talk about immigration. It is \nan issue on the west coast. It is an issue on the east coast and all \nparts in between. And to a farmer, the one thing I heard from him was: \nSenator, whatever you do, don't let the AgJOBS provision that grants \namnesty to folks who come to this country to work in agriculture get \npassed because if you let that provision in, I assure you, the pool of \nagricultural workers that we need will not be there after they gain \nthat permanent status in the United States.\n  Why should we expect this adjustment status to be any different than \nwhat we saw in 1986? It won't. I don't think it will be, and the folks \nwho are involved in agriculture don't think it will be. All that would \nbe left to our farmers and ranchers will be the H-2A program, and the \nrevisions that Senators Craig, Feinstein, Boxer, and Kennedy make to \nthe H-2A program are actually detrimental to the future success of that \nprogram.\n  I have talked to farmers, as late as the day before yesterday. I had \na group of farmers from all over the country who were in my office, and \nevery single one of them uses the H-2A program. What they tell me is \nthe program, as they have used it, is cumbersome. It is expensive. But \nit works. And in the areas of the country where farmers have used the \nH-2A program, the labor shortage issues are not as acute as in those \nareas apparently such as in California and Idaho, where they use \nillegals crossing the border, and where now the border is being \ntightened up and they are feeling a pinch because they do not use legal \nworkers.\n  In my part of the country, I went to our farmers who complained about \nnot having a quality pool of workers from which to choose. And when \nthey used illegal workers, and they had the INS come in and check on \nthem, the illegals scattered from one end to the other, all of a \nsudden, and they were left naked and unable to harvest their crops. I \nsaid: What you have to do is get in compliance with the law. You have \nto use H-2A, irrespective of how inconvenient it is, irrespective of \nhow bureaucratic it is, and irrespective of how expensive it is, if you \nwant to be legal and if you want to have that quality pool of workers \nfrom which to choose.\n  By and large, farmers in my part of the world are now using H-2A, and \nthey are finding that exactly what we thought would happen is \nhappening. They do not have to look over their shoulder every year to \nsee if ICE--now it is ICE--is coming in to check their workers. They \nknow they are here legally. They know they are going to have to pay \nthem a good wage. They know they are going to have to provide them with \nhousing--all the things that H-2A provides. And they are willing to do \nthat because they do have a quality pool from which to choose.\n  Now, finally, I point out that even though H-2A is not perfect--it is \ncumbersome, it is costly, it subjects employees who use it to \nlawsuits--in those areas where H-2A is used, they are not experiencing \nthe shortage that others have found. So I think, rather than grant a \nlarge adjustment of status to illegal workers, we ought to sit down at \nthe table and talk about ways we can make the H-2A program more \nworkable for our farmers.\n  I am happy to sit down with my friends from California and Idaho and \nsee if we cannot work through this. But let me say there are some \nfundamental problems with AgJOBS in addition to the adjustment of \nstatus provision, which does grant a pathway to becoming legal, a \npathway to citizenship for those people who work in agriculture in this \ncountry under that program for a period of 2 years. We have to work \nthrough that. I do not think that is in the benefit of the American \npeople, whether it is the American farmer or whether it is those people \nwho are here legally trying to become citizens in the right way.\n  Secondly, there is an issue relative to the wage rate. Now we have \nthe adverse effect wage rate under the H-2A program, which is not fair. \nIt is not equitable to farmers in North Dakota versus farmers in \nGeorgia, versus farmers in California and Idaho. In the recent \nimmigration reform package we had on the floor, we sought to amend that \nbill to include what is known as a prevailing wage, ``prevailing wage'' \nbeing a wage that is determined by the Department of Labor to be \napplicable to agricultural workers in certain regions within a State, \nrather than in regions of the country. It is fair. It is equitable. We \nneed to have that prevailing wage provision put into whatever amendment \nwe make to the H-2A program.\n  Also, the AgJOBS bill does not eliminate what we call the 50-percent \nrule. Every farmer who uses H-2A knows and understands exactly what I \nam talking about and knows what a hindrance this is to them because, \nunder AgJOBS, they would be forced to hire what is called a blue card \nworker who is treated like a U.S. worker for hiring purposes. If he \nshows up at the farm before 50 percent of the work is complete, then \neven though the farmer has an H-2A worker here, he has to send that \nindividual back to wherever he came from and hire that domestic person \nor that blue card person under the AgJOBS program.\n  It gets complicated, but those folks who have been involved in this \nknow exactly what I am talking about. What we should make sure of is \nthat at the end of the day we have a program that is fair to farmers, \nthat is fair to Americans--whether they are folks who are here looking \nfor work in agriculture or whether they are folks who are trying to \nbecome citizens of this country in a lawful way, in the way that is set \nforth in our Constitution--that we should make sure we provide our \nfarmers with a quality pool of workers from which to choose, and that \nwe make sure our farmers are required to pay those individuals a fair \nwage and are required to either provide them housing or provide them a \nhousing allowance, so while they are here working on their farms we do \nnot have to worry about where they are out in the communities, and that \nthey are able to take care of themselves while they are here.\n  All of these issues are critically important parts of any immigration \nreform package we take up. So I simply urge again my friends who want \nto give these folks who come to work in agriculture a pathway to \ncitizenship that we sit down at the table and work out these \ndifferences. Let's amend H-2A and accomplish the goal we all have in \ncommon.\n  Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from\n\n[[Page S10565]]\n\nNorth Dakota is recognized for 30 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10565-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10565-S10569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      AGRICULTURE DISASTER RELIEF\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself, Senator \nNelson of Nebraska, Senator Hagel, Senator Dorgan, Senator Salazar, \nSenator Coleman, Senator Baucus, Senator Johnson, Senator Burns, \nSenator Harkin, Senator Cantwell, Senator Clinton, Senator Schumer, \nSenator Inouye, Senator Thune, Senator Durbin, Senator Obama, Senator \nReid of Nevada, Senator Dayton, Senator Murray, Senator Jeffords, and \nSenator Enzi.\n  Mr. President, 21 Senators, on a fully bipartisan basis, have \ncosponsored this legislation to provide disaster relief for our \nNation's farmers.\n  In North Dakota, last year, we faced what was then extraordinary \nflooding. As shown here, these were pictures all across eastern North \nDakota. We had a million acres that were prevented from even being \nplanted, hundreds of thousands of additional acres that were planted \nand then drowned out. There was no disaster assistance for those \npeople.\n  This year--the irony of ironies--we have now had extraordinary \ndrought. This is a picture from my home county, Burleigh County, in the \ncenter of North Dakota. This is a corn crop with absolutely nothing \ngrowing. This drought is now the third worst drought in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  This chart shows the U.S. drought monitor. It shows the severity of \nthe drought across the entire midsection of the country. This shows, in \nthe darkest colors, exceptional drought. You can see the exceptional \nareas of drought are these. North Dakota and South Dakota are the \nepicenter of this drought. It has been devastating. If assistance is \nnot granted, thousands of farm families will be forced off the land. \nThat is a fact.\n  I have had the independent bankers of my State say to the White House \nrepresentative who was in my office: If assistance does not come, 5 to \n10 percent of their clients in North Dakota will be forced out of \nbusiness.\n  Thirty-four farm organizations--34 farm organizations--have now \nspoken and told the Congress of the United States: Take action on \ndisaster assistance and take it now.\n  In addition, we have this letter from the State Commissioners of \nAgriculture from all across the country, saying that emergency \nagricultural disaster assistance is a high priority requiring action by \nCongress this year. It could not be more clear that assistance is \nneeded, and it is needed now.\n  Last May, the Senate approved bipartisan emergency agricultural \ndisaster assistance for the 2005 crop year. The President threatened to \nveto the bill if the farm assistance provisions were included. During \nthe conference with the House, the majority leadership demanded the \nassistance provisions be removed.\n  In June, the Senate Appropriations Committee once again approved \nemergency disaster assistance as part of the agriculture appropriations \nbill for 2007. Again, the majority leadership has failed to bring that \nmeasure to the Senate floor for debate and vote.\n  Since that time, much of rural America has suffered from what USDA \nmeteorologists have described as the third worst drought since records \nhave been kept. Only the 1930s and 1950s exceed the severity of this \ndrought.\n  In early September, I introduced a new bipartisan farm disaster \nrelief bill to provide help for both 2005 and 2006. Senator Nelson and \nI offered that legislation as an amendment to include during the port \nsecurity bill consideration. A vote on that amendment was denied by the \nSenate leadership.\n  Last week, I once again tried to get the Senate to adopt disaster \nrelief legislation. Again, the efforts were thwarted by the majority \nleadership.\n  Today, as we are about to recess the Senate, I will offer a revised \nversion of the important disaster legislation. Let me make clear to my \ncolleagues, these are the disaster provisions that have already been \napproved by the Senate, but we have made a modification because the \nadministration has said there are two provisions they object to. Those \nprovisions--the economic assistance provisions to help offset the \nrising cost of energy, and the additional grants to the States to deal \nwith the livestock losses--we have removed those two provisions the \nadministration has objected to.\n  We retain the crop and livestock production loss provisions of the \noriginal legislation. Crop producers will still need to demonstrate a \n35-percent loss before they get anything. Payments for the livestock \ncompensation program will only be made to producers whose operations \nare in counties designated as disaster areas by the Secretary, and who \ncan demonstrate they suffered a material loss.\n  It also contains additional funding for conservation programs to help \nrestore and rehabilitate drought and wildlife losses on grazing lands.\n\n  As I have indicated, my new legislation eliminates the emergency \neconomic assistance for program crop and dairy producers, and it \nstrikes the supplemental grants to the States to assist other livestock \nand specialty crop producers.\n  These provisions were included in the original bill, but because the \nadministration has objected, we have removed them. By making these \nchanges, the Secretary's opposition no longer has any basis.\n  The cost of providing emergency disaster assistance for losses in \n2005 and 2006 is reduced from $6.7 billion in my original bill to $4.9 \nbillion in this legislation.\n  Farmers and ranchers need assistance for 2005 and 2006 natural \ndisasters, and they need it now. If these emergencies are not dealt \nwith, tens of thousands of farm families and main street businesses \nwill suffer, some of them irretrievably. It is time for Congress to act \nand to allow this legislation to be voted on. Let's give our colleagues \na chance to vote. We have removed the reasons for the objection from \nthe administration.\n  I urge my colleagues to act.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Presiding Officer, how much time do I have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator has 22 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from South Dakota if he \ncould take 4 minutes? I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from South \nDakota; and to the Senator from North Dakota, if I could give 4 \nminutes; and the Senator from Montana 4 minutes; and then the Senator \nfrom Nebraska 4 minutes as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I am glad to join my colleague from North \nDakota today and support him and the other 20 Senators who are on this \nbill in moving disaster assistance through the Senate.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota has noted--you saw the drought chart \nhe put up earlier--the Dakotas were the epicenter when it comes to \ndrought this year. We had the bull's-eye, the area where the most \nsevere drought hit.\n  I visited in South Dakota in June. At that point, we had no wheat \ncrop. In all of central South Dakota, both winter wheat and spring \nwheat were all wiped out.\n  I went back in July to central South Dakota and looked at other parts \nof the State. By then, we could tell we were not going to have a corn \ncrop. I went to western South Dakota in August with my colleague \nSenator Johnson. We traveled to areas west of the Missouri River and \nagain to the central part of the State. We looked at corn that rivaled \nwhat the Senator from North Dakota showed that was about this tall--or \nabout this tall--when it ought to have been in full bloom.\n  The livestock producers in western South Dakota had no hay crop. As a \nconsequence, many of them had to liquidate their herds. What that means \nis that effect is felt not only directly by them and those families, \nbut by the entire rural area, the entire farm economy in my State and \nStates such as North Dakota.\n  It would be one thing if it were a 1-year deal. But this is \nsuccessive years of drought, 6 years in a row, 1999, 2000, on through \n2005. We have had these types of weather conditions in our States. The \nmonth of July was the hottest July on record in my State. In the months \nof May and June we normally would get precipitation. We had less \nprecipitation than the average during\n\n[[Page S10566]]\n\nthe years of the Great Depression--the biggest disaster to ever hit \nfarm country.\n  We respond as a country, as a Congress, when other areas of the \ncountry are impacted.\n  We do it when we have hurricanes. Many stepped up and supported the \nassistance for areas in the gulf. This is the same sort of disaster. It \nhas the same sort of effect. It may not have the immediate aftermath \nyou see when a hurricane strikes. It is a slow-motion disaster, but the \neffect on the economy in places in the Midwest is just as disastrous \nand devastating.\n  Mr. President, we need action. We need the Senate to do what it has \ndone in the past; that is, step forward and provide relief for these \nhard-hit farmers and ranchers in the Midwest. It was noted by my \ncolleague from North Dakota that the Senate has, on a couple occasions, \npassed drought disaster relief. We need to get it passed. I am happy to \njoin in that effort.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague said it well. This is a \npicture of Frank Barnick walking in a creekbed that used to provide \nwater for his cattle. One day this summer, it was 112 degrees in North \nDakota. You can see the devastating drought that has occurred. The land \nlooks like a moonscape.\n  Frank Barnick said this:\n\n       It is the worst drought I have ever seen. You do a lot of \n     praying and wondering how you are going to get through it.\n\n  One way you get through these things is when Congress decides to \nreach out with a helping hand and say: We want to help you, you are not \nalone. We have always done that. Somehow, this year it hasn't been \nquite as urgent to do it. I don't understand that.\n  Senator Burns and I have twice moved legislation through the \nAppropriations Committee. The Senate has twice passed agricultural \ndisaster aid. It has moved through the Appropriations Committee a third \ntime. My colleague, Senator Conrad, taking the lead in drafting, with \nmany of us assisting, created the disaster legislation now pending that \nwe should, by consent, move through the Senate. Yet somehow it remains \nblocked. It is not urgent for some. This isn't about the major \nindustries--the pharmaceutical industry, the oil industry, or about \nanother big industry--this is about individual families living a hard \nlife, trying to make a living during tough times.\n  Will Congress help? We have helped endangered species. We can deal \nwith them--birds, bats, butterflies, black-footed ferrets, and prairie \ndogs. When they are endangered, we say: Let's help. There is a species \ncalled family farmers and family ranchers who are out on the land \nliving alone, trying to make do by themselves. When tough times come, \nwhen weather-related disasters come, they need help.\n  With the Katrina victims, when those who live on farms in the gulf \nwere devastated by Hurricane Katrina, this Congress passed agricultural \ndisaster aid for them. This Congress said yes. So did this President. \nThey just said to all the rest of you in the country out there on the \nfarm or ranch who got hit by an agricultural disaster, a weather-\nrelated disaster: You are out of luck, we don't support you. That was \nthe message from the President. So he blocked it.\n  These are Republicans and Democrats on the floor of the Senate today \nworking together to say this needs to get done. This is a priority. I \nhear the President and others go all around the world when there is \ntrouble to say: Let us help. We are there to help you. What about here \nat home? Do we need to help here? You bet your life we do. We need to \ndo it now.\n  The question of whether these folks will farm and ranch next year \ndepends on whether we do what we are required and responsible to do. \nThe answer for the last year now, and recent months, is that somehow we \ndon't have time or the urgency and that we cannot quite get this done. \nThat is the wrong priority for this country. This country has a \nresponsibility to reach out to help its own, reach out to help people \nwho are in trouble.\n  These are American all-stars, the people who live on the farms. They \nproduce food for a hungry world. They don't ask for very much. When a \nweather disaster strikes--a hurricane, a drought, or a flood--and their \nentire income is washed away, they would hope, I would hope, and I \nthink the values of our country would expect, that we would reach out a \nhelping hand and say: We want to do this now. It is a time-honored \ntradition.\n  We are not asking for something strange or different. We have always \nhelped during tough times. Let's make this an urgent priority this \nafternoon; we can do this. Let's make this a priority and decide we are \ngoing to do the right thing for America's family farmers and ranchers.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I don't know of anything more frustrating \nto all of us who come from farm and ranch country than to try to get \nthis taken care of. We tried to take care of it last year and didn't \nget it done. There was no urgency. We had a fairly good crop this year. \nWe were not the epicenter of the drought. We have been in that bull's-\neye now for 6, going on 7 years. It takes its toll not only on wells \nbut reservoirs and streams.\n  I am here in support of this because I will tell you that the Dakotas \nwere the epicenter, and they helped us out when we needed it. We are \ngoing to try to help them out the best we can and do something.\n  This year in range country, we probably had more range fires \nburning--over 800,000 acres in Montana alone. We had a lot of growth to \nour grass in the first part of the year. We hit July when it was \nterribly hot, and it became crisp. When August came, we got the fires. \nThey were devastating, taking out fall pastures, hayfields, fences, \neven livestock, and we had to move a lot of livestock.\n  We need to boost this legislation. We have it back down to where I \nthink it is a pretty commonsense approach where nobody is getting rich. \nThe only thing we are trying to do is just get the folks to next \nspring, get them into next year. That is what this piece of legislation \nis all about. There is nothing excessive in this piece of legislation \nor the money we will spend. There is not. All of that has been taken \nout. This is barebones. This is the basics to their operations. We need \nto pass it this afternoon. I call on the leadership from both sides of \nthe aisle to urgently take a look at this and make sure we get it done \nbefore we go home.\n  Mr. President, I heartily support this, and I know the man in the \nchair right now, who probably knows his State about as good as \nanybody--he was raised ``west of the river,'' as we call it, in South \nDakota. I have never seen an area as devastated by drought as this area \nwas. You could not raise a fence.\n  So I would call on the leadership to take a look at this, pass it \nthis afternoon, and get them some money before next spring rolls \naround.\n  I thank my good friends from North Dakota for their leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nDayton, Murray, Jeffords, Enzi, and Thomas be added as original \ncosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom South Dakota be given 4 minutes and the Senator from Minnesota, \nMr. Dayton, be given 4 minutes at the conclusion of Senator Nelson's \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is that from the Senator's time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, out of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of \nS. 3991, the Emergency Farm Relief Act of 2006. I thank my colleague, \nSenator Conrad, for his hard work and leadership in trying to get this \nbill passed. We have all been working together on a bipartisan basis.\n\n[[Page S10567]]\n\n  The Presiding Officer spoke eloquently about the need for this \nrelief. Today is the last day for this Congress to consider providing \nrelief for our Nation's farmers and ranchers who have suffered through \nmultiple years of drought and other natural disasters. This is the time \nwe can do it, before we adjourn for the elections.\n  I am frustrated with our refusal to provide relief to farmers and \nranchers suffering from this particular natural disaster even though we \nseem to have no problems providing relief for other natural disasters, \nsuch as hurricanes. I accept the fact that we do that, but I don't \naccept the fact that we do that and fail to do this.\n  Mr. President, I have a chart here which shows the extent of the \ndrought in the Midwest and down into Texas. You can see where the \nhotspots are. I will tell you that this only tracks it most recently. \nIt doesn't show the extent of the damage that has happened over 5 to 7 \nyears. So if you just overlaid 5 or 7 years on this, you would see \nwhere the drought has continued.\n  I decided that maybe to get parity here for this kind of disaster it \nmight be helpful to give the drought some identification. So, \nunilaterally, I decided to name it ``Drought David,'' the same way we \nname hurricanes.\n  The unfortunate fact is that Drought David has, in some instances and \nin some locations, experienced its fifth birthday and, in some other \nareas, its seventh birthday.\n  Failure to provide this needed relief threatens many small rural \nbusinesses and communities as well as farmers and ranchers. It \nthreatens our Nation's food and fuel security efforts. So today I join \nmy colleagues and thank Senator Conrad for his final push because this \nis, in fact, a bipartisan effort to try to take care of those who are \nexperiencing losses that are far beyond their ability to sustain and, \ncertainly, far beyond their control.\n  Over the last few years, I think we have begun to understand that a \ndrought has devastating impacts in much the same way hurricanes do in \nother locations. The difference is that a hurricane or a flood is a \nfast-moving disaster; this is a slow-moving disaster that can go over \nthe course of years, as I have indicated. Giving it a name, I hope, \nwill somehow have the impact of our colleagues understanding that this \nis an incident which goes over a long period of time; nevertheless, the \ndevastation can be considerable, and in some cases the economic losses \ncan be the same as those who have other disasters.\n  We cannot prevent a drought, but Congress can help when a drought \ndevastates large portions of our country. Some said maybe what we need \nto do is make sure the crop insurance program takes care of it. Well, \nthe crop insurance program is for an occasional loss, not a continuing \nand sustained loss such as this. To give some sort of an analogy, you \ncould not have insurance that would cover your house if it burned down \nevery year, but occasional loss can be covered by insurance. This is \njust not coverable by insurance the way that it is right now. We cannot \nprevent it, but we can help. That is what we are all about today.\n  I am happy to report that we have taken some action that I think will \nbe helpful. Just the other day, the Commerce Committee passed my \nNIDIS--National Integrated Drought Information System--legislation. \nThat will help us create a system that will give us early warning so we \nwill know how long droughts continue, give us better ideas about what \ndrought conditions are predicted. This early warning system will give \nfarmers and ranchers a better idea of what to expect. They can make \nplanning decisions or livestock decisions based on the kind of \ninformation that will be available.\n  Unfortunately, at the present time, we are where we are, and we are \nnot where we would like to be. We hope we will have the opportunity \ntoday with unanimous consent to move this bill forward. We can do it \nbefore we break, whether it is tonight, tomorrow, or Sunday. We need to \nget this done. There is no justification. We can ask the question: If \nnot now, when? If not now, why?\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I thank Senator Conrad for this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senators from North Dakota, \nMr. Conrad and Mr. Dorgan, for their extraordinary leadership on this \nissue.\n  We have a crisis of enormous proportions across a large swath of \nAmerica, from the Canadian border all the way to Mexico. My home State \nof South Dakota, as has been noted, is virtually the epicenter of what \nhas been a drought, not just a catastrophic drought this year but the \nprevious year and some portions of South Dakota going back to the year \n2000. It has been devastating to our agricultural economy, but then as \nwell to our Main Streets, to the economy of that entire region.\n  Recently, I joined with my colleague, Senator Thune, in a joint \ndrought tour around portions of South Dakota that have been worst hit. \nIt was evident that the needs were urgent.\n  We saw herds being sold off entirely, calves being sold prematurely. \nWe saw the factory, in effect, being sold off from the livestock sector \nof our State.\n  In the crop areas, we saw areas where there was corn that was perhaps \n6 inches high with no ears. In other areas, you would have to get out \nof the pickup and kick the dust to tell what had been planted, whether \nit was soybeans, corn, whatever. It was entirely lost.\n  There are stock dams without water. Farming operations--good \noperations--that have been in the family for generations, some 100 \nyears or more, are in great jeopardy.\n  So I am here today to share my support for getting on with disaster \nrelief.\n  We passed disaster relief for the 2005 drought as part of the \nsupplemental appropriations bill. Unfortunately, when it went to the \nHouse, the agriculture portion of it was largely stripped out. We \nprovided money to rebuild Iraq and money to rebuild Katrina--and I wish \nthem all well--but there is a lack of regard for the crisis that exists \nin rural America.\n  The administration is talking about rebuilding Iraqi agriculture in \nrural communities. That is fine. But we have American farmers and \nranchers and American Main Streets that need some attention, and that \nneed for attention is urgent.\n  We attempted to pass agriculture relief on the Agriculture \nappropriations bill, but that has now been delayed until after the \nelection. Whether we are able to hold on to that funding remains to be \nseen.\n  Clearly, we will have progress if we continue the bipartisan support \nwe have up to now exhibited in the Senate where there has been pretty \ngood support, with Republicans and Democrats, Senators from all regions \nbehind us on this issue. We need to have support from the White House \nas well.\n  It is my hope that the White House will recognize that this drought \nhas only grown worse, the needs more urgent. Senator Conrad, to his \ngood credit, has worked very closely with the White House and with \nothers to reduce the cost of this effort, to meet some of the \nobjections that have been raised by the White House and by USDA.\n  So what we have here is a drought bill that would cost about the \nequivalent of 2 weeks' expenditure in Iraq for the entire Nation, for \nthe entire year, for multiple drought years.\n  It is important we recognize droughts are disasters, just as much as \nearthquakes, hurricanes, and tornadoes. They are less dramatic because \nthey happen through a drawn-out period of time, but they are just as \ndevastating. Just as Americans come together to deal with disasters \nthat occur in other parts of the country, we need to come together on \nthis disaster as well. Americans looking after Americans.\n  We are now at the final shred of time left in this Congress. This is \nour last remaining hope to get this done. It is my hope we can set \naside partisan politics and appreciate the losses that are being \nsustained are losses that are happening to American farmers and \nranchers and American Main Streets, and it needs an American response.\n  If we pull together in this body, I am confident that we will, in \nfact, make some progress. There still is time, but we have to act now.\n  Again, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues, I urge USDA, the White \nHouse, and our friends in the other body to recognize the critical \nneed, the urgent need for attention to this catastrophic string of \ndrought years that our farmers and ranchers and Main Streets are \nfacing.\n\n[[Page S10568]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota. If he uses less, he can yield time back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nNorth Dakota, Mr. Conrad, who championed this cause of disaster relief \nfor not only his farmers in North Dakota but across the affected areas, \nwhich certainly includes my State of Minnesota.\n  As others noted, this is a bipartisan effort. I see my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Coleman from Minnesota, is here also. We stand \ntogether to make this a bipartisan effort on behalf of the farmers \nthroughout our State who have been devastated by these natural \ndisasters over the last few years and particularly the last 2 years to \nwhich this bill applies.\n  I regret that this has been passed by the Senate before. I commend \nthis body for doing so, again, on a very strong bipartisan basis. \nUnfortunately, the administration has not been willing to allow this \nfunding to go forward or even some part of it. This is long overdue.\n  It is unfortunate that we are now at the 11th hour, the 59th minute \nof this session in this year, and we haven't even addressed the \ndisaster relief necessary for the last calendar year. This legislation \nwould deal with that and also this year's relief.\n  This disaster has afflicted our State, and some of our counties have \nlost three-fourths of our crops. In fact, almost half the counties in \nMinnesota have already been declared disaster areas.\n  The crisis is real. The suffering is acute. As others said, we have a \nmagnitude of disaster in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, but a \ndisaster is a disaster. A complete disaster is as devastating to a \nfamily in northwestern Minnesota as it is to a family in New Orleans.\n  I urge my colleagues, once again, to support this measure, and I \nplead with the House and the administration to work out these \ndifferences so that these farmers and their farms can be saved, and \ntheir families can be saved. It is only simple justice and humanity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I can yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota. We have now run down the clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota \nfor yielding me time.\n  I stand with my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Dayton, in \nbipartisan agreement. This is not a partisan issue, and it should not \nbe a partisan issue. I consider this one of the most important pieces \nof legislation that has been left undone this year, agricultural \ndisaster assistance.\n  While this body has come to the aid of producers in the gulf affected \nby hurricanes who need agricultural disaster assistance, Minnesota's \nfarmers and families have been left to fend for themselves in the face \nof natural disasters--the flooding of 2005 and the record drought in \n2006.\n  In the sugar sector alone, revenue was reduced by $60 million in \nMinnesota in 2005 thanks to this natural disaster. In one county, crop \nloss exceeded $52 million, and farmers were prevented from planting \nover 90,000 acres thanks to saturated fields. These are not just \nnumbers; these are people's lives. These are their livelihoods. There \nis a sense of history and connection to the land, and the future is now \nat risk.\n  I was up at Lake Bronson, MN, in northwest Minnesota, and met with \nover 100 farmers. It is their lives. The farmers are calling my office \ndesperate to save the family farm. Farmers are losing operations, pure \nand simple.\n  Some folks in Washington cited the overall success of agriculture in \n2006, the aggregate numbers, as justification for withholding \nassistance. Congress didn't look at the overall economy in determining \nwhat sort of assistance to give those affected by the great disaster in \nthe gulf. We didn't cite the Nation's robust GDP growth and low \nunemployment rate as a reason not to assist gulf communities whose \nlocal economies were devastated by natural disaster. Nor should we \npropose such a false standard for comprehensive agricultural disaster \nassistance.\n  It is true that the suffering in the gulf is great. I have seen the \ntremendous damage myself. I have come to this floor time and again to \nlend my hand to fellow Americans. I can't help but think of the 100-\nyear flood in the Red River Valley. Senator Dayton knows; he was there. \nWe saw neighbors fighting a flood together one sand bag at a time, \nregardless of whose house was closest to the water.\n  Your State might not be the closest to the flooding that occurred in \nmy State last year or the drought this year, but as a neighbor of mine, \na fellow American, I just ask you to help me fight the natural disaster \nbeing endured in Minnesota, the Dakotas, and other parts of this \ncountry. None in this body can build a dike on our own. Please allow \nthis assistance to go forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have been advised that an objection will \nbe raised when we make the request to go to this bill. I deeply regret \nthat. I cannot tell colleagues how deeply I regret that because we have \ntried to meet now every objection that has been raised.\n  We were told that the only objection left to this legislation was \nthat there were provisions that could conceivably help someone not \ndamaged by natural disaster, even though they had been damaged by the \nsharp runup of energy costs.\n  The legislation as previously passed by the Senate could aid those \nwho were not hurt by natural disaster. So we took out those provisions, \nwith a savings of $1.9 billion.\n  Now what is left are the most basic disaster provisions that have \nbeen provided by Congress in disaster after disaster. This is national \nlegislation; it is not regional. It is national. Nobody gets any \nassistance unless they have had at least a 35-percent loss. And if they \nhave had at least a 35-percent loss, they get no help for that first \n35-percent loss. They get nothing. Zero. It is only if they have had a \nloss of more than 35 percent that they get any help, and the assistance \nonly then applies to after they have had the loss of 35 percent. Once \nyou get beyond that, then assistance begins.\n  No one is made whole. No one is enriched. What people are given is a \nchance to make it to next year. That is what is in doubt.\n  The bankers of my State have told me that if there is a failure to \nprovide this kind of assistance, 5 to 10 percent of the producers in my \nState will be forced off the land. That is the reality of what we \nconfront.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending business be \nset aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I regret very much an objection has been \nraised. We have done everything we have been asked to do to alter this \nlegislation to meet the objections previously raised.\n  So I ask one more time, Mr. President: I ask unanimous consent that \nthe pending business be set aside.\n  Mr. GREGG. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator has that right. I regret that \nhe has exercised that right. What we have done on a bipartisan basis \nnow, 23 Senators have come endorsing this legislation on a fully \nbipartisan basis asking for help of the most basic sort. I must say, as \none Senator, if we can't get assistance in this kind of circumstance, \nwe are going to have to think long and hard when other colleagues come \nto us about assistance for their areas when they suffer disaster. \nAlways before we have responded in kind. We have helped those who have \nhad disaster, whether it is flood or hurricane or whatever disaster. \nAnd now we are told that a drought somehow is not worthy of assistance. \nI must say, I think it is shameful.\n\n[[Page S10569]]\n\n  The people are about to lose their livelihoods. We have done \neverything we have been asked to do to reduce the cost of this bill, \nand now we are told: Sorry, there is no help. We won't even consider \nit. We won't even allow a vote to occur because we know what would \nhappen if there was a vote. It would be overwhelmingly passed, as it \nhas been in the past when it was far more expensive than the bill we \ncome with today.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor \nto this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, the reason we know it would pass, I would \nsay to the gentleman, and I thank him for introducing this--and I am a \nlittle out of breath because I didn't realize we were debating this, so \nI ran over here. But at any rate, I thank my colleague for introducing \nthis bill.\n  The reason we know it would pass is it has already passed the Senate \nas part of the supplemental. It is about $4 billion. Everybody \nunderstood at that particular time we had an urgent need in farm \ncountry. Everybody understood at that particular time we had a lot of \nproblems with disasters, but as others have pointed out, if you have a \nhurricane, you get in the headlines. If you have a forest fire, you are \ngetting headlines. If you have those kinds of tragedies, like a flood \nor even a mudslide in a State where people build houses perhaps where \nthey shouldn't build them--obviously it attracts attention\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The gentleman's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be granted \nan additional 5 minutes. I know there are other Members waiting, but I \nwould like to at least proceed with the Senator, my friend, for another \n5 minutes, if that would be all right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that--I was to be \nthe next speaker for 15 minutes, so I ask that I be granted 20 minutes \non my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I wish to thank Senator Gregg for his generosity in \nregard to allowing me, with the gentleman yielding to me, to make some \nadditional comments.\n  I was saying that all of these tragedies end up in the headlines. We \nknow, and all of us who are privileged to represent rural areas, \nespecially the Plains, that we have had a drought not 1, not 2, but in \nsome cases 5 or 7 years in a row, and we know we don't have any subsoil \nmoisture. We also know energy prices have gone up 113 percent since \n2002. It isn't exactly that we were rolling in clover to begin with, \nbut now there is no clover that will come up.\n  We also know, although people may not want to talk about it right \nnow, that the current farm bill doesn't work in this circumstance. I \nvoted against the current farm bill. It is not my intent to come down \nhere and discuss the farm bill, however, there are some very real \nproblems. First, it is the countercyclical program. It means when a \nfarmer doesn't have a crop, he gets no payment. It also means he has no \nreal crop insurance because the average production history on his crop \ninsurance has gone down. So no crop insurance, no payment. High and \ndry. This is the only way we are going to provide assistance to \nfarmers.\n  Now, I regret it is the 11th hour and 59th minute. I fully expect an \nobjection. I hope that would not take place. But at any rate, we are \nbuilding a case that if we have to come back here during what is called \na lameduck session, something can be done. I credit the Senator for his \nleadership in this regard.\n  A drought is a drought is a drought, and it doesn't get much \nattention, but the people affected suffer just as much as people who \nsuffer from other tragedies. I again credit the Senator for bringing \nthis up. I am a cosponsor. Whatever we get done, I look forward to \nworking with him. We have done it in the past. We did it with the \nsupplemental. It was taken out in the House, by the way. We need this \nrelief, and we need it now.\n  As I said before, I will vote for the bill, and I will speak for it, \nas I have done. And quite frankly, if this is headed for a Presidential \nveto, I will vote to override it.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank very much the Senator from Kansas, \nthe former chairman of the House Agriculture Committee and a real \nleader on the Senate Agriculture Committee and my friend. I would \nadvise him that an objection has already been raised, so we are going \nto be denied even a chance to vote. I regret that and I regret that \ndeeply because I know what it means, after having been all across my \nState and having farmers tell me--some farmers who have been in the \nbusiness for more than 30 years who have told me this will be their \nlast year; to have had the bankers of my State come to Washington to \ntell me that if there is a failure to provide disaster assistance, 5 to \n10 percent of the farm and ranch families of my State will be put out \nof business. That is the harsh reality. And this afternoon, an \nobjection has been raised and raised in a way that will preclude us \nfrom even having a vote. I think we all know what would happen if a \nvote were held: this legislation would pass, and it would pass \noverwhelmingly.\n\n  We should advise our colleagues this will not be our last attempt. If \nthere is a lameduck session, we will be here and we will insist on the \nchance to have consideration for this legislation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 20 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me just follow up on the point that \nthis would be a bipartisan vote here in the Senate today. I want to \npoint out that the piece of legislation Senator Conrad has worked on \nand that I have added as an appropriations measure twice has passed the \nSenate. Twice I was in conference with that. Twice it was defeated in \nconference. I wish to make that point because the implication was the \nDepartment of Agriculture didn't have much to do with that. The fact is \nthe House conferees defeated this because the President threatened to \nveto it, and the House conferees were listening to the Department of \nAgriculture, which also opposed it.\n  Look, it seems to me we need the administration to understand what is \ngoing on here. This is bipartisan on the floor of the Senate. We need \nsome help downtown as well from the Department of Agriculture as well \nas the White House to get this done.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have been asked to ask unanimous consent \nthat Senator Clinton be given 15 minutes at the end of the current \nqueue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes. I have a unanimous consent request that following \nSenator Hutchison, who will follow me, the following Senators be \nrecognized in order: Senator Clinton for 15 minutes, Senator Chafee for \n5 minutes, Senator Kyl for 15 minutes, and Senator Byrd for up to 45 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask \nunanimous consent that I be recognized to speak on the bill I believe \nis before the Senate, the Secure Fence Act, for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized for 20 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10569-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10569-S10573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EFFECTS OF BUSH TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly on what is an \ninteresting point that I think needs to be made a few times because \nthere has been a bit of discussion in this Chamber and questions in the \npublic's mind as to how the President's tax cuts have affected the \neconomy and affected Americans.\n  If we were to listen to the mainstream press from the Northeast, for \nexample, or to the mainstream commentary and to our colleagues on the \nother side, you would think the President's tax cuts were basically a \nbenefit to the wealthy in America to the detriment to those who are not \nso wealthy. That is the basic theme--class\n\n[[Page S10570]]\n\nwarfare. That is what we hear day in and day out.\n  Well, the facts are in. The facts are in on the President's tax cuts, \nand they are very good for this country.\n  To begin with, let's put in context when those tax cuts occurred. At \nthe end of the Clinton administration, we had seen the largest economic \nbubble in the history of America. The stock market went up \ndramatically, way past real values, based on basically paper, as a \nresult of speculation around the Internet. That bubble collapsed, \nforcing us into a recession. That was followed by the attack of 9/11, \nwhich was not only a traumatic cultural event for us, involving a \nhorrific loss of life, it was also a huge economic attack on the \nAmerican economy. Those two things together should have thrown us into \nalmost a depression or certainly an extraordinarily severe recession.\n  But what happened in the middle of this was that the President \nsuggested cutting tax rates on all Americans. That tax cut came at just \nthe right time because it softened the blow of those two huge economic \nevents, those two extraordinarily recessionary events, and allowed the \neconomy to bottom-out in a shallower and less harmful way and start to \nmove back up dramatically. In fact, the practical effect of those tax \ncuts is the following because after 5 years, we know the facts, very \ninteresting facts.\n\n  No. 1, the revenue to the Federal Government has increased \ndramatically as a result of the tax cuts.\n  No. 2, interestingly enough, high-income Americans, the highest \nincome Americans, the top 20 percent of Americans in income are paying \na higher share--a higher share of American income--of the income tax \nburden of America than they did under the Clinton years.\n  No. 3, low-income Americans, those people who are in the bottom 20 \npercent who don't pay any income tax to begin with, are actually \ngetting back from the Government in the form of direct subsidy through \nsomething called the earned-income tax credit more money than they \nreceived in the Clinton years.\n  So you have the situation where the Federal share of revenue taken \nout of the economy is back to its historic level: 18.2 percent. So we \nhave a situation where the Government is getting more revenue, where \nthe tax laws are becoming more progressive, and where the economy \nrecovered, creating 5.7 million jobs.\n  Now, how did that happen, one might ask. How can we get more tax \nrevenues if we cut taxes? How can the high-income people in this \ncountry be paying a higher burden of the taxes if we cut taxes? The \nother side of the aisle rejects that concept. They say: You just have \nto keep raising taxes. Raise taxes, raise taxes; you always get more \nrevenue.\n  Well, it doesn't work that way. Something that--if you just think for \na moment, it is pretty obvious--is called human nature intervenes. If \nyou raise taxes to a level that people perceive is unfair, and \nespecially if they are high-income individuals, they can afford to, and \nthey do, figure out ways to avoid paying taxes by investing in things \nwhich give them deductions. So tax revenues don't go up dramatically if \nyou raise revenues. In fact, the way you raise revenues is by making \nthe tax burden fair. You make it fair so that high-income individuals \npay those taxes and are willing to go out and invest in activity which \ngenerates income, which is productive and actually creates jobs, which \nin turn generates economic activity, which in turn generates more \nrevenue to the Federal Government.\n  That is exactly what has happened as a result of the President's tax \ncuts. We are now at a fair tax burden, so people, rather than avoiding \ntaxes, are willing to pay taxes. People are now willing to invest in \ntaxable activity, and the Federal Government is benefiting from a \nrobust recovery, there is job creation, and more people are paying more \ntaxes, and the high-income people are paying even more in taxes.\n  I brought along a few charts to explain this more precisely. This \nchart reflects the fact that in the last 2 years--these are the \nrevenues to the Federal Government, and these are the increases in \nrevenues--in the last 2 years--this is the period when we had the \nInternet bubble and we had the 9/11 attacks, when the war began. This \nis where the tax cuts came into place. There was a dip in revenue as a \nresult of the recession, the Internet bubble, and the 9/11 attacks, and \nthen those tax cuts started to work, and people started to produce more \neconomic activity, make investments, create jobs. As a result, in the \nlast 2 years, we have the 2 highest years of increase in revenues of \nthe Federal Government in the history of our Government--the 2 highest \nyears. So there has been a big jump in revenues to the Federal \nGovernment, another result of which is that our deficit has dropped \nprecipitously. It has gone from a $450 billion estimate down to $270 \nbillion this year.\n  This chart reflects the fact that we are now back, after the \nrecessionary event--well, the blue line reflects the historical level \nof the percent of gross national product that is usually paid in taxes: \n18.1 percent. That is the blue line here. The black line represents how \nmuch we are spending as a government. The red line represents how much \nwe are receiving as a government. You can see it goes up and down.\n  What happened was, in the Internet bubble, when people were \nmanufacturing money basically through paper, there was a huge amount of \nrevenue generated as a result of mostly capital gains. But when that \nbubble collapsed and when we were hit with 9/11, the economy dropped, \nand the incomes dropped. Down here is where we made the tax cuts, and \nthen the economy started to come back. So now we are back at a \nhistorical level of revenues for the Federal Government. We are \nactually above the historical level right now. We are getting 18.2 \npercent of gross national product into the Federal Government.\n  A very interesting fact is that the high-income individuals in \nAmerica today--these are the different quadrants, the different groups, \npeople who make $15,000, people who make about $34,000, $51,000, \n$77,000. And then people making over $184,000--that is the high-end \nincome earner in America.\n  Those folks are now paying almost 85 percent, essentially 85 percent \nof the Federal income tax burden; the high-income Americans. That is a \npretty progressive system when you have the low-income people, those \nwith $34,000 or less, actually getting money back, and the high-income \nindividuals paying the top 20 percent paying 84 percent of the tax \nburden. That is called progressive taxation. That is after the tax \ncuts.\n  In fact, prior to the tax cuts, during the Clinton years--this is a \nchart of that top 20 percent--the high-income individuals during the \nClinton years were paying 81 percent of the taxes, whereas now, under \nthe Bush tax cut, they are paying 85 percent of the taxes. Again, I \npoint out, if you think about it, this is actually just common sense. \nIf you have a fair tax law, people who are in the high incomes, who \nhave the knowledge, the ability, and accountants to invest their money \nin a way that either pays taxes or doesn't pay taxes--if they believe \nthe tax burden is unfair, they are going to invest in a way that avoids \ntaxes. They are going to buy interest-free bonds or buy highly \ndepreciating assets. So they reduce their tax burden. But if you give \nthem a fair tax burden, they are going to do things that are taxable, \nand that is good for the Government and actually it makes the tax law \nmore progressive--a very important fact.\n  As I mentioned, low-income individuals under this President are \nactually getting a better deal now than they did at any time in the \nhistory of the country. This is the line, what low-income people pay. \nActually, it is a payment to them because this would be the line where \nthey would pay something. Since this President has become President, \nlow-income individuals are receiving more in direct payments as a \nresult of the earned-income tax credit and other credits which they \nreceive than they ever received before.\n  You can compare this to the Clinton years. Low-income people, the \nbottom 40 percent of earners in America, basically received about 1.5 \npercent back in payments to them. They weren't paying any taxes. Under \nPresident Bush's tax plan they are getting almost 3 percent back. So we \nhave created a tax system now which seems to be doing everything right \nin that it is generating a historical level of Federal taxes--how much \nwe should take out of\n\n[[Page S10571]]\n\nthe economy for Federal taxes; it is generating huge revenue for the \nFederal Government; the highest income people in America are paying by \nfar the greatest share of it, 85 percent, much more than they paid in \nthe Clinton years; and low-income Americans are getting a benefit from \nthe tax rebates which we give them at the highest level in history and \nabout twice what they got under the Clinton years.\n  Probably as important, if not most important, it has generated 18 \nconsecutive quarters of economic growth. This has led to almost 5.7 \nmillion new jobs--and having a good job is the key to economic \nprosperity.\n  What we have accomplished is pretty impressive with these tax cuts. \nYet we continue to hear them be vilified by the Democratic Party and \nour liberal colleagues. They just want to keep raising rates. They want \nto go back to the Clinton years when they would raise rates and thus \nreduce the amount of taxes that the high-income individuals would pay \nbecause they would invest in shelters or find ways to generate income \nthat were not as taxable. As a result, it also impacted low-income \npeople because under the Clinton years we actually had low-income \npeople getting less benefit. It probably significantly reduces this \neconomic recovery which is a direct result of the fact that there is a \ntax burden today which creates an incentive for the person who is \nwilling to take a risk, an entrepreneur, that person who has a great \nidea, that man or woman who says: I want to go start a restaurant. I \nhave an idea I want to try out to build and sell. That individual who \nis a risk taker and a job creator has a tax climate which says: If you \nare successful, we are going to give you a benefit. That would be \ncurtailed.\n  The other side of the aisle, my liberal colleagues, they want to \nraise the tax on capital. They want to raise the tax on dividends. They \nwant to raise the tax on income. All of those things are going to have \nthe practical effect of stifling economic growth, stifling revenues to \nthe Federal Treasury, and undermining the entrepreneurial spirit of \nAmerica and the effective use of capital, which is a bit of an economic \nargument, but it should be pointed out.\n  When you maintain a low tax burden on capital--capital being savings \nand things people are willing to invest with, money people are willing \nto invest--that money flows to its most efficient use. But if you put a \nhigh tax on capital and savings, people put it in places where it is \nnot efficiently used. They put it into tax shelters to put it in hard \nexample terms. If you are an entrepreneur and you are going to go out \nand start something and you have a 15-percent tax rate on capital, you \nare going to take a risk. You are maybe going to invest in building \nthat new software or that new computer technology system or starting \nthat new restaurant with that money. You are going to invest. But if \nyou have a 30-percent tax--which is what the Democratic Party and our \nliberal colleagues want to return to, on capital--you are going to say \nto yourself: I don't want to pay that much in taxes, so I am going to \ninvest in a tax shelter. I am going to invest in something that \nprobably doesn't make a whole lot of money, but at least it saves me \ntaxes.\n\n  It is not an efficient way to use money, and it is not an efficient \nway for an economy to run and it skews investment arbitrarily, which is \ntotally inappropriate and counterproductive and would certainly not \nlead to these types of numbers where you have economic growth for 18 \nquarters, where you have 5.7 million jobs created.\n  We have the Federal Treasury with the two largest tax revenue years, \ntwo largest years of revenue in the last 2 years, where you have the \nhighest income people in this country paying the largest share of \nFederal taxes in the history of the country, 85 percent; where you have \nthe lowest income people paying no taxes and actually getting more back \nas a result of credits and benefits under the tax law than at any time \nin history. And where you have an incentive, most important, for the \nentrepreneur, who is the essence of America's economic strength, to go \nout and take risks, invest, and create jobs.\n  The numbers are in. This hyperbole we hear from the other side of the \naisle--which is a function of 1950s-Galbraith-Harvard University \neconomics which says, if you just keep raising taxes on people you are \ngoing to get more revenue--a stake was put in that by John Kennedy when \nhe cut taxes. Another stake was put in that concept by Ronald Reagan \nwhen he cut taxes and got economic growth. And certainly the final \nstake has been put in it by the fact that we have cut taxes, we have a \nfair tax system now which incentivizes people to go out and be \nproductive and causes them to be willing to invest in things that \ngenerate revenue, thus creating jobs. So that idea doesn't work.\n  It only makes sense probably if you are a former theater critic who \nhappens to be an editorial writer for the New York Times. There is no \neconomic theory that can stand up any longer because it doesn't work. \nThe tax burdens, as are shown by the numbers in this country, are \npretty close to where they should be because we are generating huge \ngrowth, huge revenues, and we have an extraordinarily progressive \nsystem of taxation where the highest earners pay the most.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I didn't come to the floor to speak about \nour economic situation, but I get so inspired by my colleague from New \nHampshire that it is hard not to respond to at least a portion of it. \nLet me just make a comment about where we are with this economy of ours \nbecause the implication in the presentation was, boy, these tax cuts \nfor wealthy Americans really did help this country.\n  In 2004 the economy grew at 4.2 percent. Yet the median family income \nin this country fell and poverty increased. This is the first sustained \nperiod of economic growth since World War II that fails to provide real \nincome growth for the average working family in this country. The fact \nis, wages and salaries are now at a lower percent of the GDP in this \ncountry than they have been since they started keeping score in 1947; \nsome progress for working people.\n  I admit, the folks at the top of the ladder are doing really well \nbecause the economic program provided by the majority and by this \nPresident says ``let's provide the largest tax cuts to the wealthiest \nAmericans because we believe it will all trickle down someday to the \nrest of the American people.'' But, it will not and it has not and, \nregrettably, we now have a dramatic increase in indebtedness. We are \ngoing to borrow close to $600 billion in the coming year in budget \npolicy and $800 billion in trade deficits. That is a total of $1.4 \ntrillion in a $13 trillion economy. So, that puts us over 10 percent of \nred ink in a single year.\n  This is working real well? I'm sorry, that doesn't even pass remedial \neconomics. That is not why I came to the floor to speak, but it is hard \nto ignore cheerleading for an economic policy that has put this country \nup to its neck in debt, hurt working families, and enriched the most \nwealthy Americans.\n  I came to the floor today and asked for some time because I wanted to \ntalk about what I have been seeing in the newspapers and what I read \nthis morning in the newspaper. The President, yesterday, went on \nanother political trip, and the President, in Alabama, said that the \nparty of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the Democrats, are the cut-and-run \nparty. That follows Congressman Hastert, the Speaker of the House, \nsuggesting Democrats are coddling terrorists. That follows comments by \nthe majority leader of the House, Congressman Boehner, suggesting that \nDemocrats care more about terrorists than the American people.\n  This stuff is way beyond the pale. Cut and run, the President says? \nCut and run? What kind of talk is this? I don't understand that. Is \nsomeone in this Chamber suggesting that we cut and run someplace? Not \nthat I am aware of. Not one person I know of is suggesting we cut and \nrun.\n  But it would be worth us talking about whether our fight against \nterrorism is a fight that is tough and smart because I don't believe \nthe current fight is very tough or very smart.\n  You know, it is probably useful for us to review some history. So, \nlet me do a bit of that, since the President is suggesting that his \nparty is the party that\n\n[[Page S10572]]\n\nis muscular and the other party is weak.\n  Winston Churchill once said: The farther back you look, the farther \nforward you see.\n  Let's look back, August 6 in 2001. On August 6, 2001, the President \nreceived what is called a Presidential Daily Briefing which said that \n``Osama bin Laden was determined to strike in the United States.'' That \nwas the heading of the briefing received by the President: ``bin Laden \ndetermined to strike in U.S.''\n  Here is what the 9/11 Commission report said, and I will give you the \npage numbers. After that briefing to the President on August 6 of 2001, \n``bin Laden Determined to Strike in the U.S.,'' here is what the 9/11 \nCommission said they found, on page 260: The President, ``did not \nrecall discussing the August 6 report with the Attorney General, nor \ndid he recall whether his National Security Adviser, Condoleezza Rice, \nhad done so.''\n  On page 261, the 9/11 Commission found that the President's National \nSecurity Council never met to discuss the possible threat of a strike \nin the United States as a result of the PDB that said ``bin Laden \nDetermined to Strike in U.S.'' Imagine that, the President was told, on \nAugust 6, 2001, that ``bin Laden determined to strike in the United \nStates'' and nothing was done.\n  In fact, the 9/11 Commission found, on page 262, no indication of any \nfurther discussion before September 11 among the President and his top \nadvisers regarding the threat of an al-Qaida strike in the United \nStates.\n  The Director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, page 262, did not \nrecall any discussions with the President of the domestic threat in the \nweeks prior to 9/11.\n  Finally, it says this, page 265 of the \n9/11 Commission report:\n\n       In sum, the domestic agencies never mobilized in response \n     to the threat. They did not have direction, and did not have \n     a plan to institute. The borders were not hardened. \n     Transportation systems were not fortified. Electronic \n     surveillance was not targeted against a domestic threat. \n     State and local law enforcement were not marshaled to \n     implement the FBI's effort. The public was not warned.\n  Those are the facts of what was and was not done by the President and \nhis advisors after they were warned on August 6, 2001 that ``bin Laden \nwas determined to strike in the United States.'' Those are not my \nfacts, but the facts on the record from a bipartisan commission that \ninvestigated following the specific warning of August 6.\n  Now the President is saying, ``Cut and run.'' Let me describe a bit \nmore history. The President and his advisers also said there were \nweapons of mass destruction in Iraq. We now know they were not. There \nwere no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.\n  He said the aluminum tubes were being purchased to reconstitute \nnuclear capability in Iraq. We now know those who told us those were \nfacts knew that there were other facts at hand inside the \nadministration that disagreed with their conclusion, but they never saw \nfit to offer that to the Congress or the American people.\n  Mobile chemical weapons labs, we were told, were a significant \nthreat. The development of mobile chemical weapons labs in Iraq, we now \nknow, came from a fellow code-named ``Curve Ball.'' He was the only \nsource. One source. A man named ``Curve Ball,'' apparently someone who \nis probably an alcoholic and a fabricator. A single source tells this \ncountry there are mobile chemical weapons labs in Iraq, and this \ncountry, through the Secretary of State, tells the world that it's a \nfact. Yet, it turns out to be a fabrication. One source, a drinker and \na fabricator, told someone about it and it becomes part of this \ncountry's national dialog.\n  Yellowcake. I don't need to go much further about yellowcake from \nNiger which turns out not to have been true either, with forged \ndocuments, mind you.\n  And Mohammed Atta, one of the hijackers, in Prague, turns out not to \nhave been true.\n  As a result of all of that, the war on terrorism took a detour and we \nwent to Iraq. We are now in Iraq. Saddam Hussein was found in a rat \nhole. He is now on trial. Is that good? Sure, it is good. He was a \nrepressive, brutal dictator who murdered people. Sure, that is good \nthat he's out of power.\n  We are now in the middle of a civil war. Yes, we can describe it that \nway, probably a low-grade civil war, but a civil war in Iraq. That is \nwhere we have American troops stationed at present. And the President \njust says, stay the course. If anyone suggests, maybe we ought to have \na discussion about being smarter and tougher in winning that war, the \nPresident says you believe in cutting and running. Being at war \ndeserves thoughtful debate, thoughtful debate about how to win that \nwar, about the detour from the war on terror. Just saying cutting and \nrunning, that is thoughtless debate, in my judgment.\n  Stay the course? Stay the course? How? Where? When? For what? The \nfact is, it is a mess. We have ourselves in a mess. We cannot pull \nAmerican troops out of Iraq. None of my colleagues, I believe, have \nsuggested we should. None that I am aware of have suggested we should.\n  But stay the course? Shouldn't we be smarter, tougher, more \neffective, and make course corrections when necessary? Course \ncorrections that will give this country a chance to succeed rather than \nfail? We have debates about wiretapping in the context of all of this \nbecause the President has decided he is going to speak about Iraq in \nthe same context as the war on terrorism. Of course, they are \ndifferent. They are related somewhat now because we went to Iraq, but \nthey were different. So the President talks about wiretapping. I am for \nwiretapping conversations between al-Qaida and the United States.\n  I say, wiretap, eavesdrop, find out what terrorists are saying. But \nno President, no Republican and no Democratic President, ought to have \nthe right to indiscriminate eavesdrop and wiretap on all Americans.\n  We do not even know what this has been about. We do not know how \nextensive it has been. We don't know how many Americans have been \nlistened to, how many records have been looked at. Yes, let's wiretap \nand find out what al-Qaida operatives are saying in telephone calls. \nLet's also protect the basic liberties of this country as we do so.\n  Last week, we had three people testify before a policy committee \nhearing, with a combined service to this country of over 100 years. \nThey were all combat veterans from Iraq. They led our troops. Two \ngenerals, two-two star generals and a colonel. One of the two star \ngenerals was offered a promotion to a third star and had a bright \npromising future, but he turned it down and resigned. He did that \nbecause he could no longer serve under the Secretary of Defense and \nfollow a flawed strategy and policy.\n  Here is just one example of what they said. They repeatedly asked for \nmore troops in Iraq. As commanders of their units they repeatedly asked \nfor more troops and repeatedly were turned down.\n  That is at odds with what we, all of America, were told all along the \nway by GEN. Tommy Franks and General Myers. That is also at odds with \nwhat General Pace has stated standing next to Secretary Rumsfeld and \nstanding next to President Bush. These Iraq combat veterans said we \nrepeatedly asked for more troops. We needed more troops to finish the \njob and do the job, to prevent the growth of the insurgents in Iraq, \nand we were repeatedly denied. That is at odds with everything the \nAmerican people have been told.\n  That's not all. Body armor? A young man told me he signed up to go to \nIraq, felt it was his duty after 9/11, quit school to do it, and when \nhe gets there his mother, an elementary schoolteacher, had to go online \non the Internet to purchase body armor to send to her son in Iraq.\n  Colonel Hammas said, we know we have better armored vehicles to \nprotect our soldiers than the up-armored Humvees. We know we have \nbetter armored vehicles. We have already produced 1,000 of them. Why \nare we not mass producing those vehicles? At the end of World War II we \nwere producing 50,000 airplanes a year to support that war. This \ncountry mobilized and said, we are in a war, we are going to win it, we \nare going to produce what is necessary to support our troops, to \nprotect our troops. Right now, we have better armored vehicles, but we \nare not producing them. We have not marshalled this country to fight \nthis war, to protect our troops, to win. We have not mobilized this \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S10573]]\n\n  Don't believe me, talk to the generals who have been there, who now \nare risking their reputations by being willing to speak out now on \nbehalf of the troops who can't speak, who can't tell us these facts.\n  There is an old saying, ``A lie travels halfway around the world \nbefore the truth gets its shoes on.'' But finally the truth is getting \nfully dressed. We need the truth and the facts to understand what this \ncountry confronts. This country has great capabilities. We should be \none nation indivisible. We are not these days. There is too much \nshouting. There are too many slogans like cut and run.\n  We should be one nation as we confront this terrorism that threatens \nour country. We should be one nation as we search for ways to deal with \nthe conflict in Iraq and to protect American soldiers who are there on \nbehalf of their country.\n  Most importantly, we need to be tough and smart as we take on these \nchallenges. This is a new war, a different war, the war against \nterrorism and the circumstances that our troops find themselves in, in \nIraq, fighting a war against an insurgency that doesn't wear uniforms. \nThis requires us to be smart and tough, requires us to change tactics \nand strategy when necessary and to have a national discussion about how \nwe succeed as a country.\n  Yet this President will hear none of it. He will not hear and he will \nnot listen. He is content to go to Alabama and say that those who \nopenly question anything he does are people who suggest we should cut \nand run. I regret that.\n  What we need to do, it seems to me, is to accept advice from some of \nthe best minds in this country. Bring people together, Republicans and \nDemocrats, conservatives and liberals, academics and others, bring them \ntogether and let's get the best of what everyone has to offer instead \nof the worst of each.\n  Let's bring people together in this country. Let's stop this \nnonsense, one side is coddling terrorists, one side wants to cut and \nrun. That is a playbook we have heard before. It is tired. It is limp. \nIt makes no sense. It divides this country.\n  I ask the President, the Speaker of the House, the majority leader of \nthe House and others, stop this sort of thing. Let's join together and \nwork together to find ways to solve problems; to, as I said, be smart \nand tough in ways to defeat terrorists, take on these terrorists as one \nnation.\n  If I sound upset by what I read in the paper today, I am. I don't \nthink it is worthy of the kind of debate we ought to experience in this \ncountry.\n  We have seen it twice leading up to the last two elections. We saw \nthe fellow who lay on a battlefield losing one arm and two legs \nbleeding for his country. We saw him tarnished in television \ncommercials. Political commercials equated him with Osama bin Laden, \nquestioning his courage and commitment to his country. It made a lot of \npeople sick to see that sort of thing.\n  Maybe we can have a national debate that elevates the discussion of \nthis country a bit. Maybe we can have a national debate that sets a \nlittle higher tone. I hope so. We can agree that this country is in a \ntough fight, one we need to win. We will not win this fight if we have \nthese kind of political tactics continued again, one more time, the \nnext 30 days before the election, the third election in a row \nquestioning someone's patriotism, questioning someone's commitment to \ntheir country.\n  They did that even with the generals. The general, the two-star \ngeneral who refused a third star and resigned instead, who commanded \nthe first infantry division in Iraq, had his commitment to his country \nquestioned. Why? Because he had the temerity to speak out, to say, ``I \nwas there. I was leading my troops, I was asking for more troops and I \nwas turned down.'' People need to know that.\n  We shouldn't be questioning the motives or patriotism of people who \nhave committed themselves to their country, who have dedicated their \nlives to their country, our country.\n  Let's elevate this debate. Let's come together. Let's act as one \nAmerica. And let's fight these terrorist groups. Let's succeed and \nprevail, together.\n  Yes, let's find a way to accomplish our objectives in Iraq. Let's do \nthat. If it takes more troops, let's do that. If it takes a different \nstrategy, if it takes changing the course, let's do that.\n  But let's do it together. Let's not get on Air Force One and go to a \nState six or eight States away and suggest that your political \nadversaries want to cut and run. That hardly serves thoughtful debate \nin this country. This country deserves better. Democrats and \nRepublicans need to come together and speak out and speak up for the \ninterests of this country.\n  But, to do that, we have to listen to each other. We have to listen \nto people like the generals. We have to listen to people who might \ndisagree with us. We can't be stubborn. That's the only way, together, \nwe will win against the terrorists.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized, under \nthe previous order, for 15 minutes.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10573-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10573-S10575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RYAN WHITE CARE ACT\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. In 1990, Congress enacted a law that has been a vital \npart of our national strategy to fight AIDS and HIV, the Ryan White \nCARE Act, which directs support and resources to the people and places \nmost in need throughout our Nation.\n  It was an incredible act of compassion, smart decisionmaking, and \nbipartisanship. Members in this Chamber put aside politics, recognized \nthe seriousness of the crisis, and took action.\n  How far we have come. Unfortunately, though, the recent debate around \nthe Ryan White CARE Act has been marred by misconceptions and mired in \npolitics. It is time to set the record straight.\n  First, some of my colleagues have alleged that New York receives more \nfunding per case than the national average, suggesting that New York is \nsomehow getting more than its fair share. But the numbers I heard being \nused on the Senate floor yesterday only represented part of the funding \nunder the Ryan White CARE Act, skewing the data to make a political \npoint.\n  When you look at the whole picture and see the funding under the \nwhole bill, the story is very different.\n  According to an analysis prepared by the Communities Advocating for \nEmergency AIDS Relief Coalition, the CAEAR Coalition--as seen on this \nchart--the national per case allocation for people with AIDS is $4,745.\n  Here is the State-by-State breakdown. New York is by no means at the \ntop. This analysis does not even account for the higher cost of living \nand treatment in my State.\n  Some of my colleagues have cried foul saying they get far less per \nperson with AIDS than New York. I heard my friends and colleagues from \nWyoming and Alabama making that point. But here are the facts, and they \nsay otherwise.\n  When you look at all of the titles under the Ryan White CARE Act, \nWyoming and Alabama actually receive more per person with AIDS than New \nYork and more than the national average. The difference between \nOklahoma and New York is about $100 per person living with AIDS. And, \nagain, these numbers do not account for differences in costs.\n  Second, there are those making misleading statements about my State, \nthat we misuse funding, or do not use the funding we receive, claims \nthat are simply not true. Some have even asserted that New York has \nallowed dog walking to count under the CARE Act.\n  Well, let me set the record straight. New York is not using Federal \ndollars for such services. And to point fingers and make such \noutlandish assertions impugns my State and is profoundly unfair to the \nthousands of New Yorkers who rely each and every day on the CARE Act \nfor treatment and needed services.\n  New York has been audited by the HHS--the Health and Human Services--\ninspector general. They said New York complies with all requirements \nand is not misspending or mismanaging its funds.\n  Another specious claim is that New York is somehow not even using the \nfunds we receive, that we retain surpluses every year. Well, being \nfiscally responsible is good management.\n\n[[Page S10574]]\n\n  In New York, a tiny percentage of unspent funds is carried from one \nyear to the next. This year, New York carried about $3 million over, \nrepresenting about 3 days' worth of expenses. That is exactly what I \nwant States to do--manage resources wisely and avoid interruptions in \ncare or create waiting lists. I don't believe sound fiscal management \nis something to denigrate.\n  Third, we are having a debate now over a shrinking pot of funding, at \na time when I absolutely agree that more and more States have greater \nand greater needs. But to argue about the formula instead of arguing \nabout the program and what it needs to be funded appropriately seems \nlike a diversion. We are having a formula fight when we should be \nfocused on fixing our strategy and strengthening our funding to meet \nthe growing challenge and crisis of HIV/AIDS in America. That is the \nreal debate we should be having on the floor of the Senate.\n  Here is a chart that shows the increase of people living with HIV/\nAIDS in the United States. That is this red line here. It shows the \ndecline in funding for title I of the CARE Act. So you can see the \ndisparity. I have a great deal of sympathy for my friends from States \nthat are just realizing the full extent of the AIDS crisis in their \ncommunities, who are deeply concerned by the fast-growing number of \nsuch cases among poor women and among our African-American and Hispanic \npopulations. But here is part of the reason we are in this dilemma. \nHere is the number of AIDS cases, and here is the amount of funding \navailable to deal with them.\n  Instead of honoring our moral obligation, instead of strengthening \nour efforts as the epidemic continues to grow, State and local agencies \nand community groups have been forced to do more with less. This is \nespecially true in New York, the State that has been hardest hit by the \nAIDS epidemic. Back in the 1980s and 1990s, people were moving from \nother States to be able to come to New York, where they thought \nsomebody would care enough to try to take care of them. And New York \nstill leads the Nation in both the number of overall HIV/AIDS cases as \nwell as the number of new HIV infections each year.\n  What is this fight about? Well, I will tell you. New York stands to \nlose more than $78 million in funding over the next 5 years. We would \nsee New York City alone lose $17 million next year. But we know who \nwould really lose--the patients whose health and lives are on the line.\n  With the exception of the AIDS Drug Assistance Program--which still \ndoesn't go nearly far enough, given the long waiting list for the \npoorest and sickest of those who cannot afford the drugs they need to \nstay healthy and alive--the CARE Act has been cut over the past 3 \nyears, even as costs and the number of people with the virus have \nrisen, adding to the pressure on New York, New Jersey, and other States \nwith higher costs of living and the largest numbers of people living \nwith HIV/AIDS.\n  In addition, the Ryan White CARE Act is the payer of last resort; it \nis the safety net for the safety net. And this Congress and the \nadministration have spent years trying to cut big holes in both. In \nfact, the CARE Act is only part of the strategy against this terrible \ndisease. The Medicaid Program serves nearly half of those living with \nHIV/AIDS in America. This Republican Congress and the Republican \nadministration have tried time and time again to cut Medicaid and have \nsucceeded in passing drastic reductions.\n  I have introduced bipartisan legislation with my colleague, Senator \nGordon Smith, the Early Treatment for HIV Act. This legislation would \nprovide Federal funding to extend Medicaid eligibility to low-income \nAmericans living with HIV before they develop symptoms, allowing them \nto access life-extending medical services.\n  There are those suggesting that somehow the epidemic has changed, \ntrying to pit one part of the country against another, trying once \nagain to divide us. My Republican colleagues have told me there is not \nenough money to prevent cutbacks for New York and other States that \nlose under this proposed formula. Nine States, plus Puerto Rico, lose, \nand every other State makes gains. So, in effect, you want to take \nmoney away from my 100,000 people living with HIV/AIDS and give it to \nworthy people in other parts of the country because this administration \nand this Congress won't put more money into funding treatment programs \nfor HIV/AIDS.\n  My colleagues on the other side still refuse to provide us with a \nguarantee--at a time when the epidemic continues to grow--that New York \nand other States facing losses will not lose out, a guarantee meant to \nmake sure people dying with AIDS have the treatment they need.\n  The White House and Republican leadership in the Congress are \ncynically pressuring many of my colleagues that if they don't \nreauthorize the bill this year, they will face cuts in funding next \nyear. But approving a fundamentally flawed bill, under pressure, that \nwill end up hurting people living with HIV/AIDS is the wrong thing to \ndo. We should be working to strengthen the CARE Act for everyone.\n  I will also address the question of the expanding epidemic. There is \nno doubt that it is growing--40,000 new HIV infections occur every year \nin the United States, and they have a disproportionate impact on people \nof color. In my State, African Americans account for 45 percent of the \ntotal population living with HIV/AIDS, while Hispanics account for an \nadditional 29 percent of the cases. But this bill cuts funding for both \nof them. Groups such as the National Minority AIDS Council, the \nHispanic Federation, and the Latino Commission on AIDS have expressed \nconcern over these cuts which would limit access to care for far too \nmany people of color and people of modest, limited means.\n  We are also seeing the infection rate rising among women. In New York \nalone, over 30,000 women are living with HIV/AIDS. Women would also be \nshortchanged under the latest version of the CARE Act. Indeed, the \nversion of the bill my colleagues want to bring up would flat-fund what \nis called title IV--the very program designed to address the needs of \nwomen, infants, and children, the populations so many have come to this \nfloor and spoken about so eloquently.\n  Let's put our money where our mouth is. Let's put money into this \nprogram so we are not picking between a poor African American in New \nYork City and a poor African-American woman in Alabama.\n  The epidemic is spreading. When people talk about the South, they are \ntalking not only about Alabama and North Carolina but Washington, DC, \nTexas, Florida, and Maryland, which are the places that have been the \nhardest hit by this epidemic. Texas and Florida alone account for about \n20 percent of people living with AIDS. Yet Florida, too, would lose \nmoney under this proposal.\n  If we decide to meet the growing AIDS epidemic in our Nation, I hope \nwe can look at the facts about how the program works now and try to \ncome to a bipartisan solution that covers the entire country's needs \nand leads to a real solution, not a political one. We know there are \nsolutions. Those of us representing the States that are going to be \ngiving up money so money can be shifted to take care of other people \nwho are worthy and deserve help have proposed solutions.\n  This is not about politics. This is about how we help people. My \ncolleagues from New York, New Jersey, Illinois, and Florida have \nproposed a 1-year extension for the Ryan White CARE Act. So let's \nextends it for a year and figure out how we can fix it. I think we \ncould raise the authorization levels across the titles by 3.7 percent \nand set up a grant program to address unmet needs of States that do not \nreceive title I funding in order to address the challenge in rural \nareas where HIV incidence has also increased. Our proposal would delay \npenalties for those who cannot meet the HIV reporting requirements and \ngive them time to come into compliance with the CDC.\n  As a Senator from New York, which has experienced the heaviest burden \nof the AIDS epidemic, I don't think anyone cares more about this \nlegislation. I understand completely the profound importance of the \nRyan White CARE Act. I am committed to the reauthorization of a good \nbill that strengthens and improves the ability of all Americans to \naccess HIV/AIDS care, support, and treatment. But a bill that \ndestabilizes existing systems of care and\n\n[[Page S10575]]\n\ndevastates, even destroys, the ability of high-prevalence communities \nto address needs is unacceptable.\n  I stand ready to work with my colleagues on a fair, openminded, \nnonpartisan, practical solution--in the spirit of the original bill \nthat brought people together to develop a strategy to combat this \nhorrible epidemic that has caused so much death and destruction, \ndestroyed so many lives, created such a challenge to our health care \nsystem and our basic values.\n  Mr. President, we can do this if we really want to. All it takes is \nnarrowing the gap between these two lines on the chart--HIV/AIDS cases \nand the amount of funding available. Some of the priorities on which we \nare asked to vote in this Chamber certainly don't reflect the pressing \nneeds I have heard described in this Chamber. I hope we can come up \nwith a real solution for the Ryan White CARE Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a disease that \nhas touched many American families. Breast cancer is the second leading \ncause of cancer deaths among American women. More women are living with \nbreast cancer than any other cancer.\n  Three million women are living with breast cancer in the United \nStates, 2 million of which have been diagnosed and 1 million who don't \nknow they have the disease. Over 40,000 women will have died from \nbreast cancer this year alone. It is the leading cause of cancer deaths \namong women between the ages of 20 and 59.\n  What is the Senate doing about breast cancer? Some of you may know \nthat I have a bill, S. 757, the Breast Cancer and Environmental \nResearch Act. This bill was first introduced on March 23, 2000, in the \n106th Congress. Since that time, the bill has been introduced in the \n107th Congress, where it had 44 bipartisan cosponsors and was on the \nverge of being included in the Women's Health Act of 2002 when \nnegotiations broke down. In the 108th Congress, the bill again had \ntremendous bipartisan support, with 60 cosponsors. But again we did not \nact on the bill, which brings me to the current situation in the 109th \nCongress.\n  The bill now has 66 bipartisan cosponsors in the Senate and 255 \ncosponsors in the House. Thanks to the support and leadership of \nChairman Michael Enzi of the HELP Committee, this bill was reported \nunanimously by the committee on July 24, 2006. The bill was hotlined \nfor floor consideration before the August recess, but it has not \nreceived Senate passage.\n  We as a Senate are denying millions of American women diagnosed with \nbreast cancer the answers that might lead to a better understanding and \nperhaps a cure to this disease.\n  How can a bill with 66 cosponsors that was reported unanimously by \nthe HELP Committee not be taken up and approved by the Senate?\n  This bill provides a targeted strategy and a long-term research \ninvestment needed to explore the links between the environment and \nbreast cancer. Millions of women who are afflicted with breast cancer \ndeserve the answers this legislation could yield.\n  I urge my colleagues to work with me to remove any obstacles and \nsecure passage of the Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On behalf of another Senator, in my personal \ncapacity as a Senator from the State of Louisiana, I object.\n  There is objection heard.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I join my colleague in expressing great \nregret that once again the women of America have been blocked from \nhaving the additional help that this bill would provide.

Mr. President, I shall not take that much time, but I do \nthink it is important to speak to the issue before us, which is \nadoption of the House bill which takes another step toward securing our \nborder. This is something the American people have been wanting us to \ndo for a long time.\n  What we will also be doing today, in fact, some of our actions in the \npast weeks have also supplemented, is to pass the money, the \nappropriations bills that we need to fund all of the things that we \nneed to be doing to secure the borders. I will speak to both of those \nitems.\n  The key to the House bill is to state a commitment that we are going \nto put the kind of infrastructure on the border that we need to secure \nthe border. It starts with fencing, but it doesn't end with fencing. It \nincludes vehicle barriers because much of the illegal entry into the \nUnited States now is accomplished by vehicles. It includes technology, \nsuch as cameras and sensors and other means of identifying people who \nare crossing our border illegally.\n  Some people say that we don't need a fence or these infrastructure \nbarriers because someday we are going to adopt comprehensive \nimmigration reform, and when we take away the magnet of illegal \nemployment, then we are not going to have the problem anymore. That is \nmy fervent hope with respect to the people who cross the border to gain \nemployment here. But the sad reality is that even if we solve that \nproblem--and we haven't gotten very far down the road because we \nhaven't adopted comprehensive immigration reform yet--even if we were \nto accomplish that in the future, we still have a very high percentage \nof people coming across the border whom we don't want here no matter \nwhat.\n  What am I speaking of? I am speaking of drug dealers, drug cartel \nmembers, gang members, and criminals, people wanted for crime, people \nwho have committed crime, much of it very serious crime. As a matter of \nfact, before the subcommittee I chair on terrorism and homeland \nsecurity, the head of the Border Patrol testified a few months ago that \nover 10 percent of the people apprehended for crossing our border \nillegally have criminal records, and many of these are serious criminal \nrecords.\n  In fact, the statistics for this fiscal year, which is almost over, \nshow that the percentage is closer to about 13 to 14 percent, and of \nthose a significant number have committed serious crimes.\n  Here are the statistics year to date: Over 1 million illegal \nimmigrants have been apprehended on the southwest border. Of that \nnumber, almost half have come through Arizona, the Yuma and Tucson \nsectors, so far about 475,000. And of the illegal immigrants \napprehended crossing our border to date in this fiscal year, 141,000-\nplus have criminal histories. Of that number, well over 20,000 are \nconsidered to have committed major crimes such as homicide, kidnapping, \nsexual assault, robbery, assault, dealing in dangerous drugs, and the \nlike.\n  A fence, barriers to illegal entry into this country are important \nnot just to ensure that we enforce our laws with respect to employment \nbut to keep out people who would do our citizens harm. The papers in my \nState are full of stories every week of people who came to this country \nillegally and then committed crimes on citizens of the United States \nand on other illegal immigrants. It is not at all uncommon to see \nstories\n\n[[Page S10576]]\n\nof crimes committed against people who just came here for a better way \nof life but who were assaulted, who were robbed, who were kidnapped for \nmore ransom so their families back home would have to pay money to \nthese coyotes, or kidnappers, and all manner of heinous crime that we \nhave to stop, we have to prevent. And the best way to do that is to \nhave barriers to illegal entry into this country.\n  I mentioned vehicle barriers. Fencing is important and this \nlegislation from the House requires the Department of Homeland Security \nto begin building fences. I talked with the Secretary this morning. \nThat project has already started. They are well on their way in \nconstructing fencing, and we will be appropriating the money for even \nmore of that construction in the future.\n  But we also have to put up vehicle barriers because more and more now \nwith the territory contested, the illegal entry into this country \neither to bring drugs in or the human smugglers to bring their cargo, \nas they call it, requires the use of vehicles.\n  Here is the problem from the Border Patrol perspective. When they see \na vehicle, they know they have trouble because it is a more valuable \ncargo. One can carry more in a vehicle than in a backpack and, \ntherefore, it is more valuable and they are probably going to protect \nit. If they are going to protect it, it is probably going to be \nwith weapons.\n\n  The number of assaults on the border are up dramatically--108 percent \nlast year according to the U.S. attorney for the District of Arizona. \nThe reason for that is that the Border Patrol is finally beginning to \ngain control of parts of the border. They are contesting the territory \nof the drug cartels and the coyotes and dangerous gangs from places \nsuch as El Salvador. As a result, there is much more violence, and it \nis causing real problems for the Border Patrol.\n  That is the bad news with the good news. We are gaining more \nterritory, more control, but with that comes more violence. Eventually, \nof course, the control will be consolidated and the violence will go \ndown. But the point is that it is important we demonstrate to the \nAmerican people that we are serious about gaining control of our \nborder, and it can't be done without more fencing.\n  Let me describe just a little bit what we mean by this fencing \nbecause there is some misinformation about it. In Arizona right now in \nthe urban areas south of Yuma, around San Louis, in Nogales, Douglas, \nand some of the smaller communities, there is some fencing. Much of it \nis a very old and ugly barrier. It is steel plates that were used in \nWorld War II and, I suppose, Vietnam for landing mats in the jungle to \nmake temporary landing strips for aircraft.\n  They stand those steel plates on end and imbed them in concrete. It \nis a very ugly wall. You can't see through it, obviously, and that is a \nproblem for the Border Patrol. They would like to see who is massing on \nthe other side and what is going on so they can prevent it.\n  Part of the money we will be appropriating will be to replace that \nwall. It is hard to maintain it, and it is better to build with more \nmodern technologies, sensors embedded in them, and the like. Part of \nthis will be to replace this deteriorating and ugly fencing. Another \nwill be to imbed sensors in the fence so when we have fencing 20, 30 \nmiles outside a community--most of the fencing is in the urban areas \nwhere most of the people are. But if we extend it to some of the \nsmuggling corridors, let's say 20 miles outside of town, we are also \ngoing to want to get the Border Patrol to a site of a breakthrough or \nan attempted crossover of the fence.\n  No fence is impervious to people getting through if they have enough \ntime and equipment. That is the key. It slows them down. What we have \nto have is Border Patrol units that can get to anyplace along the fence \nin a reasonable period of time, perhaps 10, 15 minutes, or else it will \nnot do any good. If the fence is being tampered with or someone is \ntrying to go over or under it and the Border Patrol is no more than, \nsay, 10 minutes away, that fence stops people long enough for the \nBorder Patrol to get to the site and either prevent the illegal entry \nor apprehend the people coming in.\n  So we have to have Border Patrol along with fencing, and that means \nwe also have to increase Border Patrol. What are we doing in that \nregard? We are appropriating enough money for another 1,500 Border \nPatrol this year, which will take us up to well over 14,000, \napproaching 15,000, and that is another critical component of this \nlegislation.\n  Vehicle barriers, fencing, sensors, Border Patrol units, and in those \nplaces where it doesn't make sense to have a physical fence, we can \nhave cameras--one person stationed in a control room which can monitor \nmaybe 20 different cameras, and any time they see people massing on the \nother side of the border, they can simply call up the Border Patrol in \nthe area closest, making sure they get to that site in time to \napprehend the individuals crossing illegally or to prevent the \ncrossing.\n  All of this can be done. We simply need to appropriate the money and \nto grant the authority and the direction to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to get the job done.\n  I am advised by the Secretary that this fencing is already under \nconstruction and that he can move to a much more aggressive schedule. \nObviously, we need to do it in a cost-effective way, and he needs to \nhave the discretion of sequencing what fencing goes where when, when \nvehicle barriers are better than fencing, or cameras would do the job, \nand so forth.\n  With the direction of Congress to get this done, and his commitment \nto get it done, I am persuaded we can make a big dent in getting \ncontrol of our borders. That is what we committed to the American \npeople we are going to do.\n  The key point I want to say today is that I am going to be very \npleased when we are able to adopt this legislation. No one should think \nthat it is the end; rather, it is the end of the beginning. The \nbeginning step is to secure the border, and with this direction, with \nthis bill, we will have nailed in place the direction to the Department \nof Homeland Security. If we continue to adopt the appropriations that \nwe have begun to adopt to spend the money on all the different items I \ntalked about, if we put our money where our mouth is--and we are doing \nthat--then we will be able to demonstrate to the American people that \nwe care, that we have answered the basic question that they always ask \nme, which is: Why should we adopt some new legislation when the Federal \nGovernment isn't enforcing the laws we have? This demonstrates to them \nthat we are enforcing the laws we have, that we are committed to that \nenforcement. Then we can go to the American people and ask for their \nsupport and their consensus on the next step, which will be \ncomprehensive immigration reform to deal with the problem of illegal \nhiring, to have electronic verification of employment, to have a \ntemporary worker program that really works because it is for temporary \nemployment only, not permanent employment, and finally, to deal with \nthe illegal immigrants who are here already.\n  All of those items need to be done, and the sooner we get about it \nthe better. But the place to start is by securing the border, and the \nplace to start with that is the construction of fencing and other \nbarriers to prevent illegal entry.\n  I am pleased the House has passed the bill. I am pleased that we are \ngoing to be passing the bill tonight. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis measure whenever the hour comes that we actually get to vote on \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is my understanding this is the \nminority's time. Senator Byrd is coming to the floor, and they \ngraciously granted me time to talk.\n  I wish to address a couple of issues that were raised by the Senator \nfrom New York as to the accuracies of the claims that have been made. I \nthink it is real important.\n  I don't doubt for a minute that she genuinely cares for everybody who \nhas HIV in this country. I think she does. I think her perspective on \nthe challenges that face us as a nation in terms of finances is \ndifferent from mine, and I will grant her that as well. But some of the \nclaims made are not really accurate.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an article from the \nNew\n\n[[Page S10577]]\n\nYork Times stating specifically money was spent on walking dogs for \nHIV/AIDS patients, art classes, tickets to Broadway shows, free legal \nservices, haircuts, things that other people can't do in any other \nplace other than New York and California.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [The New York Times, November 12, 1997]\n\n              New Challenge to Idea That `AIDS Is Special'\n\n                        (By Sheryl Gay Stolberg)\n\n       Behind the swinging glass doors that welcome visitors to \n     the Gay Men's Health Crisis is a world where H.I.V. is not \n     just a deadly virus, but also a ticket to a host of unusual \n     benefits.\n       At the center, the nation's oldest and largest AIDS social-\n     service agency, almost everything is free: hot lunches, \n     haircuts, art classes and even tickets to Broadway shows. \n     Lawyers dispense advice free. Social workers guide patients \n     through a Byzantine array of Government programs for people \n     with H.I.V., and on Friday nights dinner is served by \n     candlelight.\n       The philosophy underlying the niceties and necessities is \n     ``AIDS exceptionalism.'' The idea, in the words of Mark \n     Robinson, executive director of the organization, is that \n     ``AIDS is special and it requires special status.'' That is a \n     concept that has frequently been challenged by advocates for \n     people with other diseases.\n       Now some advocates for people with AIDS are quietly \n     questioning it themselves.\n       With death rates from the disease dropping for the first \n     time in the history of the 16-year-old epidemic, the \n     advocates suggest, it is time to re-examine the vast network \n     of highly specialized support services for people with H.I.V. \n     Some people are growing increasingly uncomfortable with the \n     fact that the Government sets aside money for doctors' \n     visits, shelter and drugs for people with AIDS but that it \n     does not have comparable programs for other diseases.\n       ``Why do people with AIDS get funding for primary medical \n     care?'' Martin Delaney, founder of Project Inform, a group in \n     San Francisco, asked in an interview. ``There are certainly \n     other life-threatening diseases out there. Some of them kill \n     a lot more people than AIDS does. So in one sense it is \n     almost an advantage to be H.I.V. positive. It makes no \n     sense.''\n       Mr. Delaney, a prominent voice in AIDS affairs since the \n     onset of the epidemic, is calling on advocates to band with \n     people working on other diseases in demanding that programs \n     for AIDS be replaced with a national health care system.\n       He complained that organizations like the Gay Men's Health \n     Crisis had been ``bought off'' by the special status given to \n     AIDS.\n       ``We took our money and our jobs,'' Mr. Delaney wrote in \n     the Project Inform newsletter in the summer, ``and we dropped \n     out of the national debate.''\n       That criticism has not won many fans within ``AIDS Inc.,'' \n     as some call the cottage industry of agencies that care for \n     H.I.V. patients. But Mr. Delaney's article, ``The Coming \n     Sunset on AIDS Funding Programs,'' has set off an intense \n     debate.\n       ``I think Delaney knows that he is putting out a \n     provocative, stimulating kind of discussion,'' said Jim \n     Graham, executive director of the Whitman-Walker Clinic in \n     Washington, a counterpart to Gay Men's Health Crisis. ``This \n     is the whole discussion about AIDS exceptionalism. I think \n     AIDS is an exceptional situation. AIDS is caused by a virus. \n     That infectious virus is loose in America. And when you have \n     a virus, an infectious situation such as this, it takes an \n     exceptional response.''\n       Yet many people involved with AIDS say some change is in \n     order. Many programs created in response to the epidemic were \n     intended as stopgaps, to help the dying in the health \n     emergency. Some of the money that pays for free lunches at \n     Gay Men's Health Crisis, for instance, is from the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency, which usually works on natural \n     disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes.\n       But it is becoming clear that the AIDS crisis is long term. \n     New treatments appear to be turning the disease from a \n     certain death sentence to a chronic manageable illness. \n     Accepting the projection that the epidemic will last for at \n     least another generation, advocates say, the Government and \n     private agencies need to take a hard look at spending in the \n     coming years.\n       ``We are not going to die, at least not all of us, and at \n     least not all so soon,'' said Bill Arnold, co-chairman of the \n     ADAP Working Group, a coalition in Washington that is \n     lobbying the Government to add money to its AIDS Drug \n     Assistance Program. ``A lot of us are saying that the AIDS \n     network or AIDS Inc. or whatever you want to call it, this \n     whole network that we have created in the last 15 years, \n     needs to be reinvented. But reinvented as what?''\n       That question is provoking considerable anxiety among \n     employees at the estimated 2,400 service agencies in the \n     United States, several hundred of which are in New York City.\n       The agencies offer an array of services including \n     sophisticated treatment advice and free dog walking. Although \n     most are tiny, some have grown into huge institutions \n     financed by Federal, state and local government dollars, as \n     well as contributions.\n       Critics say the organizations cannot possibly re-examine \n     themselves because they have become too dependent on the \n     Government.\n       ``They have all become co-opted by the very system that \n     they were created to hold accountable,'' Larry Kramer, the \n     playwright, said.\n       Mr. Kramer founded Gay Men's Health Crisis in 1981, but has \n     long been critical of the group. ``It's staffed with a lot of \n     people who have jobs at stake,'' he said.\n       With 280 employees and 7,000 volunteers, the program is the \n     biggest and busiest agency of its kind. For many with human \n     immunodeficiency virus, the organization and its lending \n     library, arts-and-crafts center and comfortably decorated \n     ``living room'' offer a home away from home, a place where, \n     as one participant said, ``your H.I.V. status is a \n     nonevent.'' For some, the hot lunches often provide the only \n     nutritious meals the patients get all day. For others, they \n     are simply a source of community.\n       Craig Gibson, 31, of the Bronx, is one of 10,000 people a \n     year who seek services there. Several days each week, Mr. \n     Gibson goes to the living room to play cards after lunch.\n       ``You come here, you see your friends,'' he said one \n     afternoon. ``Today they had a great chicken parmesan.''\n       A walk through the lobby shows the power and success of \n     AIDS philanthropy. A huge plaque in the entryway lists dozens \n     of donors who have contributed $10,000 or more, including \n     three who have given more than $1 million. Even so, 19 \n     percent of the $30 million annual budget comes from \n     Government sources, Mr. Robinson said.\n       ``We still need this extraordinary short-term help,'' he \n     said.\n       But Mr. Robinson said he was aware that the financing might \n     not last forever. Even as the organization expands, it is \n     doing so with an eye toward eventually scaling back. It just \n     spent $12.5 million to renovate its new headquarters in a \n     simple but expansive 12-story brick building on West 24th \n     Street.\n       Mr. Robinson, a former accountant, said the building was \n     designed so that any other business could easily move in. The \n     lease is relatively short, 15 years.\n       The agency, he added, has realized that it cannot afford to \n     be all things to all people. Until recently, Mr. Robinson \n     said, ``anybody with H.I.V. or AIDS could walk into our \n     advocacy department, and virtually anything that was wrong \n     with their life was addressed.''\n       ``If they were having problems with their landlord,'' he \n     said, ``we would deal with it. If they needed an air-\n     conditioner, we would deal with it. Now we are really trying \n     to focus on what is specifically related to AIDS.''\n       To understand why Mr. Robinson and others say they believe \n     AIDS deserves special status, a person has to go back to the \n     response to AIDS in the days when it was known as the ``gay \n     cancer.'' The Government and the rest of society all but \n     ignored the illness, forcing the people who were affected--by \n     and large homosexuals--to fend for themselves.\n       ``The original reaction,'' Mr. Arnold said, ``was in \n     response to: `This is not our problem. We don't like you. Go \n     away and die.' ''\n       ``By the time you have got 200,000 to 300,000 people \n     dead,'' he said, ``they all have friends. They all have \n     relatives. That's a lot of people impacted. So now you have \n     some critical mass.''\n       That mass has translated into a political force--and \n     significant Federal money. In his budget proposal for 1998, \n     President Clinton has asked Congress to allocate more than \n     $3.5 billion for AIDS programs, including $1.5 billion for \n     AIDS research at the National Institutes of Health and $1.04 \n     billion for the Ryan White Care Act, which provides medical \n     care, counseling, prescription drugs and dental visits for \n     people with H.I.V.\n       If Congress enacts the plan, AIDS spending would increase 4 \n     percent over last year, and 70 percent over 1993, when Mr. \n     Clinton took office.\n       In a paradox, some doctors say the array of services makes \n     it harder to care for people whose behavior puts them at risk \n     for AIDS, but who are not yet infected.\n       ``We're trying to figure out how to provide services to \n     H.I.V.-negative people to help them stay negative,'' said Dr. \n     Michelle Roland, who treats indigent patients at San \n     Francisco General Hospital. Many of Dr. Roland's patients are \n     drug abusers, people at high risk.\n       ``The truth is,'' she said, ``we have a lot more access to \n     resources for H.I.V.-positive people for drug treatment, \n     education and housing.''\n       While advocates for people with other diseases often lobby \n     vociferously for more money for research, the notion of \n     exceptionalism--that a particular illness deserves special \n     Government status--is unique to AIDS, and it is generating a \n     backlash.\n       For years, the American Heart Association has gone to \n     Capitol Hill budget hearings with charts showing that more \n     research money was spent per patient on AIDS than on heart \n     disease. Advocates for people with Parkinson's disease have \n     done the same. It will not be long, Mr. Delaney argues, \n     before people with those and other diseases follow suit, \n     demanding Ryan White-style programs for themselves.\n       Some authorities, including the president of the American \n     Foundation for AIDS Research, Dr. Arthur Ammann, said Mr. \n     Delaney was correct in pushing for universal\n\n[[Page S10578]]\n\n     health care. ``We've got to form an alliance with these other \n     diseases,'' Dr. Ammann said, ``and say, None of us is going \n     to get adequate health care the way the system is going.''\n       But others call Mr. Delaney naive.\n       ``It's interesting to muse about what he says,'' said Mr. \n     Graham of the Whitman-Walker Clinic. ``But it's both \n     undesirable and impossible. So what's the point of talking \n     about it?''\n       Naive or not, in challenging exceptionalism Mr. Delaney has \n     clearly broken a taboo.\n       ``We sort of question it among ourselves behind closed \n     doors,'' said Mark Hannay, a member of the New York chapter \n     of Act Up, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power. ``Like, isn't \n     this nice, but we're the only ones getting it.''\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, another key fact: New York State alone \nspends $25 million a year just on administration of their Ryan White \ntitle I funds. That is more money on administration than 38 other \nStates combined, 38 other States spend total on all of it.\n  The Senator from New York showed a chart on AIDS cases and spending. \nWell, she was right. It was about AIDS cases, but it wasn't about AIDS \nand HIV-infected individuals. When you look at it in terms of those \ninfected with HIV rather than AIDS cases and when you look at AIDS \ncases, AIDS cases are based on those who have had AIDS in the past and \nthose who have AIDS today but does not reflect the epidemic.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article \non the housing and rooming in New York for people who are no longer \nalive but for which they paid for a number of months, a large number of \npeople, where money was wasted.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   HIV/AIDS Shelter Costs Challenged\n\n                             (By Ellen Yan)\n\n       July 5, 2005.--The [New York] city agency that secures \n     temporary shelter for indigent people with HIV/AIDS shelled \n     out $2.2 million in questionable payments over 2\\1/2\\ years, \n     partly to rent rooms listed to people who had died, the city \n     comptroller charged in an audit released yesterday.\n       The Human Resources Administration paid $182,391 for rooms \n     listed to 26 people up to two years after their deaths, with \n     one housing provider getting 76 percent of the money, \n     $137,920, said the report from Comptroller William Thompson \n     Jr.\n       Auditors said many of the problems stemmed from the \n     agency's failure to review its own data and client files \n     before making payments to housing providers. In the audit, \n     Thompson's office looked at five housing facilities as well \n     as payments and records made from July 2002 to December 2004.\n       Among the findings, auditors said, $1 million went to \n     housing providers for residents who did not sign registration \n     logs; $456,292 was paid for overnight stays on or after \n     clients' last days of occupancy; $417,463 in payments for \n     people not in the agency's new database; $118,185 in double \n     billing; and a $20,030 check to one vendor who submitted a \n     $2,030 bill, an overpayment the agency said it will correct.\n       HRA spokesman Bob McHugh said yesterday that agency heads \n     had not seen the comptroller's final report.\n       ``For whatever reason, they chose to release it on the \n     Fourth of July, so we're not going to comment . . . until we \n     get a chance to review it,'' McHugh said.\n       In letters sent to the comptroller's office, HRA disagreed \n     with many findings. In a June 15 letter, the agency said it's \n     still waiting for Thompson's office to provide all the \n     details so it can double-check the findings.\n       For example, officials replied in letters to the \n     comptroller's office that at least three people were \n     erroneously listed as dead in Social Security records.\n       In addition, the agency wrote, weekly registration logs are \n     not final proof of whether housing was provided, because \n     people with AIDS may have been too sick to sign.\n       The agency also accused Thompson's office of giving an \n     ``unbalanced'' picture of housing conditions by concluding \n     the 91 units checked were ``generally in satisfactory \n     condition'' but then rating 25 of them as ``unsafe and \n     unsanitary.''\n       The housing agency agreed with most of the audit's \n     recommendations, including checking vendors' bills against \n     client and Social Security records.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, it is disingenuous to use AIDS cases alone \nto make comparisons. The reason for that is because this is an \nepidemic. And thanks to the wonderful presence of modern-day medicines, \nmedicines are preventing people who have HIV from ever contracting the \nfullblown AIDS syndrome.\n  The whole idea behind the bill that Senators Enzi and Kennedy have \noffered and that has passed the House with over 300 votes is to have \nthe money follow the epidemic. That is what this bill does. There are \nsmall declines in the amount of money per person in New York so that \nmarked increases in funds are available for those in the \nnonmetropolitan areas throughout the South.\n  We know the face of the epidemic is changing. That epidemic says that \nwe ought to be caring for them. The Senator's answer is just spend more \nmoney. But last year, when I offered an amendment to add $60 million to \nthe ADAP by cutting pork projects, she voted against it. So you can \ncome to the floor and claim you are for spending more money, but if you \ndon't want to cut out a Japanese garden which is for a Federal \nGovernment building which was $60 million so you can put $60 million \ninto lifesaving drugs, some would claim that is not real support for \nmore money.\n  The final point I wish to make is that last year, New York received \nover $1.4 billion in earmarks, earmarks that aren't a priority, \nearmarks that aren't necessarily needed in a time of war. There was no \noffer to cut back on the earmarks for the State of New York to pay for \ngreater care for AIDS patients. Some want to have it both ways: \nearmarks in the bill that are going to come back to us this November \nfor New York, $600,000 for exhibits, $500,000 for New York City. We \nhave to get a hold of priorities. Is HIV/AIDS a priority? Yes. And can \nwe put more money into it? Yes. But we ought to be making the tough \nchoices.\n  So I would say to my colleague that I have great respect for her \ndesire to make sure everybody is cared for, but I also have a desire to \nmake sure our children are cared for. And we need to pass this bill. It \nis a fair bill in the long term. We will work hard to make sure the \nmoneys are there. We will work hard.\n  A final point. This new bill directs that 75 percent of the money \nought to go to treatment. Less than 50 percent of the money in New York \ngoes for treatment. Fifty percent goes for other things. So we have \npeople living in South Carolina, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and in other \nStates who are now on a drug waiting list who can't get treatment, and \nwe are quibbling about $300 in other programs--not treatment--other \nprograms these people won't ever have any access to, but yet they can't \nget drugs. Is it a geographical disagreement? Yes. Everybody who is \ntalking on this is for taking care of this problem. This is a great \nway. This bill is a good start.\n  Here is the other problem. If we don't pass this bill before October \n1, lots of people in New York and in other States will be hurt because \nof the legislation in the previous Ryan White Act in terms of forcing \nthe redistribution of this. It is my hope we can work this out.\n  I appreciate the Senator's sentiments in terms of her caring for \nthose with HIV, but I know, in fact, what has been offered and worked \nand gotten through the House is a good approach that takes a little bit \nfrom New York, takes a little bit from San Francisco, and gives \nlifesaving drugs. It doesn't take any lifesaving drugs away from New \nYork or San Francisco or California but gives lifesaving drugs to the \npeople who don't have them today. We ought to be about doing that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized \nfor 45 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10578-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10578-S10584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RETIRING FROM THE SENATE\n\n\n                             Paul Sarbanes\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this is a day I hoped would never come. This is a \nspeech I hoped I would never give. These are words I hoped I would \nnever say. The senior Senator from Maryland, Paul Sarbanes, the longest \nserving Senator in the history of his great State, Senator Paul \nSarbanes, is retiring. Now I must say goodbye.\n  I am so sorry to say those words to my good friend, my true friend, \nand greatly esteemed colleague. More than once, in fact, I have found \nmyself hoping Paul Sarbanes would change his mind. But the senior \nSenator from Maryland must do what is best for himself and his family, \nand I wish him the best.\n  The retirement of Paul Sarbanes from the Senate brings to a close a \nfascinating and extraordinary Senate career. This son of Greek \nimmigrant parents grew up on the Eastern Shore of\n\n[[Page S10579]]\n\nMaryland, where he worked his way--yes, he worked his way through \nschool by waiting on tables, washing dishes, and mopping floors in the \nMayflower Grill in downtown Salisbury. From there, it was on to \nPrinceton, that great university, for an undergraduate degree, to \nOxford University as a Rhodes scholar--as a Rhodes scholar--and then on \nto Harvard Law School.\n  Paul Sarbanes began his career in public service in 1966. I had just \nbegun my second term as a Member of the U.S. Senate 2 years before when \nPaul Sarbanes was elected to the Maryland State Legislature in 1966. In \n1970, Paul Sarbanes was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives \nwhere, as a member of the House Judiciary Committee, he introduced the \nfirst article of impeachment against President Nixon.\n\n  That was Paul Sarbanes. After three terms in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, in 1976 he was elected to the U.S. Senate--yes, this \nbody--where his career became even more fascinating and extraordinary.\n  In the U.S. Senate, Paul Sarbanes has served as chairman of the \nCongressional Joint Economic Committee and chairman of the Senate \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. And he was chairman of \nthe very impressive and influential Maryland Congressional Delegation, \nwhich includes Senator Barbara Mikulski and the House Democratic whip, \nSteny Hoyer. Paul Sarbanes has also been a very effective member of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Budget Committee.\n  Senator Sarbanes has authored and sponsored important legislation, \nincluding the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which has been called the most far-\nreaching reforms of American business practices since the time of \nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n  I have always admired the quiet but effective way in which this \nunassuming, brilliant--I mean brilliant--and most reasonable lawmaker \nhas performed the Nation's business. Paul Sarbanes. The Greeks taught \nthe world to think. I don't know whether that is original or not, but \nthat is the way I feel about it, in any event. The Greeks taught the \nworld to think. I have always thought of Paul Sarbanes as a thinker--a \nthinker--a thinker. On the Senate committees on which we have served \ntogether, I have observed how he listens carefully, speaks--not often, \nbut when he speaks, he speaks so softly, and then gets right to the \ncrux of a matter. What a mind. What a brain. Yes, what a thinker. In \nhis own subtle way, he can dissect even the most powerful and most \narrogant witness. Let it be a Senator, he is the same.\n  I will always remember and always appreciate the great support that \nPaul Sarbanes gave to me during the time I served as the Senate \nDemocratic Leader. During the most troubling times, during the most \ndifficult votes, during the most controversial debate on matters, I \ncould always count on Paul Sarbanes being there--with his friendship, \nhis assistance, and his advice. I always called on Paul Sarbanes as I \ngathered the chairmen of the committees when I was the majority leader \nof the Senate and when I was the minority leader. I would call my \nDemocratic chairmen around me. They were my board of directors, the \nchairmen of the various committees when we were in the majority. I \nalways called Paul Sarbanes--he and some others, like Wendell Ford--but \nI am talking about Paul Sarbanes. I cannot begin to describe how \nimportant his support was and how much I appreciated it.\n  As I have said before, every leader would be fortunate to have a Paul \nSarbanes, this Greek--and I say that with great pride--this Greek \nthinker. When I see the statue of ``The Thinker,'' with his fist under \nhis chin, I think of Paul Sarbanes. Yes, I think of Paul Sarbanes. I \nwas always so fortunate myself to have Paul Sarbanes as a colleague to \nwhom I could go and seek advice and counsel.\n  Senator Sarbanes was one of just 23 Members of this Chamber who was \nwilling to defy popular opinion--yes, to stand up to the President of \nthe United States and to throw himself against the forces of war in \nvoting against the resolution to launch an unprecedented preemptive \nassault, military assault, military invasion of a country that had \nnever attacked us, never attacked our country; a country that did not \npose a preeminent threat to our national security--Iraq. If only there \nhad been more Senators like Paul Sarbanes, one of the 23 immortals. I \nlike to think of it in that way.\n  I am in my 48th year in the Senate, and I was 6 years in the other \nbody, making more than half a century in the Congress of the United \nStates. I have always, since that vote, felt that was the greatest vote \nthat I have ever cast. I have cast more than 17,000 rollcall votes in \nthe Senate. I will always look upon that vote as the greatest vote, the \nvote in which I take the most pride, during my 54 years in the Congress \nof the United States--the greatest vote I ever cast. I cast that vote \nwith 22 other Senators, one of whom is now gone. He died in a plane \ncrash.\n  When Senator Sarbanes announced his retirement back in March 2005, I \nremarked that he ``will be missed'' and that he ``will not be \nreplaced.'' While Paul Sarbanes will be missed, I might have to qualify \nthe latter portion of that statement. Just a few weeks ago his son, \nPaul Sarbanes' son John--John, what a name--won the Democratic primary \nin the 3rd district in Maryland to become a Democratic nominee for the \nU.S. House of Representatives. Therefore, come January we might have \nanother Sarbanes serving with us in the Congress--praise God. If so, it \nwill be fascinating to watch that son follow in his father's footsteps.\n  As the old saying goes: A Sarbanes goes and a Sarbanes comes, and \nCongress, like Tennyson's brook, goes on forever. That is not really an \nold saying. I probably just made it up. But I like it; yes, I like it.\n  Let me close by simply saying thank you, thank you Senator Paul \nSarbanes. I thank you.\n  I remember Paul Sarbanes years ago when we were thinking and talking \nabout and debating the Panama Canal treaty. I was against that treaty \nin the beginning, and then I read ``The Path Between The Seas'' and I \nchanged my mind. I studied the matter. I did what Paul Sarbanes did, I \nstudied the matter. I thought about the matter. I changed my \nviewpoints.\n  Paul Sarbanes, I thank you. I thank you for being a true friend. I \nthank you for being a truly esteemed colleague. I don't say these words \nlightly. I have been here a long time. I know a good man or woman, a \ngood Senator when I see a good Senator. And I know this man is one of \nthe finest of all Senators and a great American.\n  I thank you, Paul Sarbanes, for everything that you have done for \nyour State and your people and country our people. I wish you and your \nlovely wife Christine nothing but ambrosia and nectar as you enter the \nnext phase of your lives.\n\n     God, give us men.\n     A time like this demands strong minds,\n     Great hearts, true faith, and ready hands.\n     Men whom the lust of office does not kill;\n     Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy;\n     Men who possess opinions and a will;\n     Men who have honor; men who will not lie.\n\n     Men who can stand before the demagog\n     And brave his treacherous flatteries without winking.\n     Tall men, Sun-crowned;\n     Who live above the fog.\n     In public duty and in private thinking.\n\n     For while the rabble with its thumbworn creeds,\n     Its large professions and its little deeds,\n     Mingles in selfish strife,\n     Lo! Freedom weeps!\n     Waits, and waiting justice sleeps.\n     Wrong rules the land, I say, and waiting justice sleeps.\n     God, give us men!\n\n     Men who serve not for selfish booty;\n     But real men, courageous, who flinch not at duty.\n     Men of dependable character;\n     Men of sterling worth;\n     Then wrongs will be redressed and right will rule the Earth.\n     God Give us men--\n\n  More men, yes, men like Paul Sarbanes, the Greek scholar, the Greek \nthinker, the Rhodes Scholar, a Senator of whom I am proud and will \nalways speak with great pride.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank the very able Senator from West \nVirginia, our leader here for so many years, for his very generous and \ngracious remarks. I am deeply appreciative of his exceedingly kind \nwords.\n  But I want to thank him even more for the extraordinary leadership he \nhas\n\n[[Page S10580]]\n\nprovided over his service, both in the House of Representatives and, \nfor the last 48 years, in the Senate. I have been here three decades \nand there is no one during that time who has spoken more eloquently, \nmore perceptively about our Constitution and the role of the Senate \nwithin the Constitution, who has sought to strengthen the Senate as an \ninstitution and to have it play its role in the checks and balances \narrangements which our Founding Fathers established in Philadelphia in \nthe summer of 1787.\n  Senator Byrd again and again has called us to a higher standard. He \nhas urged us over and over to do the right thing, to understand what \nour roles are as Senators, and, as he said, I know of no issue, \ncertainly in recent times, where he has more pointedly expressed our \nrole than when we considered the issue of giving the President \nauthority to go to war in Iraq. It was Senator Byrd who sounded a \nclarion call that was heard all across the country, as he raised the \nbasic questions that needed to be raised with respect to an issue of \nsuch gravity and significance.\n  I have been honored to serve with the Senator. I early recognized \nthat the wisest course would be to follow his leadership. Again and \nagain I have been privileged to have the opportunity to do that. I \nthank him very much for what he just said. I want him to know that as \nlong as he stands on the floor of the Senate, I have confidence that \nour Constitution and this body as an institution are in good hands.\n  That is a magnificent service that he renders to the Republic. I \nthank him very much.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my dear friend. I shall always \ncherish the words thus spoken and always reflect upon this Senator, \nPaul Sarbanes, with great pride.\n\n\n                              Mark Dayton\n\n  Mr. President, I say farewell to Senator Dayton. Seldom has a \nfreshman Senator made more of an impression on me than has Senator Mark \nDayton of Minnesota who has announced that he will be leaving us at the \nend of this session of the Congress.\n  From the start of his service in this Chamber, I have been struck by \nSenator Dayton's determination to learn the rules, to learn the \ntraditions, to learn the customs of the Senate.\n  When Senator Dayton presided over the Senate, which is one of the \nresponsibilities of freshman Senators, he always did so with attention \nand dignity. His demeanor was inspiring. It reassured my belief in the \nfuture of this great institution.\n  When I meet with new Senators, as I often do, about the duties of the \nPresiding Officer, I urge them to use that gavel on that desk \nvigorously to bring the U.S. Senate to order.\n  I recall one instance when Senator Dayton banged the gavel so hard \nthat he nearly fell out of his chair. That is the way it should be. I \nthought to myself: Bang that gavel, bring the Senate to order so that \nthe Senate can conduct the Nation's business.\n  I am also impressed about the reverence that Senator Dayton shows for \nour Nation's most basic, most important document, the Constitution of \nthe United States.\n  Many people who have served in this Chamber will have to answer to \nhistory for the way they have ignored and trampled upon our \nConstitution. As President Lincoln once reminded the Members of \nCongress: ``We cannot escape history.''\n  I am confident that history will hold Senator Dayton in high regard.\n  Time after time, this freshman Senator has stood with me and the \nConstitution of the United States on the important issues before us. \nSenator Dayton was one of the lonely 23 Senators who voted not to go to \nwar with Iraq. I have been, as I say, 48 years in this body, and it is \nthe greatest vote I ever cast, the vote of which I am most proud of all \nthe 17,000 and more votes that I have cast.\n  Senator Dayton was willing to defy public opinion and the forces of \nwar because he, Senator Dayton, was determined not to hand over to \nPresident Bush, or any President, Democrat or Republican, any \nPresident, the power to declare war. No. Why? Because the Constitution \nsays Congress shall have the power to declare war.\n  With firm belief in our constitutional doctrines of the separation of \npowers and checks and balances, Senator Dayton was the only person on \nthe Senate Governmental Affairs Committee who voted against the flawed \nDepartment of Homeland Security bill that this White House pushed.\n  How I have admired the courage and the fortitude of this man, Senator \nDayton, this Senator and his firm belief in our constitutional system.\n  How I have wished that he would change his mind. I have spoken to him \nnumerous times about that. I wish we had more like him, more who would \nsay: Come one, come all, this rock shall fly from its firm base as I.\n  I thank Senator Dayton for standing shoulder to shoulder and toe to \ntoe with me on so many constitutional issues, and I thank him for the \nreverence he has shown this institution, the U.S. Senate.\n  Senator Dayton is a descendent--get this--Senator Dayton is a \ndescendent of Jonathan Dayton, who was a delegate to the Constitutional \nConvention of 1787 from the State of New Jersey. I know that Jonathan \nDayton is up there somewhere today looking down and smiling upon his \nkinsman who has worked so hard to preserve and to protect the \nConstitution, the sacred document that he, Jonathan Dayton, helped to \ncreate along with George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and James \nMadison.\n  Senator Dayton has brought to the Senate a vigor and a vision of \npublic policies that is both refreshing and needed; yes, needed.\n  Mark Dayton has devoted his life to public service. And why he ever \ndecided to leave the Senate is beyond me. I have done the best I could \ntalking with him time and time again, but he remains firm.\n  His public service included teaching school in the lower east side of \nNew York City, also known as the Bowery, and serving as a social worker \nin Boston, the great city of Boston. Senator Dayton's social and \npolitical activism landed him on President Richard Nixon's infamous \n``enemies list''--which he, Senator Mark Dayton, probably considered a \nbadge of honor--and on the staff of Senator Walter Mondale, one of our \nfine Vice Presidents.\n  Senator Dayton brought his concerns for the less fortunate and the \npowerless with him to the Senate. As a freshman Senator, he proposed a \nnew farm bill to help struggling family farms. He proposed a \nprescription tax credit plan to help Medicare beneficiaries offset the \ncosts of their medications. He established a health care help line to \nassist working families in his State in getting health coverage from \ntheir insurance companies that they had paid for. He proposed a global \ntrade agreement to limit the President's ability to negotiate trade \ndeals by giving the Congress the power to reject parts of negotiated \ntrade deals if they violated existing laws.\n\n  I expected great things from this Senator. He had been serving in \nthis Chamber for only 2 years, when on March 13, 2003, I predicted that \nSenator Dayton would have a ``long career, if he wishes to make it a \nlong one.''\n  I was surprised, I was disappointed, I was saddened to learn that he \nhas chosen instead to make a short career in the Senate. I hope he does \nnot retire from public life because our country--especially our less \nfortunate--will always need public servants like Mark Dayton. \n  But whatever he chooses to do, I wish him happiness and success. And \nI will always be grateful for my friendship with Mark Dayton and the \nwork--yes, the work--that we have done together.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield briefly?\n  Mr. BYRD. I do yield.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield to the Senator 2 minutes. Is that sufficient?\n  Mr. DAYTON. I will be very brief.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia for those gracious words. I am \ndeeply honored because they come from the mouth of one of the greatest \nSenators in the history of this country. And whatever I have learned to \napply with my understanding of the traditions of the Senate, the \nintegrity of the Senate, the dignity of the Senate, I heard first and \nforemost from the great Senator from West Virginia, who has been a \nmentor, a guide, a leader, for whom I have the utmost respect. And\n\n[[Page S10581]]\n\nwhen I did preside and listen to the Senator speak about such subjects \nas the United States Constitution, I learned more from his wisdom than \nI have learned in the previous 55 years of my life.\n  I was honored to stand with him, really behind him, when he led the \npublic outcry against the war resolution. And I was honored to be 1 of \nthose 23 Senators, and history has proven us also correct. For his \nincredible service to his State for which he was cited as the Greatest \nWest Virginian of the last century, and I expect will be cited as the \nGreatest West Virginian of this century as well, and for that same \nquality of devotion to our country and incredible leadership to our \nentire Nation, we are all--all of the country men and women--in great \ndebt to him. I am, again, deeply honored by his words.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator, and I \nwill always cherish, as long as I live, his words.\n\n\n                              Jim Jeffords\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, unfortunately, when Congress meets again in \nJanuary of 2007, this Chamber and our Nation will be without the \nservices of our esteemed colleague, Senator Jim Jeffords.\n  Senator Jeffords has announced that he is retiring so he may spend \nmore time with his lovely wife Elizabeth. May I make clear that \nElizabeth's gain is the Senate's loss.\n  For 32 years, Jim Jeffords has proudly and superbly represented his \nbeautiful State of Vermont and our great country in the U.S. Congress.\n  From 1975 to 1988, he was Vermont's lone Member in the United States \nHouse of Representatives. Now having served three terms in the Senate, \nhe has decided to retire. I regret his departure. He is a Senator I \nhave admired. He is a Senator I respected since he first came to this \nChamber.\n  Through his hard work and his dedication to this institution, he has \nhelped to make the Senate a better place. For that I have been grateful \nand thankful. He is a polite, friendly, mild-mannered man whom it is \nalways pleasant to be around. He is a U.S. Navy veteran who has never \nfailed to demonstrate his love for our great country.\n  This Senator is a great American who possesses a passion to do the \nright thing no matter what the consequence. He is a U.S. Senator who \nhas always displayed a reverence for this institution, the Senate of \nthe United States.\n  While he has a natural, easy-going manner, he is a Senator who will \nwork feverishly, who will work tirelessly for the causes in which he \nbelieves. Seldom has the Senate seen a stronger or more avid defender \nof the environment. He was one of the founders of the Congressional \nSolar Coalition. He has chaired the House Environment Study Conference \nand the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. In Congress, he \nhas constantly sought to broaden and to strengthen the power of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, and he has worked to ensure that \nimportant agency does its job.\n  His efforts to protect our environment have earned him recognition \nand awards from a number of environmental organizations, including the \nprestigious Sierra Club.\n  Senator Jeffords has been one of the Senate's foremost promoters of \nthe rights of disabled Americans. Senator Jeffords has worked to open \nopportunities for them. He is coauthor of the Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Act, IDEA. For his efforts on behalf of disabled \nAmericans, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, NMSS, honored him \nas its ``Senator of the year.''\n  Senator Jeffords has been a promoter of the arts. He was a cofounder \nof the Congressional Arts Caucus, and not long ago as head of the \nSenate committee that oversees the National Endowment for the Arts, \nSenator Jeffords--yes, Senator Jeffords--was able to block a House \neffort to abolish the NEA.\n  Senator Jeffords has been one of the Senate's biggest and best \npromoters of education. I have read some criticisms of Senator Jeffords \nfor his continuous efforts to seek more and more funding for \neducational programs for America's youth, America's young people, \nespecially special educational programs. He has even been accused of \n``bartering his vote'' on legislation for his own pet educational \nprojects. I think this was probably meant as a criticism. If it were, I \nam sure that it is a criticism that Senator Jeffords wears with pride.\n  I don't think there is anything more important to Senator Jeffords \nthan seeing that all of America's children have every opportunity to \nfulfill their educational pursuits. For this, he certainly has my \nrespect and my admiration. I applaud him. Yes, I applaud Senator \nJeffords.\n  Throughout his congressional career, Senator Jeffords, son of a Chief \nJustice of the Vermont Supreme Court and graduate of Yale University \nand Harvard Law School, has always displayed an independence of spirit, \nan independence of spirit for which he has been labeled a loose cannon. \nKnowing Senator Jeffords as I do, I know that his independence stems \nfrom an unrelenting determination to place doing the right thing above \npolitical or personal interest.\n  While in the House of Representatives, Senator Jeffords was the only \nRepublican to vote against President Reagan's tax cut bill because he \ncharged it would increase the national deficit. And it did. In the \nSenate, he was one of two Republicans who voted against President \nBush's first round of tax cuts because those cuts were irresponsible \nand favored the wealthy. Senator Jeffords was the only Republican \nSenator to cosponsor President Clinton's effort to overhaul our \nnational health care system.\n  I remember Senator Jeffords for being one of only 23 Senators who \nvoted against going to war in Iraq. I have been in this Senate 48 years \nthis year. I have cast 17,752 rollcall votes. I will say it again, \n17,752 rollcall votes. And of all these votes--I have said it before--I \nam most proud of that particular vote, the vote against that arrogant \nand reckless charge to war in Iraq.\n  The Constitution says Congress shall have the power to declare war. \nIt does not say that ``one person,'' it does not say that the President \nof the United States, be he Republican or Democrat, shall have the \npower to declare war.\n  So, 23 Senators, including Robert Byrd and Jim Jeffords, voted to \nuphold the Constitution of the United States. That was the greatest \nvote ever cast in my 48 years in the Senate. If we only had more \nSenators with the courage, the determination and the character of Jim \nJeffords, we might have avoided becoming involved in the bloody mess in \nwhich we now find ourselves in Iraq--with no end in sight. The Senate \nneeds more Jim Jeffords.\n\n  In September 2000, Congressional Quarterly included a nice profile of \nSenator Jeffords. That article discussed his willingness to take \nindependent positions even on the most partisan issues. It also \ndiscussed his black belt in the martial arts and how he had joined with \nother esteemed colleagues--Senators Lott, Craig, and Ashcroft--to form \nthat magnificent vocal group ``The Singing Senators.'' Congressional \nQuarterly pointed out that Senator Jeffords ``calls his own tunes,'' \nand I say he does. He calls his own tunes.\n  Eight months later, CQ proved prophetic. In May 2001 came an event \nfor which Senator Jeffords will often be remembered in his 32 years in \nCongress, the event that he has called his own personal ``declaration \nof independence.'' He followed his conscience and followed the path \nbest for him. As I said before, we need more Senators like Jim \nJeffords.\n  I am sorry to have to say goodbye to this unassuming, fiercely \nindependent man. As much as I would prefer that he stay, I understand \nand I respect his wishes.\n  I wish Senator Jeffords and his lovely wife Elizabeth the blessing of \nAlmighty God as they begin the next chapter of their lives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                              Mark Dayton\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I see my colleague from Minnesota, \nSenator Dayton. He will not be here in January, and I come to the \nSenate to associate myself with the praise of my distinguished \ncolleague from West Virginia for Senator Dayton.\n  We live in very partisan times. We live in times where there is great \ncynicism about politics. We come from opposite sides of the political \naisle, and there are moments we are butting\n\n[[Page S10582]]\n\nheads on issues and press releases, but I have to say my colleague's \nheart is pure. On issue after issue, when Mark Dayton, the Senator from \nMinnesota, says something, he says it because he believes it and he is \npassionate about it.\n  We worked together to try to make sure our troops, when they were on \nleave from Iraq, came home at no cost. We came together.\n  Earlier today, we were in the Senate talking about agricultural \ndisaster assistance for Minnesota farmers. The public does not see all \nthe times we work together. They do not look into a man's heart. I have \nbeen here 4 years, and what I call the pureness of the heart, the \ncommitment to public service, a lifelong commitment to public service, \nagain and again at level after level on the State and now in the U.S. \nCongress is something to be celebrated.\n  I express to my colleague and my friend--and we use that word rather \nloosely on occasion here, but he is my colleague and my friend--thanks \nfor your service. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to work with \nyou on behalf of the people of Minnesota and the people of this \ncountry.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I might have 1 \nminute to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank my friend, and I mean that \nsincerely, and my very distinguished colleague from Minnesota for those \nvery kind words.\n  The Senator said we don't agree on everything, but we are not meant \nto agree on everything. That is part of the wisdom of the process here.\n  I have endless respect for the Senator from Minnesota. He was elected \nto the Senate by the people of our State under very difficult \ncircumstances in the immediate aftermath of the tragic death of his \npredecessor. He handled that situation with great dignity and class, \nand he has continued to do so.\n  He represents our State with effectiveness, success beyond his young \nyears. That is demonstrated by the high regard he is held in by most of \nthe citizens in our State.\n  I thank him for his friendship. I thank him for the opportunity to \nwork with him. I wish him continued success after I leave the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Parliamentary inquiry: I think I have the next 45 minutes \nunder the unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is authorized to proceed.\n\n\n                               Bill Frist\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr President, soon the last remaining items of business on \nthe legislative calendar for the 10gth Congress will be taken up and \nthe current session of Congress will end. When it does, several of our \ncolleagues will be returning home and leaving public service. We will \nmiss them and we will especially miss the good ideas and creative \nspirit they brought with them to add to our work here in the Senate.\n  One of our colleagues we will all miss is Bill Frist, our good friend \nfrom Tennessee. In his two terms of service he has compiled quite a \nremarkable record of accomplishments as one of Tennessee's Senators and \nas majority leader here in the Senate.\n  Bill's interest in serving in the Senate began while he was attending \nPrinceton as an undergraduate. He was an intern in the House when \nRepresentative Evins of his home State encouraged him to run. But, \nbefore you do, he said, do something else for 20 years or so. Then you \nwill be ready to run for office.\n  He knew that was good advice so he began a career that interested him \nand challenged him as much as politics did. Bill Frist became a surgeon \nand established a reputation as one of the best transplant surgeons in \nthe Nation.\n  We were fortunate that he chose that path in life, because his in \ndepth knowledge of the practice of medicine and our Nation's health \ncare system has been an invaluable addition to the debates we have had \non those issues. His familiarity with health care from the perspective \nof the physician and his concern about rising costs as a member of the \nSenate helped to guide our efforts as we took up these and other \nmatters in committee and on the Senate floor.\n  In the years he has served in the Senate, he has put his medical \nskills to practical use several times. When a gun battle had taken the \nlives of two Capitol Police officers, he went to the scene to help. \nAlthough he was unable to save the lives of either officer, he was \nultimately successful in saving the life of their assailant. On another \noccasion, we were fortunate to have him with us when Strom Thurmond \ncollapsed on the Senate floor and needed assistance. Finally, he was \nable to revive and save the life of one of his own constituents who had \nbeen the victim of a heart attack.\n\n  Many of our constituents remember Bill Frist the days in 2001, when \nthe Senate was attacked with anthrax. Once again, Bill Frist was there \nto provide support and encouragement, and in that calm, reassuring \nmanner of his, let the Nation know that we were doing everything we \ncould to minimize the present danger and return the Senate to our \nnormal pattern of work as soon as possible. The anthrax attack was a \nchallenge that had never been faced before in the Congress, and Bill \nFrist showed his credentials as a leader during that difficult time for \nus all.\n  During his service in the Senate, Bill has taken an active role in \nthe consideration of a great many thorny and complicated issues that \nregularly come before the Senate. We were fortunate to have a doctor as \nour leader because, on many occasions, it was only Bill's bedside \nmanner that helped him to forge agreements and develop bipartisan \nagreements on the Senate floor.\n  Looking back, the record will show that one of Bill's greatest \nsuccesses was the Medicare drug benefit. This new addition to the \nMedicare program is helping seniors to pay for their prescription drugs \nand it is having a great impact on the quality of the health care we \nprovide our Nation's seniors. Although it is still going through its \ninitial stages as it is introduced to the public, and we are working to \nensure people understand the benefits it provides them, there is no \ndoubt that we wouldn't have had a prescription drug benefit program \nenacted into law at all--if not for the role Bill Frist played in the \neffort. Working with program opponents and organizations in the public \nsector that opposed the new program, Bill was able to resolve many of \nthe doubts and uncertainties that surrounded it, and ultimately, get it \nenacted by the Congress and signed into law.\n  In addition, and in what was perhaps his biggest achievement, Bill \nled a successful effort to pass an initiative to fight AIDS in Africa \nand the Caribbean. He had a heartfelt interest in the legislation and \nfirsthand knowledge of the problem it was designed to address because \nhe had done volunteer medical work for many years in Africa. His \nwitness of the impact of the disease on the population of that \ncountry inspired him to do everything he could to address and try to \nput an end to the suffering it caused. Bill can be very proud of the \ngreat result he achieved in that effort. That initiative is his legacy \nand it will save more lives over the years than we will ever be able to \ncount.\n\n  The record is clear. During Bill Frist's service in the Senate, \nespecially his years as majority leader, the Senate and the Nation have \nfaced challenges and addressed issues we had never had to deal with \nbefore. The war on terror. the detention of terrorists, the quality and \ndefinition of life, the future of our Nation's school system, partial \nbirth abortion, stem cell research and so many more controversial \nissues have found their way onto the Senate floor for our \nconsideration.\n  Through it all, Bill Frist's knowledge, deep understanding of the \nissues involved, and determination to develop a consensus on them, so \ntypical of his leadership style, enabled the Senate to be a pro-active \nand fully involved deliberative body. The results he achieved during \nhis years of service in the Senate will be his legacy and help \nprovide the foundation for the work we will do together during the \n110th Session of Congress.\n\n  Now Bill and his wife Karyn will have the time they have always \nwanted to spend with their children as Bill considers his next \nopportunity for public service. Bill Frist has been a major part of our \nday to day routine in the Senate for 12 years and we will miss his \npresence, his influence on our legislative routine, and his expertise \non the issues we have considered on the floor.\n\n[[Page S10583]]\n\n                             paul sarbanes\n\n  Mr. President, there is always an element of sadness that touches us \nall when we come to the end of a session of Congress. As the clock \nwinds down on the final hours of our legislative activities, it also \nsignals the time when several of our colleagues will be retiring and \nending their years of service in the U.S. Senate. One of our colleagues \nwho will be leaving at the end of this session is my good friend Paul \nSarbanes of Maryland.\n  I remember when I first came to Washington years ago. I wanted my \nstaff and I to hit the ground running, so I was reading up on the \npeople who would be my colleagues in the Senate. One name caught my \neye--Paul Sarbanes. It was noted that Paul was a brilliant man who was \none of the Senate's most noted authorities on the detached nuances of \nfinance.\n  As the Senate's only accountant I found that comment to be a badge of \nhonor. I knew Paul must be wearing it with great pride. I knew I would. \nI took an instant liking to him.\n  Through the years Paul and I served on the Banking Committee \ntogether. Our 8 years of service there gave me an opportunity to come \nto know him and appreciate his skills as a legislator. He has a great \nability to solve complicated problems by piecing together workable \nsolutions and then reaching out to his colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to forge an agreement that could be passed and signed into law.\n  As I came to know him, I came to greatly respect him, the hard work \nhe puts into his job every day of the year, and his commitment to serve \nhis constituents which directed his every effort on the Senate floor.\n  A few years ago I had the chance to work with him one on one as we \ncrafted the provisions of what came to be known as the Sarbanes-Oxley \nlegislation. We became good friends during the process and developed a \nmutual respect for each other's positions on the issues.\n  That was back during the days when several scandals had rocked the \naccounting and financial industries of our country. Determined to find \na solution, Paul rolled up his sleeves and went to work. I don't think \nanyone gave him much of a chance to succeed, but those were people who \ndidn't know him or his determination to find a way to solve a problem \nonce it had captured his attention.\n  As he began to work on his bill, he knew he wouldn't be able to pass \nit without the help of some Senate Republicans. On the other side of \nthe aisle, we knew we couldn't get anything through the Senate without \nthe support of several Senate Democrats. So Paul reached across the \naisle and got us all to work together to bring his bill to the Senate \nfloor where it was ultimately passed and signed into law.\n  As he worked for the people of Maryland and I worked for the people \nof my State, we found, despite our political and philosophical \ndifferences, we were always able to find common ground on the 80 \npercent of every issue that unites us. That is why Paul has a well \nearned reputation here in the Senate for his willingness to work out \nproblems for the greater good. He is known for his ability to navigate \nthrough partisan waters and arrive at solutions which are appreciated \nby the thoughtful majorities of both sides of the Senate. If you ask \nme, those are the abilities that have proven to be the secret of his \nsuccess.\n\n  Back home, his constituents appreciate his workhorse style. He has \nserved Maryland in the Senate for almost three decades and through it \nall he has earned the support of the people back home for his hard work \nand determined effort to make their lives better. The issues that were \nimportant to the people who sent him here always led Paul to the Senate \nfloor to take up the cause and do everything he possibly could to \nprotect and promote the interests of those who were counting on him to \nget results. Needless to say--more often than not--he did.\n  Now three decades of service in the Senate have come to an end and \nPaul is returning home to Maryland. I know we will all miss his \ningenuity, his creativity, and his ability to focus our efforts and \nlead on both local and national issues. It is a well known adage that \nall politics is local and that is a lesson that Paul learned and \npracticed as a master craftsman.\n\n  Now he and Christine will have time to enjoy their families together, \nand be a part of all that Maryland has to offer. I have a hunch he will \nnot be slowing down so much as changing direction. I also expect I will \ncontinue to hear from him from time to time on matters that will still \ndraw his interest.\n  It is a phone call expect and look forward to receiving in the years \nto come.\n\n\n                              jim jeffords\n\n  Mr. President, as the session draws to a close and we complete the \nconsideration of the bills before us by casting our final votes of the \nsession, I rise to express my gratitude and best wishes to one of our \ncolleagues who will be retiring when the final gavel brings to a close \nthe current session of Congress.\n  Jim Jeffords, my good friend from Vermont, has decided to return home \nso that he can spend more time with his family. Although I will miss \nhim, as will we all, I understand the reasons for his departure. There \nis nothing more important than family and the bonds between us and our \nchildren--and grandchildren--are stronger than any other in our life.\n  As the Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee, I will miss Jim's 'good ideas, his commitment to making a \ndifference, and his strong determination to make our education and \nhealth care systems operate more effectively and efficiently. He was \nan important presence on the Committee and he and his staff were always \nwilling to work long and hard on the initiatives they proposed to help \nmake our Nation a better place for us all to live.\n\n  Looking back, 1974 was a good year for both Jim and me. I was elected \nto my first term as Mayor of Gillette, WY, and Jim was elected to his \nfirst term in the House of Representatives. We both took office full of \ngreat hopes and dreams as we looked forward to doing everything we \ncould to make a difference in the lives of the people we were elected \nto serve.\n  From the beginning, Jim was very clear on his mission in Congress. He \nhad come here to make sure that our most precious resource--our \nchildren--were well taken care of. For Jim, the issue of education was \nnot something he took lightly. It was a commitment that came from his \nheart. He took the problems of our schools personally and he was \ndetermined to do something about them. He wanted everyone to have the \nsame advantages in life that he had. That was his goal and it inspired \nhim and drove his active involvement in the consideration of the \neducation issues that would come before the House and the Senate.\n\n  Jim's passion for education not only drove his work on the subject in \nCongress, but it also led him in the years to come to serve as a tutor \nat a public school on Capitol Hill each week as part of a literacy \nprogram he created. That program reaches out to involve us all in \nsupporting our public schools. Its philosophy is simple. Anyone can \nmake a difference in our schools. All it takes is a little investment \nof our time and a willingness to share our talents with the students of \na local school.\n  Not long after Jim had taken his oath of office in the House, he \nbegan working on what was to be one of his greatest successes, the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA as it has come to \nbe known. Over the years IDEA has ensured that students with \ndisabilities have equal access to a good education--and a promising \nfuture. Thanks to this landmark legislation those living with \ndisabilities will receive the education, support and encouragement we \nall need to help us become all we can be and reach our full potential \nin our lives.\n  As he served in the House, Jim's commitment to working today to make \nthings better for us all tomorrow led him to fight for meaningful \nenvironmental protections, a more effective and responsive health care \nsystem, and a sound fiscal budget that didn't overspend our present \nresources and leave a bill behind for future generations to pay.\n  That is the philosophy that directed and guided Jim when he ran for \nand won a seat in the Senate in 1988. It wasn't long after he had taken \nthe oath of office for his new position that he began working on the \nreauthorization of the Clean Air Act--another part of his legislative \npassion that will continue to be a key part of his legacy in the \nSenate. Even though he had just\n\n[[Page S10584]]\n\nbegun his service in the Senate at the time, his good ideas and \ncommitment to the protection and preservation of our natural resources \nmade him an important part of the team that would write and promote \nthis important bill.\n  No one was surprised that Jim was a key Member who was involved in so \nmany difficult and important projects as soon as he arrived in the \nSenate. He preceded me as Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee and, under his leadership the committee took a close \nlook at our schools and the quality of the education we provide our \nchildren. It considered how we might improve the training we provide \nour Nation's workers so that they might find and keep better and better \njobs. And, it continued to look for ways that we might provide support \nand empower those living with disabilities so that all Americans are \nable to maximize their potential and live their own version of the \nAmerican dream.\n\n  Back home, Jim has deep roots in his State that date back for \ngenerations. His father was a Chief Justice of the Vermont Supreme \nCourt and I am sure he learned a great deal about politics, life and \nthe law from his Dad.\n  In addition, coming from Vermont, Jim has a great understanding of \nthe challenges faced by small and rural States and the local industries \nthey depend on to keep local and State economies healthy and strong. It \nhas been said that Jim knows as much about the dairy industry as anyone \ndirectly involved in it in his State. He knows firsthand that one size \nfits all solutions that work well for the big States, all too often \npenalize the smaller ones and leave them without the support they need \nto address the same problems the large states face.\n\n  In the years to come, when I think of Jim I will remember how he \nshared his dream of a better America with us. By daring us to dream, \ntoo, he encouraged us to work together so that the future would be a \nbrighter one for us, our children and our grandchildren.\n  There is an old saying the Native Americans in Wyoming know well. We \nhave not inherited the earth from our ancestors, we are borrowing it \nfrom our children. It's a philosophy that Jim took to heart and put \ninto practice every day during his many years of public service.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent following my remarks and Senator \nDayton for 20 minutes, Senator Hatch be recognized to speak for up to \n15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10584-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10584-S10590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HIV/AIDS TREATMENT\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Earlier this afternoon, there were comments made in the \nSenate by the Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton. Some of those \ncomments distressed me a little bit. We have been trying to get the \nRyan White Care Act, which passed out of committee and passed on the \nHouse floor, to pass in the Senate. This is one of those rare \nbipartisan, bicameral bills. We worked it out in advance with the House \nso the bill the House passed is essentially the bill we passed out of \ncommittee. It is a modernization act that would ensure equitable \ndistribution of funds for HIV/AIDS treatment in the United States.\n  I am compelled to discuss some of the points that the Senator from \nNew York made today about the Ryan White Care Act and our bipartisan \nbicameral legislation. I will talk about each of her claims in turn.\n  Senator Clinton claimed that when you look at the funding for the \nwhole bill, New York is not receiving the most funds per case. I don't \ndoubt those figures. However, those are deceptive numbers. As an \naccountant, I have to point that out. They are deceptive for two \nreasons. First, her statement dealt only with funds per AIDS case. We \nhave been talking about including HIV cases as well. Why would she \nneglect to include HIV? I assume it is because 25 States have 50 \npercent of their HIV/AIDS cases not being counted today because those \nindividuals have HIV, which has not progressed to AIDS.\n  Please note that all of my numbers have included both HIV and AIDS. \nWe must include HIV in the funding formulas. Before, including only \nAIDS made sense because we were just waiting for people to die. Now, we \nhave lifesaving treatment for those with HIV; therefore, we must count \neach person who can receive lifesaving care.\n\n  Additionally, Senator Clinton is looking at more than just the \nformula funding. Her figures include funding for community health \ncenters, health care providers, providers who reach out to women and \nchildren. Thus, her figures include a lot of extra funding that is not \nat the heart of the debate.\n  If Senator Clinton wants to rely on these numbers, numbers outside of \nthe formulas, then she can do so under the current bill. She can trust \nthat the other portions of the CARE Act will assist those who she is \nsaying are being harmed by the bill.\n  As for her claim that her State has not spent Ryan White funds for \nthings such as dog-walking, I will note that the Senator from Oklahoma \nprovided information for the record regarding that.\n  Now, Senator Clinton further claims that New York only carried over \n$3 million. Well, I find that surprising, given that New York, on the \naverage, has carried over $29 million.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na document from the Health Resources and Services Administration \ndocumenting the funds carried over for New York.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S10585]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS29SE06.001\n\n\n\n[[Page S10586]]\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Now, the Senator from New York mentions her 1-year \nextension bill. I will also discuss the Senator's 1-year extension, her \nresolution for Ryan White, her solution that would simply delay the \nreauthorization for another year. It simply says to those States that \nhave not been getting adequate funds: We do not care about you, and you \nare not going to get adequate funds. We are going to re-debate all of \nthis again next year. We are not even going to move toward making it \nfair.\n  The underlying bipartisan, bicameral bill has a provision providing 3 \nyears of hold harmless funds for New York. For 3 years, New York will \nnot have to follow the formula. They would like to have 5 years. The 3 \nyears already in the bill is at the expense of the other States. The 5 \nyears would be at the expense of the other States, although I will \ncover a question that was asked yesterday in a little while.\n  This is not a time to delay. This is a time to act. We absolutely \ncannot delay the much needed updates to current formulas that ensure \nthat all Americans with HIV and AIDS are treated fairly and have access \nto life-sparing treatments no matter their race, their gender, or where \nthey live.\n  We have a chart that shows the losses that would occur under current \nlaw versus the gains that would occur after this reauthorization. The \nred States here are going to lose significant funding under the current \nlaw, beginning on October 1. One hundred thousand Americans are going \nto be left out. The chart on the right, the blue chart, shows the gains \nunder the Ryan White authorization. All States gain except five, who \nlose less funds under the reauthorization than they would under current \nlaw. Only two of the five are asking for a difference.\n  The time is now or never. As soon as the clock strikes midnight \ntomorrow, thousands of Americans will begin losing access to life-\nsparing treatment unless we pass this bill now. This amendment does not \naddress this fact. This amendment would extend a formula that will \ncause dramatic reductions in funding to many States and thousands of \nAmericans.\n  The House has passed this critical legislation, and now five Senators \nmust decide if they will stand in the way of bipartisan legislation \nwith broad support--a bill that will ensure equitable treatment for all \nAmericans living with HIV and AIDS. I would say, I believe that is down \nto four Senators now.\n  Now, my second problem with the bill of the Senator from New York is \nthat it shuts out Americans infected with HIV and does not provide them \nwith equal access to treatment. Rather, it focuses on outdated funding \nformulas that only examine AIDS, not the full spectrum of the disease.\n  Just like her numbers on funding per person, the Senator from New \nYork refuses to acknowledge those with HIV. This chart shows that \ntoday, in over 25 States, half of the cases in those States are not \ncounted because those Americans only have HIV, not AIDS. These States \nreceive funding for less than half their total HIV/AIDS cases because \nof the current, outdated, failed formula. Half the Nation does not \nreceive enough funds to provide the most basic care to their residents. \nNow, my third problem with the bill of the Senator from New York or the \nSenator from New Jersey is that it ducks the key issue. Rather than \nmore equitable distribution for funding and more equitable access to \ntreatment for all Americans, my colleagues supporting this bill are \nsimply throwing more money at the problem, assuming it will ensure more \nequitable access to lifesaving treatments. We know this is simply not \nthe case because it does not solve the inherent flaws in the funding \nformulas.\n  Now, this chart shows that under the current law, more than 3 percent \nof Ryan White funding is returned to the Treasury each year. That is \nmore than 3 percent--much of this coming from New York and New Jersey, \nthe very States that objected to the passage of the bill that would \nmore equitably distribute funding across the Nation.\n  Again, you will see here that under the current law, New York is \nreceiving $509 per case more than the national average. Under the new \nbill, they would still get $304 more than the average case per person \nacross the United States. And they have an average $29 million unspent. \nNew Jersey, the other State, is receiving $310 above the national \naverage. They would still get $88 above the national average. This bill \ndoes not get to equity. This bill moves toward equity. And it does not \nmove there until 3 years from now. Other bills we have done start \ntransitioning immediately.\n  Now, I am surprised that the Senator from New York or New Jersey \nwould offer a bill to increase funding, ignoring the outdated formula \nissues, only to increase the inequity of the program and allow more \nfunds that could save lives to be returned to the Treasury each year. \nWhy would we offer more money to States that are already grossly \noverpaid and unable to spend their money and increase the disparities \nof outdated funding formulas, further harming those States with an \nemerging crisis?\n  This amendment would have us give a few States even more money than \nthey are receiving now, while the majority of the States will receive \nsignificantly less funding over the next year. The Senators from New \nYork and New Jersey want to extend this inequity rather than fixing the \nformula, fixing the formula now, fixing it before the tomorrow-night \ndeadline, to allow fair and equitable treatment and access to care for \nAmericans who have none now.\n  I can tell you that the HIV/AIDS community and families want this \nbill now. Now, perhaps my colleague can explain why she wants to give \nmore money to States that cannot spend what they already have, while \ntaking money away from States that are struggling, as we speak, to \nprovide the basic life-sparing treatments to their residents. We are \ntalking about life and death here. It seems they want to throw money at \nStates where the epidemic started and ignore the areas where the \nepidemic has spread, underfunding areas in a growing crisis.\n\n  When you look at the money being spent, what we are talking about in \nthis amendment is saving institutions, not saving people, not saving \nlives. This is not an economic development bill. This is not meant to \nassure that institutions that might be interested in providing these \nservices still get the same amount of funds to do so even though they \ndo not have as many people to provide the services to as they are being \npaid for.\n  I wish putting more money into the program could fix these inequities \nbut, unfortunately, these inequities stem from outdated funding \nformulas and a lack of accountability. We must address the problem at \nits core and ensure that we are not denying the growing number of \nminorities and women living with HIV and AIDS equal protection under \nthe Ryan White CARE Act.\n  Now, another comment by the Senator from New York was that she needs \nmore money because it is more expensive to provide care in New York. \nThe big cost driver is HIV/AIDS medication, costs that are similar in \nevery State. Therefore, I do not understand that claim, unless it is \nprotection of the institutions rather than the people.\n  I have another unanimous consent request that I intend to propound, \nand I, again, am hoping that someone will be here to object who is \nactually objecting to the bill instead of sending a surrogate who has \nhad to go through this ritual several times already, even though he \nsupports the bill, because the request earlier, of course, was to have \na chance to vote on the bill of the Senator from New York and the \nSenator from New Jersey. And I am going to offer that. I am going to \noffer a short time for debate and a vote on that and then a vote on the \nbipartisan, bicameral bill that has already passed the House.\n  I am hoping that somebody actually involved in the substitute bill \nwill come to the floor to either agree or object. That should be fair. \nThey can have a vote. It seems reasonable to me. But it really ought to \nbe the people offering the amendment who say they have the better idea, \neven though it leaves out the HIV folks, hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans. This amendment doesn't even provide a quick fix for 1 more \nyear, because it keeps the flawed formulas that will cause tremendous \nfunding shortfalls in place. They will come back in another year then \nand ask for 5 more years of being held harmless.\n  I want to get a vote on the bill that includes HIV and follows the \npatient.\n\n[[Page S10587]]\n\nWe need to do that. We need to do it today, not tomorrow, not next \nmonth. Tomorrow night, a bunch of States will be in crisis--and their \nresidents with HIV/AIDS will begin losing access to care. I would \nimagine in their amendment they have slipped in a little thing to \nprotect the States that will fall into a trap tomorrow. But let's not \njust throw money at the problem, let's do the right thing for the long-\nterm, for the entire Nation. Let's solve the formula. Let's do what we \nhave done on a number of other bills that have gone through my \ncommittee, which is to look at the formula and say: What is fair to all \nthe States?\n  I have to say, there are some people on my committee and others in \nthis body who have said: If I look at the charts and I see what is \nhappening to my State, yes, I may lose some money, but we are trying to \ncome up with a solution that solves a problem across this country. And \nthat is what we are here for, to solve problems across the country. I \ncan tell you that the HIV/AIDS families and community want it to be \nfair and want the bill we have been asking unanimous consent on for \nseveral days now.\n  So I will be asking for unanimous consent. I will throw in this \nopportunity to have a vote on the other bill, to see if people want to \ndo more of the same or if they want to fix this over a period of time, \nagain, holding all States harmless for 3 years before we move into a \ntransition to full fairness.\n  Just last night the House passed this critical, bipartisan, bicameral \nlegislation by an overwhelming bipartisan vote, 325 to 98, and sent it \nto us to act upon it immediately. The House understood the critical, \ntime-sensitive nature of this legislation. Now the Senate must act \nquickly to reauthorize this critical program by September 30; \notherwise, hundreds of thousands of individuals in States and the \nDistrict of Columbia will lose access to lifesaving services. The only \nthing standing between us and the President's signature to enact this \nbill is a Senate vote on the House bill--or perhaps a Senate vote on \nthe possible substitute amendment and then a vote on the House bill.\n  Now, I have asked the Senate to move this critical legislation two \nother times. Currently, four Senators from two States are blocking a \nvote and thus may prevent many individuals and families from receiving \ncritical AIDS and HIV treatment under a more equitable program.\n  I appreciate the number of my colleagues who have been on the floor \nto talk about the people in their States who are dying because they are \non a waiting list and cannot get the treatment, because they have had \nhuge influxes of population, huge increases in the number of people who \nhave been infected by HIV and AIDS. We cannot let that happen. We \ncannot continue that. We cannot continue to say: Well, if we have been \nshipping money to one part of the country, we are going to continue to \nship money to that part of the country even though the problem has \nshifted. So four Senators are blocking us.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the \nhard work of the Senators from California on this legislation. I \nappreciate their willingness to continue to talk to us to address their \nconcerns. They have indicated they are no longer objecting to this \nlegislation. I thank them. However, this bill, due to other objections, \nis still not moving forward.\n  This legislation ensures that Federal moneys are distributed more \nfairly and the dollars will follow the person. This is something our \noutdated funding formula failed to do. Hundreds of thousands of people \nliving with HIV and AIDS, who live in these States, will be needlessly \nharmed if a few Senators continue obstructing good policy.\n  What is more, these four Senators will not come to the floor to \ndefend their objection to this critical legislation at a time when we \nare talking about it. So today I will ask again for the Senators from \nNew York and New Jersey to come to the floor themselves, lodge their \nobjections, listen to the unanimous consent request, where I am going \nto offer them the right to have a vote on their bill, in exchange for \nthe right to vote on the bill that came out of committee--the bill that \nis bicameral and bipartisan.\n\n  Now, as part of the unanimous consent request, I am also allowing \nthose Senators to offer that amendment, of course, the opportunity for \nthem to put forward their best solution for dealing with the concerns \nthey have. We have run hundreds of programs trying to come up with the \nmost equitable way to do this. The one we are presenting is the one we \nfound that had the most people to support it. I was told this is \nidentical to the bill introduced by the New York and New Jersey \ndelegations this week. That is the amendment we would be voting on. \nThis bill and/or amendment is not a solution; rather, it is a harmful \ndelay, putting off what we should and must do today.\n  These States simply raise objections about what funds are received \nthis year compared to last year. These States were grossly overpaid \nlast year and will continue to be overpaid next year. However, they \nwill no longer be grossly overpaid under the bill I am proposing. These \nfew Senators keep saying they will lose money under the \nreauthorization. No matter the dollar formula they say they may lose on \na given day, it doesn't add up to the amount of dollars they would \nstand to carry over from the current flawed formula. The State of New \nYork would carry over an average of $150 million over 5 years.\n  According to GAO data, even with the formula adjustment that will \nallow for more equitable treatment, save lives in more places, New York \nwould still carry over about $115 million based on their past spending. \nIn the past, New York and New Jersey have been able to under-spend \nhundreds of millions of leftover dollars. At the same time, 25 other \nStates are struggling to provide even the most basic life-sparing \nmedications to their residents living with HIV/AIDS. Because of the \ncurrent flawed formula, this amendment doesn't even count Americans \nliving with HIV. New York can afford to generously offer more than 495 \ndifferent medications to their residents. That is 23 times the number \nof medications that Louisiana is able to offer their HIV/AIDS residents \nbecause of a lack of appropriate funding. While New York offers a range \nof elective drugs, many other States are unable to provide the basic \nlife-sparing treatments that every American should have access to. This \nis indefensible. New York carries over an average of $30 million each \nyear; yet, 25 other States are having significant difficulty providing \nthe basic drugs to all of its eligible residents. Eleven States have \nwaiting lists--that is right, residents in 11 States are unable to \nreceive life-sparing treatments because their States do not receive \nappropriate funds.\n  New York, in 2005, spent an astonishing $25 million on administration \ncosts for just two titles of this law. That is more than the entire \namount of money received by 38 States in 2005 for those two titles to \nprovide care to their residents with HIV/AIDS. This inequity must be \naddressed, and it is addressed in this reauthorization. Stalling now \nbecause a couple States stand to lose a fraction of the money they \nalready cannot spend is indefensible. Lives are at risk and a solution \nis on the table today. A solution has been passed by the House and is \nbefore us now.\n  I hope those four Senators will defend their objection and allow a \nvote on their amendment. The continued expansion of the AIDS epidemic \nin this country is a certainty. While the epidemic continues in the \nurban areas in the country, the number of new cases not diagnosed in \nsmall urban, suburban, and rural areas are reaching alarming levels. As \nthe epidemic expands in all these areas, local health care systems have \noften been unable to meet the growing demands for medical and support \nservices.\n  The problems created in rural areas are often similar to those \nexperienced in large cities. However, these problems are exacerbated by \npoor health care infrastructure and limited experience with HIV/AIDS \ncare. The lack of trained primary care providers, the absence of long-\nterm care facilities, the scarcity of resources, and a scattered \npopulation are additional obstacles that may be faced in a developing, \ncoordinated outpatient service program.\n  If New York thinks it is more expensive to handle a new problem, they \nought to deal with the distances these people have to travel in some of \nthe rural areas to get care for some of the most basic ailments. Small \nareas are\n\n[[Page S10588]]\n\nalso often not able to provide the specialized services required by \nsome persons with HIV. When primary services are unavailable, \nindividuals and families must travel long distances to receive the \nnecessary care. Furthermore, rural health care systems must address not \nonly the epidemic but also other conditions, including substance abuse, \nmental illness, and sexually transmitted diseases which they may be \npoorly equipped to deal with.\n  Thus, as we think of the problem today in its expansion into rural \nareas, we must provide the same effort to those areas we did for urban \nareas in the early 1990s. We must target resources to those in need and \nassure that those infected with HIV and living with AIDS will receive \nour support and our compassion, regardless of their race, gender or \nwhere they live.\n  Finally, I want to answer the question posed by the Senator from \nMinnesota last night. Senator Dayton asked what it would cost to give \nthese States, over the next 5 years, the same amount of money as they \nreceive presently. Alarmingly, to keep those States whole, it would \ncost $614 million a year. That is over half a billion for the next 5 \nyears.\n  It is not possible just to provide increases to New York and New \nJersey due to the funding distribution; therefore, to ensure that \neverybody receives as much money per person with HIV that New York is \ncurrently receiving, it would cost over $3 billion--if we went to \nequity, it would cost $3 billion, or a 30 percent increase in Ryan \nWhite funding to maintain States' funding level that are grossly \noverpaid and unable to spend the money they do receive.\n  Our obligation as Senators is to the people of the United States. We \nstill have four Senators who continue to obstruct the Senate from \npassing a bill because of the September 30 deadline--a bill which \npassed the House 325-to-98, a bill that can save more than 100,000 \nlives, including the lives of the growing number of women and \nminorities who are afflicted by this devastating disease, and provides \nthe money to where it is needed most.\n  As I said last night, this is not an economic development project. \nThe bottom line is simply, where States have more people with HIV/AIDS, \nthey should get more money. Where States have less people with HIV/\nAIDS, they should get less money. As we all know, the Ryan White \nprogram provides critical health care services for people infected with \nHIV and AIDS. These individuals rely on this vital program for drugs \nand other services. We need to pass this legislation so we can provide \nthem with the treatment they desperately need.\n  I urge the Senators who are holding up the bill to stop playing the \nnumbers game so the Ryan White CARE Act funding can address the \nepidemic of today, not yesterday.\n  I ask the Chair how much time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I will yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nAlabama, Mr. Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. Chairman Enzi has \ndone a fine job, and he is known for his fairness and his hard work. \nUnder his leadership, State after State has agreed to this new and \nfairer formula. Unfortunately, we have a few privileged States who want \nto maintain an extraordinary funding stream and are denying funding to \nthe other States that are in crisis today.\n  I have spoken with Kathie Hiers, the director of AIDS Alabama, who is \nvery articulate on these issues, Mary Elizabeth Marr, who runs the AIDS \ncenter in Huntsville, and Jane Cheeks, the State AIDS director, and \nthey have explained to me how unfair the current system is.\n  Mr. President, I could not be prouder to serve on the committee with \nSenator Enzi, and I greatly appreciate his leadership to help those of \nus whose States are facing a national crisis.\n  I would like to briefly show this chart and make a few points. \nSenator Hatch, who wrote the Ryan White Act, is here. Ryan White was \nfrom Indiana. He was not from a large city. But Senator Hatch \nconsidered the AIDS challenges facing America, and at the time, this \ndisease appeared to be a greater problem in bigger cities. The whole \nNation contributed money to fight this epidemic in the crisis area \ncities.\n  The money that was spent fighting AIDS in these cities had a \ntremendous impact. However, the geography of the disease has changed. \nWhere is the growth of AIDS today? Where are the surging numbers? HIV \nand AIDS are increasing at a greater rate in the South. Seventy percent \nof the new HIV cases in my State are African Americans, and the \ngreatest growth rate by far is among African American women. My State \nis not receiving adequate funding to treat the greater numbers of \npeople in our State that are living with HIV/AIDS.\n  I would like to again point out that the formula used to determine \nfunding has a number of serious flaws. One of these flaws is that we \ncount AIDS cases for funding, but we do not count HIV positive cases, \ndespite the fact that HIV is the precursor to fully-developed AIDS. In \ncontrast to the early years of this disease, we have medicines that can \nbe given to people who have HIV before it has developed into AIDS. \nThese drugs have been proven to delay the onset of AIDS so that the \npeople that have access to them can live a more healthy life.\n  How is it possible that we are not including the people who have HIV \nin the funding formula?\n  These are the people that need to be put on medicines at once. We now \nknow that a pregnant women who has HIV will give birth to a child \nwithout AIDS if she is given the right medicines. However, if she is \nnot given these drugs, she faces a greater probability that her child \ncould be born with AIDS. This clearly is a very serious, life-and-death \nissue, and one that we must confront. We have continued to be generous \nwith AIDS funding, but that generosity certainly would require that we \nshift the money to follow the disease. The money should not follow \nbureaucracies and established systems where it cannot be spent. For \nexample, New York was not able to spend $29 million last year, yet \nunder the same formula, Alabama receives only $11 million for the whole \nState for the entire year. The money that they had and were unable to \nspend is nearly 3 times more than our complete funding, yet Alabama has \nwaiting lists for people who are in desperate need of these drugs. The \npeople on our waiting lists must wait before they can become eligible \nfor these drugs because we don't have enough money to pay for them. We \ncannot afford to pay for more than 40 drugs in Alabama, but New York is \nable to provide nearly 500 drugs to their AIDS patients. This is just \nnot right.\n\n  To conclude, I find it unfortunate that we have seen such partisan, \nparochial interest in protecting those who receive excessive federal \nbenefits when these benefits are no longer justified. The U.S. \nGovernment and the American people were generous to New York, San \nFrancisco, and other big cities. We saw that these cities were in a \ncrisis with this disease, and so we gave them a disproportionate \namount. These cities are not entitled to keep forever the benefits we \nhave been giving, and now we are experiencing crises in other States. I \nthink it is a sad day indeed that there are Senators blocking this \nreform and blocking the re-authorization of the act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair and yield the floor. I would like to \nnote my appreciation for Senator Hatch and his leadership on this \nissue.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Utah, \nSenator Hatch, who has been actively involved in the HIV/AIDS \ndiscussion for years. In fact, he selected the Ryan White name for this \nbill many years ago when he chaired this committee.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my chairman. I am grateful to be \nwith him on this bill. I am one of the prime authors of the Ryan White \nAct. I stood here on the floor, with Mrs. White sitting up in the \ngallery, and recognized it and named it the Ryan White bill.\n  I rise again to support the effort to call up and immediately adopt \nS. 2823, the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act. I thank \nour chairman and others who worked so hard on this bill to bring it \nhere.\n  It makes no sense that this product of bipartisan, bicameral effort \nshould\n\n[[Page S10589]]\n\nbe held up at the eleventh hour by Members representing only two \nStates--three at one time, but at least the two Senators from \nCalifornia backed off and now realize that they are not doing what is \nright here.\n  Given that the theme of this bipartisan, bicameral effort was to \ncraft something that would help even out the playing field for all U.S. \nStates and territories, it makes even less sense for these holds to be \nplaced on behalf of States that currently enjoy substantially generous \nfunding. In some areas of these States, the funding is so generous that \nwe have heard reports of Ryan White dollars being spent on dog-walking \nservices, haircuts, candlelight dinners, and four-star hotels. I, for \none, am pretty fed up with it, and to have four liberal Senators on \nthis floor holding this up is just outrageous.\n  Furthermore, some States carry over millions of unspent dollars every \nyear, and some continue to receive funding for people who are no longer \nliving. This is happening while people die in areas where the epidemic \nis newer because under the current Ryan White structure, their location \ndictates that they should receive less money for care. This \nreauthorization bill would fix that broken program structure.\n  Let me make it clear that my home State of Utah does not stand to \ngain large increases in funding. Our State AIDS director understands \nand supports the need for equity within the program. Due to efficient \nadministration of the Ryan White program, Utah is able to manage its \nfunding so that it can--just barely--avoid an ADAP waiting list for \npharmaceuticals. Utah can do this even though it receives an average of \n$1,315 less per patient in Ryan White funding than does New York, \n$1,330 per patient less than New Jersey, and $843 per patient less than \nCalifornia, just to mention three States. The New York and New Jersey \nSenators are holding up this bill.\n  I could go on and on about this because there are really only about \nfive States that receive less funding per patient than Utah. But I am \nnot going to do that, and that is precisely my point. My point is that \nthis should not be about who gets the most money. I find it \ndisconcerting that I have to point out, once again, that this program \nassists people who could die if it is not reauthorized this week. It is \nas simple as that. I have received numerous letters from the HIV/AIDS \ncommunity urging that the Senate reauthorize this program before it \nadjourns this week. I also remind my colleagues that President Bush has \ncharged Congress with reauthorizing this program.\n  Last night, the House passed H.R. 6143, the Ryan White HIV/AIDS \nTreatment Modernization Act of 2006, by a vote of 325 to 98. The vote \ntotal includes over half of the House Democrats voting for this bill. \nWhat happened to the other half? They are always out here talking about \ncompassion and talking about reason and talking about how good they are \nto the poor. Here is a chance to do some good for the poor. We worked \nhard to get everything together on this bill, and we have four liberal \nSenators holding it up. It is ridiculous.\n  I am the coauthor of three of the AIDS bills. I remember when we \nbrought the first one to the floor. It was a big battle. I was the \nconservative who stood up for it. We finally won, and we won on all \nthree of them. Like I say, I named this bill the Ryan White bill right \nhere on the floor of the Senate.\n  As I mentioned, the House passed its bill last night with \noverwhelming bipartisan support. I implore my colleagues in the Senate \nto do the same, to work in the best interest of the entire Nation and \npass this reauthorization.\n  I am really upset about it, and I think everybody ought to be upset \nabout it. Sometimes we get extreme worrying about who gets the money \nand who gets this and who gets that. New York and New Jersey are not \nbeing mistreated here. Some States will always think they are not \ngetting enough money no matter what we do here. We have to work on \nthis.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I thank my colleagues for their \nforbearance.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it is my understanding that I have 9 minutes \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Chair, and since there is a Senator now here \nfrom one of the two states objecting to us moving on with the Ryan \nWhite HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act, I would like to propound \nthe unanimous consent.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 6143, which was received from the \nHouse. I ask unanimous consent that the only amendment in order be an \namendment by Senator Lautenberg, which is the text of S. 3944, with 30 \nminutes of debate equally divided. I ask consent that following the \ndisposition of that amendment, the bill, as amended, if amended, be \nread the third time and passed, a motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, we just received this proposal about 15 \nminutes ago. This is a monumental issue, very important to my State and \nothers. Therefore, I must object at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am sorry to hear the objection. We have \nbeen trying to find a way, any way, to be able to move on to a vote on \nthis bill that is bipartisan, bicameral. It has already passed the \nHouse and I am sure it would pass here. So I am really disappointed.\n  Mr. President, I allocate 5 minutes of time to the Senator from North \nCarolina, Mr. Burr.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I am amazed to hear that \nsome have just become familiar with this bill. It has been negotiated \nin a bicameral, bipartisan way. It is the same bill that we have moved \nout of the committee and now the House has passed it without \nopposition, and we thought it just right to pick up the House bill.\n  But let me back up, if I can. Currently, New York offers over 500 \nMedicaid options to their HIV/AIDS patients. West Virginia has less \nthan 50 options for medication. Now, this disparity is not because West \nVirginia doesn't care about people with HIV and AIDS; this disparity is \nbecause New York and New Jersey and other States with Title I cities \nreceive more money per person than the other States. This just is not \nfair.\n  Why do some States offer 400 drugs to their residents with HIV/AIDS \nwhen other States keep waiting lists for individuals who need the most \nbasic lifesaving drugs? Well, in 2005 North Carolina contributed 40 \npercent of the cost for every individual who qualified for ADAP. ADAP \nqualification in North Carolina is 125 percent of poverty, $9,200. In \ncontrast, the same year, New York contributed 16 percent of the total \nADAP funds, and New Yorkers, under 460 percent of poverty were eligible \nfor Federal ADAP funds. New Jersey contributed only 14 percent of their \ntotal ADAP funds used, and residents of New Jersey, under 500 percent \nof poverty, are eligible for Federal funds. Why? Because the Federal \nfunds that we supply under this formula are so rich to New Jersey and \nto New York that a person with an income of $47,000 a year is eligible \nfor Federal medication on ADAP, but not in North Carolina. If they \nexceed the $9,500 income mark, because of our limited amount of \ndollars, they are no longer eligible.\n  In 2004, in a clinic in Charlotte, NC, there were 547 patients who \nmade 2,362 clinic visits. That is a little over 4 times a year. But we \nare told by individuals from these States that have more money than \nthey can use that they couldn't possibly tell us how many real HIV/AIDS \npatients they have in their State in a 3 or 5-year period.\n  The suggestion was made today that we delay this for another year so \nthat we would have an opportunity to work out some of this and they \ncould see if they could count patients. Let me suggest to my colleagues \nthat if individuals are going into a clinic and receiving Federal aid \nunder the Ryan White CARE Act, then you would be able to count them. If \nthey weren't going in to receive care under the Ryan White\n\n[[Page S10590]]\n\nCARE Act, then they shouldn't be eligible and the State doesn't need \nthe money. The fact is we are counting the people who are getting \nservices. They don't exceed the amount of money that they get, but they \nwould like to keep the extra. In fact, today, the reason that they \nwould like another year is they would like to keep on counting to see \nif they can get their numbers up to match the amount of money that they \nget.\n  The Senators from New York don't care about the fact that in 2006 the \nnational funding per AIDS case was $1,613. Yet in New York, the average \nwas $2,122 per case. In North Carolina, it is a little over $1,200 a \nyear. The other States that get a disproportionate share of money per \ncase exist, but they acknowledge that that disproportionate share is \nunfair. They realize it is unequal, and so they are willing to support \nthis bill. Let me tell my colleagues that Connecticut gets $2,887 per \nAIDS patient, while South Carolina gets $1,364; Minnesota, $2,903, \nwhile Arkansas gets $1,239; Louisiana, $2069, while North Carolina gets \n$1,166.\n  Mr. President, I thank those Members who are willing to support this \nlegislation, who are willing to let their numbers help others who will \ndie without this funding.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, for the last few seconds I am going to just \nmention that the bill by the Senators from New York and New Jersey was \nintroduced on Tuesday. Surely they have had time to think about having \nthat amendment debated and voted on in that amount of time. I am really \ndisappointed that they won't give some kind of an answer that will \nallow a vote on that amendment. If that is what they need for cover, \nthat is OK with me. I just need to get this done.\n  New York and New Jersey are stealing the future from those with HIV, \nand that just cannot happen in the U.S. Senate. We have to worry about \nall the people from all of the United States, and that is what the \nreauthorization would do. That is why it is important to do it. I have \nasked those questions numerous times now trying to find a way to bring \nthis bill up for a vote, and am being denied in every way--I am not \nbeing denied--those with HIV, those with AIDS, their families are being \ndenied the right to have a vote on this bill in the U.S. Senate.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The order is for the Senator from Minnesota to \nbe recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, will the Senator from Minnesota yield to \nme?\n  Mr. DAYTON. For the purpose of asking a question.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, under regular order, after the Senator \nfrom Minnesota speaks, are there other speakers lined up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas then has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nstatement by the Senator from Texas, the Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nGrassley, be allowed to speak for 20 minutes; following Senator \nGrassley, myself for 15 minutes, and following Senator Grassley, \nSenator Murray for 15, Senator Harkin for 10, and Senator Menendez for \n15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, with the understanding, Mr. \nPresident, that if a Republican Member wishes to speak, his time would \nbe allotted in between the times of the Democratic Members.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Montana so modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. First of all, I would like that not to be the case--well, \nthat automatically would be the case because Senator Grassley and \nmyself would follow Senator Hutchison. Following the Senator from \nTexas, then the Senator from Iowa, and then myself, and then I am \nasking following myself, that Senator Murray and Senator Harkin be \nrecognized. There will be three Republicans right in a row there \nalready, at least two, so I am just suggesting that at least Senators \nMurray and Harkin be able to follow myself.\n  Mr. GREGG. Maybe we can reserve this and discuss it for a second.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would like to lock in Senator Grassley and myself \nbecause we have been seeking this for some time.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would like to have the opportunity to make sure the \nRepublicans would have an equal amount of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would modify the request to suggest \nthat following myself and a Republican Senator to be recognized, and a \nRepublican Senator between Senator Harkin and Senator Menendez if they \nso request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 20 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10590-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10590-S10592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SECURE FENCE ACT\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise tonight to address the legislation \nthat is before the Senate, the legislation that would establish a fence \nalong the southern United States border. I intend to support this \nlegislation, despite its serious flaws. I agree that a physical barrier \nis necessary along some parts of our country's southern border.\n  Last month I visited southern border communities in Texas, New \nMexico, and Arizona, and I recognize the very serious need for \nadditional security measures there. In El Paso, TX, for example, there \nis a fence along the U.S.-Mexican border for about half the city. But \nthen that fence abruptly ends because, I was told, of lack of funding \nto extend it. That is nonsensical: A security fence that only covers \nabout half of the city that it is supposed to secure.\n  The day before I toured this area, that one Border Patrol station in \nEl Paso, TX had apprehended 268 people trying to enter our country \nillegally. That is unacceptable, and that is the reason I will support \nthis legislation. But it is only part of the solution. I asked Border \nPatrol agents across the southern border, or the real experts about \nwhat is effective and what is not to protect our border and our \ncitizens, whether a fence is a good idea. They replied that in some \nplaces it was and in other places it was not. They said it was one of \nseveral additional actions necessary for effective border control.\n  Yet this is the only measure contained in this legislation. It bears \nlittle resemblance to a comprehensive bill that the Senate previously \npassed to strengthen border security and stop illegal immigration. Its \neffectiveness, the border control experts told me last month, would be \nseverely reduced by the absence of a comprehensive approach. It will \nfurther waste taxpayer dollars by mandating a fence where a fence will \nnot be effective. In short, it suffers from the defects of being the \nhastily drafted, last-minute election ploy that it is, rather than the \ncomprehensive, intelligent, and effective border security bill that our \ncountry needs and our citizens deserve.\n  Previous attempts to secure our Nation's southern border have failed \nfor precisely this reason. They were only partial steps where only a \ncomplete solution will be successful. It is stupid for Congress to pass \nsomething that will fail, and shameful for Congress to do it for short-\nterm political benefits rather than the long-term national interest. I \nhave no doubt this legislation will pass and that it will be used by \nthose it benefits between now and the November 7 election.\n  So I plead with my colleagues and with the House to finish this job \nwhen we return after the elections. Let's have the Homeland Security \nCommittee on which I serve and other committees claiming jurisdiction \nto ask the border security experts themselves what else must be done to \nmake this fence effective. Let's get the House to drop their political \npre-election posturing and deal with the present and future realities \nof our illegal immigration problem by passing key parts of the Senate \nbill.\n  It is necessary to be tough on illegal immigration, but being tough \nand stupid is stupid. Let's challenge the House to get tough and smart \nabout protecting our southern border, as President Bush has proposed \nand as the Senate has enacted. But let's not fool ourselves and let's \nnot try to fool the American people that this legislation by itself \nwill solve or even substantially reduce the very serious flood of \nillegal aliens crossing our southern border.\n\n[[Page S10591]]\n\n  This bill is also incomplete and inadequate because it does nothing \nto strengthen our national security along our country's northern \nborder, even though that border spans 5,500 miles and is over three \ntimes longer than our 1,800-mile southern border. Our northern border \nhas not, as yet, experienced the same volume of illegal traffic as the \nsouthern border. Yet it is even more unguarded and thus unprotected. \nThere are over 11,000 Border Patrol agents stationed along our 1,800-\nmile southern border. There are only 950 agents along our entire 5,500-\nmile northern border.\n  If you are what the Border Patrol agents call an economic immigrant, \nmeaning someone who is coming into this country for a job, and you live \nsouth of the United States, you will probably try to cross our southern \nborder. The Border Patrol agents with whom I talked last month in \nTexas, New Mexico, and Arizona estimated that over 95 percent of the \npeople crossing our southern border illegally are doing so for economic \nreasons.\n  The really dangerous illegal entries are by criminals trafficking \npeople, narcotics, and other illegal activities--and most dangerously, \npossibly terrorists. Our northern border is just as much a target of \nthose most dangerous criminals, and many of them are smart and \nsophisticated enough to know that their chances of illegal entry are \nincreasingly better along our northern border than along our southern \nborder.\n  Border security for our Nation is not one border or the other--it is \nboth. Yet until now most of the attention, most of the policy, and most \nof the funding has gone only to southern border security. As I \nmentioned before, there are over 11,000 Border Patrol agents stationed \nalong our southern border, and the major training facility for all of \nthem is located in New Mexico. But there are only 950 agents along our \nentire northern border and no training facility is devoted to that \nspecialized training.\n  So I am very pleased that the fiscal year 2007 Homeland Security \nappropriations bill directs 10 percent of its funding and 10 percent of \nthe new agents hired to be committed to our northern border. That is \nalmost $38 million and over 150 new Border Patrol agents, which is most \nof what my amendment that was adopted by the Senate would accomplish. \nIt is a 15-percent increase in the number of northern Border Patrol \nagents. It is an essential first step in the right direction. However, \nit is only a first step. Much more must be done, and hopefully will \nstart to be done when we return in November.\n  I also want to comment briefly on the military tribunal bill passed \nby the Senate last night, a bill that I voted against. I want to be \ntough against terrorists, as that legislation claims to be. But I also \nwant to be smart about it, and that bill is not. Its worst provisions \nwould be applied not only to known al-Qaida members, but also to almost \n500 other detainees at Guantanamo who have been imprisoned without \ntrials for over 4 years, and to over 1,400 Iraqi citizens who are now \nimprisoned indefinitely in that country.\n  Many of them will be eventually found innocent of anti-American \nactivities and will be released. However, most of them, their families, \nand their friends, will hate the United States for the rest of their \nlives after being imprisoned for months or years, denied any due \nprocess, many of them tortured or abused, and most of their families \nrefused information about their whereabouts or even whether they are \nstill alive.\n  The recently unclassified National Intelligence Estimate concluded \nthat the war in Iraq has greatly increased anti-American feelings \nthroughout the Arab world and has created a new generation of \nterrorists. The barbaric treatment of thousands of Muslims has \nundoubtedly fueled some part of that growing hatred toward Americans \nand has added to the increased threat of terrorist attacks against us.\n  This legislation allows the continued torture of detainees, denies \nthem the basic rights to challenge their indefinite incarcerations, and \neven strips from U.S. courts their constitutional authority to review \nthis legislation and the treatment of detainees under it.\n  It is absolutely untrue--let me say that again--it is absolutely \nuntrue that providing detainees with those rights would require their \nrelease from military prisons. Under the rules of the Geneva \nConventions, even if an enemy combatant could not be prosecuted, or \neven if he were acquitted in a trial, he could still be held \nindefinitely as a prisoner of war until the President of the United \nStates declared that the war against terrorism was concluded.\n  Finally, providing humane and just treatment to detainees protects \nour own service men and women and our intelligence operatives around \nthe world. A great Republican Senator, Mr. McCain from Arizona, who was \nheld prisoner in North Vietnam for 5.5 years and who was tortured by \nhis captors, has said repeatedly that we cannot insist other countries \nabide by the Geneva Conventions and treat our citizens humanely if we \ndo not do so ourselves. In other words, we must follow the Golden Rule:\n\n       Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.\n\n  I believe that legislation which we passed last night, which I \nopposed, will ultimately be considered one of the darker acts in our \nNation's history, one that has been enacted only a handful of other \ntimes and, in every one of those instances, was regretted and \nrepudiated later because it violates the values and the principles of \nthis great Nation.\n  It is the attempt of terrorists and their desire to drive us away \nfrom those values and principles within our own country, and as we \ntreat others around the world, so we then become perceived by others \naround the world.\n  We are the greatest Nation on this Earth. We are the most powerful \nNation on this Earth. We are looked to by other countries around the \nworld as the leader of this world. We need to be true to that \nrequirement, and we need to be true to our own values and our history. \nI believe we failed to do so, tragically and regrettably, last night.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, may I ask how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator yielding his \ntime to the Senator from New Jersey?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. He wasn't going to come in between us anyway. He wants \nthe 8\\1/2\\ minutes but not right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Is there objection to the \nSenator from Minnesota yielding his 8 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Reserving the right to object, the only objection is \nabout what Senator Baucus set up; that we were going to come in line \nafterwards. I don't object to him having the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota still has a little \nunder 8 minutes on his time, and he is asking to yield that time to the \nSenator from New Jersey. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY It is better to let it go rather than argue about it and \nuse it up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Iowa. I thank my colleague \nfor yielding time, his time. I do not want to take too much time, aside \nfrom my response to what comments I heard here, but I do want to say \nthat I regret this is among the last opportunities we will have to meet \non the floor with our distinguished colleague from Minnesota, who has \nalways been forthright on the issues, sticking up for what he believes, \nno matter what the penalty.\n  Mr. President, I want to talk to another issue. I want to respond to \nthese challenges that I hear on television about where are the--\nessentially, and I will inject the word; they don't use it, but they \nsay--cowards who won't come down on the floor to defend their position? \nWho are they? Challenge me on cowardice? You have to look at my record \nbefore they start that stuff.\n  I was an original cosponsor of the Ryan White CARE Act. That was back \nin 1990. I have been an active supporter of this legislation for many \nyears now. So I do not appreciate some of the lectures I have been \nhearing from people who claim that this is a principled issue with them \nand that we are being cruel and unfair and all kinds of\n\n[[Page S10592]]\n\nthings. It is nonsense. Let's discuss the issue rationally and see \nwhere they have been all these years when we have had practically flat \nfunding on this critical issue for some 4 years now, not even meeting \nthe growth in inflation.\n  I have heard lectures about the effect on minorities. I will tell you \nsomething. The National Minority AIDS Council opposes this bill and \nsupports our objection.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a communication from them be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006\n\n       Dear Members of Congress: On behalf of the National \n     Minority AIDS Council (NMAC) and our national constituency of \n     more than 3,000 minority community based organizations on the \n     front lines of the fight against HIV/AIDS in their \n     communities, we would like to thank Congress for its efforts \n     to reauthorize the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources \n     Emergency Act (CARE Act).\n       NMAC supports the legislation's goal to retain the current \n     structure of the CARE Act while seeking to protect care \n     infrastructures and responding to demographic shifts in the \n     HIV epidemic.\n       However, we are concerned that the legislation, as drafted, \n     does not address the need of all minority populations \n     infected and affected by HIV/AIDS nationwide, and believe it \n     needs several improvements before passage in order to gain \n     our support.\n       As the nation's largest discretionary spending program \n     aimed at providing care, supportive services and treatment \n     for individuals and families infected and affected by HIV/\n     AIDS who would not otherwise receive access to these \n     services, full funding for the CARE Act is essential and the \n     appropriate authorized funding levels should be a high \n     priority of the Congress in the reauthorization of the law.\n       Unfortunately, the CARE Act has been flat-funded for a \n     number of years, even as the rate of new HIV infections is \n     consistently reported at approximately 40,000 per year.\n       Full funding for the CARE Act is critically important to \n     communities of color that have been devastated by the \n     epidemic. Without a fully funded CARE Act, at $2.6 billion, \n     many men, women and children of color will not have access to \n     this care and gaps in health disparities will grow \n     exponentially.\n       NMAC supports the direction of additional funding to areas \n     with high HIV incidence; however, with the absence of \n     additional funding states like New York, California, Florida, \n     Texas and New Jersey that have historically been epicenters \n     of the epidemic may be faced with the destabilization of \n     systems of care. We believe regions of the country should not \n     have to advocate for additional funding to the detriment of \n     other areas seeking to care for those affected by the \n     disease.\n       NMAC is also opposed to several other provisions of the \n     bill, including the inclusion of the Early Diagnosis Grant \n     Program and the lack of additional funding and resources for \n     the Minority AIDS Initiative.\n       If you have any concerns or questions about our concerns, \n     please feel free to contact Damon Dozier, NMAC Director of \n     Government Relations and Public Policy at (202) 234-5120 \n     extension 308 or HYPERLINK ``mailto:ddozier@nmac.orq''.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Ryan White CARE Act reauthorization legislation \nthat is before us now would shift already inadequate Ryan White money \naway from States such as New Jersey where the epidemic first appeared \nand where the need is still growing, to States where the epidemic is \nemerging.\n  I have been to an AIDS ward in a hospital in Jersey City. I have \nlooked in those cribs where those little things are, twitching and \nmoving because they come from mothers who have been HIV-infected, and \nthe effect is horrible to witness. These are poor people.\n  In this State of mine we have five of America's poorest urban \ncenters. That is where we see the dominance of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\n  This bill pits cities against cities, States against States, women \nagainst men, and urban areas against rural areas. That is not the way \nto do it, if you really care. We need to fully fund the Ryan White CARE \nAct. But the majority is not willing to do that. So they are trying to \nsteal the funds away from States that have the need and already have \nthe population to serve.\n  It is less than amusing for me to hear people who oppose adequate \nfunding for this program suddenly act like this is the primary concern \nto them, that everybody else who doesn't agree with them is cowardly. \nAnd these four Senators they keep identifying--I am one of the four, \nproud to be one of those four. If there is a newly emerging problem in \nrural areas, then there is one answer--add money, add funding. But \ninstead of funding AIDS treatment, the Senators on the other side of \nthe aisle who are not here to defend the tax giveaways or the cost of \nthe war--they voted to give away AIDS funding money to wealthy \nAmericans, the wealthiest among us, in massive tax cuts. That's OK. \nGive that money to the rich so these poor little things, shivering in \ntheir cribs, can just do with a little bit less than they have. How \nabout, instead of the estate tax cut for Paris Hilton--substantial \nfunds--I ask my colleagues, why don't they come out here, protest that, \nand say let's give that money to help people with AIDS?\n  The majority has allowed President Bush to turn Iraq into such a mess \nthat we are spending over $2 billion a week. Our whole program is $2 \nbillion a year. So why don't we cut back for a couple of weeks, give it \nto support treatment for HIV/AIDS. What if we could take just 1 week's \nworth of spending in Iraq for AIDS treatment?\n  We still have a massive problem in our States, and maybe they have an \nemerging problem. My suggestion, with all my heart, fund it. Find the \nmoney for it. But don't take it away from a neighbor or another State \nwhere the problems are overwhelming as well.\n  In my home State of New Jersey, we have the highest proportion of \ncumulative AIDS cases in women. We rank third in cumulative pediatric \nAIDS cases. Furthermore, we have consistently ranked fifth in overall \ncumulative AIDS cases since the beginning of this epidemic.\n  Yet under the reauthorization proposal, we stand to lose $70 million. \nIt is unacceptable. It is not acceptable for us to simply say this is a \nformula fight and there will undoubtedly be winners and losers because \nthe losers in this case pay a terrible price.\n  With the Ryan White CARE Act, when we talk about losers we are \ntalking about lives being lost. I for one will not settle for such an \noutcome. I object to this process and to this bill because it is a \nshortsighted approach to how we take care of HIV and AIDS patients in \nthe future.\n  This bill will take hope away from people living with HIV/AIDS to \nurban areas in large States. I will not let it happen on my watch, no \nmatter how challenging or how vitriolic the suggestions are made \ntalking as if we are afraid to come out. We are not afraid at all to \ndefend our position. We just think theirs is wrong.\n  Come out and tell the truth about how you feel about it and say, \nlet's find more money. Let's have a debate about higher funding for the \nRyan White CARE Act and see if we can get the necessary means to cover \nour needs.\n  I don't think you are going to hear that from the Senators who were \nso bold in their accusations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank you. I will continue to object \nto going forward with this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, would you signal to me when I have used \n15 minutes of my 20 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10592-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10592-S10596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           SORRY FATE OF TAX EXTENDERS IN ``TRAILER'' PACKAGE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we've hit the end of the road on trying \nto pass the trailer bill separately. It is pretty clear we won't get a \nbill to the President's desk before we recess for the upcoming mid-term \nelections.\n  From my perspective the right thing to do is to pass legislation that \nresolves two important tax policy issues. The issues are a permanent \ndeath tax relief package and the trailer bill which contains a \nretroactive extension of several tax relief provisions. Those \nprovisions expired on December 31, 2005. That is the right date--\nDecember 31, 2005. Taxpayers have lived with uncertainty on these \nbipartisan, widely-supported provisions for almost 9 months or three-\nquarters of a year.\n  How did we get here? How come we can't get a permanent death tax \nrelief deal when it is clear that more than 60 Senators are on record \nin support of repeal or significant relief? How come we can't get a \nresolution of expired tax provisions that are overwhelmingly supported \nin both the House and Senate? This uncertainty is solely the \nresponsibility of the leadership of both\n\n[[Page S10593]]\n\nparties here in the United States Senate.\n  We are stuck on death tax because the Democratic leadership won't let \nenough Democratic Senators vote their conscience. It's all because of \npolitical calculations. That's a shame. Family farmers and small \nbusiness owners deserve an answer to the uncertainty posed by the death \ntax. My answer would be to repeal the death tax. Repeal isn't in the \ncards. We have had votes to prove it. Unfortunately, the political \nproof that repeal wasn't in the cards didn't materialize until the \ncloture vote we had back in June.\n  The American people deserve a final and definitive answer on death \ntax relief. As we go home, they have only to look to the Senate \nDemocratic leadership and ask why the Senate was not permitted to work \nits will on this issue.\n  I want to tell the rightfully disappointed family farmers and small \nbusiness folks that we will resolve the death tax problem. It should \nhave been resolved by now. And, it will be resolved in a way that \nfocuses on family farms and small businesses. I pledge to family \nfarmers and small business folks, especially those in my home state of \nIowa, that I will devote my energy and resources, as chairman of the \nSenate Finance Committee, to resolving this problem.\n  Let's turn to the trailer bill. It's an odd name for a bill. The bill \nhas been held up for so long some folks have probably forgotten the \nbasis of the nickname. I will remind you. It's a trailer bill because \nit covers tax provisions that dropped out of the tax relief \nreconciliation conference agreement. That conference agreement included \nthe cornerstones of both the House and Senate bills. The cornerstone of \nthe House bill was a 2-year extension of the lower rates on capital \ngains and dividends. The cornerstone of the Senate bill was an \nextension of the hold-harmless on the alternative minimum tax--``AMT''. \nI was pleased we covered the cornerstones of both bills. We only had \nrevenue room to cover the cornerstones. The other provisions, \nprincipally the tax extenders, were decided to travel in a bill to \nfollow or ``trail.'' Hence the name trailer bill.\n  The trailer bill took several weeks of intense negotiations. The \nnegotiators were Chairman Thomas for the House and Senator Baucus and \nme for the Senate. They were tough negotiations, but they produced a \nfair agreement. That agreement was included in the trailer piece of the \ntrifecta. The House ratified Chairman Thomas's agreement when it passed \nthe trifecta.\n  In my view, the agreement is closed. No items should be subtracted. \nNo items should be added. A deal is a deal. Let me repeat that. A deal \nis a deal. Changes should only occur if all the parties to the \nagreement consent. We don't have another 5 to 6 weeks to re-negotiate \nthe trailer bill.\n  In getting to that agreement, I pushed hard for several Senate issues \nto be resolved. I'm referring to items other than the basic 2-year \nextension of provisions that expired on December 31, 2005. Let me go \nthrough a few of those items.\n  First off, there is the abandoned mines reclamation--AML--fund \nproposal. Senators Santorum, Byrd, and Rockefeller took the lead in \nthis plan. Chairman Enzi did the heavy lifting.\n  Secondly, there is a package of added incentives to enhance Hurricane \nKatrina rebuilding efforts. Senator Lott took the lead on this package, \nalong with the support of Senators Vitter, and Landrieu.\n  Third, there are tax relief incentives for mine safety. Senators \nByrd, Santorum, and Rockefeller argued for these important provisions.\n  Fourth, there is an expansion of the veterans mortgage bonds program. \nThis is a program that the states use to provide veterans who return \nfrom combat with low-interest loans so that they can buy their families \na home. Senators DeWine and Smith advanced these provisions.\n  Fifth, there is a proposal to provide a deduction for private \nmortgage insurance--PMI--for low-income home purchasers. Senators \nLincoln and Smith worked hard to secure these provisions.\n  Sixth, there is a proposal to level the playing field between \nindividual and corporate timber capital gains transactions. This \nproposal will insure that timber-growing areas and related mill towns \nwill not be disadvantaged if the timber company is a corporation. Most, \nnot all, of the Senators from the timber growing states in the Pacific \nNorthwest and southeast had an interest in this provision.\n  These are a few of the proposals that were negotiated and resolved in \nthe trailer package. In my role as Finance Committee chairman, I \nprotected these Senate positions. I expect our Senate Leadership to \nback me as we proceed. I am protecting Senators and Senate positions, \nso you would think they would automatically back me. To reiterate, a \ndeal is a deal. The House has affirmed the deal with its vote on the \ntrifecta. There should be no backsliding on the deal.\n  Now, we haven't been able to move a separate trailer bill because the \nRepublican Leadership wants to use the trailer as a ``sweetener'' for \nvotes for death tax relief at some future point. I have been pushing \nfor a separate bill for a lot of reasons. Some Republican colleagues \nhave complained about my efforts, using terms like ``whining'' to \ndescribe my persistence.\n  Why push so hard for a separate bill, some have asked. There are \nthree key reasons. The first is the 19 million taxpayers who may face \ncompliance problems because of incomplete IRS forms. The second reason \nis the hundreds of thousands of business taxpayers who have been in \nlimbo waiting for final approval of measures like the research and \ndevelopment tax credit. Third, I'm virtually certain that the \nleadership's strategy of trying to use unrelated ``sweeteners'' to turn \nDemocratic votes for a death tax deal will continue to fail.\n  Let's go through these reasons, one-by-one.\n  First, take a look at the Finance Committee website. On September 13, \nand 26, 2006, you will find press releases that explain Finance \nCommittee tax staff research. At my request, the tax staff looked into \nthe effects of delaying action on the three widely-applicable expired \nmiddle-income tax relief provisions. I am talking about the deductions \nfor college tuition, teacher's out-of-pocket classroom expenses, and \nState sales tax. You will see that we are talking about a group of up \nto 19 million tax filers being affected. Tax filers means families \nfiling jointly and individuals filing as singles. In other words, we \nare talking about a lot more than 19 million taxpayers. Let me repeat \nthat. More than 19 million taxpayers. The professional staff, all \nexperienced tax practitioners who discussed this problem with the IRS, \ncame to the conclusion that delaying action on extenders into the lame \nduck would have adverse consequences for that group of 19 million \ntaxpayers. I won't go into details, you will find them on the website.\n  Let me say that serving as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee \nis a privilege and a responsibility. I thank the people of Iowa and my \nfriends and colleagues in the Senate Republican Caucus for that \nprivilege. I enjoy every day I serve as chairman, but it brings \nresponsibilities as well. One of those responsibilities is tax policy. \nNow, whether an individual Senator agrees or disagrees with a \nparticular expiring tax relief matter is debatable. We all have \nopinions on these things. Probably no two Finance Committee members, \nlet alone two U.S. Senators not on the committee, agree on all expiring \ntax relief measures. What we ought to agree on, is that we should not \ndeliberately, and I underline the word deliberately, take actions to \nunnecessarily complicate taxpayers' efforts to comply with our \nadmittedly complex tax system. That's what delaying action on these \nprovisions means. There's no ifs, ands, or buts. If we do not act \nbefore the 2006 IRS forms are finalized we're causing problems for \nthese 19 million taxpayers. It's just not right.\n  As chairman, I would not be doing my job if I stayed silent. I had to \nspeak out. It's my responsibility to those millions of taxpayers. Some \nhave called it whining. Some might call it annoying. Others could call \nit persistence. I call it doing my job. When you are talking about up \nto 19 million middle-income taxpayers who are trying their best to \ncomply with the tax system, I will whine until I run out of breath. I \ntried to remedy this problem by persuading my leadership to change\n\n[[Page S10594]]\n\nits mind. I did it in a way that is respectful of the rights and \nresponsibilities of the leadership. I'm disappointed and frustrated \nthat leadership has failed to act.\n  The second reason I pressed for a separate trailer bill is to deal \nwith long-expired business-related tax incentives. These matters, like \nthe research and development tax credit, are overwhelmingly popular in \nthe House and Senate. Businesses have been in limbo on these \nprovisions. We are talking about almost 9 months of limbo now and at \nleast another month of limbo. A lot of businesses, in good faith, \nrelied on my assurances. They relied on assurances of the Congressional \nleadership, made in May of this year. These business folks were assured \nthat these extenders would be done. In my State, Rockwell-Collins, of \nCedar Rapids, is taking a financial hit because of our dilly-dallying. \nAnd it is not just management that cares. Iowa is a manufacturing State \nand we are proud of our ``R & D.'' Thousands of Iowa employees of these \ncompanies have the right to ask why this popular provision is being \ndelayed. Some of them could ask why something this popular is a \n``hostage'' to be cavalierly shot? They could ask me if political \n``credibility'' of threats is more important than a job-based \nincentive?\n  When they ask me these questions, I could blame the Democratic \nleadership for thwarting Republican efforts to get death tax relief. \nCertainly, there's truth to that defense. But, the Iowa workers, as \nmost Midwesterners, want to know the bottom-line. Blaming the other \nside is fair political discourse and everyone does it. But it is not a \nsatisfactory answer if the matter is not taken care of. We owe these \ncompanies and workers a ticket out of limbo.\n  I come to the third reason I pushed for a separate trailer bill. \nAlmost 2 months ago, the proponents of the trifecta rejected my advice \nand decided to place the bet. I advised them publicly and privately \nthat it would not work. I won't repeat all of that. It is in the \nCongressional Record of August 3. The bottom line is that the horses \ndidn't come in on the trifecta. After the vote, being worried about the \nendless delay on extenders, I suggested a course of action that would \n``keep the hope of death tax relief alive.'' Under the plan, the \nleadership would push for an early vote on the trifecta in either the \nform in which it failed or in a revised form. If it were to fail, I \nsuggested we pass a separate trailer bill.\n  This plan would have tested, for a fourth time, whether sweeteners \nfor key Democrats would turn their votes to favor a death tax relief \npackage. I was convinced months ago that sweeteners wouldn't turn \nDemocrat votes.\n  On this point about turning votes with sweeteners, let's step back \nfor a second and look at the big picture. Death tax is a passionate \nissue. There is a moral dimension to it. Liberals tend to define any \ndeath tax relief as immoral because they argue the benefit of the \nrelief will go to wealthy people. The political ads they produce use \nthe actress Paris Hilton as an example.\n  Conservatives also look at the death tax as a moral issue. They see \nthe death tax as confiscation of the fruits of labor and saving. It's a \npenalty on the rewards of hard work. From our perspective, the death \ntax is about small business and family farms. It's about providing one \ngeneration with a chance to pass on the results of their thrift and \nwork to the next generation. The political ads we produce use family \nfarm and small business examples.\n  So, this is an issue where folks have strong feelings. Ironically, \nfrom a process standpoint, Republicans and Democrats think alike. Here \nis what I mean by that comment. Republicans and Democrats want \npermanent relief. Most, not all, of my caucus wants permanent repeal. A \nfew Democrats agree with that view. Because of the political \ncalculations I referred to before, you can not find a definitive \nDemocratic Caucus position plan on death tax relief. The Democratic \nCaucus is divided into three groups. Some want repeal. Some want \nsignificant relief short of repeal. Another group, probably a big \nmajority, the liberal core, wants symbolic permanent relief and don't \nwant to lose much revenue in doing it.\n  There is a huge irony in all of this. The irony is the Republican \nleadership's sweeteners strategy ignores this basic mindset on the \ndeath tax. Republicans will not compromise their principles on the \ndeath tax with unrelated sweeteners. Neither will the middle group of \nDemocrats.\n  The ultimate evidence is record votes. As former Majority Leader Bob \nDole once said, it's all about the votes. The evidence that sweeteners \ndon't matter is on the record. Take a look at it. Timber capital gains \nwas added as a sweetener on the first Thomas effort. It did not change \nany votes. There was an effort to add the pension bill to a death tax \nrelief package. That didn't change votes and was aborted. Then, we had \nthe third sweetener effort, the trifecta. A minimum wage hike, the \nultimate sweetener, was added along with the trailer bill. It changed \none vote in gross. We are not certain, that if all Democratic Senators \nwere here that day, that, on net, the vote count would have changed.\n  As the old saying goes about some places, there is no there, there. \nThe sweeteners strategy is like the places the old saying refers to. If \nour goal is 60 votes and permanent death tax relief, there is no there \nthere.\n  Rest assured, another trifecta run will carry extra political \nbaggage. Don't listen to me. Listen to the Democrats who have resisted \nthe iron hand of their leadership on this issue. Senator Lincoln has \ntaken more heat than any single Senator in trying to get permanent \ndeath tax relief. Ask her for her opinion on this ``sweetener'' \nstrategy. She says forcing the political votes on the trifecta set us \nback on getting permanent death tax relief.\n  Why, with the pressure of elections off, and a new session coming up, \nwould any targeted Democrat Senator switch their vote on a bill that \nwas designed to squeeze them? Would any of my Republican friends in the \nsame position react any differently? Think about it.\n  Add to this futility another factor. Taking another run at a revised \ntrailer bill would start an endless negotiation. If we re-open the \ntrailer bill with the idea of adding even more sweeteners, where do we \nstop? How would that endless negotiation help close a deal on permanent \ndeath tax relief? The truth is trying to play trailer bill issues for \nmore votes on death tax relief only complicates resolution of the death \ntax.\n  So, the third reason I continued to try to clear the trailer bill is \nthat I want a clear path to a death tax deal. Combining death tax \nrelief with other issues only complicates our ability to get a death \ntax relief package. There is little or no utility in continuing the \nfailed strategy of trying to ``turn'' death tax deal votes.\n  Now, where do go from here? As I said a few minutes ago, I want to \nresolve two important tax relief issues--permanent death tax relief and \nthe trailer bill. One package is done--it's the trailer bill. The other \npackage needs some work, but can get done. We might even have a shot at \npermanent death tax relief in lame duck. If we are going to move the \nball forward, we are going to have to recognize that we have two \nseparate tax relief products. I hope all of us have finally learned \nthat lesson. If we have learned our lessons, the trailer bill is a slam \ndunk. If we have learned our lessons, and, key Democrats are finally \nfreed to do what they want to do, they will vote their conscience and \ntheir constituents' interests. If those two critical steps occur, we \nwill get a permanent death tax relief deal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my friend, my colleague, and \nchairman of the Committee on Finance, Senator Grassley, for trying to \ndo what is right, and that is to get the extenders package passed \ntonight. He has done an excellent job of explaining why the so-called \ntrifecta bill--that is the standards trailer, melded in with the estate \ntax reform, melded in with a minimum wage reduction--just is not going \nto work.\n  Three times I have tried to urge this Senate to pass the so-called \nextenders. Three times the Senate disagreed; that is, I have asked for \nunanimous consent three times and each time the Senate said no. The \nobjection was from the other side of the aisle.\n  I again thank my friend from Iowa. I think it is important to realize \nhow vitally important it is we get these so-called extenders passed. \nWhat are they?\n\n[[Page S10595]]\n\nThey are basic provisions in the Tax Code which expired at the end of \nlast year. They expired. There is a deduction for teachers' classroom \nexpenses, a deduction for education tuition, there is a deduction for \nState sales tax revenue, there is a deduction for research and \ndevelopment. They all expired. These are all provisions that many \nAmericans have relied on and hope to rely on when they file their tax \nreturns next year.\n  They are not in the law. It is already September 29. We have not \nacted to extend these. They are extremely important to an awful lot of \npeople.\n  Let's just take teachers, for example. Teachers desperately want to \nhelp teach their kids. Some of them buy classroom supplies. They go \ndown to Wal-Mart and buy supplies and they get a deduction for the \nclassroom supplies they buy. It is important for the teachers. It is \nimportant for the kids. It is a good thing to do. It has been in the \nlaw--at least it has been in the past. It was a law through 2005.\n  What about tuition deduction? We all know how important that is and \nhow much people depend on that for their education expense, \nparticularly when tuition is going up so much. I cannot believe it, \nthat expired at the end of last year.\n  This Congress, apparently, is not going to enact it. I have asked the \nSenate three times to bring it up and pass it, joined in by my good \nfriend from Iowa. Three times the other side of the aisle objected. Why \ndid they object? Because they want to tie it back into estate tax \nreform, they want to tie it back into minimum wage reduction. We all \nknow that is not going to work. As the Senator from Iowa said, clearly \nand eloquently, we tried that many, many times and that dog don't hunt. \nThat bird doesn't fly. It just doesn't work. It is not going to go.\n  What should we do, if that is not going to work, if that is not going \nto go? We should exercise our responsibilities and do what is right.\n  I have a couple of charts. I want to show everyone what the 1040 form \nlooks like. This is the basic Form 1040 that applies to taxpayers who \npaid taxes in the year 2005. The two provisions at issue are \nhighlighted here. Line 23 is ``educator expenses,'' and line 34 is \n``tuition and fees deduction.'' Line 23, for educator expenses, is for \nteachers who spend money on classroom supplies. There are 3.3 million \nexercising this deduction. They want to help their kids and, obviously, \nlower their taxes, so they took the deduction.\n  Line 34 on Form 1040 is ``tuition and fees deduction.'' About 3.6 \nmillion Americans took advantage of that deduction when filling out \ntheir tax returns for the tax return for 2005.\n  What will happen if we do not pass this extenders provision tonight \nor tomorrow? First, the IRS has said their drop-dead date is mid-\nOctober. They need to know what the law is by mid-October. We will not \nbe here mid-October if we do not pass these extenders, these provisions \nin the next couple of hours. We are not going to be here. If we come \nback in a lame duck session--November 13 we are coming back--who knows \nhow soon it will be before we finally take up the extenders?\n  I suspect because these are so popular that this is going to attract \nan awful lot of other legislation. Maybe it is the estate tax change, \nwages--I don't know what it will be, but it will attract a lot of \nattention at the lame duck session. So that means it will probably \ndelay.\n  I don't know how long this lame duck session will last. I have been \nhere for some lame duck sessions close to Christmas, very close to \nChristmas. I remember one that was 2 or 3 days before Christmas.\n  What happens if we pass the extenders late? Here is what will happen. \nThese lines I told you about, lines 23 and 34, are going to change. If \nthis is the basic 1040 form--and there are more deductions than this \nthat taxpayers can take, but these are the basic deductions and the \nmost important deductions--line 23 is no longer a deduction for \nteachers classroom supplies. Instead, line 23 is ``Archer MSA \ndeduction.'' That is only for up to 750,000 taxpayers. Compare that \nwith what has been replaced, classroom teacher deduction, or 3.3 \nmillion teachers. And line 34, that used to be the deduction for \ntuition expenses. That now becomes jury duty pay you pay to your \nemployer. How many people take a deduction because their employer pays \nthem for jury duty?\n  My point is, very important provisions are no longer going to be in \nthe law. They will not be available.\n  You might ask, gee, what happens if Congress passes these very \nimportant provisions--who knows when; it could be just before \nThanksgiving; it could be December; it could be the first part of \nDecember--the IRS has will be mailing out the wrong forms. The forms \nare going to be wrong because presumably, hopefully, sometime in \nNovember or December we do what is right, we continue these provisions \nwhich means to say we do not raise taxes.\n  Let's not forget if we do not pass this we are raising taxes, first, \non 3.3 million teachers; we are raising taxes on another 3.6 million \npeople who file for tuition deduction. These people will find their \ntaxes increased if we do not pass this provision.\n  Again, say we do pass the provisions later in the year, say, in \nNovember or December, and the wrong forms go out. Then what will \nhappen? People will have the wrong forms. Then what will happen? Gee, \nthe IRS, will have to figure out what to do about this. Maybe they will \nsend out a postcard. Who do you send postcards to? They send postcards \nto people who filed paper returns the preceding year. A lot of people \ndo not file paper returns. They are not going to get a postcard. They \nare not going to know. They are not going to know that Congress \ncorrected the mistake it made by passing these extensions.\n\n  What about people who file electronically? What about people who buy \ntheir software, their Turbo Tax software sometime around Thanksgiving \nor the first part of December, getting ready for Christmas, with \nChristmas presents. They are not going to know. They are going to buy \nthe wrong software. The software is not going to have the right \ninformation on it.\n  You add it altogether, this Congress is being highly irresponsible by \nnot continuing--we call them extenders. There are others: the sales tax \ndeduction. What about the R tax credit? There are about 16,000 \nbusinesses that use the R tax credit. We have reports that many \ncompanies are going to have to restate their earnings--restate them--\nbecause they cannot calculate the research and development tax credit \nin their financials. They will have to restate them. No company wants \nto restate on the down side. No company wants to do that. Even big \ncompanies have to restate them--not just small companies but big \ncompanies. They too will not be able to take advantage of this.\n  So I just say it is highly irresponsible for this Congress not to \nextend these provisions. And when I make the request we take up the \ntrailer bill and pass it, this is not a perfunctory request. This is \nnot some crank turning. This is real.\n  I think, unfortunately, there are some people in the leadership on \nthe other side of the aisle who think: Oh, this is just a mechanical \nexercise. This is not a mechanical exercise. It is certainly not \nmechanical to all those teachers, kids who paid tuition, who want their \ndeduction, businesses that don't get the advantage of the R tax \ncredit, people who want to deduct their sales taxes that are supposed \nto be deductible. We are not extending that either. We are only talking \nabout two of the so-called extenders.\n  Our failure to act here is going to be very costly. The IRS has to go \nto great expense to print corrective returns, errata sheets. They have \nto file statements to taxpayers notifying them of changes. Taxpayers \nare going to wonder: What is going on here? Do you know what else is \ngoing to happen? A lot of taxpayers, teachers, are not going to know \nthere has been a change made. They are going to get the wrong form. The \nform is not going to have it on it. There are a lot of people and kids \nand parents who are not going to know there has been a change. They are \nnot going to know because it is not on the form.\n  Somebody might make an effort to try to tell people later on, but \nthere is a real risk of a lot of taxpayers who are just not going to \nknow they could take deductions, and they are not going to know because \nthey have the wrong information. And they have the wrong information \nbecause the IRS has given\n\n[[Page S10596]]\n\nthem the best information they could at the time, but Congress was \nderelict, Congress was not responsible, Congress did not do what it \nshould do for the American people.\n  I am very concerned. And, frankly, I am very disappointed. I am \nsaddened that this Congress is, in effect, playing games. I hope very \nmuch, and I ask, I plead with the other side, at least let's hold off \njust a little bit. Don't immediately object. Let's figure out a way to \nwork this out.\n  We have a few hours here tonight. It is very simple. These are \nprovisions everybody has agreed on. There is no disagreement. The only \nproblem the other side of the aisle, the majority, has is when to do \nit. I indicated that the drop-dead date for the IRS is October 15, so \nnow is the time to do it--not later. We cannot couple this with estate \ntax repeal. We cannot couple this with the minimum wage increases. We \nhave tried that a couple, three times. It did not work.\n  The dye is cast. Senators have cast their votes. So let's get on with \nit. Let's get on with it. Let's put those issues behind us. We do not \nhave to deal with minimum wage or estate tax tonight, but we do have to \ndo the extenders tonight. This is very timely.\n  I very much hope that nobody objects right away. Maybe we could put \nthis off for a few minutes, maybe a half an hour or something, and \nplead with those who are sane, who want to do this right, to just get \nthis package of extenders passed. So I am going to ask consent, but \nmaybe somebody could modify the consent to hold it off a little longer \nwhile we try to work out a way to get this passed.\n  Mr. President, we do not apparently have the consent request printed \nright in front of me right at this moment. But I am going to have it \nlater tonight. That is probably better because that means maybe cooler \nheads will prevail and we can figure out a way to get this passed.\n  I see my good friend from Arizona is standing in the Chamber. I know \nhe would like to get these provisions passed. I know he has other \nconsiderations too, but he would like to have this provision passed, \nand I think everybody on the floor would like to get these provisions \npassed. We can deal with these other issues, but we don't have to deal \nwith them tonight. We cannot tonight. It is too late. But everybody has \nagreed to this package of extenders--everyone. The chairman of the \nFinance Committee has been desperately trying to get this passed. I \nhope later on tonight, when we ask consent, we get it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n15 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is my understanding that under the \ncurrent consent agreement, following me on this side is Senator Harkin \nand Senator Menendez, with Republicans in between.\n  I amend that consent and ask unanimous consent that following Senator \nMenendez, Senator Landrieu be allowed to speak for 15 minutes, Senator \nSalazar for 15 minutes, Senator Lautenberg for 15 minutes, with \nRepublicans in between, as per their request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, would \nthe Senator again give me that order? I missed it somehow. Let me see \nif I can insert myself in one of the Republican slots.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, following me is an empty Republican slot.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, if I could be inserted in there for up \nto 10 minutes, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like the same insertion, following \nthe Senator from Georgia, in the appropriate order, for no more than 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify her request?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I modify the current request that \nfollowing myself, Senator Cornyn be recognized for 10 minutes, Senator \nHarkin for 10 minutes, Senator Craig for 10 minutes, Senator Menendez \nfor 10 minutes, a Republican Senator as designated for 10 minutes, \nSenator Landrieu for 15 minutes, a Republican Senator for 10 minutes, \nSenator Salazar for 15 minutes, a Republican Senator for 15 minutes, \nand Senator Lautenberg for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, again reserving the right to object, I \nwill tell Senator Cornyn you paid him a great compliment, but that it \nbe Senator Chambliss instead of Senator Cornyn.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I apologize. It is Senator Chambliss. And I apologize.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10596-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10596-S10599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          VETERANS HEALTHCARE\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss how we are doing in \ncaring for America's veterans. With our country at war, with 1.5 \nmillion Americans who have served in the global war on terror, and with \nmany of them coming home in need of care--it is a critical question.\n  Last week, we got a shocking report from the Government \nAccountability Office, which found that the VA has misled Congress \nabout its failure to plan for our veterans.\n  Based on that report and other research, I came here to the Senate \nfloor 2 days ago and shared my concerns with the full Senate. I said \nthat the Bush administration has not been honest with us about its \nfailures to plan for the needs of our veterans, and that we still have \na lot of work to do to get back on track. And I warned that--3\\1/2\\ \nyears into this war--the Bush administration still does not have a plan \nto meet the needs of all the veterans who will be coming home.\n  In my speech on Tuesday, I said that Congress needs to provide real \noversight of the Bush administration so that we can ensure our veterans \nget the care they have earned. For those who want to see my full \nremarks and all the evidence I cited, you can watch or read my speech \non my Web site at http://murray.senate.gov.\n  This morning, the Senator from Idaho came here to the Senate floor \nand spoke with great passion about our veterans. The distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee took issue with some \nof the things I said in my remarks here on Tuesday.\n  I respect the Senator from Idaho. I appreciate his leadership of our \ncommittee, and I am pleased to provide more information before the full \nSenate. I want everyone to know that the Senator from Idaho and I have \nworked together on veterans issues.\n  I want to point out that when the VA finally admitted that it was \nfacing a $3 billion shortfall--the chairman was first to stand beside \nme and find the funding to fix the problem. And I thank him for that.\n  I am proud to say that the Senator from Idaho and I agree on many \npoints. We both agree that the VA provides excellent healthcare. When I \nwas in college during the Vietnam War, I interned at the VA hospital in \nSeattle. I saw firsthand how dedicated and talented VA employees are.\n  Today, that ethic of service and commitment to quality beats in the \nheart of every VA employee. I am proud of the progress we have made \nhelping the VA become a model for effective, high quality healthcare.\n  The Senator from Idaho and I also both agree that we have increased \nVA funding. It has been an uphill battle--and the facts tell me that we \nare not prepared for the many veterans coming home--but we both agree \nthat we have increased veterans funding. I might point out that we in \nCongress provided those increases in spite of years of inadequate \nbudget requests from the White House.\n  We agree that the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee works in a \nbipartisan fashion under the leadership of Senator Craig and Ranking \nMember Akaka. As I have said many times on this floor--taking care of \nour veterans is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. It is an \nAmerican issue, and we all need to be part of the solution.\n  And finally, I couldn't agree more with the Senator from Idaho that \nwe should focus on the facts. Those facts should guide our budgets and \nour policy decisions. If the facts say everything is fine, that's \ngreat. But when the facts say there are problems, we need to hear those \nfacts, and we need to respond based on the facts.\n\n[[Page S10597]]\n\n  That's why the GAO report is such a bombshell. Professional, \nindependent government investigators found that the Bush administration \nhas not told us the facts about its budget and planning problems.\n  Think about that--if the people we rely on for the facts are not \ntelling us the truth, we've got a real problem. If they're hiding the \ntruth, we won't be able to provide veterans with the services they \nneed. And one of the answers has to be more oversight and more \naccountability, so we can get to the truth.\n  Let me turn to the three main points that are relevant here:\n  First, the Bush administration does not have a real plan to meet the \nneeds of our Iraqi War veterans--and that failure is impacting the care \nwe provide all veterans.\n  Second, the Bush administration misled this Congress and it is still \nnot providing us with up-to-date, timely information.\n  And third, we in Congress need to provide real oversight and demand \nreal accountability--or our veterans are gonna fall behind.\n  Mr. President, I am very concerned that the Bush administration still \ndoes not have a plan to meet the needs of our returning servicemembers. \nAnd to prove that I want to point to three sets of figures that come \nfrom the VA itself.\n  The first piece of evidence concerns the number of veterans the VA \nexpected to treat this year.\n  For fiscal year 2006, the VA planned to take care of about 110,000 \nveterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. 110,000. How many are they actually \ntreating? 185,000. So in this fiscal year--that is just about to end--\nthe VA underestimated demand by 68 percent. And that is just for those \nveterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. If the VA had an accurate \nplan, they wouldn't have been so far off.\n\n  Let's go to the second piece of evidence that shows the VA has no \nplan. As I said, this year we are treating 185,000 veterans from Iraq \nand Afghanistan. How many will we treat next year? The VA estimates \nthat it will only be 109,000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. We are \ntreating 185,000 today, but the VA thinks that number is going to go \ndown dramatically next year.\n  Given what we know about our continued involvement in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, that simply defies logic. And you have to wonder how the \nVA ever came up with those figures in the first place. Its projection \nfor next year is even lower than its projection for this year. Where \nare they getting these numbers? Why are they so wrong?\n  Those are the questions we in Congress need to be asking. If the VA \nreally thinks that next year we will have fewer veterans seeking care, \nit clearly has no plan to deal with those who will be coming home.\n  Let me turn to the third piece of evidence that shows the VA has no \nplan to deal with Iraq war veterans. In July, the VA told us it will \nneed $1 billion each year for the next 10 years to care for veterans \nfrom Iraq.\n  But the fact is--for this year alone--we are already spending more \nthan $1 billion. They have given us a 10-year estimate, and they are \nalready wrong in the very first year. And the lion's share of veterans \nhave not separated from the Pentagon yet, so it is a safe bet that \ndemand for VA services will go up and that will require more funding.\n  So the VA is already wrong in the figures it provided us just a few \nmonths ago. That's because they don't have a plan.\n  The fact that they predicted 110,000 enrolled Iraq War veterans this \nyear--and they are already serving 185,000 shows they don't have a \nplan.\n  The fact that they think demand for care will drop next year shows \nthat they don't have a plan.\n  And the fact that we are already spending more than they said we \nwould need for Iraq war vets shows they don't have a plan.\n  This is unacceptable. If we tolerate it, then we are not doing our \njobs here in Congress. They don't have a plan, and we better have some \noversight and accountability before more veterans end up getting hurt.\n  Next Mr. President, I want to turn to the facts of the GAO report \nthat I requested. This report--prepared by independent, credible \ngovernment investigators--tells us what is really happening. All of us \ncare about the facts and we all care about getting this right, and \nthat's why we should all take this report to heart. Unless we learn \nfrom our mistakes, we are never going to do any better for America's \nveterans.\n  In that spirit, I want to focus on four findings. First, the GAO \nfound that the VA knew it had serious problems with its budget, but \nfailed to notify us in Congress. Even worse, it misled us.\n  The report suggests that the VA could still be sending us inaccurate \ninformation in its quarterly reports.\n  Second, the GAO found that the VA was basing its budgets on \n``unrealistic assumptions, errors in estimation, and insufficient \ndata.''\n  Third, the Pentagon failed to give the VA up-to-date information \nabout how many servicemembers would be coming down the pipeline into \nthe VA.\n  Finally, the GAO found that the VA did not adequately plan for the \nimpact of servicemembers from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  For me, I think one of the most disturbing findings is that the VA \nkept assuring us in Congress that everything was fine--while inside the \nVA it was clear that shortfalls were growing.\n  The VA became aware it would have problems in October 2004--but \ndidn't admit those problems until June of 2005. Veterans were telling \nme of long lines and delays in care.\n  For months, I tried to give the VA more money, but the administration \nfought me every step of the way. And who paid the price for the VA's \ndeceptions? America's veterans, and that's just wrong.\n  Let me walk through some of the deceptions found in the report. It \nshows a very troubling gap between what the VA knew and what the VA \ntold us.\n  According to the GAO report, starting back in October 2004, the VA \nknew money was tight. It anticipated serious budget challenges, and \ncreated a ``Budget Challenges'' working group.\n  Two months later, in December 2004, the budget group made internal \nrecommendations to deal with the shortfall. It suggested delaying new \ninitiatives and shifting around funding.\n  Two months later, in February 2005, the Bush administration released \nits budget proposal for 2006.\n  The GAO found that budget was based on ``unrealistic assumptions, \nerrors in estimation and insufficient data.''\n  A week later at a hearing--on February 15, 2005, I asked the VA \nSecretary if the President's budget was sufficient. He told me:\n\n       I have many of the same concerns, and I end up being \n     satisfied that we can get the job done with this budget.\n\n  Let's remember what was happening back at that time. I was hearing \nfrom veterans that they were facing delays in care and that the VA \nsystem was stretched to capacity. But the VA continued to say \neverything was fine.\n  On March 8, Secretary Nicholson told a House committee that the \npresident's fiscal year 2006 budget,\n\n       gives VA what it needs.\n\n  I was hearing a much different story as I spoke with veterans around \nthe country. That is why on March 10, I offered an amendment in the \nSenate Budget Committee to increase veterans funding by 3 percent so we \ncould hire more doctors and provide faster care to veterans. \nUnfortunately, Republicans said no.\n  That same month, the VA's internal monthly reports showed that demand \nfor healthcare was exceeding projections. That was another warning sign \nthat the VA should have shared with us, but it didn't.\n  On March 16, Senator Akaka and I offered an amendment here on the \nSenate floor to increase veterans funding by $2.85 billion. Once again, \nRepublicans said no.\n  The next month, on April 5, Secretary Nicholson wrote to Senator \nHutchison saying:\n\n       I can assure you that the VA does not need emergency \n     supplemental funds in FY 2005.\n\n  A week later, on April 12, I offered two amendments on the Senate \nfloor to boost veterans funding. First, I asked the Senate to agree \nthat the lack of veterans funding was an emergency and that we had to \nfix. Republicans said no.\n  Then I asked the Senate to agree that supporting our veterans was a \npriority. Again, Republican said no. As a\n\n[[Page S10598]]\n\nresult, veterans didn't get the funding they needed, and the deception \ncontinued.\n  On June 9, I asked Secretary Nicholson at a hearing if he had enough \nfunding to deal with the mental health challenges of veterans returning \nfrom Iraq and Afghanistan. He assured me the VA was fine.\n  So for 6 months we had happy talk that everything was fine with the \nVA. Then, in June--just two weeks after the Secretary's latest \nassurance--the truth finally came out. On June 23, the VA revealed a \nmassive shortfall of $3 billion.\n  I went to work my colleagues, and we came up with the funding. But we \ncould have solved that problem much earlier and saved veterans the \ndelays they experienced.\n  By misleading us, the Bush administration hurt America's veterans. We \ncould have provided the money when it was needed. We could have been \nhiring the doctors and nurses we needed. We could have been buying the \nmedical equipment that was needed. And we could have helped keep \nthousands of veterans off waiting lists for care.\n  Here's the bottom line: The Bush administration knew about a problem \nback in October 2004.\n  They saw it getting worse, but they kept assuring us everything was \nfine. They worked to defeat my amendments to provide funding, and they \ndidn't come clean until June 2005. That is unacceptable.\n  I think America's veterans deserve real answers. This report shows \nthat the VA was not telling Congress the truth and was fighting those \nof us who were trying to help. We need to bring Secretary Nicholson \nbefore the Veterans' Affairs Committee so we can get some real answers. \nWe need to ensure the VA does not repeat the same mistakes of the past \n2 years. We owe that to our current and future veterans who sacrifice \nso much for us.\n  We need an explanation of why the VA misled us about so-called \nmanagement efficiencies. The GAO found those alleged savings were \nnothing but hot air. This report clearly shows the Bush administration \nmisrepresented the truth to us for 4 fiscal years, through 4 budgets, \nand 4 appropriations cycles about these bogus savings. And when they \ncould not make these efficiencies a reality, they took the funds from \nveterans' healthcare. That is unacceptable.\n  The report also suggests that even in its latest quarterly reports to \nus--the VA is slow to report and does not provide key information we \nrequired--such as the time required for veterans to get their first \nappointment.\n  The GAO report also says that the Department of Defense failed to \nprovide the VA up-to-date information on how many servicemembers would \nbe separating from service and seeking care at the VA. That is really \nfrustrating to me because I have been asking every general who comes up \nhere if they're doing enough to ensure a smooth transition from the \nPentagon to the VA.\n  In fact, on February 16 of last year, I questioned Secretary Rumsfeld \ndirectly. I got him to agree that caring for veterans is part of the \ncost of war but he had no real answer when I asked why his request for \nthe war did not include funding for veterans.\n  Finally, the GAO report verifies that the VA failed to plan for the \nimpact of the veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to respond in detail to \nsome of the points my colleague from Idaho raised. He is a very \ndedicated and hard-working advocate for America's veterans.\n  At times, we may disagree on policy, but it is never personal. And it \nis my highest hope that whatever policy disagreements we may have will \nresult in better service for America's veterans.\n  The Senator from Idaho said that VA healthcare is the best care in \nthe world. And I certainly agree as I said earlier. But too often, \nveterans are barred from that receiving that care and are put on \nwaiting lists.\n  For example in the VA Service Network that covers Alaska, Oregon, my \nhome State of Washington and Senator Craig's home State of Idaho, the \nVA states that there are over 10,000 veterans on waiting lists for \ntheir initial appointments. There are thousands more waiting for \nspecialty care. Veterans in need are told to wait months before they \ncan see a doctor.\n  In fact--of the 21 regional Service Networks--the region that covers \nboth Washington and Idaho is the worst at getting veterans primary and \nspecialty care appointments within 30 days of the date requested. That \ndata comes straight out of the VA's own quarterly budget reports. It is \nnot my interpretation.\n  So great care is important, but making sure veterans can actually get \ntimely access to that care is equally important. And that's an area \nwhere the VA is falling short.\n  The Senator from Idaho pointed out that we required the VA to submit \nquarterly reports on budget execution. He says we have received three \nsuch reports this year. That is accurate. But what the chairman did not \nsay is what the GAO found. From page 5:\n\n       However VA's reports have not included some of the measures \n     that would assist Congress in its oversight, such as measures \n     of patient workload that would capture the costlines of \n     patient care, and the time required for new patients to be \n     scheduled for their first healthcare appointment. Moreover, \n     while VA has 12 months to execute its budget, it did not \n     submit its first two quarterly reports to Congress until \n     nearly 2 months after the end of each quarter, using patient \n     workload data that were as much as 3 months old at the time \n     of submission.\n\n  That is the GAO telling us that the VA's information was late and \noutdated. We need to demand better.\n  Let me comment on another statement by the Senator from Idaho. He \nsaid that we've had great success in delivering service to veterans. \nThen he said this:\n\n       it doesn't mean that every veteran got exactly what they \n     wanted the moment they asked for it.\n\n  That has never been the standard. The question is this: Can veterans \nwho need help get it when they need it?\n  The evidence I have seen suggests we have got a long way to go. On \nTuesday, I shared with the Senate the story of a soldier in Virginia \nwho is back from serving our country in Iraq. He can't sleep at night \nso he called the VA for an appointment. They told him he would have to \nwait 75 days to see a doctor. That is unacceptable. Ensuring that \nveterans get timely care--especially for mental health services--is a \ndire need.\n  Again, don't take my word for it. Remember what a VA undersecretary \nsaid in medical journal recently--that mental health care services are \n``virtually inaccessible'' because of long waiting lines. So when we \nuse a reasonable standard, it is clear we are falling far short of what \nour veterans deserve.\n  Senator Craig said that during the last 6 years, the administration \nand Congress has increased VA funding by 70 percent. But let me remind \nhim that every step of way Congress had to fight the administration for \nthose increases.\n  I know that we are putting more funding into the VA than we have \nhistorically. I have worked with my colleagues to fight for that \nfunding. But let me remind my colleague from Idaho that we still have \nthousands of veterans waiting for primary and secondary care--or not \nbeing allowed to access care at all.\n  The funding that this Congress has provided for the VA still does not \nprovide enough to ensure that every veteran who is eligible can access \ncare. The VA takes what Congress appropriates and then limits which \nveterans can access care to make the care the VA provides fit within \nthe budget box Congress provides.\n  Time and again, proposals for increased fees and copays are presented \nto discourage veterans from accessing VA care. I am happy to say we \nhave fought off this administration's efforts to put those increased \nfees and copays in place. But--at the same time--the administration has \nlimited access to the VA for Priority 7 and 8 veterans.\n  The VA admitted that fees and copays within its fiscal year 2007 \nbudget would discourage 200,000 enrolled veterans from accessing care, \nand another 1.1 million from enrolling at all. This is wrong. We need a \nreal budget based on the real needs. Not one based on limited access \nand discouraging veterans from seeking the care they were promised.\n  The Senator from Idaho wanted to be very clear that he had called \nhearings and exercised oversight. I agree. He did. I was one of the \npeople who pushed for those hearings. I was at those hearing. I \ndemanded answers at those hearings.\n\n[[Page S10599]]\n\n  And one thing is clear--those efforts were not enough. We are still \nnot getting straight answers from the VA. We are still getting out-of-\ndate information. We still do not have a plan from the VA to care for \nthe veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  So yes, there were hearings--I think we'd all agree that after a $3 \nbillion error that hurt our veterans there better be hearings--but they \nwere not enough. And we need more oversight and more accountability if \nwe're going to make sure veterans do not get hurt again.\n  The Senator from Idaho asked--why now? Why am I calling for more \noversight now? Because the GAO just released its report. I didn't tell \nthe GAO how long to take in its investigation. When it had the facts, \nit released them, and I spoke up immediately. In fact, I think the \nSenator from Idaho will remember the morning the GAO released its \nreport I shared the results with our Veterans Affairs Committee at a \npublic hearing.\n  I thought everyone on the committee needed to know immediately that \ngovernment investigators found the VA had not told us about the \nproblems it knew about and that the VA is providing quarterly reports \nthat are late and based on old information. Simply put, I spoke out \nwhen we got the facts.\n  I would add that if anyone believes that my remarks on Tuesday are \nthe first time I have stood up and spoke out for our veterans--they \njust have not had their eyes open over the past few years. And I would \nremind my colleagues that there is no moratorium on speaking out for \nour veterans. Whenever we learn facts that affect America's veterans, \nI'm going to share them, and I'm not going to stop speaking out until \nwe in Congress do the right thing.\n  Furthermore, unless we change the path we are on, we will be talking \nabout this issue next September, the September after that, and every \nmonth in between. This is not going away.\n  So we in the Senate debate a lot of issues--none more significant \nthan the issue of going to war. We are at war, and this body has a \nresponsibility to meet our obligations in prosecuting that war--that \nincludes taking care of our veterans. Today, we are not meeting that \nobligation. That is not just my opinion. It is the only conclusion a \nreasonable person could draw from the GAO report. And however \ninconvenient that may be--that is a fact.\n  Mr. President, I repeat my conclusion from my remarks here on \nTuesday. Veterans deserve better, and this Senate and America can do \nbetter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to express my support for \nproviding relief to agricultural producers nationwide.\n  Earlier today Senator Conrad from North Dakota led a debate on the \nfloor regarding agricultural disasters; especially the severe drought \ncausing severe loss of crops all across America, and the need to extend \na helping hand to farmers.\n  We always hope to stay out of the disaster business, unfortunately \nMr. President, this has indeed been a very unusual year. In August of \n2006, in my State of Georgia, 155 of 159 counties were designated by \nthe Secretary of Agriculture as primary natural disaster areas due to \nlosses caused by drought and excessive temperatures.\n  Cotton and peanut harvests are underway today in the State and, \nunfortunately, the Department of Agriculture's most recent crop summary \nrates dryland fields in poor to fair condition, with much lower yields \nthan usual. If peanut production forecasts are realized, we could have \nthe lowest production yields on peanuts since 1980. Losses extend \nbeyond the fields and have had a serious effect on livestock producers \nas well. For example, in addition to losses due to drought, many \npastures and hayfields have experienced severe armyworm infestation.\n  My staff continues to receive calls from across the State with \nconcerns about crop and pasture conditions. I have personally heard the \ncalls and seen the need for agricultural disaster assistance throughout \nGeorgia. As chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I convened \neight farm bill hearings across the country this summer. I will have to \nsay that in traveling to these regions and visiting with the producers, \nI can report that there has been severe disasters occurring in each and \nevery section of our country from an agricultural standpoint. Rural \nAmerica is hurting.\n  While the Senate did not have the opportunity today to proceed with \nthe vote on this very important issue, I want to be clear that I do \nsupport disaster assistance. Earlier this year, the Senate passed \ndisaster assistance in the fiscal year 2006 supplemental appropriations \nbill. Unfortunately, that provision was dropped in conference. Since \nthen, the situation has greatly worsened. Fortunately, we currently \nhave a disaster package in the Senate agriculture appropriations bill, \nwhich we expect to complete after the November elections.\n  The appropriate place to address agriculture disaster is in the \nagriculture appropriations bill. However, we will need to refine and \nimprove this disaster package based upon current circumstances. For \nexample, the current disaster package provides assistance only for \nlosses for the 2005 crop-year. Unfortunately, the losses in 2006 appear \nto be more extensive, more widespread, and more severe than the 2005 \nlosses. The University of Georgia Center for Agribusiness and Economic \nDevelopment estimates that at this point agriculture production losses \nmay total over $819 million in Georgia alone.\n  At the current time, we may not know the full extent of the 2006 crop \ndamage, but it is evident in looking across the country that crop and \nlivestock assistance is needed.\n  The Secretary of Agriculture has agreed with us on this point. \nEarlier this summer he announced in the Dakotas that a disaster indeed \nhad taken place across America. However, he provided what I thought, \nfrankly, was a fairly nominal response to the issue.\n  America's farmers provide this country the safest, most affordable \nfood and fiber supply of any country in the world. It is our duty to \nstand by them in this time of need.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10599-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10599-S10600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             READING FIRST\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Education Department's inspector \ngeneral released a blistering report last week about a program called \nReading First. The inspector general reported that Education Department \nofficials, one, mismanaged the program; two, steered school contracts \nto publishers they favor and away from others; three, flagrantly \nignored Federal laws on maintaining local and State control of school \ncurricula.\n  These are serious findings by the inspector general. Reading First is \none of the largest programs in the Education Department. Congress has \nappropriated about $5 billion, or about a billion dollars for each of \nthe past 5 years. So when we learn that a program of this size is being \nmismanaged, that laws are being broken, we need to take pause and \ninvestigate further.\n  Soon after Reading First was created, a number of publishers, \nresearchers, and local school officials complained that the Department \nfavored certain reading programs over others. They claimed that the \nDepartment pressured States and local school districts--sometimes \nsubtly and sometimes bluntly--to purchase its preferred programs and \nreject others.\n  These kinds of activities are illegal. The law that established the \nEducation Department states:\n\n       No provision of a program administered by the Secretary or \n     by any other officer of the Department shall be construed to \n     authorize the Secretary or any such officer to exercise any \n     direction, supervision, or control over the curriculum, \n     program of instruction, administration, or personnel of any \n     educational institution, school, or school system . . . over \n     the selection or consent of . . . textbooks, or other \n     instructional materials by any educational institution or \n     school system, except to the extent authorized by law.\n\n  Now, when we established the Department of Education--and I happened \nto be here at that time; I was in the House of Representatives at that \ntime--the hue and cry went up to those who were opposed to establishing \nthe Department of Education that the Department of Education would \nbegin telling local school districts what to\n\n[[Page S10600]]\n\nteach, what books to use. Well, none of us wanted that. We wanted the \nDepartment of Education to do certain things but not to control local \nschools. We wanted to leave the control of school curricula, textbooks, \nwhat they taught, in the hands of local school boards. So we put this \nin the law expressly forbidding the Secretary of Education, or anyone \nin that Department, to exercise any direction, supervision, or control \nover textbooks, and things like that. That is about as clear as night \nis from day in the law.\n  Later, when we passed the No Child Left Behind Act, we further \nelaborated on that, and No Child Left Behind established the Reading \nFirst Program. It reiterates this point:\n\n       No funds provided to the Department under this act may be \n     used by the Department to endorse, approve, or sanction any \n     curriculum.\n\n  The Department officials repeatedly denied that they showed any \nfavoritism. However, the inspector general's report shows that, in \nfact, they went to great lengths to influence exactly which \ninstructional materials school districts must use. They accomplished \nthis in several ways.\n\n  First they--I mean the Department of Education officials--stacked \ntheir grant review panels with members who shared their own philosophy, \ndirectly contradicting the No Child Left Behind Act which laid out \nspecific rules designed to ensure the panels were balanced.\n  Next, they designed the grant applications in such a way as to \ndiscourage States from using certain reading programs--reading programs \nthat had been approved at the local level and had been approved at the \nState level. So the Department designed the applications in such a way \nas to discourage the States from using these reading programs, even to \nthe point of selectively eliminating phrases from the No Child Left \nBehind Act they didn't like. The No Child Left Behind Act put in \ncertain phrases they had to use in terms of getting grants. Guess what. \nThey just left those out of the grant application--just left them out \ntotally.\n  Third, they leaned heavily on school districts to drop reading \nprograms that didn't meet the Department's approval. For example, the \nReading First Director opposed a whole-language reading program sold by \na company called the Wright Group. In an e-mail, he urged a staffer to \nmake it clear that the Wright Group didn't have his approval. Here is \nan excerpt from his e-mail. This is an e-mail from the Reading First \nDirector Christopher Doherty. He said:\n\n       They--\n\n  This is the group that wanted to come in and make an application--\n\n       They are trying to crash our party and we need to beat the \n     [expletive deleted] out of them in front of all the other \n     would-be party crashers who are standing on the front lawn \n     waiting to see how we welcome these dirtbags.\n\n  What does all that mean? That means: Look, we have our programs, we \nhave what we want; others want in and, guess what, we are going to keep \nthem out. ``They are trying to crash our party''--``our party.'' What \ndid Mr. Doherty mean by ``crash our party''? They have selected \npublishers, selected materials they want these schools to use. \n``Party''? What does that mean?\n  Here is how it played out in Massachusetts for one State. The Reading \nFirst Director, this same guy, Christopher Doherty, called a State \nofficial to say he had concerns about certain reading programs that \nfour school districts were using. All of these programs had gone \nthrough the appropriate approval process at the local and State levels. \nNevertheless, the State official conveyed that concern to the local \ndistricts. The three that dropped those approved programs continued to \nget their Reading First funding. The one district that stuck with the \nold program that had been approved had its Reading First funding taken \naway.\n  What is that saying? It is saying: OK, school districts, if you want \nmoney, you have to play our ball game, you have to accept our \ntextbooks, you have to accept what we want, not what you at the local, \nwhat you at the State level want, but what we want in Washington.\n  When we step back and look at the big picture, we see a Department of \nEducation where the attitude is: We know best, and to heck with \nCongress, to heck with Federal laws. They are saying basically it \ndoesn't matter what the law says about local control of schools. If we \nlike a particular program, we are going to make sure a school uses it, \nand if we don't like it, we are going to make sure they don't use it; \nwe know best, and we will decide. That seems to be the attitude of the \nDepartment of Education.\n  We live in a nation of law. We have offices such as the inspector \ngeneral to investigate whether agencies such as the Education \nDepartment are really following the laws we pass. Guess what. The \ninspector general found they are not following the law at the Education \nDepartment. They are basically thumbing their nose at it.\n  So far, the person who has borne most of the blame has been the \nReading First Director, Christopher Doherty, but I think we need to \nlook a little higher.\n  Secretary Spellings responded to the report by blaming other \nDepartment employees and noting that the events occurred before she \ntook over the Department. However, as President Bush's domestic policy \nadviser, she exerted enormous control from the White House over the \nDepartment of Education activities.\n  Michael Petrilli, a former Department official who worked in the \nDepartment from 2001 to 2005, wrote a column this week in which he said \nthat Mrs. Spellings knew exactly what was going on.\n  Here is what Mr. Petrilli wrote:\n\n       As the President's first-term domestic policy advisor, she \n     micromanaged the implementation of Reading First from her \n     West Wing office. She put one of her most trusted friends \n     inside the Department of Education to make sure that Doherty \n     and his colleagues didn't go soft and allow just any reading \n     program to receive funds. She was the leading cheerleader for \n     an aggressive approach. And now she bobs and weaves: \n     ``Although these events occurred before I became Secretary of \n     Education, I am concerned about these actions and committed \n     to addressing and resolving them.''\n\n  A quote from Secretary Spellings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I didn't realize I had a time limit. I ask \nfor 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, if this description is accurate, it is \nhard to imagine that Secretary Spellings didn't know anything about the \nabuses described in the inspector general's report. Instead of making \nothers take the fall for what happened, she needs to stand up and say \nwhether she had any knowledge of or involvement in these activities \nwhen she worked in the White House.\n  Last week's report from the IG was just the first of several on the \nEducation Department's management of the Reading First Program. I am \nafraid that what we have learned so far is just the tip of the iceberg. \nSecretary Spellings needs to explain as soon as possible her role in \nthis program.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in my capacity as a Senator and chairman of \nthe Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I rise this evening to pay \ntribute to two men who were bookends of what has been termed the \n``greatest generation,'' those Americans who served in World War II. \nOne stood behind the lens and took that famous photo on Iwo Jima that \nbecame the iconic picture of the war in the Pacific. The other gave up \nhis life in front of the lens and laid his life on the line in the \ncause for freedom in Europe. I speak, of course, of the photographer \nJoe Rosenthal and the famed actor Glenn Ford. Both men died a few weeks \nago, and it is fitting that this body, the Senate of the United States, \nrecognize these great men for their contributions.\n  Most Americans instantly know that image Joe Rosenthal captured: the \nphoto of five marines and one Navy corpsman raising the flag--the \nAmerican flag--over Iwo Jima. That image became the basis for the Iwo \nJima Memorial which rises above Arlington National Cemetery and a copy \nof which greets those who enter Quantico Marine Base in Virginia. That \nimage was\n\n[[Page S10601]]\n\nalso made into a postage stamp, not once but twice, and inspired the \ncreation of at least two major pictures: ``The Sands of Iwo Jima'' \nstarring John Wayne and the new movie, ``The Flags of Our Fathers,'' \nproduced by Clint Eastwood, which will debut in a few weeks.\n  It has been said that Joe Rosenthal's famous photograph not only gave \nAmericans back home an image of what was happening on the front lines, \nit persuasively argued that America was winning that war.\n  The impact of that image cannot be overstated. In fact, former \nPresident George Herbert Walker Bush, who served as a Navy pilot during \nWorld War II, recently recalled seeing the flag-raising photo in the \nnewspaper during the war with Japan and said that without Joe \nRosenthal's picture, the war might have dragged on even longer:\n\n       I wonder if Joe fully appreciated what this photograph \n     meant, and what it still means to the American people.\n\n  That is what the elder President Bush wrote.\n  The President's comments were shared recently at a public \npresentation in which Joe Rosenthal was posthumously awarded a Navy \nmedal for distinguished public service. It was an honor long overdue \nbut one I am proud has finally been awarded.\n  But while many know the story of Joe Rosenthal's famous photograph, \nfew Americans, however, really know the real life story of the famous \nactor Glenn Ford.\n  Glenn Ford was born in Canada. He emigrated to the United States when \nhe was 5 years old. He was a descendent of U.S. President Martin Van \nBuren. But Glenn Ford made his own way in his life. He went on to \nbecome a Hollywood movie star who appeared in over 100 movies and \ntelevision shows. But his heroic real-life military actions are worthy \nof a film all its own.\n  Before the beginning of World War II, Glenn Ford served in the Coast \nGuard Auxiliary. In 1942, he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps. In the \naftermath of the war in Europe, Glenn Ford came upon a displaced \npersons camp several miles outside of Munich, Germany. An estimated \n12,000 to 15,000 homeless Jews were living at the Fernwald camp, which \nappeared to have been overlooked in the postwar confusion.\n  According to the Simon Wisenthal Center, which in 1985 presented \nGlenn Ford with the Liberator's Award:\n\n       The survivors were astonished and wept with gratitude to \n     see an American who really cared, and for seven weeks Ford \n     brought food, books and medical supplies. The supply \n     sergeants looked the other way as Ford loaded up his jeep day \n     after day, and headed up to Fernwald.\n       Ford alone was responsible for giving hope and life to \n     approximately half of these 12,000 to 15,000 inmates in an \n     over 7-week period. Many women named their newborn sons after \n     him in recognition and in gratitude.\n\n  Committed to service in the Armed Forces, Glenn Ford also served a \ntour of duty in Vietnam in the Mekong Delta during Operation Deckhouse \nV and twice came under fire--intense enemy fire--and narrowly escaped \ndeath from a sniper's bullet, a bullet which wounded the attache \nstanding next to him.\n  Among his numerous medals and accommodations are the Medal of Honor \npresented by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Medaille de la France \nLibre for the liberation of France, two commendation medals from the \nU.S. Navy, and the Vietnamese Legion of Merit. He received the rank of \ncaptain with the U.S. Naval Reserves in 1968.\n  Today, as we battle terrorists wherever they are, I think we should \nall reflect on the words of Glenn Ford penned in 1980. Here is what \nthat honored and decorated movie star said:\n\n       I'm proud to be an American. Let me say again. I'm proud to \n     be an American. And I believe it's time for every one of us \n     to stand up and show our support for our great country. There \n     are faults and occasional inequities in America. But the \n     proof of how good things really are here is the lines at our \n     borders and at our consulates all over the world of people \n     wanting to come here to live.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       In the last 200 years, we have built a wonderful dream that \n     other countries can only hope to achieve. So let us not hurt \n     that dream by our own selfishness. If we think only of \n     ourselves and do nothing but complain about this magnificent \n     country--instead of supporting her--we will lose everything \n     our forefathers fought for. We must all pull together and \n     elect good officials. And we must save energy and help our \n     neighbors--especially the young of America--understand the \n     real meaning of the free enterprise system.\n       But let's never forget that to remain free we must always \n     be strong. That is an important lesson I--\n\n  Meaning Glenn Ford--\n\n     learned in my navy career in World War II. National defense \n     must be the top priority for any country. If you are not \n     strong, you are not safe. Now is the time for every American \n     to be proud. This is the land of the free and the home of the \n     brave. But only as long as we are brave. If we are not brave, \n     we will not be free.\n\n  So penned by the actor Glenn Ford.\n  As I said at the beginning of my comments this evening, Joe Rosenthal \nand Glenn Ford were bookends of World War II. Joe Rosenthal was behind \nthe lens and took that seminal picture of the war in the Pacific, the \nIwo Jima flag-raising, while Glenn Ford, who had spent his time in \nfront of the lens in motion pictures and in business, left the \nlimelight to become a true war hero and devote his time to save a \nNation and to save a world.\n  Glenn Ford and Joe Rosenthal were true patriots. Now those heroes are \ngone, like so many other veterans of that great war. The Nation is \nlosing many of its World War II veterans. Believe it or not, nearly \n1,000 members of the Greatest Generation pass away each day of each \nweek. But while they are leaving us at a sad and very steady pace, \ntheir legacy of freedom and bravery, I hope, will live on forever. \nLet's think tonight of Joe Rosenthal and the late actor Glenn Ford.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n15 minutes under the previous order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10601-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10601-S10604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RYAN WHITE CARE REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise tonight to speak about the Ryan \nWhite CARE reauthorization.\n  We have heard a number of speakers on the Senate floor over the past \nfew days claiming to be experts on New Jersey's HIV/AIDS community and \nour Ryan White Program. Now, some might choose to listen to them, but I \nchoose to listen to the real New Jersey experts. Governor Corzine says \nthe bill will have ``an enormous negative impact for individuals and \nfamilies with HIV in New Jersey.''\n  New Jersey stands to lose millions of dollars in the first year alone \nwith these losses increasing over time. The losses will disrupt and \ndestabilize the comprehensive continuum of care that has been \nestablished. And New Jersey's HIV/AIDS providers and advocates are \nunified against the proposed bill and know the real impact these cuts \nhave on real lives.\n  The medical director from the Monmouth Medical Center and HIV Clinic \nin Long Branch, NJ, a clinic funded by Ryan White funds, says:\n\n       Since our inception in 2001, we have doubled our size. \n     Fifty-two percent of our clients are women. Forty-eight \n     percent are African Americans. The majority of our clients \n     have no insurance and no access to medications, except to the \n     State ADAP program. Our patients are living longer and having \n     a better quality of life. In fact, this past year we have had \n     8 babies born to HIV-infected women. None of these infants \n     are infected with the virus. To ensure that we will not lose \n     ground in the fight against this epidemic, the Ryan White \n     program must be reauthorized so that existing clinics and \n     programs continue to provide medical access for care and \n     treatment. Please do not dismantle the system at the expense \n     of another, they tell us.\n\n  Now, I really had to bite my lip earlier because some came to the \nfloor of the Senate and had the audacity to say that New Jersey is a \nprivileged State. To them I say: I would gladly give up the privilege \nof being No. 1 in the Nation in the proportion of women living with \nAIDS. I would gladly give up the privilege of having the third largest \nproportion of children living with HIV/AIDS. I would gladly give up the \nprivilege of having the fourth highest number of people living with \nHIV/AIDS. I would gladly give up the privilege of having the fifth \nlargest number of new AIDS cases each year--each year--despite the fact \nthat we are only the ninth largest in total population. I would gladly \ngive up the privilege of having the fifth highest rate in reported \ndeaths due to AIDS.\n  I am sure that the 32,000 people living with HIV or AIDS in New \nJersey would love nothing more than to be able to\n\n[[Page S10602]]\n\ngive up that privilege, or the people of color who account for 75 \npercent of all HIV/AIDS cases, or the women who make up more than a \nthird of all people living with HIV/AIDS. I am sure they would gladly \ngive up that privilege as well.\n  These same experts have argued that New Jersey is receiving more than \nits fair share of Ryan White funding. But what we are hearing is just \nanother numbers game to try to avoid the real issue, which is the \ncompletely inadequate funding in this reauthorization bill.\n  When you look at the full picture, without just zooming in on the \npiece that happens to fit your argument, New Jersey is one of the most \nexpensive States in which to live in this country. Yet it spends less \nper person--less per person--than 15 other States, including Alabama, \nWyoming, South Dakota, Montana, Alaska, Idaho, Massachusetts, Vermont, \nthe District of Columbia, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, and \nMichigan.\n  So just to put things in perspective, according to the Care \nCoalition, Alabama spends about $5,778 per HIV/AIDS patient, and \nWyoming spends $5,984 per patient. In contrast, New Jersey spends $800 \nless than Alabama and $1,000 less than Wyoming per patient on HIV/AIDS \ncare. So I cannot accept the numbers as those would have it constructed \nfor the purposes of pursuing their argument.\n  There are more than 2,130 new HIV/AIDS infections each year in New \nJersey, and in 2004 New Jersey reported almost 2,400 new HIV and AIDS \ncases, more than all but 4 other States. Ryan White funding is being \nput to good use saving lives and helping individuals avoid disability \nand lead productive, successful lives. In New Jersey, we are giving \n32,000 people with HIV/AIDS a new lease on life. We have one of the \nmost effective ADAP programs in the Nation, as well as comprehensive \nservices, including primary medical care, mental health service, \nsubstance abuse services, oral health, case management, nutritional \nservices.\n  So thanks to the success of New Jersey's network of care, we have \nseen a sustained drop in the number of HIV/AIDS deaths each year. \nHowever, with this growing population, there is a growing need for \nservices. It is blatantly clear that any cut to our State is a \ndestructive blow to the very network of care that countless men, women, \nchildren, and babies are counting on.\n  Now, I would be happy to have a straight, one-year reauthorization in \nwhich all would be made whole if the majority is willing to accept it. \nI am also willing to find a solution to the real problem, which is a \nsevere shortage of funding--a severe shortage of funding. As I said, I \nam happy to give up the privilege--I would be happy, as would the lives \nof those individuals who find themselves struggling day in and day out, \nthey would be happy to give up the privilege that we heard about on the \nfloor. But I cannot stand by and watch the hopes and dreams of New \nJerseyans living with HIV/AIDS be extinguished by this misguided \nproposal.\n  How can I go back to constituents in New Jersey living with HIV or \nAIDS and tell them it is a fair deal to have them put their lives at \nrisk? I can't and I won't, and we can't have an appropriate \nreauthorization.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Republicans \nhave an extra 15-minute slot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. ENZI. I have been allocated in that slot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. ENZI. I would assume that the Senator from New Jersey has had \nadequate time to look at the unanimous consent request that I presented \nearlier, and I will be making that unanimous consent request again. He \nmust be ready to debate the AIDS bill that New York and New Jersey have \nproposed, and I am ready to grant time to have a vote on that bill as \nwell as the bipartisan, bicameral bill passed by the House last night. \nI have no fear of that. This Nation has a lot of problems with HIV and \nAIDS that need to be taken care of. There is one bill that does that \nfairly--a bill that the House overwhemingly passed. A bill with a \ncomprehensive, fair and equitable solution. There is another one that \nmerely extends the time where we keep doing the same thing that we have \nbeen doing. A quick fix that would give us the same results that we \nhave been getting--people across the country are dying because of not \ngetting treatment, because of unfair, inequitable funding formulas that \nignore the new, emerging epidemic of HIV in rural areas and the \nSoutheast.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Mr. President, \nwould the Senator from Wyoming yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ENZI. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, just a parliamentary inquiry as to the \norder of speakers and where we are, based on the last unanimous consent \norder.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Senator Enzi has 15 minutes, then Senator \nLandrieu has 15 minutes, and then another Republican has 15 minutes, \nand then the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Salazar, has the fourth 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I thank my friend \nfrom Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank my neighbor from Colorado. As we set it up earlier, \nwe have been alternating times. I am glad that I have the opportunity \nto speak right after the Senator from New Jersey. I know he turned down \nthe unanimous consent request earlier. I am hoping that he will accept \nthe unanimous consent this time.\n  Tomorrow is a very critical time for people in the United States. \nThese States, the red states in this chart in particular, will start \nlosing significant funds at midnight tomorrow night if the current \nfailed formula is not fixed. California loses $18.78 million; \nConnecticut, $3.2 million; the District of Columbia, $6.93 million; \nDelaware, $1.52 million; Georgia, $9.68 million; Illinois, $12.48 \nmillion; Oregon, $1.38 million; Pennsylvania, $9.25 million; \nWashington, $2.42 million; Maryland, $11.64 million. We can fix this \nformula tonight. A solution, passed overwhelmingly in the House, is \nbefore us now.\n  I appreciate the letter that I got from the Senator from Maryland, \nMs. Mikulski, reminding me that this goes into effect tomorrow and \nasking me to get the Ryan White bill done.\n  Now, when we reauthorize this program by using the bill that came out \nof my committee and passed overwhelmingly in the House, there will be \nsome changes to the formula--saving many States from significant and \ncritical losses. Instead of California losing $18.78 million, they will \ngain $15.38 million because the money is going to follow the cases, and \nthey are not going to get the penalty that they would have under \ncurrent law. I have the chart that shows the gains for a number of \nStates. All the ones that I mentioned would have gains instead of \nlosses. So this is a critical piece of legislation to all of these \nStates.\n  We are talking about unfairness and inequity. This isn't the only \nbill on which we are changing formulas so they more accurately address \nthe problems they were meant to address. The reason we have \nreauthorizations is so that on a regular basis we can review the monies \ngoing to States, see how it is allocated, see if it needs to be \nallocated on a different basis so that it is more fair. Our committee \nran several hundred evaluations to see different kinds of formulas at \nthe suggestion of members of the committee and Members of the Senate to \nsee what the fairest way would be to do this bill.\n  Now, not only did we pick the fairest way to transition, by holding \nthose States harmless for 3 years, but we chose the fairest formula in \nthe long-term that ensures that Americans with HIV/AIDS get the \ntreatment they need on an equitable basis no matter their race, gender, \nor where they live. I have to tell my colleagues, there is not another \nbill we have done that allows this kind of inequity--under current \nlaw--to continue to give those States time to prepare for the formula \nshift. Of course the States that do not obtain equality for 3 years are \nusually pretty upset. They think that the equality ought to come in \nmuch earlier in the process.\n\n  So we had a number of States that said, How come it gets to be unfair \nfor\n\n[[Page S10603]]\n\nthat long? We said we are going to try to protect these States so they \nhave a time to transition, so they prepare their systems for the change \nin the funding.\n  One of the things that was raised earlier this afternoon was that it \nis more expensive to live in New Jersey. It is more expensive to live \nin New York.\n  It is pretty expensive to live in DC, too, and DC is going to lose \n$6.93 million, if we don't pass this legislation. If we pass this bill, \nthey are going to gain $4.35 million. It is a change for a lot of \nStates, but it is a change to fairness based on the number of people \nwith HIV/AIDS, not the number of institutions that we have been funding \nin these States. This program is not for economic development. It is \nnot a way to keep jobs. It is a program to keep patients alive.\n  On these other bills I have been working on--the Older Americans \nAct--includes a 5-year transition. Some of the States said, By golly, \nwe have been cheated for years. We ought to get our money faster, but \nthey have agreed to a 5-year transition.\n  The ones who are losing money have said: Okay, we understand, that is \nfair. You gave us a time to transition.\n  We have 9 or 10 bills that my committee has to do that deal with \nformulas. I can tell you the first reaction of every Senator, including \nmyself, is to say: Print the chart out, see what happens to my State. \nNaturally, you get upset if your State is not going to get as much \nmoney as they got before. But, fortunately, the majority of the Members \naround here look and say, Is the amount I am getting fair?\n  Higher costs--I want to go back to that again. What we are providing \nare the AIDS drugs, and the AIDS drugs cost the same all over this \ncountry. It doesn't cost more for an AIDS drug in New York than it does \nin Wyoming. As for expenses, we only have a couple of big cities in \nWyoming--Cheyenne is 52,700-and-some people, that is our biggest city; \nCasper is next with a little over 50,000, and then it drops off \nsignificantly.\n  If a third of your towns have less than 250 people in them, how many \nof those do you think have a hospital? How many of those even have a \ndoctor to look at somebody with HIV/AIDS? They have to travel a long \nway at great inconvenience and great cost. We don't cover that. We \ncover the treatment.\n  When we crafted the current funding proposal, we ran dozens of these \nvarious formula options to see which was the fairest way to do it, \nwhich one created the least amount of disruption. That is how we came \nup with the current funding formulas in this bill. We are being asked, \nof course, to consider another bill, introduced on Tuesday of this week \nby the Senators from New York, New Jersey, and Florida. I believe we \nshould debate this bill. However, I have problems with this bill \nbecause what that other bill does is delay this argument over funding \nformulas for 1 year. It doesn't do the equity for sure at any time. So \nin our bipartisan, bicameral bill, what we said is we will delay equity \nfor 3 years. Three years is better than 1 year, so I really don't \nunderstand why anybody is holding this bill up.\n  I understand that they lose money. I understand that. However, they \nare grossly overpaid. As I have shown before, under the current law, \nthe State of New York gets $504 more than the average per patient \nacross the rest of the Nation. New Jersey gets $310 more per person \nthan the average across the rest of the Nation.\n  Under the reauthorization, New York will still get $304 per person \nmore; New Jersey will still get $88 per person more. As I have \nmentioned, all of the funds have not been spent every year. So we are \nsaying New York does not want to share even what did not spend.\n  I can understand Senators being concerned over losing the money. What \nI am just asking is we take a look at the whole national picture, just \nlike we are taking the whole national picture in some other bills \npending before the HELP Committee. For all of those bills, I pledge \nthat during this next year we will have hearings where we look at the \nformulas in these other bills and see how we can transition more \nquickly than we have been doing, to move toward equity.\n  If you have people who are dying of AIDS and you have people who \ncannot be treated for HIV, you have a real problem. We are not talking \nabout parks or things that might be considered luxuries. We are talking \nabout life and death. The earlier we start treating people, the more \nchance they have for survival.\n  Fortunately, very fortunately, there have been a lot of drugs that \nhave been developed for the market that make a difference, now, for \nthose infected with HIV; these drugs will extend their lives. We don't \nhave to wait until they are in the AIDS category to do that. We don't \nhave to do that to give them as good a life as possible. We can start \nproviding life-saving treatment when we know they have HIV. We can \npositively extend their lives.\n  That is what we are trying to do with this bill. Under the other \nbill, introduced on Tuesday of this week, the supporters are \neliminating, again, the count of HIV, the ability to treat those with \nHIV. As far as fairness, don't you think we ought to treat as early as \nwe can with the capability that we have instead of just waiting until \nthey have AIDS and then counting them and pay for them?\n  The other bill doesn't take into account the HIV folks at all. If I \nwere one of the Senators from those two States, and I have been holding \nout this long, I would be here yelling too, I guess, because I would \nhave to explain why I was doing what I'm doing--and not just to the \npeople in my State. I would have to be explaining why I was being an \nobstructionist for life-saving care to the whole Nation. Of course, \nthose outside my State don't get to vote for me, but we do have an \nobligation to all of those folks across the Nation.\n  When we have equitable funding formulas, if States come up with a \nhigher HIV/AIDS population than we thought they would have, we may have \nto put more money into it. But the additional money ought to come with \nthe additional cases. We ought to have some numbers to back up what is \nhappening, and not everyone has the numbers to back up their current \nfunding. We have some waiting lists, waiting lists of people who are \nwaiting for life-saving treatment. But if they look at the waiting list \nthey may say, I am not going to gain treatment anyway, so why would I \neven get on a waiting list? Thus, there may be thousands more, not \nseeking treatment because, where they live, we are not treating them \nequitably. I do know there are some difficulties out there.\n  I know the time to vote on Ryan White is now or never because as soon \nas the clock strikes midnight tomorrow night thousands of Americans \nwill start losing access to the life-sparing treatment unless we pass \nthe bill now. I can't understand why four Senators are denying people \nsuffering from HIV/AIDS to vote on this critical legislation to create \na more equitable program.\n  Earlier today, the Senators from New Jersey and New York suggested \nthat the answer to the inequities in Ryan White is more money. I say we \ncan talk about more money in Ryan White as soon as the States that are \nhoarding funds allow current dollars to focus on those in need, \nindividuals on waiting lists throughout the country. We have to address \nthe current inequities, not compound them by just adding more dollars \nto a failed funding formula. We don't want to continue to have the rich \nStates get richer while the poor States get poorer.\n  The Senator from New Jersey also suggested this bipartisan bicameral \nbill was not supported by minorities because the National Minority AIDS \nCouncil did not support the bill. One council does not capture all the \nminorities. In fact, over seven minority organizations, including the \nAlaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, Brother 2 Brother, Latino \nCoalition, League of United Latin American Citizens, the National Black \nChamber of Commerce, the National Minority Health Month Foundation, and \nthe New Black Leadership Coalition support this bipartisan bicameral \nproduct.\n  In addition, 34 other organizations support this key legislation, \nincluding key national advocate organizations such as AIDS Action, AIDS \nHealthcare Foundation and the Southern AIDS Coalition.\n  I ask unanimous consent the full list of supporting organizations be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S10604]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Organizations That Support Final Passage of Ryan White HIV/AIDS \n                      Treatment Modernization Act\n\n\n                               H.R. 6143\n\n       AbsoluteCare Medical Center; ADAP Coalition; AIDS Action; \n     AIDS Action Coalition; Huntsville, AL; AIDS Action Ohio; AIDS \n     Alabama, Inc.; AIDS Healthcare Foundation; AIDS Outreach of \n     East Alabama Medical Center; AIDS Resource Center Ohio; \n     Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium; American Academy of \n     HIV Medicine; American Dietetic Association; Am I My \n     Brother's Keeper, Inc.; Birmingham AIDS Outreach; Brother 2 \n     Brother.\n       Carepoint Adult, Child and Family Center; Catholic \n     Charities Diocese of Fort Worth; Columbus AIDS Task Force; \n     County of Los Angeles; County of Riverside; County of San \n     Diego; First Ladies Summit; Governor Robert L.

May I ask my time?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 5 seconds left.\n  Mr. ENZI.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about an \nissue that, of course, many of us have been involved in now for years, \nliterally, trying to provide a revenue stream for the Gulf of Mexico--\nnot just Louisiana but Mississippi, Alabama, and Texas. For 40 years or \nlonger, they have contributed more oil and gas to this Nation than \nSaudi Arabia and Venezuela combined. In the minds of many along the \ngulf coast, particularly post-Katrina and Rita, two of the largest \nhurricanes to hit the North American continent, people along the gulf \ncoast are feeling, on this issue, that perhaps the gulf coast has been \nforgotten.\n  I want to say to my colleagues here, Republicans and Democrats, the \npeople of the gulf coast are grateful, extremely grateful for all the \nsupport given this year for hurricane relief--not one, not two, not \nthree, but four supplementals.\n  Mr. President, you yourself have been down there personally, walking \nthe neighborhoods that were destroyed and being a strong advocate for \nus on the Appropriations Committee. So we are very grateful.\n  But there are two extremely important bills and issues that we must \nhave to complete this package of initial recovery and lay a foundation \nso that the gulf coast can build securely. We know we can rebuild, but \nthe question, from Pascagoula to Beaumont is, Can we rebuild safely?\n  We have counties in east Texas and parishes in west Louisiana, \nwestern Louisiana and southeastern Louisiana, and counties in \nMississippi, that have literally been 100 percent destroyed. I mean, in \nSaint Bernard Parish there was not a house left standing out of 75,000 \npeople.\n  It is so tragic because this particular parish has flooded like this \nnot once but twice. Saint Bernard Parish has flooded, not once but \ntwice. It flooded in 1965, when Hurricane Betsy poured about 10 feet to \n12 feet of water, sort of in the same way--a storm surge, aided and \nabetted by this channel that the Corps of Engineers dredged to help the \nport and help navigation on the Mississippi River, which helps the \nwhole country. But it really didn't help the people of Saint Bernard \nbecause they lost their homes. President Johnson came down and pledged, \n``Never again.''\n  Here we are, 35 or 40 years later, and they have lost everything \nagain. Some of these families who built back from Betsy, they are 70, \n80 years old, to have it washed out again. It is just too much for this \nSenator to bear. It is too much for our delegation to bear.\n  There are two major pieces of legislation that the Louisiana \ndelegation cannot go home without this Congress, and that is the WRDA \nbill, because it is the water resources bill of the United States of \nAmerica. Since we have more water than almost anybody, this is a huge \nbill to us.\n  We are not managing our water well. It has flooded our homes.\n  We have to pass this WRDA bill to help us build our levies, \nnavigation channels, locks, and dams to protect our people--not because \nwe are a charity case but because we contribute so much wealth to the \nNation. The Nation can't do without it. You wouldn't want to try. If \nyou did, and our pipelines closed and our refineries closed, and south \nLouisiana, south Texas, and the southern part of Mississippi and \nAlabama closed, you would just as soon turn the lights out in this \nChamber. There would be no economy in the United States of America.\n  That is a bold statement. You say: Senator that is not true. We could \ndo without you.\n  If I showed you the charts, which I am not going to bore you with, \nyou could not get anywhere near the oil and gas we need to fuel the \neconomy in this country without it.\n  We can't go home without the WRDA bill, and we can't go home without \nthe offshore oil and gas revenue.\n  As much money as we get in WRDA, and as many projects as we get in \nWRDA, we can't wait every 10 years to authorize our project. We need an \nindependent stream of revenue to secure our wetlands, to restore them. \nWe have lost more wetlands than the State of Delaware. We lose a \nfootball field every 30 minutes. We lost the size of the District of \nColumbia in the last storm. I don't know how much more we can lose. If \nan enemy came to our shores to take our land away the way we are \nletting it drift into the gulf, we would have declared war.\n  Our delegation put in a bill for OCS revenue sharing. We said we have \na deal for the country. We will open even more in the gulf. Everyplace \nelse is shut down. Nobody wants to drill, so let us even drill more. We \nwill open up 9 million acres, and we will share the revenues with \nTexas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. The country gets enough \nnatural gas to fuel 1,000 chemical plants for 40 years. That is a lot \nof gas. The Southern States would share in a very fair and reasonable \nway these revenues. We think that would be a good thing for America.\n  This is the Jack well that Chevron just found. It is one well, 28,000 \nfeet deep, and it has doubled the reserves in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  When I hear some critics of the Senate approach saying to me--to the \nSenators from Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Texas--that our bill \ndoesn't do anything, it is just a wonder of what it might do if we \ncould maybe find five more Jack wells here or 10 more. Who knows. There \nis a lot of land.\n  The great beauty of our arrangement is we protected the coast of \nFlorida, as the Florida Senators and the Governor of Florida, Governor \nJebb Bush, have asked us to, and we still found enough territory to \nopen.\n  We are leaving here without this bill that makes a tremendous amount \nof\n\n[[Page S10605]]\n\nsense because we just couldn't finish negotiations with the House.\n  But I am very hopeful that when we return in the lame duck that it is \na lame duck and not a dead duck because I could get a lame duck \nhobbling out of here, and I can't take a dead duck home. We need to \ntake something home that is alive and flapping to give these people \nhomes, to restore these wetlands, and for heavens' sake, send some oil \nand gas to the industries in America that are really on the edge right \nnow of whether to expand these refineries or not because China looks \nmore promising every day.\n  If we don't give them hope, they are going to leave and jobs are \ngoing to be lost.\n  I see my good friend from Idaho who knows this issue well. He might \nwant to take one of my minutes and add a thought about this because he \nhas been a good partner on this issue. I would appreciate his words on \nthis chart or anything he wants to talk about.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. I will be \nvery brief.\n  This is very important for all of us to listen to. Just because gas \nprices are falling at this moment, we should not walk away from an \nopportunity to continue to build reserves and known reserves in the \ngulf and other areas, for the U.S. Geological Survey says it is \nphenomenally plentiful. The well Senator Landrieu just talked about at \nthe 28,000-foot level has contributed mightily to an unbelievable drop \nin gas prices over the last month and a half, coupled with the lack of \nstorms. Yes, other things are going on. But the reality is that the \nAmerican producer now knows less of their potential is not at risk \nbecause it is under the control of the United States. It has taken that \n$20 risk figure off the top of a barrel of oil, dropping it into the \nlow sixties range or high fifties range. That is what is reducing the \nprice at the pump.\n  I thank the Senator from Louisiana for her continued effort. I hope \nthis Senate and the House will recognize the potential of building U.S. \ndomestic reserves that are safe, out of harm's way, out of the way of \nthe political, fragile nature of other countries of the world.\n  I thank the Senator for her steadfastness. I and others will help her \nwith this goal.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I want to call my colleagues' attention \nto this chart which I had my office put together today. I thought it \nwould be a good chart to leave with because maybe it will put a little \nenergy underneath our efforts to get something done when we get back.\n  Production from the gulf coast is over 1 billion barrels of oil. The \ntotal production from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela together is 973 \nmillion barrels of oil.\n  I do not know if the Governors of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and \nAlabama want to shut down production. But if they do, there would be a \nreal problem for the country. I know people might say that couldn't be \ndone because you don't have jurisdiction over pipelines, and the \nFederal Government could operate that. I would hate to see the court \nbattles that would ensue. We actually have one court case pending which \nwas filed by the State of Louisiana alleging that the appropriate \nenvironmental standards have not been attended to. And the judge will \nrule on that in November.\n  No Governor other than Governor Blanco has taken that step, and no \nGovernor has suggested it. I am not giving testimony that I have heard \nthem even privately say it. But I can promise you that the people in \nthe Gulf of Mexico are getting tired. Everywhere I go, people in Texas, \nMississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana say to me: Senator, why are we the \nonly ones producing? And why when you go to Washington and ask them to \njust share these revenues with us they say no? Don't they know that we \ndon't have any houses to live in? Don't they know our churches have \nbeen ruined? Don't they know our children don't have schools? What is \nwrong with Congress?\n  I am having a hard time explaining that.\n  For people who say the Senate bill doesn't do anything, I think 1 \nbillion barrels of oil--almost equivalent to 60 percent of what OPEC \ncontributes on a yearly basis--is a lot of oil.\n  Considering things aren't going real well in Venezuela these days, we \nmight want to get this bill passed and help our industry and help our \npeople.\n  In the last 4 minutes, I want to say in the spirit of cooperation \nthat I filed a bill today on the issue of royalty recovery. This is an \nissue with the House of Representatives. It is an issue with us. It is \nan issue with the other House, and it is an issue with us. I thought \nmaybe this would help everybody to see.\n  We can talk about it when we come back, of course.\n  These are the wells that were issued in 1998 and 1999 that did not \nhave thresholds. There were over 1,000 of them. I am sorry I can't \nidentify the 15 that are producing, but out of these there are only 15 \nthat are producing. These are the ones which are producing and \nroyalties are being generated because there was a mixup in the \ncontract. When we get back we should resolve this issue. That is what \nmy bill says, and it suggests how to do it.\n  Some of this money could go to Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and \nAlabama in the earlier years. Some could go to the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, and a lot of it could go to deficit reduction. We \ncould reduce the debt on people and get a little head start on our \ncoastal restoration, as well as do something for the Nation on land and \nwater.\n  We could debate how the revenue should be shared, but I laid a bill \ndown today to give us maybe a starting point for people who discuss how \nwe might do that.\n  I will conclude with this: The Louisiana delegation cannot go home \nfor Christmas without the WRDA bill and without the OCS bill. We are \ngoing to be here a long time until those bills are passed. We want to \nwork with people, we want to be cooperative, and I filed a bill to \nsolve this problem and meet the House halfway on this issue.\n  Then let's do something when we get back and work hard to get \nsomething out to the American people that could make at least the \nindustry have a happy Christmas. Individual consumers might not feel \nthe price of natural gas directly. But our industries and big and small \nbusinesses certainly do, and our farmers most certainly do. It would be \na good Christmas present to give them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The next 15 minutes is allocated to the \nRepublican Senators.\n  Who yields time?.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield back the Republican time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized \nfor 15 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10605-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10605-S10606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise tonight to speak to the so-called fence bill and ask my \ncolleagues and urge them to oppose the construction of this fence in \nthe way it has been proposed to the Senate.\n  I oppose the construction of this fence because at the end of the day \nthis is not going to fix our borders. It is not going to deal with the \nlawlessness that we currently are having to deal with with respect to \nimmigration, and it is not in the long-term interests of the United \nStates of America.\n  For me, I may be the No. 100 U.S. Senator, but I have heroes on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  I remember Ronald Reagan when he went to the Berlin Wall and he told \nMr. Gorbachev that he should take down the Berlin Wall. He was about \ntaking down walls and bringing communities together.\n  I remember John Fitzgerald Kennedy, a person who inspired my whole \nlife in politics and our country. I remember him working on creating \nthe Alliance for Progress with the notion being that the Western \nHemisphere would be a much more successful hemisphere if we were able \nto work with nations that were all a part of this hemisphere. That \nAlliance for Progress by President Kennedy is still celebrated \nthroughout the United States and throughout Latin America because of \nhis vision that we would bring communities together. Yet what we are \ndoing today on this national security issue of immigration reform is \nabandoning\n\n[[Page S10606]]\n\nprinciples and allowing politics to triumph.\n  This body tonight, by voting for what I expect will be successful \npassage of this bill, has allowed politics to triumph over what is in \nthe best long-term interests of this country and over the principles \nthat we worked on together to try to bring about comprehensive \nimmigration reform.\n  I stood with a number of my colleagues on the Republican side putting \ntogether what was a comprehensive immigration reform package. We had \nleaders on the Democratic side who have inspired me for ages, such as \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Durbin, and Senator Reid standing with people \nsuch as Senator Craig and Senator McCain and Senator Graham and others \nto try to pull together comprehensive immigration reform. At the end of \nthe day, we were able to get that comprehensive immigration reform. The \nPresident lauded it because it was a good bill. It was legislation that \ndealt with creating a system of law and order, that would have taken us \nout of the lawlessness we currently have in our country with respect to \nimmigration and have created a comprehensive system to deal with this \nmajor issue of national security, economic security and moral values.\n\n  Our legislation dealt with border security. Our legislation dealt \nwith the enforcement of our immigration laws. Our legislation dealt in \na realistic way with the penalties and the registration that would \napply to the 12 million or so people who are here in this country \nundocumented today. It was legislation that was comprehensive in \nnature.\n  Yes, we were proud we had Senators such as Graham, McCain, Specter, \nReid, Kennedy and a whole lot of other Members who stood behind this \ncomprehensive approach to immigration reform.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I support, as did the Senator from Colorado, \ntough border security. I voted, as did the Senator, for an amendment in \nthe context of an immigration reform bill that would have authorized \nfor Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff 370 miles of fence based on \nwhat he told the Senate he needed. Building some fencing as part of a \ncomprehensive reform bill makes sense.\n  Would the Senator agree, we cannot take a piecemeal approach to \nfixing our borders?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I agree with my friend from Nevada that, indeed, \nSecretary Chertoff and others have said that a fence by itself will not \ndeal with the problems we are facing in immigration.\n  Secretary Chertoff's statement was, in his words:\n\n       In fact, building a fence in the desert would have the \n     somewhat ironic result of requiring us to put more bodies \n     right up against the border because it would be a less \n     efficient way to deal with it.\n\n  So, yes, the Secretary of Homeland Security himself, along with the \nAttorney General of the United States, has taken a position that this \nis the wrong way to go.\n  Mr. President, as we put together this legislation, I want to quickly \nreview what it is we did as we went through the legislation.\n  First of all, with respect to border security, we were tough on our \nborder, but we were substance. We said we would add 12,000 new Border \nPatrol agents.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say my friend from Colorado, we have an \nimportant agreement we would like to put before the Senate. I ask the \nSenator from Colorado allow me to interrupt him.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time remains.\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, before the unanimous consent request from \nmy colleagues, I was talking about\n\n[[Page S10607]]\n\nwhat we had done together in the bipartisan spirit of moving forward \nwith a comprehensive immigration reform package that the President had \nrequested us to work on together and on which there was a great deal of \nleadership on the part of the Members in this Chamber to accomplish a \ntask which the Nation needed.\n  That was a piece of legislation which was the law and order bill. It \ndealt with border security. It dealt with the enforcement of our \nimmigration laws. It dealt with the system of penalties and \nregistration that would have brought the 12 million people who now live \nwithin the shadows of America out of the shadows. It is an important \npiece of legislation.\n  Yes, there was disagreement in the Senate as we debated that bill for \nalmost a month. At the end of the day, Democrats and Republicans came \ntogether to pass a comprehensive immigration reform.\n  I will quickly review a few of the components of that bill. First, \nwith respect to border security, we said we would add 12,000 new Border \nPatrol agents. We would create additional border fences. We would \nprovide new criminal penalties for the construction of border tunnels, \nthe legislation pushed by my colleague, Senator Feinstein from \nCalifornia. We would add new checkpoints and points of entry so we \ncould control our borders. And we would expand the exit-entry security \nsystems at all land borders and airports.\n  We took some significant steps forward in the legislation, including \na 370-mile fence, which was an amendment. We took significant steps \nforward on legislation that was tough on border security. It included \nlegislation that was an amendment proposed by the Senator from Alabama \nwhich would have constructed a 370-mile fence. That was a comprehensive \npiece of legislation.\n  In addition, we said we would be a nation of laws and we would \nenforce our laws. We did that with a number of different provisions \nwhich included an additional 5,000 new investigators. It included 20 \nnew detention facilities. It included provisions to reimburse the \nStates their costs for detaining and imprisoning criminal aliens. The \nlist goes on. It was a tough bill that said, we are going to enforce \nthe immigration laws of our country.\n  We did not stop there because we have the reality of an elephant in \nthis room, in this country: the 12 million people who live here. Under \nthe leadership of Senator McCain and Senator Kennedy, we came up with a \nprogram that would have brought these 12 million people out of the \nshadows through a system of penalties and registrations that would have \napplied to them. We would have required they pay a fine of $1,000 \ninitially. It would require they register with the U.S. Government, \nthat they pay an additional $1,000 fee. They go to the end of the line, \nthe back of the line, they learn English, and a whole host of other \nsteps.\n  Our bill was a comprehensive bill. One of the finest moments of this \nSenate was that there were a number of Republicans and Democrats who \ncame together to pass that legislation.\n  Tonight, unfortunately, we are in a position where the politics of \nthe day and the politics of the Senate have triumphed over the national \nsecurity interests which we addressed in this legislation.\n  The values that drove at least my participation in that debate, along \nwith my colleagues including Senator Martinez from Florida, were simple \nvalues. They were the values that said we are a nation of laws. That \nmeans we have to have a law that is going to work, that is going to \nsecure our borders, that is going to get rid of the lawlessness we \ncurrently face.\n  The other value that drove me is something which Senator McCain, my \nfriend from Arizona, often talked about when he talked about the \nhundreds of people who are dying in the deserts of his particular \nState. To me, those values are values that we should keep at the \nforefront, the value of us being a nation of laws and also the moral \nvalues we have to the rest of humanity.\n  I do not believe that this political gimmick of a fence that is \narbitrarily dictated by Washington to Arizona, California, and Texas is \nthe right way to go. I don't need to go very far to find people would \nhave agreed with me. The Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection \nunder this administration says it doesn't make sense. It is not \npractical. That was on June 20 of this year. The Attorney General of \nthe United States, Gonzales, said, ``I think that's contrary to our \ntraditions.'' Secretary Chertoff said that, in fact, building a fence \nin the desert might be problematic and unrealistic.\n  There are a number of people in the Bush administration who raised an \nobjection to this particular proposal that we are considering tonight.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. May I keep going for a couple of minutes and I will be \nhappy to yield for a question from my friend from Illinois.\n  I say to my friends who are listening tonight, I do have some \npersonal history on this issue because my family came here in 1598, \nlong before Jamestown, some 12 generations ago. We have been around a \nlong time.\n  My own history is one where I know I am the first Mexican American to \nserve in this Senate in 30 years--the first Mexican American in 30 \nyears and the only one, ever, elected to the Senate outside of the \nState of New Mexico.\n  When I look at this issue of the border, I approach it from the point \nof view that we as a nation have a sovereign responsibility to protect \nour borders. We have a responsibility to make sure we have a systematic \nlaw in place that deals with the immigration issues of our country. But \nI also believe, just as Ronald Reagan asked Mr. Gorbachev to take the \nwall down between East Germany and West Germany in order to end the \ncold war, there will come a time when, hopefully, this Senate is part \nof taking down this wall between Mexico and the United States.\n  Before I conclude, I yield to my friend from Illinois for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Colorado. I thank him for his \nleadership on comprehensive immigration reform which includes real \nborder enforcement, workplace enforcement, dealing with the needs in \nour country for immigration--legitimate legal immigration--and also \ndealing with those who are here who should be given a chance to earn \ntheir way toward legal status.\n  I also agree with my colleague from Colorado about this notion of a \n700-mile fence. No matter where I go in the State of Illinois, I ask \npeople, Do you see the weakness in the logic and the weakness in the \nargument of a 700-mile fence on a 2,000-mile border? It is obvious. It \nis pretty clear to me that this political bidding war on a border fence \nhas more to do with the security of those who are up for reelection in \njust a few weeks than the security of America.\n  You do not have to be a law enforcement expert or an engineering \nexpert to know that this fence, as it has been defined in this bill, is \nso expensive--$6 billion--and that we are now passing a homeland \nsecurity bill that has $1.2 billion, not nearly enough to even start \nand build half of this fence.\n  So the realistic thing to do, as the Senator from Colorado and I have \ntried to do, is to work for sensible fences, sensible barriers, the \nbest technology, the best security personnel, work for those processes \nand technologies that will truly make sure the illegal immigrants stop \ncoming across our border.\n  I thank the Senator from Colorado for his leadership.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank the leader and great Senator from \nIllinois for his leadership in putting together the comprehensive \nimmigration reform package.\n  Parliamentary inquiry: How much time do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). Fifty-four seconds.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Fifty-four seconds. Let me just conclude. Mr. President, \nI hope as we move forward as a Senate we can find the courage in this \nbody tonight to turn down this political gimmick; that in this body \nthere are statesmen and people of principle who believe we ought to put \nour national security interests ahead of politics; that there are \npeople in this body who believe we ought to address the economic \nrealities of America's farmers and ranchers and construction workers, \nconstruction companies, and others; that there are people in this body \nwho can look at the future of the Western Hemisphere, including our \nrelationship with Latin America, and\n\n[[Page S10608]]\n\nrecognize that at the end of the day the fence that is being proposed \ntoday is going to be inimical to the long-term interests of the United \nStates of America as we unite as a global community to deal with the \nissues of terrorism around the world; that this fence is going to be \nsomething that is going to hurt us in building those alliances.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against this fence bill. \nAnd I urge we do it in a bipartisan way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, there is now time for a speaker from the \nmajority side until 9:10.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield back the 10 minutes to the \nmajority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back 10 minutes to the \nmajority, the majority's time until 9:10.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have 3 minutes, and for the benefit of \neveryone here, I might as well use it now. There is nobody else to \nspeak, is there?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair sees no one else. The Senator from \nIllinois appears to be trying to do that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly, if I might.\n  Mr. REID. I have time under the order. Please go ahead.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader. I ask \nunanimous consent to be recognized as in morning business to speak for \n5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RES. 594\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, just 2 days ago I came to the floor and \nintroduced a bipartisan resolution, the resolution cosponsored by \nmyself, Senator Mark Dayton, Senator Norm Coleman, Senator Tom Harkin, \nand others. What did the resolution say? It said that we would \nrecognize that we are about to observe the fourth anniversary of the \ndeath of our former colleague, Paul Wellstone, who died in an airplane \ncrash during his campaign for reelection to the U.S. Senate for \nMinnesota.\n  It speaks of his service to Minnesota, the fact that he was a loving \nfather and husband, that he dedicated his life to public service and to \neducation, and that he worked tirelessly to advance mental health \nparity for all citizens of the United States.\n  This, of course, goes on to explain, in the course of this \nresolution, that Paul Wellstone died before he could pass the most \nimportant bill on this subject, the mental health parity bill. So I \nresolved that:\n\n       [O]n the fourth anniversary of his passing, Senator Paul \n     Wellstone should be remembered for his compassion and \n     leadership on social issues throughout his career;\n       Congress should act to help citizens of the United States \n     who live with a mental illness by enacting legislation to \n     provide for equal coverage of mental health benefits with \n     respect to health insurance coverage unless comparable limits \n     are imposed on medical or surgical benefits. . . .\n\n  That language in this resolution is directly from the Domenici-\nWellstone bill on mental health parity. I go on to say:\n\n       [M]ental health parity legislation should be a priority for \n     consideration in the 110th Congress.\n\n  The next Congress.\n  Mr. President, I never dreamed that anyone in this Senate would \nobject to this resolution, this resolution acknowledging the death of \nour former colleague and asking that the great cause he dedicated most \nof his public life to continue, and that we pass this bipartisan bill \nwhich has been pending on the floor.\n\n  That was the reason I brought this to the floor. I thought it would \npass without controversy. I was shocked to learn that someone has put a \nhold on this resolution. I cannot understand that.\n  I would now ask the clerk if it is necessary--I would like to make \nsure that this resolution has been filed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator please restate his inquiry?\n  Mr. DURBIN. My question to the clerk is whether this resolution has \nbeen filed.\n  So as to expedite this, what I would like to do is send this \nresolution to the desk that I have in my hand and ask unanimous consent \nfor its immediate consideration and adoption of the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, there is an objection on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, imagine that, observing the fourth \nanniversary of the death of one of our colleagues, acknowledging his \nlife of public service, and simply asking that the next Congress take \nup his bill to try to make sure those suffering from mental illness \nwill get fair treatment and compensation under their health insurance \nplans, I find it hard to believe. But if that is the nature of our \nbusiness, if we have reached that level of partisanship, then it is \nregrettable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I understand what the problem is on this \nresolution. All of us loved Paul Wellstone. What an advocate he was. \nWhat a believer he was. But in this legislation, as I understand this \nresolution, it calls explicitly for the endorsement of those who \nsupport the resolution of a mental health piece of legislation that is \nnot universally accepted. Some people, I understand, have suggested we \nuse a different, a general affirmation of the goal of that legislation, \nand that we could all support.\n  But I think it is a bit much to ask, on a resolution, without any \nstudy, that this Senate take a position on a specific piece of \nlegislation. I think that is where we were on it. Everybody who knew \nPaul Wellstone loved Paul Wellstone. I am sorry and think almost, I \nhave to say, it is a little bit unfair and not collegial to push the \nlegislation or the resolution as worded in a way that makes any of us \nfeel that we would not be acceptable to a resolution to honor Paul \nWellstone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I submitted the language in this \nresolution to the Republican side. I have worked on three different \nversions of the language to find something that mirrors the language, \nthe purpose clause, of the bill that was introduced by Senator Domenici \nand Senator Wellstone, calling on the Senate to try to enact \nlegislation to meet that goal.\n  There may be Senators who vote for this resolution and want to offer \nan amendment or change it. That is the way this place works. But to \nsuggest if you call for legislation to give people with mental illness \na chance for compensation in your health insurance that it is not \ncollegial--it is not collegial? I have offered this resolution and \namended it twice in an effort to be as collegial as possible. But it is \nhard to understand.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator has asked that this body, through the \nadoption of this resolution, endorse a piece of legislation that \neverybody is not prepared to endorse. We would be prepared to endorse \nthe concepts contained in the resolution. And I think that has been \ncommunicated to you. I do not see how you could expect--unless you \nexpect unanimous support for the piece of legislation as written--that \nyou could ask everybody to accept it.\n  I think you are overreaching, Senator Durbin, in all due respect. And \ncould we work on that? I would be glad to talk to you about it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to my friend from Alabama, we have been working on \nit for days.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, I am prepared to--\n  Mr. DURBIN. Excuse me. I have the floor. If the Senator would like to \nvote against the resolution, that is his right. But to say that we are \nnot even going to consider this resolution, I think, is regrettable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10608-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10608-S10616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SECURE FENCE ACT OF 2006--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, since all of our efforts to go to \nconference with the House and to secure comprehensive immigration \nreform were unsuccessful, I am reluctantly voting in favor of the H.R. \n6061, the Secure Fence Act of 2006. After many hearings and a laborious \nmarkup, the Judiciary Committee produced a comprehensive bill providing \nfor border security, employee verification, guest workers and a \nsensible plan to handle the 11 million undocumented immigrants.\n  Despite repeated efforts, we were unable to secure a conference with \nthe House to reconcile differences between the bills the House passed \nand the Senate legislation.\n  There was successful opposition to piecemeal legislation by the House \nthat would have, for example, enabled state and local police to enforce \nimmigration laws. During a field hearing I held at the Philadelphia \nConstitution Center on July 5, 2006, Philadelphia Police Commissioner \nSylvester Johnson testified that making local enforcement of \nimmigration law would undermine the basic function of local police. He \nfurther testified that ``once we start enforcing immigration law, then \nwe are going to lose . . . that response from the immigrant community \nbecause they are not going to contact us. Nor will they contact us if \nthey have information about other people, about other violence-type \nthings.''\n  The one major issue which has reached the Senate for a vote despite \nour efforts to avoid piecemeal legislation is the fence issue. As to \nthe substance of the construction of the fence, I have long supported \nthis facet of border security--in fact, our bill produces 370 miles of \nfencing through major urban areas and adds 500 miles of vehicle \nbarriers along the U.S./Mexico border. On this state of the record, \nsince I do support the construction of the fence and since we have \nsucceeded in avoiding any substantial piecemeal legislation, I am \ncasting my vote in favor of H.R. 6061.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this year the Senate passed a comprehensive \nimmigration bill. Senators and staff worked tirelessly to negotiate and \npass that bill, which was a comprehensive, fair solution that respected \nhuman dignity, and recognized the need for strong border security. The \nresponse we got from the majority in the House of Representatives was \nobstruction. Rather than proceed to a conference to try to hammer out a \nmeaningful solution, the House leadership ignored our calls to proceed \nand spent the month of August holding sham hearings on the Senate's \nbill meant only to undermine the work we completed and inflame anti-\nimmigrant passions. Now the House leadership, enabled by the majority \nleader, asks us to forget all about the efforts we made and take up and \npass a narrow, unbalanced bill to help their election chances.\n  If there is any doubt that this effort by the majority leader is \npolitical, consider the timing of this bill. On September 21st of this \nyear, just as the majority leader brought this bill to the floor, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security announced the beginning of its Secure \nBorder Initiative with the award of a multi-year, billion-dollar \ncontract to the Boeing Corporation to begin work on a state-of-the-art \nborder security system. Yet, at the same time the Department of \nHomeland Security tries to secure the border with 21st Century \ntechnology, the Senate majority seeks to duplicate and confuse those \nefforts with a plan straight out of the 18th century. Despite the \nnumerous problems in that agency, it is still a better idea to let them \nproceed with the Secure Border Initiative than it is to throw even more \ntaxpayer money at a redundant and inferior project.\n  The majority leader seeks to pass this legislation--with little \ndebate and no amendments--to pander to the anti-immigration crowd. I \nunderstand that the Republican majority wants to leave this session \nwith something they can take with them and hold up as a Republican \nvictory for national security, but true security means more than hiding \nbehind walls. We should be unwilling to sacrifice our chances at \ncomprehensive reform to appease the isolationist faction in this \ncountry. Voting against this bill is not a vote against national \nsecurity; it is a vote in favor of the comprehensive bill the Senate \nalready passed.\n  Regrettably, this bill also contains a requirement for a study to be \nconducted on the necessity and feasibility of a barrier on the \nCanadian-American border. I have filed an amendment to strike this \nstudy, but the majority leader, as is his practice when bringing up \ncontroversial bills to score political points, has obstructed \nDemocratic Senators from offering amendments to improve this bill. To \nthink that we would even consider engaging in this type of unilateral \nbehavior is mind-boggling. Have we learned nothing from the Bush-Cheney \nadministration's go-it-alone strategy? As a Senator from a northern \nborder state, I cannot emphasize enough how important it is for us to \nengage our neighbors in a cooperative manner when it comes to security. \nIf we were to pass this legislation, we would send a message to our \nCanadian allies that we don't trust their ability to achieve security \nand we would ignore the fact that border security is in both of our \nbest interests. We will achieve much more by working respectfully and \ncooperatively with the Canadian government than we will by conducting \nstudies as to whether we should wall off one of our most valuable \nallies.\n\n  Another deeply troubling aspect of this bill is the virtually \nunlimited grant of authority to the Department of Homeland Security to \n``take all actions . . . necessary and appropriate'' to secure the \ncountry's border. The bill's grant of authority to the Secretary of \nHomeland Security lacks any boundaries--any delineation of where such \nauthority ends. It would abdicate congressional authority and delegate, \nwith no intelligible principle, unlimited power to an executive agency \nto achieve broad goals, for which the method of achievement is left \nundefined. Recall that this is the same agency that was responsible for \nthe utter failure in responding to Hurricane Katrina. We are still \ncoming to grips with the fallout from that disaster, which was made \nworse by the administration's incompetence during the storm, and its \ncontinuing failures to curb contracting abuses that have slowed the \nreconstruction. People along the gulf coast continue to suffer as a \nresult of the administration's incompetence, and we are here debating \nwhether to embark on yet another billion-dollar contracting folly. This \nis a disgrace.\n  This week, the U.S. inspector general for Iraq reconstruction \nreleased a report on a $75 million project to build the Baghdad Police \nCollege, which the inspector general called ``the most essential civil \nsecurity project in the country.'' In his report, the inspector general \ncalled the project a ``disaster'' and said ``the truth needs to be told \nabout what we didn't get for our dollar from Parsons,'' the contractor \nresponsible for the debacle. For $75 million in taxpayer funds, the \nAmerican people and the Iraq police forces got a building that is \ncurrently uninhabitable due to substandard workmanship, and which may \nhave to be demolished.\n  When the Bush administration proves that it cannot even ensure that \none of the most critical aspects of Iraq reconstruction is done \ncompetently, I shudder to think about the potential abuses that could \ncome along with the building of 700 miles of fence. At the rate\n\n[[Page S10610]]\n\nthat this administration's crony contractors are performing, I have to \nwonder if a fence ever could get built that didn't have gaping holes in \nit. Before we hand over even more authority to the Bush-Cheney \nadministration to create yet another opportunity for their crony \ncontractors to rip off the American people, maybe we should actually \nconduct some oversight and demand some sorely needed accountability.\n  Groups from all over this country, from all sectors of our society \nhave weighed in against the building of this fence. From religious \nleaders to immigration advocates, from environmental organizations to \ntrade associations, from women's rights organizations to academics; \nopposition to this last-minute, cobbled-together-proposal is \nwidespread. It is clear to me that the idea of turning our country into \na fortress is an idea that many Americans view as contrary to our \nvalues and our heritage, and I will stand with them in opposition to \nthis bill.\n  The proposed footprint of this fence will trench through the \nsovereign territory of the Tohono O'odham Nation in Arizona, who will \nbe precluded from any involvement in the project. Chairwoman Vivian \nJuan-Sanders of the Tohono O'odham Nation wrote Members of Congress \nurging legislators to rethink this proposal before we decide to \nsignificantly impair a fragile environment and a long-developed working \nrelationship between the O'odham Nation and the United States \ngovernment to improve border security. We would do well to listen to \nthe concerns of those whom this bill will affect most.\n\n  Secretary Chertoff has said the border fencing provisions contained \nin the Senate's comprehensive immigration bill are what the department \nneeds to secure our borders. During our debate on comprehensive \nimmigration reform, Republican Senators held out Secretary Chertoff's \ndesire for the 370 miles of fence as justification for supporting that \namendment. Those same Senators who spoke so forcefully about the need \nfor 370 miles of fencing now are saying we need more, nearly twice as \nmuch. It seems clear now that the arguments from those Senators meant \nvery little.\n  For those who fear that voting against this bill will allow them to \nbe viewed as ``soft'' on national security, remember that this body \nalready passed a bill that contained provisions for a border fence, \nalong with many other significant security measures. The American \npeople are smart enough to understand what is going on here, and I am \nconfident that the American people are sick and tired of being scared \ninto swallowing every irresponsible proposal put forth by this \nRepublican Congress under the guise of national security. Yesterday, a \nmajority of this body voted to erode key elements of our Constitution \nbeyond recognition, and passed a bill that I am certain we will come to \nregret. If we pass this fence legislation, we will continue this \ndownward spiral of reactionary, fear-driven legislating. It is time for \nus to stand up against those who seek to corrupt the underpinnings of \nour democracy. I have had enough, and I suspect that a majority of the \nAmerican people have had enough.\n  We need to stop and think about the mark a fence like this will make \non our character as a nation. Once this fence is built, it will be very \ndifficult to go back, and we will have taken a step down a road that I \ndo not think a civilized and enlightened nation should travel. In a \ncountry on the cutting-edge of technology, with a history of legendary \ningenuity, and driven by innovators of the highest caliber, we can do \nbetter: we can secure our borders through human innovation, technology, \nand vigilance. When we approach our immigration situation in a \ncomprehensive manner, we will see how unnecessary this wall is. When we \nachieve comprehensive reform, rather than piecemeal false solutions, we \nwill realize the security we need. Long after the political and \ncultural storms over immigration pass, this cobbled-together fence will \nremain an ugly scar, and will serve as a reminder of a very poor \ndecision made out of fear rather than reason. Rather than strength, \nthis fence will symbolize weakness and a lack of confidence in \nourselves. I will vote against this bill, and I hope other Senators \njoin me in rejecting this blatant and costly political stunt.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, as I traveled across all 67 counties of \nthe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, almost to a person my constituents \nunderstand that America is not controlling our borders. From Berks to \nButler, from Wayne to Westmoreland and Erie to Philadelphia, and across \nall income bracket and regardless of race, thousands of people tell me \neverywhere I go that we have to address our border security now. More \nthan that, they tell me we must not reward or give preferential \ntreatment to illegal aliens whose first step on our soil was a \nviolation of our laws. They are clear, they do not want amnesty.\n  And I hear from all the talking heads and think tank wonks about how \nour Nation is a nation of immigrants. Well, obviously, except for the \nNative Americans, we are all immigrants from somewhere, and I am no \nexception.\n  My grandfather made so many sacrifices to give my family the \nopportunities we have all had. He left his family back in Riva de la \nGarda, Italy, to come to America and make a better life for them. He \nworked in the Pennsylvania coal mines and met the legal requirements to \nbring over my grandmother and my dad to Pennsylvania but that meant 5 \nyears away from his family to earn the right to bring them over. Yes, \nimmigrants are more than welcome in America, and they have made great \nincredible contributions to our society--but they have done so legally.\n  My family and millions of others have lived the American dream of \nfinding good paying jobs, better education and safe environments for \nour children. The key is that it can and must be done legally. The \nfoundation for the American dream must be built on the solid \ncornerstone of the rule of law, not the leaky sieve that characterizes \nour current borders.\n  This immigration crisis has been caused by decades of flawed amnesty \npolicies that have left our borders porous and dangerously undermanned. \nThe public is understandably frustrated that in the post-9/11 world we \nlive in where our national security depends on our border security--we \nstill do not know who is coming into our country, where they are from, \nand what they are doing here. I share their frustration and cannot for \nthe life of me understand why my colleagues continue to put \npartisanship and posturing over our national security.\n  The 9/11 Commission stated in the preface of its report that ``[i]t \nis perhaps obvious to state that terrorists cannot plan and carry out \nattacks in the United States if they are unable to enter the country.'' \nUnfortunately, many of my Senate colleagues do not think this is so \nobvious. Well, it is obvious to the U.S. attorney for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania who, in applying for an antigang grant, said \nthat with the influx of illegal immigrants to the 222 Corridor that \n``the Latin Kings, Bloods, NETA and lately MS-13, are recruiting or \nfighting with local gangs for control of the drug markets. Violence is \na daily by-product.''\n  The evidence is clear that the current immigration crisis poses an \nimmediate threat to our communities--gang violence, drug trafficking, \nmurders, rapes, and the burdensome costs shouldered by our public \neducation, health, and housing systems. Just last week the Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement arrested more than 100 criminals, fugitive \naliens, and other immigration status violators living throughout \nPennsylvania--from Philadelphia to York to Pittsburgh. Among those \narrested were individuals convicted of sex offenses, burglary, larceny, \nrobbery, criminal trespass, weapons violations, narcotics violations, \naggravated assault, shoplifting, fraud, and resisting arrest.\n  It is time--well, frankly it is well past time--that we put first \nthings first--we must secure our Nation's borders now.\n  Our friends in the House passed an immigration bill that understands \nthe urgency of securing our borders, but it is impractical--both in \nenforcement practice and in politics. And then the ``comprehensive'' \nSenate bill did exactly the wrong thing--offering illegal immigrants \namnesty, providing them Social Security benefits, relieving them of tax \nburdens Americans face, and giving them better worksite employment \nrights than American citizens enjoy. It was the wrong bill at the\n\n[[Page S10611]]\n\nwrong time and failed to pass the one real test of securing our \nborders.\n  Yet as I travel the State, it is clear to me that many people do not \nknow what all is in the Senate bill. That lack of information is \ndangerous for our national security but even more dangerous to our \nPennsylvania jobs, tax revenue, education system and social welfare \ncosts.\n  So let me start by reminding you what is wrong with S. 2611.\n  It does not protect American workers. In fact, Americans--U.S. \ncitizens--can be put out of work--or their wages reduced--by the \nemployment of the guest foreign workers.\n  It gives social security benefits for illegal work or stolen \nidentities. Why does this matter? Ask my constituent--Laurie Beers--who \nhad her Social Security number stolen by an illegal immigrant. Laurie \nis a hard-working hospice nurse who is constantly traveling. Recently, \nafter Laurie learned that her information had been stolen and misused \nshe did all of the right things--contacted the Federal Trade Commission \nto report the identity theft, called the identity theft hotline, \ncontacted the three credit bureaus to obtain copies of her credit \nreport, contacted the FBI and the Secret Service to report this breach \nof trust. In response, Laurie received letters confirming she was a \nvictim of identity theft. When she contacted the Internal Revenue \nService, she was told that the man using her Social Security number is \nan illegal immigrant. After talking to the FBI and the Secret Service, \nthey confirmed that the person is an illegal immigrant. And this \nillegal immigrant has been working for an employer in New York and has \neven been filing income tax returns on Laurie's Social Security number.\n  Laurie is understandably upset that the IRS has known for 3 years \nthat someone else has been using her social security number but did \nnothing to notify her or to stop the theft of her identity. \nUnfortunately, the employer--Adecco--will not cooperate with Laurie. In \nfact, Laurie reports that they have been downright nasty. Laurie is \nlucky in that her credit has not been destroyed, but she has been \ndamaged. The person who stole her identity wrote a bad check to J. C. \nPenneys and now Wal-Mart will not accept Laurie's checks--something \nthat will show up on her credit report.\n  That bill forgets the ``guest'' part of ``guest worker'' as the \n``guest worker program'' is neither temporary nor based on the need for \nnon-American workers.\n  It requires Mexican ``cooperation'' to protect our own borders.\n  This bill provides amnesty, but tries to calls it ``earned \nlegalization.'' Proponents of the bill say that this is not amnesty, \nand that an alien has to meet certain conditions; but do they really? \nIllegal aliens in the amnesty program are supposed to pay a fine of \n$2,000. However, that $2,000 fine only has to be paid ``prior to \nadjudication,'' or up to 8 years from now. And they get a benefit \nAmericans would love to have. Under the bill, illegal aliens only have \nto pay 3 of their last 5 years in back taxes. They get an option of \nwhich years, while Americans do not get that choice.\n  It give employers a free pass for hiring illegal aliens. The bill \nsays that employers of aliens applying for adjustment of status ``shall \nnot be subject to civil and criminal liability for employing such \nunauthorized aliens.'' Unbelievable.\n  The bill will dramatically raise spending and increase welfare costs. \nThe Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation, \nJCT, estimate that this bill would increase direct spending by $16 \nbillion over the 5 years and $48 billion over 10 years. But what about \nall of the entitlement programs such as welfare? Illegal immigrants are \ncurrently ineligible for most federal welfare benefits, but when you \ngive citizenship as this bill does those currently here illegally will \nbe eligible for welfare programs. If just 60 percent of those currently \nhere illegally get citizenship--the ballpark figure of the number that \nhave been here more than 5 years--Robert Rector at the Heritage \nFoundation estimates that welfare costs will increase by more than $11 \nbillion per year.\n  However it may be even more important to note what the Senate bill \ndid not do. We know that we must secure our borders, so my colleagues \nand I tried to add a provision to require a certification that the \nborders are secure before granting legal status to any alien who \nentered the United States illegally. I was not only surprised but \nextremely disappointed that our efforts to do this right--to secure our \nborders first before dealing with the 11 million illegal aliens in our \ncountry--failed. So that bill continues to put the cart before the \nhorse--and continues to hold our national security hostage to a \n``comprehensive solution.''\n  For this reason, in June I introduced my own bill--the Border \nSecurity First Act, S. 3564. My bill takes a first-things-first \napproach. This first step cannot, and should not, wait for a \n``comprehensive'' solution. When we secure our borders--and only then--\nwe can address the remaining illegal immigration-related challenges \nwith the apposite remedies.\n  Despite consensus on all of the border security provisions in my \nbill, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have not allowed us \nto move forward that legislation. Nonetheless, this week the Senate is \nworking to send to the President a bill to secure our southern border \nwith 700 miles of at least double-layer fencing. I am glad we are here \ntoday to take a real first step--admittedly a modest step but at least \na first step--toward demonstrating to the American public that we have \nheard you, that we understand we need to address border security first.\n  And the American public has been clear, but let me focus on my State \nfor a minute. In Pennsylvania, my constituents have been clear--80 \npercent oppose amnesty for illegal immigrants, and 84 percent support \nbuilding a fence on the southern border. Stop the flood and do not give \namnesty. That is the message, colleagues. It cannot be plainer. We must \nlisten and put America's border security first, reject amnesty, and \npass this bill.\n  Border security cannot wait for more hearings, debate, and \ncompromise; it must be done right, and it must start now. This bill is \na good first step.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, on May 17 of this year, the Senate passed a \ncomprehensive immigration reform bill that contains a real solution to \nthe immigration crisis in this country. S. 2611 was passed with strong \nbipartisan support. In a Congress that has been marred by partisan \npolitics, the success of this bill--this truly bipartisan compromise--\nwas a breath of fresh air: an achievement to be proud of.\n  What has happened now, however, is something to be ashamed of. Once \nagain, politics has hijacked policy. Knowing they cannot go home \nwithout taking some action to address immigration, Republicans in \nCongress have decided that saving their seats is more important than \nsecuring the borders.\n  You might wonder how we got here--when the Senate passed \ncomprehensive immigration reform back in May and the House passed an \nenforcement only bill in December 2005. Once again, the answer is \npolitics. Rather than moving to conference to work out some sort of \ncompromise on these bills, Republicans in the House traveled around the \ncountry holding 60 one-sided hearings under the guise of gathering \nevidence.\n  This was not a good-faith effort to create effective policy. It was a \nstalling tactic used to run out the clock on comprehensive reform. That \nkind of political gamesmanship will not work on me.\n  Everyone under the sun is for fencing on the border. A fence is an \nimportant part of comprehensive reform. I supported an amendment to the \ncomprehensive reform bill that authorized 370 miles of triple-layered \nfencing and 500 miles of vehicle barriers along the southwest border. \nAnd I supported $1.8 billion in funding for the construction of that \nfencing and 461 miles of vehicle barriers. I supported construction of \nthis fence because I believe that it is a critical part of \ncomprehensive immigration reform.\n  But no one in a million years thinks this is the answer. No one in \nthe world thinks Congress should pass this fig leaf and call it a day. \nIf you address the reasons why immigrants come into our country--their \nability to find work with a relatively small chance of getting caught--\nas well as how they come in, then increased fencing makes much sense. \nFencing alone simply cannot work.\n\n[[Page S10612]]\n\n  You don't have to take my word for it. Governor Janet Napolitano of \nArizona, a border State where much of the illegal border crossings \noccur, said this about the fence proposal:\n\n       You show me a 50-foot wall and I'll show you a 51-foot \n     ladder . . . That's the way the border works.\n\n  Consider the words of the former Secretary of Homeland Security, Tom \nRidge. He said:\n\n       Trying to gain operational control of the borders is \n     impossible unless our enhanced enforcement efforts are \n     coupled with a robust Temporary Guest Worker program and a \n     means to entice those now working illegally out of the \n     shadows into some type of legal status. . . . [E]ven a well-\n     designed, generously funded enforcement regimen will not work \n     if we don't change the immigration and labor laws that \n     regulate how would-be workers can come to the United States.\n\n  What he is saying is that only comprehensive immigration reform, such \nas S. 2661, will actually fix our immigration problem.\n  And, you know what? His former boss, the President of the United \nStates, would agree. Speaking in the Oval Office just days before the \nSenate passed S. 2611, the President said:\n\n       An immigration reform bill needs to be comprehensive \n     because all elements of this problem must be addressed \n     together, or none of them will be addressed at all.\n\n  Current Secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, also \nendorses comprehensive immigration reform:\n\n       For [our] Secure Border initiative to be fully effective, \n     Congress will need to change our immigration laws to address \n     the simple laws of supply and demand that fuel most illegal \n     migration and find mechanisms to bring legal workers into a \n     regulated, legal Temporary Worker Program, while still \n     preserving national security.\n\n  Perhaps most importantly, the people on the ground in the front lines \nof the immigration struggle tell us that only comprehensive immigration \nreform can work. As Jeffrey Calhoon, deputy chief patrol agent for the \nYuma sector of the Border Patrol said:\n\n       We need a comprehensive immigration reform that provides \n     additional resources for border security, establishes a \n     robust interior enforcement program and creates a temporary \n     worker program.\n\n  A vote cast in favor of this fence--in the absence of comprehensive \nreform--is a vote cast in favor of a piecemeal approach that we know \nwill fail, is a vote cast against comprehensive immigration reform. \nThat is what this vote is about. As my friend Senator Specter, said, \nvoting for the Secure Fence Act will undermine our chance to enact \ncomprehensive reform. He should know. He is the chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee.\n  The Secretary of Homeland Security has not asked for the amount of \nfencing provided for in this bill. Although the bill does not authorize \na specific amount of fencing, it does dictate exactly where the fencing \nshould be put up. Some people believe the bill authorizes 730 miles of \nfencing, but Customs and Border Protection, CBP, however, estimates \nthat it will require 849 miles of fencing to get the job done.\n  We can't even estimate the amount of fencing based on funding levels \nbecause the bill contains no specific funding authorization. We do \nknow, however, that it will be expensive. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity estimates the cost of a single layer of fencing to be $4.4 \nmillion a mile and vehicle barriers to $2.2 million. Because double \nfencing requires extra money for building all-weather roads, the total \nestimate from the Department of Homeland Security is $6.6 billion, $9 \nmillion a mile.\n  There are many other things that we could do with that kind of money. \nWe could hire, train, and equip more Border Patrol agents. We could \npurchase more detention beds to end our unfortunate ``catch and \nrelease'' policy. We could place more port-of-entry inspectors and \ncanine detection teams in the field. We could invest in new \ntechnologies for border protection, or in an interoperable \ncommunications system for the Nation's first responders. But no, \nCongress would rather punt on the tough decisions and dodge the real \ndebate. What a disgrace.\n  I oppose this failure of the Senate to do its job and live up to its \nresponsibility. I sincerely hope that this vote does not signify the \nbeginning of the end of comprehensive immigration reform as I fear it \ndoes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, for an immigration measure to be effective, \ntwo aspects are necessary. One aspect is enforcement and the other is \naddressing the status of millions of undocumented immigrants who are \nliving in the United States.\n  The Senate spent several weeks earlier this year debating a \ncomprehensive immigration bill which struck an acceptable balance \nbetween enforcement and legalization. We passed that bill but House and \nSenate Republicans have been unable, despite months of negotiations, to \ncome up with a final bill. This is irresponsible at best.\n  The secure fence bill only addresses enforcement but worse, it only \naddresses a small part of enforcement. This bill builds a wall. A wall \nthat will cost as much as $9 billion. And a wall that will be \nineffective. As Governor Napolitano of Arizona said, ``You show me a \n50-foot wall and I'll show you a 51-foot ladder at the border. That's \nthe way the border works.''\n   Apprehending individuals illegally crossing the border only \npartially solves the problem. First, half of the undocumented \nimmigrants in this country came here legally and then overstayed their \nvisas. A fence will not solve that problem.\n  Second, the reason so many try to enter this country is the search \nfor jobs. We must work to cut off the supply of jobs by making it too \ncostly for employers to hire the undocumented. There are laws on the \nbooks that do this, but these laws have rarely been enforced by this \nadministration.\n  Furthermore, no immigration law that we pass will be effective if we \ndo not negotiate and sign bilateral agreements with other countries on \nnumerous issues including taking back aliens removed from the United \nStates, document forgery, smuggling, human trafficking, and gang \nmembership.\n  Immigration is one of the most important issues Congress has to \naddress. But we did address it in March. It was thorough and thoughtful \nyet tough, and it is the conference report for that bill that we should \nbe passing tonight, instead of this ineffective enforcement bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to discuss the bill pending \nbefore us, the Secure Fence Act of 2006.\n  Over the past year, many Senators, as well as President Bush, have \ndedicated themselves to addressing the problems of our broken \nimmigration system. In April, the Senate overwhelmingly passed, in a \nbipartisan fashion, a comprehensive immigration reform package designed \nto secure our borders as well as address the economic need for workers \nin our Nation. In passing this legislation, the Senate rejected the \nargument for an ``enforcement first'' strategy that focuses on border \nsecurity only, an ineffective and ill-advised approach. Congress cannot \ntake a piecemeal approach to a national security crisis. I believe the \nonly way to truly secure our border and protect our Nation is through \nthe enactment of comprehensive immigration reform. As long as there is \na need for workers in the United States and people are willing to cross \nthe desert to make a better life for their families, our border will \nnever be secure.\n  The Secure Fence bill authorizes 700 miles of fencing along our \nsouthern border. To many in Congress, this sounds like a ``quick fix'' \nto our border security problems. However, in a briefing before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee last spring, Secretary of Homeland Security \nChertoff clearly stated that only 370 miles of fencing along the \nsouthern border is necessary. I find it interesting that this bill \nwould mandate 700 miles of fencing in light of the Secretary's \nstatement. In fact, it is my understanding that the Secretary feels \nthat the additional 330 miles of fencing is not only unnecessary but \nalso imprudent because it will force DHS to reduce funding other border \nsecurity initiatives.\n  Because of the clear wishes of the Secretary and the concerns of \nborder communities over the disruption the construction will cause to \ncommerce along the border, a group of Senators, including myself, had \nhoped to offer and vote on an amendment that would allow the Secretary \nof Homeland Security, the true expert on securing our border, to decide \nwhere fencing was necessary along the border and where money was better \nspent on other types of border security measures. It would have asked \nfor local community input on the placement and construction of\n\n[[Page S10613]]\n\nthis wall. My understanding is that this amendment had been circulated \nin both Chambers and no objections had been raised by the leadership in \nthe House or the Senate or the committees of jurisdiction. \nUnfortunately, because of the objections of a single Senator, we are \nnow unable to offer and vote on this commonsense, fiscally responsible \namendment.\n  Another amendment that we had planned to offer, dealing with the \ndefinition of ``operational control'' of our border, met the same fate. \nThis amendment would have given a reasonable and achievable meaning to \nthe term ``operation control'' as it relates to the Secretary's duties \nin this bill. However, again, the same Senator raised an objection to \nthe clarification of this definition. I believe that this bill, and \nmore importantly, our Nation's security, will be worse off for this \nobjection to making commonsense improvements to this bill.\n  I have struggled and debated over how I should vote on this bill. I \ntruly believe that we must have comprehensive immigration reform and \nwill continue to dedicate myself to achieving a thorough response to \nour Nation's struggles with illegal immigration. However, since I am \nforced to choose between nothing and a fraction of the border security \nthat our country needs, I must support providing some form of border \nsecurity. As a Senator from a border State, I recognize that we are \nfacing a crisis in our border region and infrastructure improvements to \nour border security are desperately needed.\n  If Congress thinks that it can continue this piecemeal approach to \nborder security and achieve any real results for our national security, \nit is sadly mistaken. Mr. President, I hope that we can return in \neither a lameduck session or in the 110th Congress to not only correct \nthe problems in the bill before us but also make a serious effort at \ncomprehensively reforming our Nation's immigration system.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to \nexplain why I voted against limiting debate on the Secure Fence Act of \n2006 when that vote occurred last night.\n  In large measure my decision to vote against cloture was procedural. \nThis Senate has had no opportunity to debate and amend the bill before \nus today. There are some very important amendments that our colleagues \nwould have like to offer which now they cannot.\n  Those who do not understand Senate procedure might ask, how could \nthat be possible? After all, hasn't this bill been the pending business \nof the Senate off and on for 6 days?\n  Let me explain. The Senate majority leader has, as is his right, used \nSenate procedures to block Senators from offering or voting on \namendments. He has done what is called filling the amendment tree. \nUntil the Senate voted last night to limit debate on this legislation, \nno vote was taken on any amendment to this bill. Now that cloture has \nbeen invoked, many otherwise pertinent and important amendments are no \nlonger in order to this bill.\n  Unfortunately, that has been the pattern of conduct with respect to \nthis legislation and others in this Congress. This bill was rushed \nthrough the House of Representatives on September 14. There were no \nSenate hearings on the matter, no committee input into the content of \nthis bill. That is not the way this Senate ordinarily does business, \nand it is certainly not the best way to address legislation that is \nsupposed to be improving our Nation's security .\n  The Senate already had a very serious and responsible debate on the \nsubject of border security in the context of its deliberations of \ncomprehensive immigration reform. We spent 9 days debating many \namendments on that bill, including amendments related to the \nconstruction of fences along the U.S.-Mexico border. The bill \nultimately adopted by the Senate provides for 370 miles of fencing in \nthe most vulnerable high-traffic areas along the U.S.-Mexican border. \nThat is what the administration requested and recommended. It also \ncontained a very important requirement that Federal authorities first \nconsult with those who will be most affected by construction of such a \nfence--relevant local, State, and Federal agencies on both sides of the \nborder. I supported that legislation.\n  Why is it that the Senate is now being asked to consider a far less \ncomprehensive approach to securing our country? Does anyone really \nbelieve that by simply building a fence, adding physical barriers, \nlights, cameras, and sensors along 730 miles of our southern border, we \nare somehow going to make our Nation secure? Do we really believe we \ncan be secure without the cooperation of other governments, most \nespecially our immediate neighbors, Canada and Mexico? And do we really \nbelieve that by unilaterally putting up barriers on our southern border \nand contemplating doing the same on the northern border, we are \nstrengthening the will of Canada or Mexico to give us that cooperation?\n\n  Is the next step going to be building fences along the remaining \n1,300 miles of our southern border and the more than 3,000 miles of our \nnorthern border? At what cost? The Congressional Budget Office puts the \ncost of the current fence proposal at $3.2 million per mile of fence. \nOther estimates are even higher--$10 million per mile for some \nstretches of the fence. When you add in annual maintenance, the cost of \nthe fence could exceed $1 billion. So are we prepared to spend another \n$5 billion to $6 billion or so to construct an additional 4,300 miles \nof fencing to complete the job?\n  In the meantime our immigration system is broken. More than 10 \nmillion undocumented aliens live among us but at the same time outside \nthe legal structures of our Government creating additional economic and \nnational security challenges which the comprehensive immigration bill \npassed by the Senate responsibly sought to address. The pending bill \ndoes not.\n  The House and Senate passed very different legislation related to \ncomprehensive immigration reform and enhanced border security. The \nPresident endorsed the Senate-passed measure. What would usually be the \nnext step in the legislative process would be for the House and Senate \nconferees to meet to reconcile the differences between the two bills. \nBut that is not what has happened in this case.\n  Rather, the Republican leadership, in an effort to score political \npoints, has rushed through this very minor bill authorizing the \nconstruction of fences on the southern border and mandating a study of \nthe advisability of doing so on our northern border. They have blocked \nany serious debate or amendments to the pending matter, and once final \npassage occurs they will declare that our Nation is now secure.\n  That is why I felt strongly last night that we ought to have a real \ndebate on the challenges to our Nation's security and consider relevant \namendments that could address those challenges rather than rushing to \njudgment on the very simplistic and costly approach called for in this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, we do our citizens a real disservice when we let \nelection year politics get in the way of the peoples business.\n  Unfortunatey, it will have to be left to a later date to do what \nwould really enhance our Nation's security; namely, enact legislation \nto fix our broken immigration system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, what is the following order within the \nunanimous consent that deals with this legislation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are five Senators to whom time is \nallotted. Prior to the vote, the time is limited to Senator Salazar, 5 \nminutes; Senator Bingaman, 5 minutes; Senator Craig, 5 minutes; Senator \nReid, 3 minutes; Senator Frist 3 minutes.\n  Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed the \nfirst 5 minutes and Senator Salazar from Colorado take the second 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for 5 minutes, to be \nfollowed by the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about H.R. 6061, \nthe Secure Fence Act, and to express my disappointment that the \nmajority leader has decided to prevent Senators from offering relevant \namendments. I have an amendment, which is germane postcloture, which \nsimply provides the\n\n[[Page S10614]]\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security with discretion regarding the use and \nplacement of fencing along our border.\n  As a Senator who represents a border State, I understand the \nfrustration communities are facing due to the inability of the Federal \nGovernment to secure our Nation's borders. Illegal immigration is a \nserious problem and we do need to do a better job of addressing this \nissue.\n\n  The Senate has passed a comprehensive immigration bill aimed at \nimproving security along our borders and at reforming our immigration \nlaws. Although this bill isn't perfect, it is a step in the right \ndirection. I was very disappointed that the leadership in the House \nrefused to appoint conferees, and instead decided to hold hearings \naround the country to stir up discontent rather than to seek solutions.\n  The Senate has passed a bipartisan bill. The House has passed a bill. \nWe should have convened a conference committee and tried to work out \nthe differences between these bills. The failure to at least make a \ngood-faith effort at coming to an agreement is unacceptable.\n  With regard to the specifics of the Secure Fence Act, I do believe \nthat there are locations along our border where fencing makes sense. \nFor example, I support the $1.2 billion that is in the 2007 Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations bill for fencing, infrastructure, and \ntechnology, and I voted to provide $1.8 billion for the Army National \nGuard to build fencing and vehicle barriers along the southwest border \nas part of the Defense Appropriations bill. In addition, over the last \nseveral years I have secured millions of dollars of funding for fencing \nand vehicle barriers specifically for New Mexico.\n  However, we need to be smart about security. Walls may make good \nsound bites in political ads, but the reality is that the individuals \ncharged with securing our borders have consistently stated that they \nare only part of the solution and that there are better and more cost-\neffective ways to provide for border security.\n  As Ralph Basham, the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, \nstated earlier this year in a response to a question about the proposal \nto build 700 miles of double-layered fencing: ``It doesn't make sense, \nit's not practical.'' He went on to say that what we need is an \nappropriate mix of technology, infrastructure, and personnel.\n\n  Secretary Chertoff has voiced similar concerns, and has consistently \nmaintained that securing our borders will require a much more \ncomprehensive approach than simply building fences.\n  Unfortunately, the bill, as currently drafted, does not provide the \nDepartment of Homeland Security with the discretion they need to \ndetermine the most appropriate means to secure the border. It ties \ntheir hands with regard to the use and placement of fencing.\n\n  Under current law, the Department of Homeland Security already has \nthe legal authority to build the fences that it needs, and I do not \nthink we should be mandating over 700 miles of fencing in specific \nlocations at a cost of millions of dollars per mile unless we know that \nthis is something that DHS believes it is the best way to enhance \nsecurity.\n  This bill micromanages and mandates specifically where DHS must build \nfencing. For example, with regard to New Mexico, the bill states that a \nfence must be built ``extending from 5 miles west of the Columbus, NM, \nport of entry to 10 miles east of El Paso, TX.'' There hasn't been any \nlocal input regarding this specific location and I haven't received any \nindication from DHS that they believe that this is the best place to \nbuild a fence.\n\n  To the contrary, in discussions during one of the southwest New \nMexico Border Security Task Force meetings, the point was raised by \nlocal security officials that the location of the proposed double-\nlayered fencing in the bill is in the wrong place.\n  The bill also mandates fencing in some areas where we just spent \nmillions of dollars per mile to build vehicle barriers. According to \nDHS, it costs approximately $4.4 million for a single layer of fencing \nper mile. The bill we are debating today mandates double-layer fencing, \nwhich adds up to about $6.6 billion for the 730 miles of fencing \nrequired under the bill. If we are going to spend billions of dollars \nto place a fence along over one-third of our southern border, we should \nat least ensure that it is in the right location and that DHS can make \nnecessary adjustments in the interest of securing our borders.\n  To this end, I hoped to offer an amendment that would ensure that the \nSecretary of Homeland Security has the ability to modify the placement \nand use of the fencing mandated under this bill, if the Secretary \ndetermines that such use or placement of the fencing is not the best \nway to achieve and maintain operational control over the border. I \nstrongly believe that this is a reasonable amendment that ensures that \nDHS has the flexibility it needs to alter this proposal if it doesn't \nadvance our overall security strategy.\n\n  Let me be clear, I believe we should do what it takes to secure our \nborders. I have consistently worked to secure increased funding for \nvehicle barriers, surveillance equipment, and additional Border Patrol \nagents. But I also believe we should do it in the most effective way, \nboth from a security standpoint and in terms of costs.\n  I also intended to offer an amendment that would have provided border \nlaw enforcement agencies with much needed relief in addressing border-\nrelated criminal activities. Specifically, the amendment would have \nauthorized $50 million a year in funding to help departments purchase \nnew equipment and hire additional officers. This legislation has wide \nbipartisan support and has passed the Senate on two occasions. However, \nmost recently, the majority party removed this bill from the 2007 \nHomeland Security appropriations bill. If the majority party wants to \naddress security issues, I stand ready to do so. Unfortunately, it \nappears that they are more concerned with political grandstanding than \ncrafting substantive border security policies.\n  I strongly believe that Senators should have an opportunity to offer \namendments and improve the bill. Regrettably, the majority leader has \nused technical procedural rules to prevent Senators from doing so. I \ncannot vote for this legislation without being afforded the opportunity \nto offer my amendments and fix this flawed bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to offer this amendment \nprior to final passage on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on this side there is an objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that I think \nit is unfortunate that we cannot make a commonsense change in this bill \nto make this a workable piece of legislation. It could pass this Senate \nwith 100 votes if, in fact, this amendment were adopted--at least as \nfar as I am concerned it likely would. The fear that the purpose of \nthis bill is to get a bill to the President that has the word ``fence'' \nin the title so that the people can go out and campaign on it in the \nnext 4 or 6 weeks, that is not good government. That is not a good \nresult, policywise, for this country. I, unfortunately, will be \ncompelled to vote against the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nColorado is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I think the objection just heard against \nthe logical amendment proposed by my friend from New Mexico \ndemonstrates the political gimmickry going on in the Chamber this \nevening.\n  His amendment simply would have said that there would be discretion \nfor the Department of Homeland Security Secretary to make a \ndetermination as to where it would make the most sense for these fences \nto go. The objection to that amendment demonstrates what is happening \nhere, and that is that the people who are supporting this legislation \nbelieve Washington knows better than our experts in the executive \nbranch of Government and the people who live along the borders; it \ndemonstrates, again, the political rawness that is behind this fence \namendment being proposed tonight, which I expect will pass because \npeople want to score political points by using this in the immigration \ndebate in our country.\n  Again, the fence by itself is not a solution. The fact of the matter \nis that more than half of the people who are here illegally in the U.S. \ncame here legally. Their visas expired and they are\n\n[[Page S10615]]\n\nin the United States. So putting a fence on the border as proposed in \nthis legislation all by itself will not resolve the comprehensive \nimmigration issues we are facing in our country today.\n  It wasn't so long ago that this Chamber went into a vigorous debate. \nPeople disagreed. I disagreed with my friend from Alabama, but we \nagreed finally on some issues around the fence. There was debate that \ntook place over a comprehensive solution, a fundamental national \nsecurity problem. There were 23 Republicans who came together with \nabout 40 Democrats and said that we will put our Nation's security \nfirst and we will address our national security; we will address the \neconomic security issues of our country, including the agricultural \njobs, which my friend Senator Craig has been so eloquent about today. \nWe were able to get that done.\n  Yet, today, in the waning hours of this session, we are moving \nforward with a political gimmick because people want to ride this horse \nof immigration on this fence-only proposal on the way to victory in \nNovember.\n  Mr. President, I don't believe this legislation is good for the long-\nterm interests of the United States and the Western Hemisphere. I \nbelieve that we as a Senate can do much better.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the fence bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we can build the tallest fence in the world, \nand it won't fix our broken immigration system. Nor will it strengthen \nsecurity on the borders. to do that, we need the comprehensive reform \nthat the Senate passed earlier this year. We have been waiting for \nmonths for the majority to appoint conferees so we could complete this \nimportant legislation, but they have refused to do so.\n  I support tough border security. I voted for an amendment, in the \ncontext of our comprehensive immigration reform bill, that would have \nauthorized Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff's Department to build \n370 miles of fencing--based on what he told us in the Senate he needed. \nBuilding some fencing as part of the comprehensive reform bill makes \nsense. As I have said before, we cannot take a piecemeal approach to \nfixing our borders.\n  We need to do more. We passed a comprehensive bill. It had strong \nborder security, it had temporary worker program, which is so important \nwith agriculture and the resort industry. We also said that we had to \ndo something to take care of the 12 million people who are living in \nthe shadows. What would they do to get out of the shadows? They would \nhave to pay taxes, get a job, learn English, and stay out of trouble. \nAnd we had employer sanctions. Only a combination of all of these \nelements will work to get our broken immigration system under control.\n  Nearly half of the undocumented immigrants in this country came here \nlegally and overstayed their visas. A fence or a wall, no matter how \nhigh and mighty, will not solve this problem.\n  I agree with Attorney General Gonzales, Homeland Security Secretary \nChertoff, and former Secretary Ridge that a fence is not the most \nappropriate or effective way to secure our 2,000-mile southern border. \nAs Secretary Chertoff said:\n\n       Fencing has its place in some areas, but as a total \n     solution, I don't think it's a good total solution.\n\n  The Department of Homeland Security already has the authority to \nbuild fences along our border. This amendment is unnecessary. I believe \nit is not about securing our border but about election-year politics.\n  A majority of the Republicans have made very clear that they are not \nserious about doing anything to get control of the broken immigration \nsystem. Where is President Bush? He said he wants comprehensive \nimmigration reform, and he has been silent. The President and the \nRepublicans in Congress have made it clear that they have no interest \nin going into a conference to enact legislation this year.\n  I believe we can only secure our borders through comprehensive \nreform, as I have outlined. No amount of Republican grandstanding on \nthis issue will change that. The Senate has offered a practical, \nworkable, fair solution to fix our immigration system, and I regret we \nhave not been able to move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we immediately \nconsider Senate amendment No. 5022, known as AgJOBS, offered by myself, \nSenator Feinstein of California, and 53 cosponsors. The amendment is at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I object.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we recognize the need for a fence. We \nrecognize the need for border security. But as we speak, American \nagriculture is losing somewhere between $1 billion and $5 billion at \nthe farm gate because our southern border is closing. We have troops at \nthe border. We are investing now nearly $2 billion a year at the \nborder. This Congress, this Government, wants to prove, as we must, to \nthe American people that we mean it when we say we are going to secure \nour southern border. But I have said for 2 years that, in doing that, \nwe had to tie the cart and the horse together; that is, we needed to \nprovide for the American economy a legal guestworker program. We have \nnot done that. We are not doing that.\n  In my State of Idaho now, there is an 18 to 20 percent reduction in \nthe employment base in agriculture as we speak. In the State of \nKentucky, the tobacco growers cooperative is now losing their tobacco \ncrop because they have nobody to pick. In Illinois, in the orchards at \nthis time, apples are rotting on the trees. In Florida, it is estimated \nthat we have already lost nearly a billion dollars worth of oranges. Is \nthis the fault of American agriculture or is this the fault of a \nCongress that would not take an obsolete and functional law and fix it, \nso that we could have a legal workforce, one that comes and works and \ngoes fast. That is what a guestworker program is all about. In Oregon, \nan apple orchard picking 25 tons a day is now picking 6 tons a day, and \nthe apples are rotting.\n  The Senators from California, Senators Feinstein and Boxer, talked \nabout the produce in the great San Juaquin Valley that rots as we \nspeak. Some will say those farmers should have known better. Maybe they \nshould have. That is why they came to me several years ago and said: We \nhave a problem; help us fix it; help us get a legal workforce.\n  We did not do that. We tried mightily--some of us--but we are now \nrefusing to do that at a time of crisis. So if it is not us to blame, \nwho is it?\n  So let the consumer go to the fresh produce shelf this fall and \nwinter and pay double the price for some of the products. Also, see \nsome of our production move offshore to Argentina and Brazil, because \nit will go where the workforce is if the workforce cannot come to it.\n  None of us want an illegal system. We must have a legal system. We \nwill return in November, and we will be able to add up the losses, and \nthat will be a tragedy.\n  I hope that in November, with those losses calculated--and I hope I \nam wrong; I hope it is not $5 billion or $6 billion or $7 billion. But \nif it is, Senators, roll up your sleeves; we have a problem to solve, \nand it is a very big problem. We cannot afford to lose the fruit and \nvegetable industry of this country. For the sake of America, for the \nsake of American agriculture, it is a labor-intense industry of the \nkind that requires a viable legal guestworker program.\n  Tonight, in a moment of crisis--and we now know it--the Senate of the \nUnited States has refused to deal with the problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is currently under a unanimous \nconsent order for the remaining speaker to be the majority leader, \nSenator Frist, who is allocated 3 minutes.\n  The majority leader is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, last week, immigration agents arrested 120 \nillegal workers at a worksite in Colorado within 1 mile of global \nsurveillance and a missile early-warning facility. Most likely, they \ncame to America to find jobs. But if any had sinister intentions, only \na fence separated them from a critical military facility.\n  Most immigrants come to America with good intentions, but not all of \nthem. Intelligence reports show that\n\n[[Page S10616]]\n\nal-Qaida considers our borders a vulnerability. Imagine how terrorists \nmight exploit a 1,951-mile border with Mexico.\n  We are a Nation of immigrants, but we are also a Nation of laws and \nprinciples. Any attempt to halt the influx of illegal immigrants must \nrespect that fact. The comprehensive immigration reform legislation the \nSenate passed in May struck a careful balance. We took a three-pronged \napproach: fortify our borders, strengthen worksite enforcement, and \ndevelop a fair and realistic way to address the 12 million people \nalready in our country illegally, without offering amnesty.\n  Clearly, we won't reach an agreement on comprehensive immigration \nreform before we leave for the recess, but fortifying our borders is an \nintegral component of national security. We cannot afford to wait until \nNovember to do that. We know what works. We built a 14-mile fence near \nSan Diego and saw illegal immigration in the area drop dramatically. We \ndeployed 6,000 National Guard troops to our southwest border and saw a \n45 percent drop in border apprehension.\n  The comprehensive solution to immigration reform is ideal, yes, but I \nhave always said we need an enforcement-first approach to reform--not \nenforcement-only but enforcement-first.\n  The Secure Fence Act of 2006 let's us get a head start on the first \nprong of comprehensive reform. It requires the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to achieve complete operational control over our border with \nMexico. With this bill, we will have better control over who enters the \ncountry, how they enter it, and what they bring with them.\n  Without the critical security measures included in the bill, we leave \nourselves open to attack. We place our national security at risk.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader yields back the remainder \nof his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the \nbill pass?\n  The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I oppose cloture on the Child Custody \nProtection Act, S. 403, because there are not adequate safeguards for \nyoung women seeking abortions, particularly in cases of rape, incest, \nor health of the minor.\n  On September 22, 1998, I voted against cloture on a similar bill. On \nJuly 25, 2006, I voted against a similar bill.\n  Those bills, like the one now pending, made it a crime to take a \nminor across state lines for purposes of obtaining an abortion without \nparental consent or notification. I opposed that legislation because of \nmy concern for minor girls who have an abusive or bad relationship with \ntheir parents, including circumstances of incest. Such a relationship \nmakes it difficult, if not impossible, for the girl to admit to being \npregnant or to express her desire to obtain an abortion. Additionally I \nam concerned with the delay this bill poses on young girls seeking \nabortions in the case of rape or health risks.\n  Proponents of this legislation have urged me to support it on the \nground that the state judicial bypass laws provide a sufficient means \nfor young girls who have such a bad relationship with their parents, to \nreceive judicial authorization to secure an abortion without their \nparents' knowledge or consent.\n  It has been suggested to me that there may be compelling data that \nthe judicial bypass procedures provide a sufficient means for such \ngirls' interests to be protected. On the current state of the record, \nhowever, I believe that the judicial bypass procedures are not \nadequate, so I do not believe that a Federal crime should be legislated \nfor those who take minor girls across state lines to secure an \nabortion.\n  To those who have urged me to support the legislation and have asked \nme to review such data, I have replied that I would be willing to study \nany such information. As noted, on this date of the record, I could not \nsupport legislating a Federal crime on this issue.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I cannot support the Child Interstate \nAbortion Notification Act, CIANA. First, I object to the decision to \nbring this bill directly to the floor, circumventing the\n\n[[Page S10617]]\n\nSenate's committee process, and to prevent Senators from offering \namendments. This bill contains provisions that have never been debated \nin the Senate not in committee, and not on the floor. Part of the bill \nwe are considering today consists of the Child Custody Protection Act, \nwhich did pass the Senate earlier this year although without being \nconsidered in committee. But this bill also contains a number of \nadditional troubling provisions that should go through the committee \nprocess. At a minimum, Senators should have an opportunity to offer \namendments to legislation that could have such a serious impact on \nyoung women's lives.\n  I voted against the Child Custody Protection Act when it came before \nthe Senate in July because the bill is an overreach of federal power \nthat comes at the expense of the health and safety of young women. The \nnotion that one state may not impose its laws outside its territorial \nboundaries is a core federalist principle, and I believe this bill \nmight very well violate the Constitution. States should retain their \nright to enact and implement appropriate policies within their \nterritorial boundaries. The Child Custody Protection Act would preempt \nthese rights by allowing the laws of certain states to essentially \ntrump the laws in other states.\n  The Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act, in addition to \ncontaining the language of the Child Custody Protection Act, includes a \nnumber of other, even more problematic, provisions. It would implement \nonerous new Federal notification and consent requirements in states \nwhose existing state laws do not meet the bill's standards, raising \nserious federalism concerns, and would subject providers to criminal \npenalties for failing to comply. In addition, these requirements would \nvary for teens and providers according to the state in which the minor \nlives and the state to which she travels, making them extremely \ndifficult to comply with. Not only that, but the new federal \nrequirements do not include a judicial bypass procedure, and do not \nhave an adequate health exception.\n  In an ideal world, all young women who face this difficult decision \nwould be able to turn to their parents. But we do not live in an ideal \nworld, and the reality is that there are young women who feel they \ncannot turn to a parent out of fear of physical abuse or mental abuse, \ngetting kicked out of the house, or worse. This bill would deny these \nyoung women the ability to turn to another trusted adult for help.\n  Our focus in the Senate should be on ensuring that unintended \npregnancies do not happen in the first place. For these reasons, I \nintend to continue my work in the Senate to ensure that all women have \naccess to the best information and reproductive health services \navailable. If we do that, abortions will become even more rare, as well \nas staying safe and legal.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Child Custody \nProtection Act, which will protect the rights of our Nation's parents \nand their children's well-being.\n  I was very pleased with the work of this body when the Child Custody \nProtection Act came before the Senate in July. Through the hard work of \nmy colleagues, I believe we were able to come up with an even stronger \nbill designed to protect our young daughters.\n  The only successful amendment offered to the Child Custody Protection \nAct contained two important clarifying provisions dealing with parents \nwho commit incest.\n  Senator Boxer and I worked together to ensure that parents who have \ncommitted the heinous act of incest are unable to sue, and therefore \nprofit from, someone else who has transported their minor across State \nlines for an abortion.\n  The Ensign-Boxer amendment also added a new provision making it \nFederal crime for someone who has committed incest to transport their \nvictim across State lines for an abortion.\n  Recognizing the importance of preserving parent's rights, the Senate \npassed the Child Custody Protection Act by a vote of 65 to 34.\n  The support of 14 Democrats reflects the reality that this not an \nissue divided on pro-life or pro-choice lines.\n  There is broad and consistent support to preserve the rights of \nparents.\n  An overwhelming number of States have recognized that a young girl's \nparents are the best source of guidance and knowledge when making \ndecisions regarding serious surgical or medical procedures, like \nabortion.\n  Forty-five States have adopted some form of parental notification or \nconsent law, proving their widespread support for protecting the rights \nof parents.\n  The people that care the most for the child should be involved in \nthese kinds of health care decisions and, if there is aftercare needed, \nbe fully informed in order to care for their young daughter.\n  Additionally, a huge majority support parental consent laws. In fact, \nmost polls show that consent is favored by almost 80 percent of \nAmericans.\n  These numbers do not lie; the American people agree that parents \ndeserve the right to be involved in their minor children's decisions.\n  The bill before us today makes it a Federal offense to knowingly \ntransport a minor across a State line, for the purposes of an abortion, \nin order to circumvent a State's parental consent or notification law.\n  It specifies that neither the minor transported nor her parent may be \nprosecuted for a violation of this act.\n  The purpose of the Child Custody Protection Act is to prevent people, \nincluding abusive boyfriends and predatory older males who may have \ncommitted rape, from pressuring young girls into having secret \nabortions without their parents consent.\n  The bill also requires an abortionist to give 24 hours' notice to a \nparent of the minor from another State before performing the abortion. \nSeveral exceptions are made, including exceptions related to parental \nabuse and the life and bodily health of the mother.\n  Should the abortionist fail to do so, they could face a fine or jail \ntime.\n  We are reminded how important parental notification is when we hear \nthe story of Marcia Carroll and her daughter, from Pennsylvania.\n  Ms. Carroll's daughter was, without her mother's knowledge, pressured \nby her boyfriend's stepfather to take a train and cross State lines and \nhave an abortion she didn't want to have and which she now regrets and \nseeks continual counseling for.\n  The abortion provider who performed an abortion on Mrs. Carroll's \ndaughter had a long history of abusing his patients.\n  Mrs. Carroll should have been given an opportunity to learn about the \nhistory of her child's doctor, who had been professionally disciplined \nmultiple times for having sex with a patient in his office, for \nperforming improper rectal and breast exams on two others, and for \nindiscriminately prescribing controlled dangerous substances.\n  The parents of America should be given the chance to make sure their \nchildren's doctors are not potential sexual abusers and controlled \nsubstance pushers, and this legislation would give them that chance.\n  As Mrs. Carroll testified, ``I felt safe when [the police] told me my \ndaughter had to be . . . of age in the State of Pennsylvania to have an \nabortion without parental consent . . . It never occurred to me that I \nwould need to check the laws of other States around me.\n  I thought as a resident of the State of Pennsylvania that she was \nprotected by Pennsylvania State laws. Boy, was I ever wrong.''\n  Dr. Bruce A. Lucero, an abortion provider, has supported this \nlegislation because ``patients who receive abortions at out-of-state \nclinics frequently do not return for follow-up care, which can lead to \ndangerous complications.''\n  Sure enough, the abortion provider who performed an abortion on Mrs. \nCarroll's daughter failed to schedule a followup visit with her to help \nensure there were no postabortion complications.\n  Speaking as the father of three young children, including a daughter, \nI understand how difficult the challenges of raising children can be.\n  In most schools across the country, our children cannot go on a field \ntrip, take part in school activities, or participate in sex education \nwithout a signed permission slip. An underage child cannot even receive \nmild medication, such as aspirin, unless the school nurse has a signed \nrelease form. Some states even require parental permission to use \nindoor tanning beds.\n  Nothing, however, prevents this same child from being taken across \nState\n\n[[Page S10618]]\n\nlines, in direct disobedience of State laws, for the purpose of \nundergoing a life-altering abortion.\n  In many cases, only a girl's parents know her prior medical and \npsychological history, including allergies to medications and \nanesthesia.\n  The harsh reality is our current law allows for parents to be left \nuninformed about their underage daughter's abortion, which can be \ndevastating to the physical and mental health of the child.\n  Parental notification serves another vital purpose--ensuring \nincreased protection against sexual exploitation of minors by adult \nmen.\n  All too often, our young girls are the victims of the predatory \npractices of men who are older, more experienced, and in a unique \nposition to influence the minor's decisions.\n  According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, ``almost two-thirds \nof adolescent mothers have partners older than 20 years of age.''\n  Rather than face a statutory rape charge, these men or their families \nuse the vulnerability of the young girl against her, exerting pressure \non the girl to agree to an abortion without talking to her parents.\n  In fact, in a survey of 1500 unmarried minors having abortions \nwithout their parents' knowledge, 89 percent said that a boyfriend was \ninvolved in the decision.\n  The number goes even higher the younger the age of the minor.\n  Allowing secret abortions do nothing to expose these men and there \nheinous conduct.\n  In the unfortunate instance of abuse or where there is rape or incest \ninvolved within a family, minors may be afraid to go to one of the \nparents. In response, judicial bypass laws have been written across the \ncountry to protect the minor.\n  This legislation is a commonsense solution to defeat the legal \nloophole that currently results in parents being denied the right to \nknow about the health decisions of their minor daughters--a fact which \nthe Supreme Court upheld in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which states, \nthat it is the State's right to declare that an abortion should not be \nperformed on a minor unless a parent is consulted.\n  This is not an argument on the merits of abortion; rather, this is a \ndebate about preserving the fundamental right of parents to have \nknowledge about the health decisions of their minor daughters.\n  Parental permission is so important because parents are the most \nintimately involved people in their children's lives.\n  We cannot allow another young girl's life to be irreparably damaged \nbecause of a legal loophole that keeps parents from being involved in \none of the most major decisions their daughter may make in her life.\n  It is time for Congress to step up and commit to protecting our \ndaughters by assuring that a parent's right to be involved is \nprotected.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am a proud cosponsor of S. 403, the \nChild Custody Protection Act. This bill has strong bipartisan support \nas illustrated by its vote of 65 to 34 that occurred in July. \nUnfortunately, due to political maneuvers by its opponents, the \nenactment of this critical legislation is being blocked.\n  This is one of the most important pieces of legislation to be \nconsidered during the 109th Congress. Why is this legislation so \nimportant? Because despite the fact that 23 States require a minor to \nreceive parental consent prior to obtaining an abortion, these \nimportant laws are being violated. Today, minors, with the assistance \nof adults who are not their parents, are being transported across State \nlines to receive abortions without obtaining parental consent. We must \nend this circumvention of State laws and, more importantly, the \nconsequences such actions have on life.\n  S. 403 would make it a Federal offense to help a minor cross lines \nfor the purpose of obtaining an abortion, unless it is needed to save \nthe life of the minor. Its enactment is critical, and we cannot allow \nits opponents to continue to stall needlessly its progress.\n  Earlier this month, I joined with 40 of my colleagues in urging the \nmajority leader to take action to enable this legislation to continue \nthrough the legislative process. The leader has now taken such action. \nOn Wednesday, a cloture motion was filed to break the opponents logjam, \nand I applaud and support this action. We must do all that we can to \nmove this critical legislation to the President's desk.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n5441, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     5441) ``making appropriations for the Department of Homeland \n     Security for the fiscal year ending September 30th, 2007, and \n     for other purposes'', having met, have agreed that the House \n     recede from its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate, \n     and agree to the same with an amendment, and the\n\n[[Page S10619]]\n\n     Senate agree to the same, signed by a majority of the \n     conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of September 28, 2006.)\n\n\n                              section 550\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with my \ngood friends, Senator Pryor, Senator Domenici, and Senator Warner. To \nmy colleagues, it is my understanding that a question as to the intent \nof the chemical facility security provision has arisen. Senator Pryor, \nin your view, what is the meaning of section 550 with respect to its \neffect on State laws or rules?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Senator from Ohio for raising this important \nquestion. Section 550 does not contain any language regarding its \npreemptive effect. I know there have been some in the other House who \nbelieve that this silence means the legislation would have no effect on \nState or local attempts to regulate chemical security--in other words, \nthat it gives them a green light to go farther. I want to state clearly \nmy belief to the contrary. As we all know, under well-established \nSupreme Court precedent, a Federal law that is silent in this way can \nstill occupy the field and impliedly preempt any State legislation on \nthe same topic. Historically, Congress has done so in the security \narea, whether it be nuclear security or aviation security.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I thank Senator Pryor for his statement because I \nagree with it. I know my good friend from Virginia, Senator Warner, \nalso has views on this. Senator Warner, in your view, what is the \nmeaning of section 550 with respect to its effect on State laws or \nrules.\n  Mr. WARNER. I also thank the Senator from Ohio for raising this \nimportant question. I concur with the assessment of my good friend from \nArkansas regarding the preemptive effect of this chemical facility \nprovision. As the Senator noted, there is strong Supreme Court \nprecedent regarding the implied preemption of State laws, especially as \nit relates to homeland security, homeland defense, and national \nsecurity. There are several examples of statutes that remain silent \nwith regard to the effect on State laws and it has been my belief \nthroughout the entire debate on chemical security legislation that this \nprecedent should hold true if we did not explicitly speak to the issue \nto State preemption.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I thank Senator Warner for his statement. I strongly \nagree with the assessment that Congress and the Federal Government have \nthe duty to provide for the security of our States and our people. \nFurther, the importance of a single, integrated set of comprehensive \nnational standards is vital to the security of this sector. I see my \ngood friend from New Mexico here as well. I ask the Senator from New \nMexico if he has further views on the meaning of section 550 with \nrespect to its effect on State laws or rules.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator from Ohio for this important \ndiscussion. I also concur with the assessment of my colleagues, Senator \nPryor and Senator Warner. This issue was discussed at length before the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. The effect of \nsilence on the chemical security language in question is clear. Federal \nlaw that is silent in this way can still occupy the field and impliedly \npreempt any State legislation on the same topic. Further, the \nprecedence for Federal preemption in regulatory matters dealing with \nsecurity is clear. In the interest of national security, the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission was created to oversee the nuclear facilities. \nGiven the importance of this critical infrastructure and the clear \nnational security concerns, the Federal Government has exclusive \nregulatory authority. I concur with my colleagues who have noted that \nin matters of national security the Federal Government should perform \nits constitutional duty to defend the homeland.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I thank my good friend from New Mexico for his \ncomments, and I strongly agree with his assessment. It is the Federal \nGovernment's preeminent role when it comes to matters of national \nsecurity to set a uniform set of rules with which the regulated \ncommunity must comply. I feel strongly that this provision sets that \nuniform set of rules and in so doing, impliedly preempts further \nregulation by State rules or laws.\n\n\n                WARNING, ALERT, AND RESPONSE NETWORK ACT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to ask my colleague from Alaska \nabout the Warning, Alert, and Response Network Act, or WARN Act, that \nis part of the SAFE Port Act that is before the Senate. The WARN Act \nwill authorize a wireless alert capability to provide citizens with \nemergency alerts on their wireless devices. This is an important \nenhancement to the emergency alert system that FEMA currently operates. \nI would note that the language in the WARN Act does not alter FEMA's \nrole in the emergency alert system. It is my understanding that this \nlanguage directing the FCC to develop the wireless capabilities will \nnot interfere with the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee considering and reporting legislation next year to further \nclarify FEMA's role with respect to the emergency alert system and new \ntechnologies. Is that correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator's understanding is correct. The \nParliamentarian's office has indicated to my staff that the wireless \nalert capability language in the act does not preclude the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee from considering \nlegislation next year to address FEMA's role with respect to the \nemergency alert system, and I commit to working with you to develop a \nbill that will set forth FEMA's role with respect to new emergency \nalert capabilities.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Senator. I look forward to your support in \naddressing FEMA's role in the emergency alert system in legislation \nnext year.\n\n\n                  WESTERN HEMISPHERE TRAVEL INITIATIVE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today for the purpose of engaging in \na colloquy with my colleagues from the Senate Homeland Security \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Senator Stevens, Subcommittee Chairman \nGregg and Subcommittee Ranking Member Byrd. We would like to discuss \nthe intent of section 546 of the fiscal year 2007 Department of \nHomeland Security Appropriations conference report regarding the \nWestern Hemisphere Travel Initiative, WHTI.\n  In 2004, Congress passed and the President signed into law the \nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, which included a \nprovision creating WHTI as a means of better securing our borders. The \nprovisions require that all individuals, including U.S. citizens, \npresent a passport or its equivalent in order to verify identity and \ncitizenship when they enter the United States from neighboring \ncountries, including Canada or Mexico. As currently set out by the \nadministration, the law would take effect on January 1, 2007, for \nairports and seaports and on January 1, 2008, for land crossings.\n  As those deadlines loom ever closer, my colleagues and I have grown \nmore and more concerned that the plan has been poorly planned and there \nis a considerable lack of adequate coordination not only among the \nDepartments of Homeland Security and State, which are charged with \nimplementing the initiative but also with the governments of Canada and \nMexico. I fear that we face a train wreck on the horizon if the plan \nsteams along as is.\n  The senior senator from Alaska most definitely recognizes how \nimproper implementation of WHTI could impede the flow of people and \ngoods across our borders. The residents of his home State especially \nwould face unique challenges under WHTI because all Alaskans have to \ncross into Canada before entering the continental United States by \nland.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Vermont is correct. The Department of \nHomeland Security and the State Department are now in the process of \ndeveloping the rules needed to implement this initiative. The State \nDepartment is proposing an alternate form of documentation to be \naccepted for land border crossings known as a passcard. The passcard \nwould be slightly less expensive than a passport but would still \nrequire the same adjudication and background check as a passport and \ncould only be used for land travel between our country, Canada and \nMexico.\n  Many of my constituents travel to Canada every day. I believe each \nSenator from Idaho, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire,\n\n[[Page S10620]]\n\nNew York, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Washington will \nagree it is imperative that the travel requirements between Canada and \nthe United States be implemented in a manner that does not adversely \naffect Americans. To date, the construction and price of the passcards \nhave not been established. Passcards are essential to ensure the flow \nof travel and business activities between the United States and other \ncountries is not hindered.\n  I am also concerned with the looming date of implementation for WHTI. \nThe administration's current plan is to implement the air and sea \nportion of the initiative by January 2007, this coming January. This \nmeans that in just 3 months all U.S. citizens traveling by air and sea \nfrom Canada and Mexico or the Caribbean will need a passport to enter \nthis country.\n  The intent of language included in the Homeland bill is in no way \nmeant to indefinitely delay the implementation of this initiative. \nSecuring our borders is important, and I support these efforts. I want \nto make sure the State Department is prepared to adjudicate the large \nnumber of requests for passports and passcards this initiative will \nproduce.\n  Our language also creates a single implementation date for land and \nsea crossings. Families often take a cruise to Alaska, and continue \ntheir vacations in Canada. In order to avoid confusion to these \ntravelers, we must have one date in which they are expected to have new \ndocumentation, rather than the current plan to implement sea this \nJanuary and land in January 2008. Further, they should be able to use \nthe passcard for both land and sea crossings, rather than requiring a \npassport for the sea portion of a vacation.\n  I believe DHS and the State Department are operating under an \nunrealistic timeframe. We must ensure they have enough time to properly \ntest and implement this system, which includes biometrics and new \nborder security equipment. We must also clearly set out guidelines we \nexpect to be met before this initiative can be implemented. This is \nwhat we hope to achieve with the language we included in the Homeland \nbill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Like Alaskans, Vermonters have strong economic ties to \nCanada and depend on the efficient movement of products across \ninternational borders. Many Vermont families, including mine, \nfrequently travel to Canada to visit family members living there or to \nspend a weekend in the beautiful cities of Montreal or Quebec City. \nSimilarly, our Canadian friends enjoy many Vermont treasures, including \nour ski resorts and our own ``great lake,'' Lake Champlain. In 2003, \nmore than 2 million Canadians visited Vermont, spending $188 million \nwhile here.\n  Additionally, Vermont has a number of small towns along the border \nthat depend on access to neighboring Canadian towns. In some cases, \nthese towns share emergency assistance, grocery stores, and other basic \nservices. Residents sometimes cross the border on foot several times a \nday just to conduct routine business. Other northern border States \nenjoy similar trade and tourism benefits with Canada and could face \nsignificant downturns in their economies if this law is not implemented \nproperly.\n  At a cost of about $100, passports are an expensive hardship for \nmany, especially families would not otherwise travel abroad. The \nproposed PASS Card is a less costly alternative but also raises a \nnumber of new concerns, including issues of privacy and effectiveness. \nOn top of that, DHS and State are still arguing over what technology to \nembed in the card. I find it highly unlikely that the State Department \nwill be able to process the flood of requests for passports and PASS \ncards that will come from this initiative by the deadline when key \ndecisions have still not been made.\n  Mr. STEVENS. These are just some of the issues which must be \nconsidered before implementing this plan. In addition, the lack of \npublic outreach to inform citizens of the new requirements concerns me.\n  I see the potential for a disaster at our borders if regulations are \nhastily imposed. There is just too much at stake to implement a travel \nsystem that has not been properly tested, and this is why Senators \nLeahy, Gregg, Byrd, I worked together with House Homeland Security \nAppropriations Subcommittee Chairman Rogers to craft bipartisan \nlanguage to extend the WHTI implementation date. Our language simply \ngives the State Department and DHS more time to make sure this is done \nright.\n  Mr. GREGG. I believe the proper implementation of WHTI is imperative. \nI wish to emphasize that the Departments of Homeland Security and State \ncan move forward with the full implementation of WHTI before June I, \n2009--but to do so they must comply with all legislated criteria. These \nlegislated criteria are designed to ensure that the PASS Card protects \nthe privacy of our citizens, that readers have been installed at all \nports of entry, that all employees have been properly trained--in \nshort, that the system works, before it is used by millions of \ncitizens. And I emphasize that implementation, meaning putting the \nsystem into operation can occur at any time but no later than June 1, \n2009, if the conditions, which are designed for proper operations, are \nmet.\n  Mr. BYRD. I, for one, will definitely be interested to see how the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the Department of State are \nprogressing on WHTI implementation. And we will be able to do so \nbecause we mandate that the Departments provide quarterly briefings on \nthe progress being made on WHTI implementation and that the first \nbriefing should be no later than December 1, 2006.\n  Mr. LEAHY. My colleagues are both correct. While hasty implementation \ncould result in avoidable problems for all those who will be affected \nby this Initiative, we also want to make sure that it is done on a \nreasonable timetable. Our amendment requires a modest implementation \ndelay to June 1, 2009, and also requires that certain technological \ngoals are met in the design of the PASS Card to ensure that the \nstrictest standards are in place to protect personal information. \nThough it has been two years since the Intelligence Act requirement \nbecame law, the agencies have made little progress to implement WHTI. \nThis provision (Sec. 546) provides additional guidance to the agencies \nto insure smooth implementation.\n  Our language also requires the Departments of Homeland Security and \nState to certify prior to implementation that a cost for the PASS Card \nhas been agreed upon, that all border authorities are familiar with the \ntechnology, and that the technology has been shared with the Canadian \nand Mexican authorities. These are just a few of the steps we have \ntaken in this amendment to ensure that the transition to an increased \nsecurity environment is done without creating unnecessary obstacles.\n  And the Senate and House Appropriations Committees will most \ncertainly share the Homeland Security Department and the State \nDepartment report to us on how they are progressing in meeting the \nprogram criteria and moving toward implementation.\n  I thank my colleagues for all their hard work on reaching an \nagreement on this language. With it, we greatly increase our chances \nfor the successful implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel \nInitiative.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, one of the most important parts of \nthis Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill is a section \nthat should not be in it at all. It is a perfect example of how the \nmajority has decided to legislate: make back room deals and pass phony \nprotections instead of real ones.\n  I am speaking about the section that purports to adopt chemical \nsecurity protections for our country.\n  To illustrate what chemical security means, and why it is so \nimportant, let me tell you what happened on Tuesday in Elizabeth, NJ. A \nworker at a trucking company accidentally ruptured a small pressurized \ngas tank and released a cloud of sulfur dioxide into the air. Workers \nat nearby storage and shipping facilities became ill. Truck drivers in \nthe area abandoned their vehicles as their lungs burned and they \ncouldn't breathe. People on the side of the road were vomiting. Fifty-\neight people--including a first responder--were taken to the hospital. \nThat was a small accident. Imagine if a terrorist blew up a large \nchemical facility.\n  To understand the impact, all you have to do is drive 9 miles down \nthe\n\n[[Page S10621]]\n\nroad from Elizabeth to Kearny, NJ, home to the Nation's most dangerous \nchemical plant. Kearny is a blue-collar, working-class town. Forty-\nthousand residents--men, women and children--make Kearney home. An act \nof terror at the Kuehne chemical facility could put Kearny--and the \ntwelve million Americans who live within fourteen miles of the plant at \nrisk. No wonder that facilities storing large amounts of chemicals have \nbeen called ``pre-positioned weapons of mass destruction'' by homeland \nsecurity experts.\n  One would think that the majority and the administration would do all \nit can to stop an attack in Kearny--or at any of America's nearly \n15,000 chemical facilities. Republican leaders have put together a \ncounterfeit bill that they are trying to pawn off as ``chemical \nsecurity,'' but we are not buying it, and neither should the American \npeople.\n  Recognizing that this was a problem even before 9/11, I introduced \nthe Nation's first chemical plant security bill in 1999. And earlier \nthis year, Senator Obama and I introduced a new comprehensive chemical \nsecurity bill that seeks to protect the American people--not the \nchemical industry. The Republican leadership has brushed aside our \nstrong bill, and other legislation that has come out of the Homeland \nSecurity committees in the Senate and the House.\n  Instead, the Republican leaders borrowed a page from the ``Dick \nCheney Energy Task Force'' playbook: lock the windows, bolt the doors \nand meet with industry lobbyists. And what did the Republicans and \nchemical industry lobbyists come up with? A fraudulent bill. The \nchemical industry bill put forward by the Republicans fails to require \nthe safest practices at the highest-risk facilities. It is a bill that \nfails to secure the nearly 15,000 facilities that store dangerous \nchemicals. A bill that fails to protect drinking and waste water \nfacilities. And a bill that fails to make clear that states can adopt \nstronger chemical security laws than the federal government.\n  So will this chemical security bill authored by the chemical \nindustry, the majority, and the administration make the Nation safer? \nNo. The public should not be fooled. Because this fake chemical \nsecurity bill has been attached to the Homeland Security appropriations \nbill, most Senators will vote for it. But make no mistake, it is not \nwhat we want or need.\n  We need a bill that requires all chemical plant owners to improve the \nsecurity of their sites, and when possible, replace toxic chemicals \nwith safer ones. We need a bill that makes perfectly clear that states \ncan adopt stronger laws than the toothless version the majority are \ndoing here. We don't need the majority, the White House, and the \nchemical industry deciding the fate of towns like Kearny or Elizabeth \nbehind closed doors.\n  All of this is more reason we need a new direction in Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak to \nthe Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2007.\n  Since 9/11, we have made significant progress in bolstering the \ndefense of our Nation against terrorism. Today, Americans are safer \nthan they were just 5 years ago. However, as we learned from the \nrecently released National Security Estimate, the threat of terrorism \ncontinues.\n  As a border State and a major thoroughfare for trade, Washington \nState faces incredible security challenges. Along our northern border, \nofficial checkpoints are separated by miles of vast, rural and rugged \nterrain\n  The Ports of Seattle and Tacoma make up the Nation's third largest \ncontainer center. Puget Sound is home to America's largest ferry \nsystem, transporting more than 26 million passengers and 11 million \nvehicles annually throughout the area.\n  The Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2007 provides vital \nresources to build on the progress we have made to make our Nation more \nsecure and citizens safer.\n  It contains specific provisions that I am very proud to have worked \non--provisions that I believe make a strong bill even stronger.\n  I will speak about those provisions in just a moment, but first, I \nwant to take a moment to acknowledge the steadfast leadership and \nstalwart dedication of the bill's managers, Senator Gregg and Senator \nByrd.\n  This bill recognizes that as a Nation, we still need to make serious \ninvestments in our National security.\n  That is why we're adding significant resources--more than $21 \nbillion--to better secure our borders.\n  This includes $2.2 billion to add 1,500 agents to monitor and \napprehend criminals--criminal or people crossing the border--and $1.4 \nbillion for detention facilities, including nearly 7,000 additional \ndetention beds to end our failed ``catch and release'' policy.\n  Using cutting edge technology is critical to securing our 4,000-mile-\nlong northern border. With vast, rural and rugged terrain, physical \nbarriers provide limited benefits along much of the northern border.\n  The right tools can provide critical intelligence about areas that \nhave previously gone unsecured for so long.\n  This legislation includes a provision, which I offered with Senator \nBaucus, directing the Department of Homeland Security to work with the \nFederal Aviation Administration to test the use of unmanned aerial \nvehicles on the northern border.\n  UAVs with extended range can conduct prolonged surveillance sweeps \nover remote border areas, relaying information to border agents on the \nground.\n  This will modernize our patrol capabilities and enable us to reach \nhundreds of miles of previously unguarded border.\n  It is time to get serious, smart and practical by using the best \nproven resources out there.\n  I have also sponsored a provision included in this legislation \ndirecting the Department of Homeland Security and State Department to \nwork with Canadian officials and State and local first responders to \nidentify border security challenges--including interoperable \ncommunications--in preparation for the 2010 Olympics.\n  Lastly, I was proud to join Senator Feinstein to secure a provision \ncriminalizing the construction of smuggling tunnels under our borders \nand putting into law stiff penalties for anyone building or using such \ntunnels.\n  In July 2005, we discovered a smuggling tunnel between Canada and \nWashington State. It had been used to traffic drugs, but it's all too \nclear that tunnels could just as easily be exploited by terrorists to \nenter undetected into our country.\n  The legislation before us also provides more than $4.3 billion to \nimprove the security of our ports and the global supply chain.\n  This includes: More than $2 billion to the Coast Guard; $210 million \nin port security grants; $420 million for radiation and gamma ray \ninspection equipment for scanning cargo containers; and nearly $200 \nmillion to screen cargo containers at foreign ports and collaborate \nwith private entities to enhance supply chain security.\n  Focusing on security where cargo is loaded abroad, at the point of \norigin, is vital to achieving security for our ports here at home.\n  I am proud to have cosponsored a provision with Senators Coleman and \nSchumer, included in this legislation, which directs the Department of \nHomeland Security to test a new integrated container inspection system \nat three foreign ports.\n  This technology has already shown promise at the Port of Hong Kong.\n  And I believe that testing this system is the next important step to \nmove us toward 100 percent screening of containers.\n  From our borders to our ports, this legislation also represents a \nsignificant investment in the security of our transportation systems.\n  In light of the foiled terrorist operation in the U.K. on August 10, \nI remain especially concerned about aviation security.\n  As we all now know, a network of terrorist cells planned to down as \nmany as 10 U.S. airliners by smuggling liquid explosives onto flights.\n  The foiled plot provides a stark reminder of the serious gaps which \ncontinue to impede our efforts to secure the commercial airline \nindustry.\n  In 1994, we learned the dangers of our inability to screen passengers \nfor liquid chemicals that could be combined to create an improvised \nexplosive device, when Ramzi Yousef successfully bombed Philippines \nAirline flight 434. In 1995 they uncovered the infamous ``Bojinka'' \nplot in Manila.\n\n[[Page S10622]]\n\n  Yet more than 10 years later, we still have not developed a \ntechnology that can be deployed in airports to screen passengers for \nthese substances.\n  To fix this, we need to make a strong investment in research and \ndevelopment.\n  The Senate version of this legislation--which passed before the \nAugust U.K. terrorist threat--had only $5 million slated for research \nand development of explosive countermeasures, under the Science and \nTechnology directorate at the Department of Homeland Security.\n  After the Senate returned from August recess, I wrote to Chairman \nGregg requesting that he work in conference to increase funding for \nexplosive detection research under the Science and Technology \ndirectorate.\n  The conference report before us today includes nearly $87 million in \nexplosives research funding and I want to thank Senator Gregg for \nworking in conference to accommodate this request.\n  The explosives detection problem is both urgent and technically \nchallenging. Passenger screening technology must be efficient, \nreliable, and effective.\n  The latest threats make it clear that we need to accelerate our work \nto find innovative solutions to evolving challenges.\n  We must be smart and tough in our fight against global terrorism. Our \nfirst priority must be ensuring that Americans are safe.\n  We have come a long way since 9/11. We have worked hard and made \nprogress and we are safer today.\n  But it is clear: We need to do more to stop terrorists and their \nschemes.\n  We can't let down our guard--at our borders, at our ports, on our \npassenger planes.\n  The legislation before us today builds on progress we have made and \ndelivers strong and serious investments so we can do even more.\n  Americans deserve to know that we are doing everything we can to \nsecure our country and keep them safe.\n  Again, I want to thank the managers of this bill for their efforts. I \nlook forward to working with them as we continue fighting to secure our \nNation.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to voice my strong support for \nefforts to secure our Nation's borders, which remain porous. We must \nimmediately address this threat to our national security and make \ncertain that we allow local officials greater involvement as they work \nwith the Secretary of Homeland Security regarding the location of \nborder fencing.\n  I have consistently supported and voted in favor of border security \nefforts--such as the installation of reinforced fencing in strategic \nareas where high trafficking of narcotics, unlawful border crossings, \nand other criminal activity exists. I have also supported installing \nphysical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors where \nnecessary.\n  Throughout our debate on comprehensive immigration reform, I have \nstressed the need to secure our Nation's borders--not only our \nsouthwest border with Mexico, but also our northern border with Canada, \nour maritime borders, coastlines and ports of entry. We must secure our \nborders first, but we must also work toward a comprehensive solution \nthat addresses the needs of commerce and our economy.\n  The Secure Fence Act of 2006 is needed, and serves as our downpayment \nwith the American people on what we must do to address border \nsecurity--so that we can then move forward to address comprehensive \nimmigration reform.\n  To this date, we have hired, trained, deployed 11,300 Border Patrol \nagents, ended catch and release, accelerated the deportation process, \nand expanded the number of beds in detention centers to almost 23,000.\n  We have also provided an additional $1.9 billion in immediate funding \nfor border security to cover the first 1,000 of 6,000 new Border Patrol \nagents who will be deployed in the next 2 years. These funds will \nassist with the temporary deployment of up to 6,000 National Guard \ntroops aiding the Border Patrol with surveillance and logistics.\n  I will continue to champion border security measures and strongly \nsupport the efforts of my colleagues to strengthen our southwest \nborder--protecting our citizens from threats of terrorism, narcotic \ntrafficking, and other unlawful entries. However, I am concerned about \nCongress making decisions about the location of the border fencing \nwithout the participation of State and local law enforcement \nofficials working with the Secretary of Homeland Security. These \nlocations should not be dictated by Congress.\n\n  Our border States have borne a heavy financial burden from illegal \nimmigration and their local officials are on the front lines. Their \nknowledge and experience should not be ignored. Texas shares \napproximately one-half of the land border between the United States of \nAmerica and the Republic of Mexico. As such, State and local officials \nin California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas should not be excluded \nfrom decisions about how to best protect our borders with their varying \ntopography, population, and geography.\n  Local officials in my home State of Texas--particularly in the areas \nof El Paso, Del Rio to Eagle Pass, and Laredo to Brownville--cited in \nthe underlying bill, will not have an opportunity to participate in \ndecisions regarding the exact location of fencing and other physical \ninfrastructure near their communities. Because the time constraints \nimposed by the pending adjournment will not permit a resolution of this \nvery important issue at this time, I asked for, and received, a \ncommitment from our Senate majority leader and the Speaker of the House \nof Representatives promising to address these concerns.\n  The letter addressed to the chairs of the Senate and House Committees \non the Judiciary and Homeland Security states that prior to adjournment \nof the 109th Congress, we will act on this issue.\n  Ours is a nation of laws and we must be a nation of secure borders. I \nstand ready to work with my colleagues to enact meaningful legislation \nin this session of Congress that addresses border security first and \nthat ensures our local communities will be involved in the decisions \nthat have such a dramatic impact on the lives of their constituents. I \nappreciate the commitments of our Senate leader and the Speaker and \nlook forward to working with them on this important issue.\n  In addition, I have been given a separate letter on this subject from \nLeader Frist, and I ask unanimous consent that both of these letters be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                Office of the Majority Leader,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 29, 2006.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: I am enclosing a copy of a letter \n     signed today by myself and Speaker Hastert in which we \n     outline a number of important additional border security \n     measures that we plan to take prior to adjournment.\n       In this letter, the Speaker and I have pledged to respond \n     to the concerns raised regarding the lack of opportunity for \n     local officials, such as those in the areas of El Paso, Del \n     Rio through Eagle Pass, and Laredo to Brownsville, to \n     participate in decisions related to location of border \n     fencing.\n       Thank you for taking the time to bring this important issue \n     to my attention and to that of our colleagues.\n       I look forward to working with you upon our return to \n     complete this action.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 William H.

Peter King,\n     Chairman, House Homeland Security Committee, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. James Sensenbrenner,\n     Chairman, House Committee on the Judiciary, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     Chairman, Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs \n         Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairmen: Following passage of the Secure Fence Act of \n     2006, the following actions will be taken before adjournment \n     of the 109th Congress:\n       First we will work with the Department of Homeland Security \n     (DHS) to ensure they consult with representatives of U.S. \n     state and local governments, including Native American \n     tribes, regarding the exact placement of fencing and other \n     physical infrastructure along the southwest border of the \n     United States.\n       Second, legislation should require the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security to put fencing\n\n[[Page S10623]]\n\n     and physical barriers in areas of high illegal entry into the \n     United States, yet allow flexibility to use alternative \n     physical infrastructure and technology when fencing is \n     ineffective or impractical.\n       Third, the legislation should clarify the definition of \n     operational control of the border to ensure accountability \n     and a workable standard for the Department.\n       We have spoken to the Administration and know that they \n     fully support these proposals and we expect that they will \n     actively support our effort to make these changes before the \n     end of the year.\n           Sincerely,\n     J. Dennis Hastert,\n       Speaker, House of Representatives.\n     William H. Frist,\n       Majority Leader, U.S. Senate.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, for years, homeland security experts \nhave been warning that chemical facilities are one of our most glaring \nhomeland security vulnerabilities. Yet Congressional efforts to empower \nthe Department of Homeland Security to regulate such facilities have \nfoundered in the face of administration inaction and opposition from \nsome industry groups and their allies. That is why I am pleased that \nCongress has at last authorized DHS to begin regulating some of the \nmost risky chemical facilities.\n  Specifically, the Department of Homeland Security appropriations \nconference report directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to begin \nregulating high risk chemical facilities. It gives DHS 6 months to \ndevelop interim regulations for chemical site security and specifies \nthat the program should require chemical facilities to develop \nvulnerability assessments and site security plans. DHS would have to \nreview such documents and approve or disapprove the security plans \nbased on whether they address the vulnerabilities identified for that \nfacility and meet security performance standards designed by the \nDepartment. The Secretary would have authority to audit and inspect \nfacilities in the program and to seek civil penalties against those who \ndo not comply. The Secretary could also order the shutdown of a \nfacility that does not meet the standards until it comes into \ncompliance.\n  This is undoubtedly progress, and I hope DHS will fulfill its \nresponsibility to promptly and vigorously exercise this new authority \nto address an extremely dangerous homeland security weakness.\n  But while this provision is an improvement on the status quo, it \nfalls well short of what we need to fully address this threat. That is \nparticularly disappointing because both the House and Senate Homeland \nSecurity Committees have approved bipartisan, comprehensive chemical \nsecurity bills that could have and should have received floor debate \nand become the basis for final legislation this fall. I deeply regret \nthat we were not able to advance the bipartisan committee bills or to \nretain many of their provisions.\n  On the Senate side, Senator Collins and I introduced the Senate \nchemical security bill, S. 2145, after holding four hearings on \nchemical security this session and consulting with many interested \nparties. Our legislation was marked up in the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee in mid-June, and reported out on a 15 to \n0 vote. While that bill did not include everything I wished, it was a \nbalanced and comprehensive program for chemical security that was able \nto garner broad support on the Committee. I wish to address a few \nspecific issues that were part of S. 2145 but which have been lost or \ndistorted in this chemical security provision.\n  First, let me speak to the issue of inherently safer technology or \nIST. The bipartisan chemical security bill approved by the Senate \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee recognizes that \nsometimes the best security will come not from adding guards and gates \nbut from reexamining the way chemical operations are carried out in \norder to reduce the amount of hazardous substances on site, improve the \nway they are stored or processed, or find safer substitutes for the \nchemicals themselves. These changes limit the loss of life or other \ndamage in the event of an attack and therefore make a facility a less \ninviting target for terrorists to begin with. They also have the added \nbenefit of limiting the harm from an accidental release. S. 2145 \nclearly requires facilities to look at the risks and consequences \nrelated to the dangerous chemicals on site and address those specific \nvulnerabilities in their security plan. And it includes these process \nchanges among the menu of security measures that chemical facilities \nshould examine when designing their security plans.\n\n  The House chemical security bill, H.R. 5695, goes further and would \nrequire high risk chemical facilities to implement safer technologies \nunder certain conditions. That requirement is similar to an amendment I \noffered at markup which, had it been adopted, would have required the \nriskiest chemical facilities to consider such technologies and \nimplement them if feasible.\n  This is not a question of forcing industry to conduct its operations \noff a government-issued play book. Companies would analyze for \nthemselves whether there are less dangerous ways to conduct their \nbusiness and would not be required to implement any changes that were \nnot feasible or merely shifted risk elsewhere. But given the \nextraordinary risks involved, it is imperative that companies be \nrequired to at least take a long hard look at some of the commonsense \nsolutions that have been advocated or already adopted by others within \nthe industry.\n  Unfortunately, the chemical security provision included in the DHS \nappropriations conference report has no language to encourage safer \ntechnologies, and actually includes language aimed at preventing the \nSecretary from even urging a facility to consider such options.\n  Second, I regret that this chemical security provision includes \nflawed language on information protection and judicial review. Of \ncourse, none of us would want to release sensitive information about a \nchemical plant that would be useful to a terrorist. However, excessive \nsecrecy in a Government security program can actually make us less, not \nmore safe. This is because some degree of transparency is necessary to \nhelp us make Government programs more accountable and effective. Also, \nlocal communities and their elected officials deserve to know whether \nlocal facilities are being kept safe against a terrorist attack, and \nthe community's vigilance can help make us all safer.\n  I believe S. 2145 as introduced achieved the right combination of \nprotecting real security information, while allowing enough disclosure \nto create accountability. Unfortunately, those carefully drafted \nprovisions have been replaced, in this measure, by a mechanism that \nwill impose undue secrecy on information submitted and developed in \nrelation to this program and could deny the ability of Congress and \naffected communities to ensure that the program operates effectively. \nThis measure also puts cumbersome restrictions on the use of such \ninformation in court enforcement proceedings and includes an ill-\nconsidered provision that would limit court review of a chemical \nfacility's conduct.\n  Finally, I am extremely disappointed that this measure does not \ninclude the provision from S. 2145 guaranteeing States and localities \nthe right to enact stronger chemical security measures. S. 2145 \nexplicitly recognizes that Congress is not the only body that can and \nshould help ensure the safety and security of the Nation's chemical \nfacilities. States and localities have long regulated such facilities \nfor various safety and environmental concerns. Since 9/11, some States \nhave also moved to require security improvements at these facilities. \nThese State and local protections are critical companions to our effort \nat the Federal level and should not be displaced unless there is an \nabsolute conflict, such that it is impossible for a facility to comply \nwith both the Federal law and a State or local law or regulation on \nchemical security. S. 2145 also specifies that it does not disrupt \nState and local safety and environmental law regarding chemical \nfacilities, and it does not seek to dislodge or alter the operation of \nState common law with respect to such facilities.\n  Contrary to calls by industry, the chemical security language \nCongress is approving does not affirmatively preempt State and local \nchemical security rules and I do not believe it should or will have the \neffect of preempting such laws. Nevertheless, it is preferable that \nCongress speak clearly and decisively\n\n[[Page S10624]]\n\non such an important security matter, and it is unfortunate that the \nconference report does not retain the strong antipreemption language of \nour bipartisan Senate bill.\n  These are only a few of the issues that must be revisited, or visited \nanew, in a complete authorization bill. This chemical security \nprovision is clearly a stopgap measure, one which will expire as soon \nas we can replace it with a permanent authorization or, at the latest, \nthree years after enactment. So while we have given DHS the authority \nimmediately to begin regulating chemical facilities, we must not let up \nin our efforts to reach agreement on a permanent and comprehensive \nchemical security bill as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the fiscal year 2007 \nDepartment of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, which will direct \nnearly $35 billion toward strengthening the homeland security of this \ngreat Nation. The measure, though imperfect, addresses one of my top \npriorities, particularly the recreation of our ineffectual Federal \nemergency management system into an organization capable of preparing \nfor and effectively responding to disasters, whether caused by nature \nor terrorists.\n  This month, we observed the fifth anniversary of September 11--a day \nthat changed the course of history for this Nation. We are all united \nin our desire to defeat the threat of global terrorism and to prevent \nany more families from having to experience the unfathomable sense of \nloss that the survivors of 9/11 have experienced.\n  I believe we have made real progress in strengthening our homeland \nsecurity since 9/11, and I am privileged to have had a role in bringing \nabout that progress. I must add, however, that we are still a ways off \nfrom assuring the American people they are as safe as they should be. \nWe continue to work toward that goal, and each day we get a little bit \ncloser.\n  This appropriations bill moves us in the right direction in large \npart because of its provisions to refashion the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency in the wake of its disastrous preparations for and \nresponse to Hurricane Katrina, the worst natural disaster in our \ncountry's history which took the lives of over 1,500 citizens and \npermanently altered the lives of millions more.\n  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Susan \nCollins and I conducted an 8-month-long investigation into the \ngovernment's disgraceful response to Hurricane Katrina. We found \nnegligence, lack of resources, lack of capability, and lack of \nleadership at all levels of government, which, as we know too well, \nresulted in the failure to relieve the massive suffering that occurred \nalong the gulf coast.\n  To guarantee more effective planning and a more successful response \nin the future, Chairman Collins and I made a number of recommendations \nin our final report, entitled ``A Nation Still Unprepared.'' The most \nprominent of these recommendations, a FEMA redesign, is in this \nlegislation before us today. With these changes, which add strength and \ncommonsense restructuring, the Federal Government will be better \nprepared to protect its citizens in times of disaster.\n  Let me briefly describe the most important provisions. First, we \nelevate FEMA to a special, independent status within the Department of \nHomeland Security much like what the Coast Guard and Secret Service now \nhave--so that reorganizations could only occur by congressional action. \nThe FEMA Administrator will be the President's principal adviser in an \nemergency and the administrator and top regional officials will have to \nhave appropriate experience and qualifications for the job.\n  This legislation also restores unity to FEMA's preparedness and \nresponse functions. In other words, there will be one organization--\nFEMA--responsible for both responding to a disaster and planning and \ntraining for that response.\n  To strengthen the ties between Federal and local officials, we will \nelevate FEMA's regional offices, taking the focus away from Washington \nand putting it where the real work of preparedness is performed: on the \nfront lines, in the States, towns, and cities most affected by a \ndisaster. The goal is to familiarize Federal officials with regional \nand local threats, vulnerabilities, and capabilities and ensure that \nthey are familiar with each of them and their State and local \ncounterparts before disaster strikes.\n  The legislation also creates a new Office for Emergency \nCommunications dedicated to achieving the operability and \ninteroperability of emergency communications among first responders \nthat is fundamental to any disaster response.\n  These mission changes will begin to be put into place by authorizing \na 10 percent increase in FEMA's operations budget in each of the next 3 \nyears--above the much-needed increase in FEMA's fiscal year 2007 \nappropriations that is included in this bill. Of course, more is \nneeded, but this legislation makes a start. In addition, we authorize \nadditional funds for States to carry out their disaster preparedness \nresponsibilities, including doubling funding for critical emergency \nmanagement performance grants.\n  This bill also provides additional assistance to people and \ncommunities struck by disaster. It will, for example, allow FEMA more \nflexibility in the type of housing it can provide disaster victims to \nfind more cost-effective alternatives to the widely criticized FEMA \ntrailers. It establishes measures to assist with family reunification. \nAnd it requires FEMA to better address the needs of those with \ndisabilities in disaster preparedness training and an actual disaster.\n  As is inevitably the case, there are things missing from this bill \nthat would have made it better--provisions that were included in the \nbill that Senator Collins and I introduced and that was passed out of \nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee but that were \nlost in conference. These include funding for a dedicated grant program \nto support and promote communications interoperability among first \nresponders and additional assistance for individuals and communities \nthat fall victim to catastrophic disasters.\n  This appropriations bill advances the safety of all Americans in \nother important ways. For the first time ever, the Department of \nHomeland Security would have the authority to regulate high risk \nchemical facilities. I am disappointed; however, that the bill does not \npreserve more of the comprehensive and bipartisan legislation passed \nout of both House and Senate homeland security committees. The Senate \nbill, for example, guaranteed the rights of states to enact stronger \nchemical security provisions. And both bills encouraged the use of \nsafer chemicals and methods to lessen the vulnerability of chemical \nfacilities in the first place. These provisions are vital because, as \nwe most recently observed with the breech of security here at our own \nheavily guarded Capitol complex, guards and gates alone are always \nsubject to failure. The American people will not be safe from attacks \non these facilities until we provide comprehensive security.\n  September 11 showed us the flaws in our ability to detect and avert \nterrorist attacks. Hurricane Katrina showed we still haven't grasped \nmany of the lessons of 9/11 and so we remain unprepared. This spending \nbill moves us toward better preparedness and response to the \ncatastrophes we know await our future.\n  But, unfortunately, there is no cheap way to be better prepared. It \ntakes money--more money than this budget offers. Too few dollars have \nbeen set aside to secure our ports, our transit systems, our railways. \nOur first responders--who need equipment, training, interoperable \ncommunications--continue to be critically under funded. The cuts this \nbill makes in State homeland security funding are far less deep than \nthose proposed by the President in his budget this year, but they are \ncuts nonetheless, and they continue what has been a disturbing downward \ntrend over the last few years. Since 2004, for example, the state \nhomeland security grant program--which provides the central \npreparedness assistance to states throughout the country--has been \nslashed by 69 percent.\n  Additional resources are needed, and I will continue to advocate for \nthem as a wise investment in the greater protection it will provide the \nAmerican people. But overall, I think this bill is a significant step \ntoward ensuring that\n\n[[Page S10625]]\n\nwe have a strong, capable agency to lead the country's response to \nfuture disasters, whether natural disasters or terrorist attacks--and \nthat is primarily why I will vote for its passage and urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Lastly, I thank all of the staff on the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, whose many months of work investigating \nthe Katrina response and overseeing the recovery process, formulating \nrecommendations, fashioning those recommendations into legislation, and \nguiding that legislation through the Congress has resulted in the \nimportant changes to our nation's emergency preparedness and response \ncapabilities included in this appropriations bill. The minority staff \nmembers are: Joyce Rechtschaffen, Laurie Rubenstein, Robert Muse, \nMichael Alexander, Eric Andersen, David Berick, Dan Berkovitz, Stacey \nBosshardt, Janet Burrell, Scott Campbell, William Corboy, Troy Cribb, \nHeather Fine, Boris Fishman, Susan Fleming, Jeffrey Greene, Elyse \nGreenwald, Beth Grossman, R.

Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleagues for \ntheir hard work on the fiscal year 2007 Department of Homeland Security \nappropriations bill. I also want to congratulate my friend from New \nHampshire, Chairman Gregg, for his leadership in putting together a \npackage of funding that will secure our country's ports and borders and \nstrengthen immigration and customs enforcement. During this session of \nthe 109th Congress, we have spent a good deal of time considering \nmeasures that would strengthen our borders and reform our immigration \nsystem. I believe this spending bill is a testament to the \nadministration and the Senate's commitment to these issues.\n  In this bill, the conference agreed to provide a total of $34.8 \nbillion to secure our Nation's borders and infrastructure. This marks \nan overall increase of $2.3 billion over the fiscal year 2006 enacted \nlevel, including supplemental funding, and includes a $1.8 billion \nemergency spending provision for border security.\n  This bill specifically sets aside over $8 billion for Customs and \nBorder Protection. I represent a State that is directly impacted by its \nsouthern border with Mexico, and I laud the provisions that provide \nfunding for 1,500 new Border Patrol agents. My home State of New Mexico \nis also home to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, FLETC, and \nthe addition of extra Border Patrol agents prompted the conference to \nprovide $275.25 million for new facilities, salaries, and additional \ninstructors.\n  The bill also provides a $602.2 million for the U.S. Customs and \nBorder Patrol to procure and maintain air assets. I thank the chairman \nfor supporting my request for $20 in funding for unmanned aerial \nvehicles, UAV's, and related support systems. The conference report \nalso provides $232.98 million for a border construction program. Funds \nfrom this program will be used to construct and maintain border \nfacilities, and $7.46 million will be used to build vehicle barriers \nalong my State's international border with Mexico. We have heard a \ngreat deal from Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, ICE, about the \nneed for additional bed space for apprehended illegal immigrants. The \ncommittee provides a total of $3.89 billion in funding for ICE, of \nwhich $153.4 million is to be used for additional detention bed space.\n  Mr. President, it is no easy task to prioritize funding of programs \nrelated to homeland security. I am proud of Chairman Gregg's leadership \nin ensuring that our Government has provided the resources and moneys \nnecessary to secure our borders and strengthen our enforcement systems. \nUnder the chairman's leadership, we have increased funding for border \nsecurity each year, and I am proud that we have done so again this \nyear.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to express frustration and \ndisappointment with a provision included in the fiscal year 2007 \nHomeland Security appropriations bill. The provision would extend the \ndeadline for the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative from 2008 to \n2009.\n  On August 2 Senate Finance Committee held a hearing to highlight the \nproblems at our Nation's borders. We heard testimony from the \nGovernment Accountability Office, GAO, about their undercover border \ncrossings over the last 3 years. The GAO agents used fake documents, \nphony driver's licenses, and claims of U.S. citizenship in order to \nenter the United States. According to the GAO, their undercover agents \ngot past the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol 42 of 45 times. CBP failed \nto catch the intruders 93 percent of the time, proving that anyone with \na fake identification and a tall tale can get waived right in the \nUnited States.\n  The committee also heard some very strong evidence as to why the \nWestern Hemisphere Travel Initiative, WHTI/Initiative, is important and \nwhy we should make sure this law is implemented by the deadline \nestablished by Congress. In 2004, Congress passed the Intelligence \nReform and Terrorism Prevention Act to require the Departments of State \nand Homeland Security to implement a plan requiring a passport or other \ndocument for all travelers entering the United States. We passed this \ninitiative in order to reduce the free travel across our borders by \npotential terrorists, as recommended unanimously after an extensive \ninvestigation by the bipartisan, independent 9/11 Commission.\n  At the hearing in August, CBP agreed that the initiative is important \nand told us that they were working to be prepared for the January 1, \n2008 deadline. They said the initiative and its passport requirement is \nthe ``gold standard.'' In fact, they even stated that another similar \nhearing could be held again in a few years if our country did not have \na mandatory, standardized document with security features such as \nbiometric identifiers. It was made very clear--border security, in \npart, depends on secure documents.\n  Congress, through authorization bills, sets deadlines for a reason. \nWithout them, nothing would get done in Washington. Even with \ndeadlines, agency bureaucrats procrastinate. The US VISIT Program of \n1996 is a classic example. The deadline we set for the WHTI is not \nuntil January 1, 2008. Extending the deadline in this year's spending \nbill is premature and foolish. We should have allowed the agency to try \nto meet the deadline and implement a system that will close our borders \nto potential terrorists as quickly as possible.\n  If the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative is delayed, then it is \neven more critical that our Customs inspectors be equipped with the \ntools and technology demonstrated at the Finance Committee's August 2 \nhearing. Only then can they have a better chance at catching people \ncrossing into the United States with fake versions of the currently \naccepted documents, which are so easy to obtain.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the fiscal \nyear 2007 Department of Homeland Security conference report. I want to \nbegin by thanking Senator Judd Gregg for his tireless work on this \nreport, and for his commitment to funding the important initiatives in \nthis bill that are so critical to border security, and securing the \nhomeland. Through his leadership a conference report is before us that \nis fiscally responsible while also implementing the necessary programs \nto ensure that we continue defeating the threats to our homeland. I \nwould especially like to touch on a few issues that are especially \nimportant to our homeland security initiatives and to my State of \nGeorgia.\n  I applaud the committee's continued reaffirmation of Public Law 106-\n246, stipulating that any new Federal law enforcement training shall be \nconfigured in a manner so as to not duplicate or displace any Federal \nlaw enforcement program of FLETC.\n  This conference report contains $2 million for the Practical \nApplications/ Counterterrorism Operations Training Facility--CTOTF--at \nthe Federal Law Enforcement Training Center--FLETC--at Glynco. Since \nthe terror attacks of 9/11, counterterrorism has become a core function \nfor Federal law enforcement agencies, and the CTOTF will provide \npractical hands-on training in this new state-of-the-art facility. The \nCTOTF will recreate various settings, both foreign and domestic, that\n\n[[Page S10626]]\n\nagents might encounter out in the field, including rural and urban \nneighborhoods, subway stations, buildings, and roadways. Part of the \ntraining site is now functioning, already making use of donated buses, \nrailway cars, and an airplane.\n  All 82 law enforcement agencies that train at FLETC will have access \nto the new facility. We are preparing our Federal law enforcement \nagents to meet their agencies' mission and I am pleased that this \nconference report recognizes the need to provide them with a realistic \ntraining environment. This practical training, in addition to other \ntactics they learn at FLETC, will also save lives. The students' level \nof awareness of potential dangers will be raised so that when they \nencounter similar situations in the real world, they react correctly.\n\n  I also applaud the inclusion of an extension of the Rehired \nAuthority. Without the renewal of this authority, FLETC would not have \nbeen able to schedule the full training requirements at Glynco and \nArtesia to meet the initiative for Border Patrol at Artesia, and the \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement and Detention Officer Training at \nGlynco. FLETC has demonstrated the need for the authority to be \ncontinued.\n  There were many strong reasons to justify this needed authority, but \nperhaps the most compelling is that by using annuitants FLETC can save \ndollars versus hiring--permanent full-time employees, FTE gain \ndemonstrated experience--the current average is 26 years of law \nenforcement experience--and free up some of the instructors now \nprovided to FLETC by its partner agencies on a temporary basis to be \nused instead in front line law enforcement operational functions. I \napplaud the conference and Chairman Gregg for recognizing the \nimportance of this provision.\n  FLETC is the Federal Government's primary source of law enforcement \ntraining. Eighty-two partner organizations subscribe to FLETC for their \nlaw enforcement training at the basic--entry level--and advanced \ntraining levels. During basic and advanced training, trainees and newly \ncommissioned law enforcement officers are molded into the culture of \nlaw enforcement, much like basic trainees and young soldiers in the \narmed forces. It takes instructors that have the ability to provide \nrealistic instruction to gain the respect of their students as they \nimmerse students into their law enforcement careers. These instructors \ncan come only from the ranks of Federal employees with many years of \ncurrent and relevant law enforcement experience. Subject areas taught \nby these instructors include law enforcement techniques and topical \nareas, such as counterterrorism prevention and detection and border \ntracking procedures.\n  It is in the best interest of the Government to have Federal \nGovernment employees with state-of-the-art knowledge and experience \nregarding tactics, policies, and practices of the law enforcement \ncommunity to provide instruction to trainees, agents, and officers that \nare beginning their careers. To outsource training for law enforcement \nfunctions, even in a partial or fragmented manner, is counterproductive \nto the overall security and enforcement of the laws of the United \nStates.\n\n  The conference report contains a provision making the activities of \nthe staff of FLETC inherently governmental. And while the words ``and \nhereafter'' would have provided the desired result of keeping this from \nbecoming an annual issuance issue, I thank the conferees for the \ninclusion of this language and look forward to working with them to \nstrengthen it in the future.\n  Finally, I commend Chairman Gregg for his commitment to the CBP P-3 \nprogram by providing $70 million to extend the life of these valuable \nassets for another 15,000 to 20,000 hours. These aircraft are an \nimportant component to our national law enforcement and homeland \nsecurity efforts. In addition, they have been critical for FEMA \ndisaster support.\n  Specifically modified for use in drug interdiction, these aircraft \nhave been invaluable for the homeland security mission as well. P-3 AEW \nand P-3 Long-Range Tracker aircraft have a highly successful 20-year \nrecord of detecting and tracking drug smugglers throughout the U.S., \nCanada, Mexico, Caribbean basin, and Central and South America. In \nfact, in fiscal year 2005, CBP P-3s were instrumental in the seizure \nand destruction of a record-breaking $1.7 billion worth of illegal \ndrugs and recognized by the U.S. Interdiction Coordinator for this \nfeat.\n  For years, the CBP P-3 AEW has provided surveillance of significant \nnational events which include support of Presidential and Vice \nPresidential domestic travel; large, terrorism-vulnerable sporting \nevents--the Super Bowl, 2002 Winter Olympics, the Masters--and large \ncity and regional air surveillance during ``high level'' threat \nstatus--AEW surveillance and anti-air coordination of the DC area \nduring State of the Union addresses.\n  The CBP P-3s have been unspoken heroes in providing FEMA disaster \nsupport. There are CBP/FEMA plans to use the P-3s to provide post-\ndisaster assessment and monitoring. In addition, the CBP P-3s were very \nactive in hurricane relief efforts for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita last \nyear. For nearly 2 weeks, they were flying 20 hours a day providing \ncoordination of search and rescue missions, real-time communications \nlinks and real-time video to the Homeland Security Operations Center, \nthe CBP Operations Center, and NORTHCOM. These images also were aired \non CNN.\n  These versatile aircraft and their crews have met, and continue to \nmeet, the needs of our country to address a variety of missions. I \nthank Chairman Gregg for recognizing their important role by extending \ntheir service life in a cost effective manner.\n  I also note the inclusion of funds for a CBP training facility in \nHarper's Ferry, WV. Given my interest in border security, I look \nforward to visiting that facility to see firsthand the training that \ngoes on there.\n  Mr. President, again, Chairman Gregg and his staff are to be \ncommended for their hard work and leadership during a very tough \nconference negotiation. I appreciate the hard work of my friend, the \nSenator from New Hampshire, and look forward to working with him in the \nfuture on these and other issues.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I applaud the progress we will soon make \nin the Homeland Security appropriations bill to lower the cost of \nprescription drugs for all Americans. While the prescription drug \nreimportation provision included in this bill is certainly not a \ncomplete solution to the ever-increasing cost of pharmaceuticals, it is \npart of the answer.\n  This legislation includes a provision to allow Americans to bring a \n90-day, personal supply of prescription drugs approved by the Food and \nDrug Administration, for which they have a valid doctor's prescription, \ninto the country from Canada.\n  I commend Senators David Vitter and Bill Nelson, who introduced this \namendment to the Homeland Security appropriations bill during the \nSenate debate, for their dedication to lowering prescription drug \nprices.\n  We must reduce prescription drug prices so that Americans are not \nforced to cut their pills in half or to choose between medicine and \ngroceries. Virtually all democracies in the world, except the United \nStates, negotiate drug prices for their citizens.\n  The pharmaceutical industry currently sells its Food and Drug \nAdministration, FDA, approved drugs to virtually every other \nindustrialized democracy in the world at prices that are typically 50 \npercent less than prices in the United States. Ours is an ``open \ncheckbook'' strategy, and the result is massive profits for the drug \ncompanies but catastrophe for ordinary Americans.\n  The growth of prescription drug spending in recent years has outpaced \nevery other category of health care spending. According to the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services, prescription drug costs grew at an \ninflation-adjusted average annual rate of 14.5 percent from 1997 to \n2002, reaching $162 billion in 2002. That amount is four times larger \nthan prescription drug costs were in 1990.\n  An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office found that average \nprices for patented drugs in other industrialized nations are 35 to 55 \npercent lower than in the United States. In its 2002 annual report, the \nCanadian Patented Medicine Prices Review Board\n\n[[Page S10627]]\n\nfound that U.S.-patented drug prices were 67 percent higher, on \naverage, than those in Canada.\n  South Dakotans are painfully aware that their neighbors just a few \nhundred miles to the north, in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, Canada, are \npaying much less for the exact same prescription medication. One of my \nconstituents recently wrote me with his concerns about the huge \ndiscrepancy between drug prices in Canada and the United States. The \ngeneric version of his medication is not available in the United \nStates, but because he could obtain the generic from Canada, his \nphysician prescribed it and this man successfully used it for many \nyears.\n  He writes that in Canada, the price of his generic medication is \n$0.46 per tablet, and the brand-name drug is $0.77 per tablet. After \nenrolling in Medicare Part D, he was required to use the brand-name \ndrug, available in the United States for $1.19 per tablet--a 16 percent \nincrease over the Canadian brand-name price, and a 62-percent price \nincrease over the generic drug, which got the job done just fine.\n  This constituent writes:\n\n       It appears to me that the Medicare D plan is a ``gold \n     mine'' for the drug makers. . . at least for this one drug. \n     It is true that I probably should NOT complain because under \n     the Medicare D I only pay my co-payment. However, my concern \n     is not so much my drug cost but the fact that the American \n     taxpayer is being cheated because of the much higher cost per \n     tablet that is paid to the drug producer under the Medicare D \n     program than if the drugs were purchased on a competitive bid \n     procedure. . . After all, I am also an American taxpayer so \n     it does concern me.\n\n  Ehile reimportation is an important step forward, it is only a start \nin our effort to improve access to necessary medications at affordable \nprices. We need to go further and allow Americans access to Canadian \nprices at their local pharmacy. They should not have to take buses to \nCanada to access these savings.\n  To that end, I remain dedicated to enacting the provisions of \nlegislation I introduced with a bipartisan group of colleagues, the \nPharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act of 2005, S. 334. This \nbill would provide for the safe importation of prescription drugs from \nCanada that are both approved by the FDA and manufactured in an FDA-\napproved plant. Eventually, once the FDA establishes the appropriate \nsafety protocols included in the legislation, this bill would allow \nindividuals to purchase drugs directly from Canadian and U.S. \nwholesalers, and pharmacies could import drugs from facilities in \nseveral countries that are registered, fully inspected, and approved by \nthe FDA.\n  So while I applaud the Senate on this small step forward in its \nefforts to reduce prescription drug prices for Americans, I remain \ncommitted to working with my colleagues to create additional \ninitiatives that will lower the cost of prescription drugs.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the chemical security \nprovisions included in the DHS appropriations conference bill. I have \nworked on this issue since 2002 and have always supported reasonable \nchemical security legislation that provides DHS with the authority it \nneeds to protect chemical facilities from terrorists without \noverreaching. I believe this compromise language achieves that balance.\n  I am pleased that this language specifically excludes water utilities \nfrom coverage and focuses the efforts of DHS on private chemical \ncompanies. The Nation's drinking water and wastewater systems are arms \nof local government, not for profit industries. We in Congress \nrecognized the fundamental difference between the for profit private \nsector and local government entities when we passed the Unfunded \nMandates Act. To have included water utilities in this language would \nhave imposed an enormous unfunded mandate on our local partners in \nviolation of that act.\n  Many here in Washington assume that local governments need to be \nforced to protect their citizens. As a former mayor, I can tell you \nthat is simply not true. Local water utilities have been making \ninvestments in security consistently since 9/11 and continue to do so. \nI have offered a bill on wastewater facility security that provides \ntools, incentives, and rewards, not mandates, for local governments to \ncontinue to upgrade security. My legislation passed the Environment and \nPublic Works last Congress with a bipartisan vote and again this \nCongress by voice vote. However, this week, for the second straight \nCongress, when I tried to bring the measure before the full Senate, the \nminority objected even to its consideration. My colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle are holding this legislation up because it does not \nimpose needless mandates and does not include extraneous environmental \nprovisions.\n  For these same reasons, many will rise in opposition to the chemical \nsecurity compromise language included in the conference report. \nThey will argue that the bill needs to allow the Federal Government to \ntell companies how to manufacture their products by requiring \nfacilities to switch the chemicals they use or change their operating \npractices. This concept, known as ``inherently safer technology,'' is \nnot, nor has it ever been, about security. IST is an environmental \nconcept that dates back more than a decade when the extremist \nenvironmental community were seeking bans on chlorine--the chemical \nthat is used to purify our Nation's water. It was only after 9/11 that \nthey decided to play upon the fears of the Nation and repackage IST as \na panacea to all of our security problems.\n\n  I find it very interesting that those arguing most vehemently for IST \nin security legislation are not security experts but, rather, \nenvironmental groups. This only underscores the fact that IST is not a \nsecurity measure; it is a backdoor attempt at increasing the regulation \nof chemicals operating under the guise of security.\n  The legislation before us does not include these extraneous \nenvironmental mandates but instead properly focuses efforts on \nsecurity. The language explicitly clarifies that the new regulatory \nauthorities given to the Department of Homeland Security do not include \nany authorities to regulate the manufacture, distribution, use, sale, \ntreatment or disposal of chemicals. These authorities have been \nproperly provided to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other \nagencies and departments under numerous environmental and workplace \nsafety laws, such as the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Toxic \nSubstances Control Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and a \nhost of others.\n  I believe the conference language achieves what those of us who have \nbeen working on this issue for years have been trying to do--it \nprovides strong authorities to DHS to reasonably regulate private \nsector entities without being hijacked by extraneous concepts that have \nno place in the security debate.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the fiscal year 2007 \nHomeland Security appropriations conference report. The Senate adopted \nthis measure earlier today, and I supported it.\n  I would like to begin by thanking the principal Senate authors of \nthis conference report: Senator Gregg and Senator Byrd. I commend my \ncolleagues and their staffs for the hard work they put into negotiating \nwith the House of Representatives and crafting this report.\n  The conference report adopted by the Senate today funds our country's \nhomeland security activities at $34.8 billion for the upcoming fiscal \nyear. These activities include supporting national and regional \nemergency preparedness, first responders, and infrastructure \nprotection. Taken together, these initiatives form the foundation upon \nwhich our country depends for its domestic security.\n  I feel compelled to speak today because notwithstanding the efforts \nof our colleagues and notwithstanding the adoption of this conference \nreport, I have deep concerns about how this measure--like those that \npreceded it--funds our country's vital homeland security and emergency \npreparedness activities.\n  We all know that disasters--both natural and manmade--continue to \nthreaten our Nation's domestic security and prosperity. As Hurricane \nKatrina tragically demonstrated last year and as the recent terrorist \nplot uncovered by British authorities to destroy U.S.-bound aircraft \ndemonstrated last month, our domestic security--particularly our \ncritical infrastructure--remains dangerously prone to exploitation and \nattack. In light of this unpleasant reality, one would think that the \nCongress of the United States would do everything it could to shore\n\n[[Page S10628]]\n\nup the foundation of our domestic security--to make it as impregnable \nas possible against the destructive forces of nature and man. Yet, as \nwe look at the measure adopted by the Senate, I do not believe it does \nenough to protect Americans from natural disasters or acts of \nterrorism.\n  I believe that the most important activities for ensuring our \ndomestic security include assisting local and regional emergency \npreparedness activities, supporting first responders, and protecting \ncritical infrastructure. Taken together, these activities represent the \nbackbone of our efforts to plan for, respond to, and prevent disasters \non our soil. They encompass supporting firefighters, police officers, \nemergency medical technicians; they encompass fully protecting all of \nour ports and transit systems; and they encompass quickly and \neffectively responding to real or perceived threats in all parts of our \ncountry.\n  Over the past several years, experts in the national security and \npublic health issues relevant to our first responders, critical \ninfrastructure, and emergency preparedness have reported their domestic \nsecurity needs. I would like to remind my colleagues that these are \npresent needs--not future projected needs. For example, our \nfirefighters have identified more than $4 billion needed each year for \nperforming their critical duties safely and efficiently; our port \nauthorities have identified $8.4 billion required for meeting increased \nFederal security requirements; and our transit systems have identified \n$6 billion needed for making our trains and buses safer for passengers.\n  Regrettably, the conference report adopted by the Senate continues a \npattern of failure on the part of the present administration and \nleadership of Congress to adequately meet these needs. Under this \nmeasure, States receive $900 million from the State Homeland Security \nGrant Program--a $350 million increase over the fiscal year 2006 level \nbut $250 million below the fiscal year 2005 level. Our \nfirefighters receive $662 million from the FIRE and SAFER grant \ninitiatives--vital firefighter assistance grants that I was pleased to \nauthor with Senators DeWine, Warner, and Levin. This level of funding \nis $7 million above last year's level but $1.338 billion below the most \nrecent combined authorization level. Our ports receive $210 million--\njust over half of the amount authorized in the recently passed SAFE \nPorts Act, which I was pleased to support. Finally, our transit systems \nreceive $175 million--a $25 million increase above last year's level. \nWhile we have taken steps to boost our domestic security since the \nattacks of September 11, 2001, our State and local governments largely \nremain inadequately prepared, our first responders spread too thin, and \nour critical infrastructure inadequately protected.\n\n  I would also like to discuss briefly another aspect of this \nconference report. In addition to funding the Department of Homeland \nSecurity for the upcoming fiscal year, the conference report makes \nsignificant administrative changes to the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency, FEMA. Many of these changes codify recommendations made by the \n9/11 Commission and various reports issued in the wake of the Federal \nresponse to Hurricane Katrina.\n  I would like to commend particularly the efforts of Senator Collins \nand my fellow colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, in working \nwith conferees to incorporate these reforms to FEMA into the conference \nreport. In my view, these reforms promise ultimately to return FEMA to \nbeing better empowered to manage mitigation, preparedness, response, \nand recovery activities with respect to natural and man-made disasters.\n  Nevertheless, I would be remiss if I did not mention some concerns I \nhold with respect to these reforms. More specifically, I remain \nconcerned these reforms open the possibility for, but do not guarantee, \ninput from all stakeholders involved with local, regional, and national \nemergency preparedness efforts. I am also concerned that these reforms \ndo not offer, in my view, explicit guidelines with respect to resource \nsharing, capability standards, and compliance benchmarks. I believe \nthat it is essential for FEMA, as it works to incorporate these \nreforms, to develop and implement proper regulations that ensure equal \ninput from all local, regional, and national stakeholders, clear \nguidance on adequate local, regional, and national levels of \ninvestment, and clear direction on what activities need to be performed \nby local, regional, and national preparedness systems.\n  Mr. President, we continue to live in an age when the threat of harm \nto Americans on their own soil remains dangerously high. As world \nevents continue to remind us, we must remain vigilant about our \ndomestic security. We must proactively assess our weaknesses and \nproactively work to do all we can to eliminate those weaknesses. Put \nsimply, the lives and the safety of all Americans hang in the balance.\n  On balance, I supported this legislation because the funding it \nappropriates does take important steps toward meeting some of our \ncrucial domestic security needs. However, I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues in the coming years to find and provide the \nresources necessary to make our Nation as safe and strong as it can \npossibly be.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will support final passage of the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill today because it includes vital \nfunding for our first responders and our Nation's borders. \nUnfortunately, the bill still does not go far enough.\n  In particular, I am disappointed that the Senate has again included \nthe small State funding formula for our largest first responder grant \nprogram. We need to change our approach to allocating these scarce \nresources by reducing the amount of funds allocated to States \nregardless of need and increasing the funds available to States facing \nthe greatest threats and greatest need. I will continue to work with my \ncolleagues in coming months to make the allocation of these scarce \nresources more equitable.\n  I am also disappointed that this bill does not take steps to \nestablish a Northern Border Air Wing in Detroit, MI, as the Senate bill \ndid. The Northern Border Air Wing, NBAW, initiative was launched by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, DHS, in 2004 to provide air and marine \ninterdiction and enforcement capabilities along the northern border. \nOriginal plans called for DHS to open five NBAW sites in New York, \nWashington, North Dakota, Montana, and Michigan. Michigan was \noriginally scheduled to be the third facility opened.\n  The New York and Washington NBAW sites have been operational since \n2004. Unfortunately, not all of the sites have been established, \nleaving large portions of our northern border unpatrolled from the air \nand, in the case of my home State, the water. In the conference report \naccompanying the fiscal year 2006 DHS appropriations bill, the \nconferees noted that these remaining gaps in our air patrol coverage of \nthe northern border should be closed as quickly as possible. This bill \ndoes not accomplish the goals set by Congress last year.\n  In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, John Bates, \nthe Chief CBP official in the Detroit Sector said the Detroit area's \ninternational border is ``an attractive site for criminal organizations \nthat traffic human cargo, contraband, and narcotics across our \nborder.'' Chief Bates also noted in his testimony that the ``natural \nterrain and geographical nexus to the waterways'' presents a tremendous \nchallenge to border interdiction and Law Enforcement efforts, the \nfailure of which ``could have major national security implications.''\n  During Senate floor consideration, with the help of Senators Byrd and \nGregg, the Senate accepted my amendment related to establishing the \nfifth and final Northern Border Wing. Unfortunately, this funding was \ntaken out in conference, and the gap along the northern border will \nremain open for yet another year.\n  Given the serious threat from terrorists, drug traffickers, and \nothers who seek to enter our country illegally, I would hope the \nDepartment uses its operating funds to open the Michigan site as soon \nas possible. According to the Department, establishing the NBAW will \ncost approximately $17 million. This would be consistent with an April \n11, 2006, letter to me in which Secretary Chertoff indicated that it \nwas his Department's plan to open the Michigan site during the 2007 \nfiscal year. I hope he will follow through on that promise.\n\n[[Page S10629]]\n\n  Although I wish the bill did more to make first responder funding \nrisk-based and to establish a Northern Border Wing in Michigan, there \nare many provisions in the bill that I support.\n  I was pleased to learn of the appropriators' decision to retain the \nLeahy-Stevens Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative deadline extension. \nAccording to the Detroit Regional Chamber of Commerce, businesses in \nMichigan are already being negatively impacted by concerns about \ncrossing land borders from Canada into the United States. Extension of \nthe implementation deadline will allow DHS and the State Department to \nwork through a variety of issues associated with REAL ID and the \nproposed pass cards, as well as allow for a more effective public \ninformation campaign.\n  I am also pleased that the final bill includes funding for 1,500 new \nBorder Patrol agents. I hope the Department will apportion these agents \nin a manner that considers the threat along the northern border, \nparticularly in the areas around the northern border's busiest \ncrossings. I was pleased the conferees noted the lack of experienced \nborder agents on the northern border and that they have agreed to hold \nthe Secretary's feet to the fire on this issue. As a member of the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, I look forward to \ndiscussing this matter with Secretary Chertoff.\n  The conferees retained a provision regarding a pilot project for \nunmanned aerial vehicles on the northern border. The Great Lakes are \nalmost completed unguarded at present, and UAVs are the perfect \ntechnology for surveillance along these water borders. The Great Lakes \noffer a unique opportunity for the Department, and I look forward to \nworking with the Department in the coming year on this issue.\n  I am pleased that the bill includes language that will strengthen the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA. The Federal Government's \nbungled response to Hurricane Katrina demonstrated incompetence at the \nhighest levels of DHS and also demonstrated the need to strengthen our \nNation's emergency response capabilities. The FEMA provision will \nrestore the vital connection between emergency preparedness and \nresponse that Secretary Chertoff had previously severed. The bill also \nincludes a provision for keeping families together during mass \nevacuations and requires DHS to establish a National Emergency Child \nLocator Center that will help families reunite more quickly in the \nevent they get separated during a disaster. I hope these provisions \nwill help prevent the reoccurrence of one of the most tragic \nconsequences of the Katrina disaster--the thousands of children who \nwere reported as missing in its aftermath. However, I am disappointed \nthat the bill did not include a $3.3 billion authorization for a \ndedicated communications interoperability grant program. This provision \nhad previously been included in an emergency management reform bill \nthat we passed in the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee.\n  The bill also includes a provision that would authorize the Secretary \nof Homeland Security to issue interim regulations for high-risk \nchemical facilities. Although this authorization is long past due, I am \ndisappointed that such an important provision was drafted behind closed \ndoors, instead of being vetted with full transparency, as was the case \nwith the comprehensive chemical plant security legislation that passed \nout of Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee \nunanimously on June 15, 2006. I am glad that a 3-year sunset provision \nwas included in the bill so that the authorizing committees can make \nany needed improvements to ensure that the threats from chemical plants \nare fully addressed.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the fiscal \nyear 2007 Homeland Security conference report. It is important for me \nto begin by thanking Senator Judd Gregg for his hard work and for his \ndedication to producing a strong report. I commend Senator Gregg for \nhis leadership and for working with me to secure several important \ninitiatives that are so important for the State of Georgia and for \nAmerica's security.\n  The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, FLETC, is located in \nGlynco, GA. We have outstanding law-enforcement training which takes \nplace at this fine facility. The conference report restored $2 million \nto FLETC's Counterterrorism Operations and Training Facility, COTF. I \nam profoundly grateful for this funding and know that the men and women \nof law-enforcement who operate and train at FLETC are grateful, also. \nSince the attacks of 9/11, it has become vital that our law enforcement \nreceive the most up to date counterterrorism training that is \navailable, and FLETC provides it.\n  I also would like to commend Chairman Gregg for including language to \nensure that the training and programs being developed at the Advanced \nTraining Center at Harper's Ferry, WV, will not be duplicate or \ndisplace any Federal law enforcement program at FLETC. I am pleased \nthat Senator Gregg referenced the language in Public Law 106-246 in \norder to reaffirm Congress's longstanding commitment to protect the \nprograms and training at the FLETC. I look forward to continuing to \nwork with him to ensure that this language continues to be included in \nthe future.\n  Senator Gregg honored my request to protect and ensure the FLETC to \nrenew the Rehired Authority. Without the renewal of this authority, \nFLETC will not be able to schedule the full training requirements at \nGlynco and Artesia, NM, to meet the initiative for Border Patrol at \nArtesia, and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Detention \nOfficer Training at Glynco. The FLETC has demonstrated the need for the \nauthority.\n  There are many strong reasons to justify this needed authority, but \nperhaps the most compelling is that by using annuitants, FLETC can save \ndollars, versus hiring permanent full-time employees, gain demonstrated \nexperience--the current average is 26 years of law enforcement \nexperience--and free up some of the instructors now provided to FLETC \nby its partner agencies on a temporary basis to be used instead in \nfront line law enforcement operational functions.\n  The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center is the Federal \nGovernment's primary source of law enforcement training. Eighty-two \npartner organizations subscribe to FLETC for their law enforcement \ntraining at the basic--entry level--and advanced training levels. \nDuring basic and advanced training, trainees and newly commissioned law \nenforcement officers are molded into the culture of law enforcement, \nmuch like basic trainees and young soldiers in the Armed Forces. It \ntakes instructors that have the ability to provide realistic \ninstruction to gain the respect of their students as they immerse \nstudents into their law enforcement careers. These instructors can come \nonly from the ranks of Federal employees with many years of very \nrelevant law enforcement experience. Subject areas taught by these \ninstructors include law enforcement techniques and topical areas, such \nas counterterrorism prevention and detection and border tracking \nprocedures. It is in the best interest of the Government to have \nFederal Government employees with state-of-the-art knowledge and \nexperience regarding tactics, policies, and practices of the law \nenforcement community to provide instruction to trainees, agents, and \nofficers who are beginning their careers. To outsource training for law \nenforcement functions, even in a partial or fragmented manner, is \ncounterproductive to the overall security and enforcement of the laws \nof the United States.\n  The conference report contains language making the activities of the \nstaff of the FLETC inherently governmental. While it was my hope that \nthe provision would have been strengthened by the use of the words \n``and hereafter'' to avoid the requirement of a renewal each year, I \nlook forward to working with the chairman to achieve this goal in the \nfuture.\n  I am very proud of our employees at FLETC Glynco and the work that is \ndone there and am a very strong supporter of the FLETC. I look forward \nto continuing to help strengthen the operations that are conducted \nthere so that we can offer the best possible training and protection to \nour homeland.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me first express my appreciation for \nthe hard work of the conferees in approving the legislation we will \nvote on\n\n[[Page S10630]]\n\nshortly that contains an important provision addressing the security of \nour Nation's chemical infrastructure.\n  I believe it is very important that our chemical infrastructure have \nsafeguards for the use and storage of chemical manufacturing and \ndistribution. There is no doubt that it is vital to our efforts to \nensure national security and the safety of the public. However, we \nshould remind ourselves that many in the regulated community have \nalready taken proactive actions, especially since September 11, 2001, \nto address threats to their facilities and operations, and have adopted \na number of safeguards.\n  It is my hope that Congress in its oversight role, and the Department \nof Homeland Security in its administrative and regulatory role, takes \nthose efforts into account and ensures that any new protections and \nregulations are workable and appropriate.\n  I am concerned that while the intent of the chemical security \n``compromise'' in this conference report is to address security \nconcerns associated with high-risk industrial chemical use, the bill \nmay also affect many low-risk facilities at a disproportionate level. \nOne of those low-risk industries that will certainly be affected is our \ndomestic dairy industry.\n  My State of Idaho is a leader in milk production and processing, and \nour dairy industry is a major economic force. The industry employs the \nlatest technologies to provide high quality products to our consumers \nand trading partners. What most people do not know is that dairy \nfarmers, dairy cooperatives, and milk processors use anhydrous ammonia \nas a cooling agent to safely store milk and milk products as it makes \nits way from farm to grocery store shelf.\n  Many in the food industry consider anhydrous ammonia to be one of the \nmost efficient refrigerants available and in a relatively low-risk \nprocess. In accordance with Government regulations and guidelines, many \ndairy facilities now use anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems after \nphasing out other chemicals that are less environmentally friendly.\n  The dairy industry in Idaho and nationwide has been extremely \ndiligent in taking actions to enhance the safety and security of their \nfacilities. Those actions include regularly working with the Department \nof Homeland Security under Presidential Directives 7 and 9 along with \nregularly conducted vulnerability assessments with the Food and Drug \nAdministration, FDA, the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, and State and local officials.\n  Food facilities were some of the first industries we focused on in \nour fight against terrorism. This sector of our economy is currently \nregulated under the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism \nPreparedness and Response Act of 2002 under the jurisdiction of the \nFDA. The anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration systems at these \nfacilities is already regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, \nEPA, under its Risk Management Program, RMP, regulations and by the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, under its Process \nSafety Management, PSM, regulations.\n  I believe, that the intent of including language in this conference \nreport to strengthen the safety of our chemical production \ninfrastructure was to focus on high-risk chemical plants. However, the \nlanguage in the bill could impose serious burdens on what would \nnormally be considered low-risk operations like dairy farms, \ncooperatives, and milk processors.\n  Clearly, there is substantial interest in ensuring the security of \nour Nation's chemical infrastructure while not forcing onerous and \nduplicative regulations on one of our most important food industries. I \nhope some common sense will prevail on this issue, and I plan to \ncontinue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and the \nadministration to see that happen.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on the 5 year anniversary of the terrorist \nattacks of 9/11, many our Nation's commentators asked the same \nquestion: Are we safer today than we were on 9/11? Well, I must say to \nmy colleagues, that is the wrong question. America was not safe on 9/\n11.\n  So in my book, being safer than we were on 9/11 is not saying much. \nWe must set a higher standard.\n  Regrettably, the President has set a very low standard. The President \nis comfortable with cutting grants to first responders 3 years in a row \nat the same time that our police, fire, and emergency medical personnel \nstill cannot talk to each other on their radio systems. The President \nis comfortable with cutting grants to equip and train our heroic \nfirefighters by 46 percent and with proposing to eliminate the program \nto hire more firefighters. The President is comfortable with a Homeland \nSecurity Department that is so bureaucratically lethargic that $173 \nmillion approved by Congress to secure our ports sat in the Treasury \nhere in Washington for 11\\1/2\\ months.\n  This President is comfortable with a rob-Peter-to-pay-Paul approach \nto homeland security. When the Department was faced with a shortfall in \nfunding for securing Federal buildings, the administration proposed to \ncut funding for developing effective countermeasures for explosives. A \nmonth later, Britain arrested potential terrorists who wanted to blow \nup planes over the Atlantic with liquid explosive. What an \nembarrassing, short-sighted proposal from the administration. I was \npleased to join Chairman Gregg in rejecting the proposal.\n  This administration was comfortable with shutting off federal funding \nfor the FEMA program that provides long-term healthcare to the brave \nfirst responders who tried to save lives and look for survivors at the \nWorld Trade Center on 9/11. It was the Congress that came forward with \nfunds to continue providing healthcare to our first responders.\n  Well, I am not comfortable with the state of our homeland security.\n  It has been 5 years since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It has been \nnearly 5 years since Richard tried to blow up a plane bound for Miami. \nIt has been 2\\1/2\\ years since hundreds were killed in the Madrid train \nbombings. It has been over 1 year since 752 were killed or wounded in \nthe London train bombings. Just this summer, potential terrorists were \narrested in Britain, who were planning to blow up planes over the \nAtlantic. Our aviation sector remains on high alert. There is no \nquestion about a continuing risk of attack.\n  So, 5 years after 9/11, has the Department of Homeland Security taken \nthe steps that it needs to take to help make Americans safe?\n  Five years after the 9/11 attacks, 11 million cargo containers arrive \nin the United States each year. Any one of them could carry a nuclear \nbomb, or nuclear material to make a bomb. Yet only 5 percent of these \ncontainers are opened and inspected. Only 17-19 percent are examined \nwith imaging equipment. Only 73 percent are screened for nuclear \nmaterial.\n  Five years after the 9/11 attacks, many of our first responders still \ncannot communicate with each other on their radio systems.\n  Five years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, we still have no system \nfor verifying the identities and backgrounds of the thousands of \nworkers who have access to our ports, boats, cargo containers, or air \ncargo.\n  Five years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, we still do not have a \nreliable system for inspecting the 23 billion pounds of air cargo that \nis placed on passenger aircraft every year.\n  Annually, 500 million people cross U.S. borders via ports of entry--\nmore than 330 million of them are noncitizens. One of the key findings \nof the 9/11 Commission is that we do not have a system in this country \nfor tracking aliens who pose a risk and remain in this country \nundetected. Five years after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, we still do \nnot have a system for knowing when, or if, aliens have left the \ncountry. Nor do we have a 10-fingerprint system to reliably verify the \nidentity, or the criminal or terrorist background, of aliens coming \ninto this country.\n  The EPA has estimated that there are 123 chemical plants across the \ncountry that could each endanger more than 1 million people if \nattacked. Yet 5 years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, we have no \nregulations directing the chemical industry to improve security.\n  Five years after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, we have a Department \nof Homeland Security, but it is a department rife with management \nproblems. The Department has become a contractor's dream. Over $11.5 \nbillion of the Department's budget was executed through\n\n[[Page S10631]]\n\ncontracts, a 60-percent increase over 2004. Yet only 18 of the 115 \nmajor DHS contracts are managed by certified program managers. What an \nincredible opportunity for waste. It is no wonder that the GAO found \n$1.4 billion of waste from Katrina spending.\n  The Department has the dubious distinction of being investigated 525 \ntimes by the GAO since its inception. The vast majority of the GAO \nreports cited poor management and leadership practices.\n  According to the Rand Corporation, between 1998 and 2003, there were \napproximately 181 terrorist attacks on rail targets worldwide. Five \nyears after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the Department has no plan \nfor helping State and local governments to secure rail and transit \nsystems. $150 million that Congress appropriated for rail and transit \nsecurity sat at the Department for 11\\1/2\\ months. Since 2001, I have \noffered eight different amendments to fund rail and transit security, \nand all of them were opposed by the administration and defeated.\n  The recent terrorist plot to blow up commercial airplanes crossing \nthe Atlantic Ocean has highlighted a known vulnerability. Five years \nafter the terrorist attacks of 9/11, we do not have technologies that \ncan detect liquid explosives.\n  The Department recently published a Nationwide Plan Review that found \nthat the majority of State and local emergency operations plans are not \nfully adequate, feasible, or acceptable. Can you imagine? Five years \nafter 9/11, the Department's own data indicates that State and local \ngovernments are not ready to deal with a catastrophic event. The \nDepartment has not even published a congressionally mandated National \nPreparedness Goal.\n  The terrorist attacks of 9/11 should have been a wake-up call; but, \napparently, the Department of Homeland Security, which was created in \nresponse to 9/11, somehow did not get the message.\n  Given these continuing vulnerabilities, I am pleased to say that the \nconferees have set a higher standard than the White House or the \nDepartment.\n  The conference agreement contains many improvements to the \nPresident's request, particularly, with regard to border security and \nport security. Were steadily increasing funding for Emergency \nManagement Preparedness Grants, despite the President's proposed cuts \neach year. We have restored proposed cuts in grants to fire departments \nfor needed equipment, and for hiring firefighters. The conferees have \nalso mandated that grants be awarded within certain timeframes so that \ndollars intended to make Americans safer do not sit in the Treasury for \nan entire year.\n  The conference agreement also includes important reforms in the \norganization of FEMA. Hurricane Katrina proved that the \nAdministration's approach to breaking FEMA into pieces was a failure. \nThis legislation will help put FEMA on sound footing.\n  In addition, the conference report contains many provisions that \nprovide clear guidance to the Department about how to improve its \noperations.\n  I am particularly pleased with the improvements in funding for border \nsecurity. Over the pass 2 years, starting with an amendment I offered \nwith Senator Larry Craig to the fiscal year 2005 emergency \nsupplemental--with the support of my Subcommittee Chairman, Senator \nGregg--this Congress, and especially this Senate, has added 4,000 new \nBorder Patrol agents and 9,150 new detention beds to the fight for \nborder security. And, as a result of our efforts, there are 1,373 new \ndetention personnel and 526 new Customs and Border Protection officers \nat our ports of entry.\n  With Congress leading the way in a bipartisan manner, this \nadministration has finally awakened and realized that this country \nfaces a true illegal immigration crisis. There are 12 million illegal \naliens currently living in this country--with more than 500,000 new \nillegal entering each year. And, as of this past January, there were an \nestimated 558,000 alien absconders--illegal aliens who have been \nordered to be removed from this country, but who have thus far escaped \ndetection. These individuals must be found and removed.\n  I am pleased that the conference report before us makes great strides \nat achieving that goal. We are ending the short-sighted practice of \n``catch and release'' and replacing it with ``catch and remove.'' This \nconference report supports 27,500 detention beds.\n  We have increased the number of Fugitive Operations teams from 16 in \nfiscal year 2005 to 75 teams in fiscal year 2007. In fiscal year 2005, \nthese teams apprehended over 15,000 illegal aliens including 270 sexual \npredators and 11,200 fugitive aliens with judicial orders of removal \nagainst them. Adding an additional 23 more teams--for a total of 75 \nteams--will make a real difference in removing from this country those \nindividuals who have been ordered removed and who are here illegally.\n  We are also increasing funding for the criminal alien program, which \nidentifies illegal aliens currently serving time in U.S. prisons and \nbegins removal proceedings against them while they are in jail. There \nare an estimated 630,000 criminal aliens in all Federal, State, and \nlocal prisons--of whom 551,000 have not yet been identified for removal \nfrom the country. Of these, 275,000 are here illegally. Additional \nattention is also focused on worksite enforcement.\n  I commend my excellent Chairman, Senator Judd Gregg, for his \noutstanding knowledge of this bill and for his leadership. I thank him \nand his able staff, and I thank my staff, for their work on this \nlegislation. This is a good agreement.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, every year, millions of \nAmericans who cannot otherwise afford their prescriptions at pharmacies \nin the United States seek the same FDA-approved prescriptions from \nCanada at significantly lower prices. However, on November 17, 2005, \nU.S. Customs quietly implemented a new, stricter policy on prescription \ndrug importation. The new policy has resulted in over 37,000 \nprescription drug shipments being detained by Federal officials. The \nnew policy has limited the ability of American consumers to purchase \nthese legally prescribed medications from FDA-approved facilities in \nCanada.\n  Mr. President, I can tell you that my constituents are extremely \ndisturbed by the actions being taken by our Federal Government. \nSilently implementing a stricter policy without adequately informing \nthe public puts the health of those who have relied on the prompt \ndelivery of these medications at risk.\n  That is why I offered an amendment with Senator Vitter to the Senate \nversion of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill. Our \namendment prohibits Customs from stopping the importation of FDA-\napproved prescription drugs by American citizens. The amendment \nreceived overwhelming bipartisan support when it was added to the \nSenate bill.\n  Unfortunately, the language agreed to by a House-Senate conference \ncommittee will only allow Americans to buy and carry home Canadian \nprescription drugs for personal use, while continuing to prohibit \nconsumers from ordering their prescriptions from Canada by mail.\n  Although the original Nelson-Vitter provision would have given all \nAmericans greater access to affordable prescription drugs through the \nmail, the diluted version that emerged from conference committee will \nhelp only a few Americans from one part of the country. This language \nhelps almost no Floridians who live thousands of miles from the \nCanadian border. While I am pleased that Americans living near the \nborder will now have greater access to low-cost prescription \nmedications, I believe that this provision discriminates against \nFloridians and others who do not live near Canada.\n  However, this provision is a small step in the right direction. I \nbelieve that its passage will open the door to expanding access to \nlower-cost medications from Canada for all Americans, regardless of \nwhere they live. We have made progress but I intend to keep pushing the \nissue until all Americans can get the medications they need at an \naffordable price.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes remaining equally divided \nprior to the vote.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. On behalf of myself and Senator Byrd, we yield back the \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the conference \nreport.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S10632]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will speak on the port security \nconference report we are just passing. I am a conferee on that bill and \nthis conference has been a sham. It is shameful because the Democratic \nmembers of the conference committee have not been allowed to offer \namendments to the conference report. We were sitting on our hands for \nvirtually an hour while the chairman of the conference committee was \nabsent, without a piece of paper in front of us about what was in the \nport security bill. Nothing. There was no indication of what was there. \nNo guide, nothing--just sitting there wiling away the time.\n  Why, we asked, did the Republican leadership in the House and the \nSenate allow this perversion of the democratic process? Why make \npromises we would have a chance to offer amendments but never be able \nto do so?\n  They wanted this conference to be a plain backroom deal. Their agenda \nis to strip from this bill important provisions on rail security, \ntransit security and aviation security and replace them with \nlegislation that has nothing to do with our homeland security at all, \nour port security.\n  I would like to understand from the majority what it is they were \ntrying to tell the American people. What was so objectionable about the \nprovisions Democratic conferees wanted to offer to bolster aviation, \ntransit, rail, truck, bus, and pipeline security?\n  The Senate has agreed to the rail security legislation and twice the \nSenate has approved transit security legislation. Twice the Senate \nagreed to my amendment to remove the arbitrary cap on the number of \nairport screeners that can be hired, but each time these measures died \ndue to the inaction by the House of Representatives. Now Republican \nleaders, once again, want to kill them.\n  Last night, the Republican chairman assured the Democratic conferees \nthat they could offer amendments to the conference report, but they put \nobstacles in the way to permit it from happening. Republicans were \nfearful of showing votes against common sense for rail, transit and \naviation security measures. This challenges logic beyond belief.\n  Last night, the House had actually approved, had voted 281-140, to \ninstruct their conferees to support the Senate provisions on rail, \ntransit and aviation security. Transit systems have always been \nterrorist targets. They are open, accessible and teeming with innocent \npeople. Since we have not done what we need to do to protect them, they \nare vulnerable.\n  Recent attacks in Madrid, London and Mumbai have shown just how \ndevastating these attacks can be. Hundreds of people have been killed \njust commuting to and from their jobs in those cities.\n  The Senate rail security provision mandated measures to help protect \n25 million Amtrak riders each year, but the House leadership dismissed \nrecent attacks on the rail systems as not significant enough to guard \nagainst. It would protect millions more who live near rail tracks where \ntrains carrying hazardous materials pass by, with some very close to \nthis facility, on nearby tracks. Once again, logic failed.\n  The aviation security provision dealing with airport screeners was \napproved in the Senate by a vote of 85-12. It would have removed the \narbitrary caps on hiring TSA airport screeners. I repeat, the Senate, \nby a vote of 85-12, would have removed the arbitrary cap on hiring TSA \nairport screeners even though burgeoning numbers of passengers are \nflooding our airports. Lifting the cap could have made air travel \nsafer. And it would have reduced the amount of time passengers have to \nwait in line at terminals to pass through security lines.\n\n  It is important for the American people to understand the enormous \nopportunity taken away from them to protect themselves. It is important \nfor our people to understand the leadership in the Congress stood \nagainst rail security, transit security or shorter airport-airline \npassenger security.\n  We did not finish the conference on the port security bill. We \nfinished a sham. The majority ought to be embarrassed by their \nthoughtless abandonment of essential security protection for the \nAmerican people as they travel.\n  The leadership stripped out--in the conference that never took \nplace--rail transit and aviation security but made sure that Texas \nHold'em Poker games are illegal to play on your computer.\n  I regret this took place. I hope America does not see in its near \nfuture that they were foolishly careless in not protecting our citizens \nas much as they could.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent since the Senator \nfrom Alaska yields back his 5 minutes that I be permitted to speak for \nup to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10632-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10632-S10633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SAFE PORT ACT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, shortly this evening, the Senate will \nadopt the conference report on the SAFE Port Act. This conference \nreport includes all of the major port security improvements that were \nincluded in the Port Security Improvement Act of 2006 that passed the \nSenate just 2 weeks ago. It has been strengthened by including some of \nthe provisions in the companion House bill.\n  This is a major accomplishment for this Congress that will help to \nstrengthen our Homeland Security in ways that really matter. The \noriginal template for the SAFE Port Act was the GreenLane Maritime \nCargo Security Act I introduced with Senator Murray, Senator Coleman \nand Senator Lieberman almost a year ago.\n  I commend Senator Murray for her steadfast commitment to \nstrengthening port security. I also thank the Presiding Officer, \nSenator Coleman, for his leadership. He has chaired three hearings on \ncargo security that helped identify the vulnerabilities and shortfalls \nin the current systems. That investigation by the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, in fact, helped inform our legislation \nand, indeed, all of the problems that the Presiding Officer identified \nin his hearings have been addressed in this landmark legislation.\n  I also commend the ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee, \nSenator Lieberman, who helped to shepherd this bill through our \ncommittee. This has truly been a bipartisan bicameral effort. It \nrepresents the Senate at its best. As a result, we have been able to \nproduce significant legislation.\n  America's 361 seaports are vital elements in our Nation's \ntransportation network. Last year, some 11 million shipping containers \ncame into this country. Now, when we look at the shipping containers, \nwe hope they simply contain consumer goods or parts or other useful \nobjects. But, in fact, every one of these 11 million shipping \ncontainers has the potential to be the Trojan horse of the 21st \ncentury.\n  The vulnerability of our cargo is perhaps best illustrated by an \nincident that happened in Seattle earlier this year. In April, 22 \nChinese nationals were caught as they attempted to leave a shipping \ncontainer. Those illegal aliens transited in a shipping container all \nthe way from China to our shores to the port of Seattle. This container \ncould have just as easily have contained not people seeking a better \nway of life but people seeking to destroy our way of life. There could \nhave been a squad of terrorists in that container. There could have \nbeen the makings of a dirty bomb. There could have even been a small \nnuclear device. That is the vulnerability of the current system.\n  In fact, the containers have been called the poor man's missile \nbecause a low budget terrorist could ship one across our oceans to a \nUnited States port for only a few thousand dollars. The stakes are very \nhigh.\n  If you visit a port like Seattle, as I have, you see that the port is \nlocated in the midst of a large urban population, with two stadiums \nclose by, with ferries bringing thousands of visitors. The loss of life \nwould be devastating.\n  But there is another impact of a possible attack on our ports; that \nis, the\n\n[[Page S10633]]\n\neconomic loss that would ensue. We are aware that many plants and \nretailers now rely on just-in-time inventories that bring goods to \ntheir stores.\n  I think we should look back at 9/11 and look at what happened to our \nsystem of commercial aircraft when we had the attacks on our airplanes. \nIn fact, commercial aircraft were grounded for a number of days. And \njust as that happened 5 years ago, an attack on any one of our ports \nwould most likely result in the closure of all ports, and the economic \nconsequences would be devastating. It would affect the farmers in the \nMidwest, who would be unable to ship their crops. It would affect \nretailers across the country, who would soon have empty shelves. It \nwould affect factories that would be forced to shut down and lay off \nworkers because of the loss of vital parts.\n  The best example I can give you of what the economic impact would be \nis to look back at the west coast dock strike of 2002. Unlike any \nterror attack, that was both peaceful and anticipated, and yet it cost \nthe economy $1 billion a day for each of the 10 days it lasted.\n  Since the attacks on our country 5 years ago, there have been some \nactions taken to improve security at our seaports. For example, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security instituted several important port \nsecurity programs such as the Container Security Initiative and what is \nknown as C-TPAT, the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism \nProgram. Unfortunately, the investigation led by the Senator from \nMinnesota has demonstrated that those programs have been very unevenly \nimplemented. Some have lagged, and some have not been effective because \nthere has not been the proper verification that has been needed.\n  What our legislation would do is provide the structures and the \nresources to strengthen those programs. The legislation before us is a \ncomprehensive approach that addresses all levels and all major aspects \nof maritime cargo security.\n  It will require the Department of Homeland Security to develop a \ncomprehensive strategic plan for all transportation modes by which \ncargo moves into, within, and out of U.S. ports.\n  It requires the Department of Homeland Security to develop protocols \nfor restarting our ports if there were an incident, which we certainly \nhope this legislation will prevent or help prevent any attack on our \nseaports, but if one does occur, it is essential the Federal Government \nhave a plan for reopening the ports and releasing cargo as soon as \npossible. Unfortunately, and in my opinion amazingly, we do not have \nsuch a plan today. So we will require the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to develop such a plan.\n  We authorize $400 million for each of the next 5 years in risk-based \nport security grants. We also authorize training and exercises that we \nknow are key to preparedness and effective response.\n  We improve and expand several security programs, such as the \nContainer Security Initiative, the C-TPAT Program, and we establish \ndeadlines for action on these programs.\n  We provide additional incentives for shippers and importers to meet \nthe highest level of cargo-security standards. We also make sure the \nDepartment is meeting deadlines for such essential programs as the TWIC \nProgram.\n  Another critical provision in this bill is the requirement that all \ncontainers at our 22 largest ports be scanned for radiation by the end \nof next year. All the 22 largest ports, which handle 98 percent or \nvirtually all cargo, would be required to have radiation detection \ndevices in place by the end of next year. We also expand the radiation \nscanning that is done at foreign ports through the CSI program and the \nMegaports program. Obviously, our goal is to push off our shores and \nkeep the danger from ever getting to our shores in the first place.\n  Another security measure is the vital transportation Worker \nIdentification Credential, or the so-called TWIC, Program. It has \nlanguished for years, and it should not have because the TWIC Program \nis necessary to control access to port facilities and vessels, and it \nis a vital program.\n  We also--I know this has been of great interest to the Presiding \nOfficer--establish a pilot program with real deadlines and real results \nat three foreign ports to test the feasibility of doing a nonintrusive \nscan; in other words, sort of an x ray of every container, have that \nscan actually analyzed, and combine it with a radiation scan.\n  That is going to allow us, eventually, to get to the goal, once the \ntechnology is there, of a 100-percent integrated scanning program.\n  There is still work to be done to address security for other modes of \ntransportation, such as rail and mass transit. But tonight we should \ntake great pride in the great progress we have made in strengthening \nthe security of our seaports.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10633-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPROVIDING FOR A CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES \n         AND A CONDITIONAL RECESS OR ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my friend for yielding to me.\n  While Senator Collins is still on the floor, I want to take a moment \nto say, Mr. President, if you go back 5 years ago and consider the \ntragedies that befell our Nation on September 11, it opened our eyes to \nthe kind of threats we face with respect to the security of our air \ntravel. It served to open our eyes, subsequently, with respect to the \nsecurity of our ports, with the security of our chemical plants and the \ncommunities that are located around them. I think we have had our eyes \nopened to security threats that maybe face people who travel on our \ntrains and our commuter rail systems.\n  We have seen all too well how inadequately--ineptly, really--FEMA \nresponded to the Katrina and the gulf coast part of our country. I \nthink most of us agree today we are better equiped now to fend off \nthreats to the security of our air travel. And I think with respect to \nthe security of our ports, with this legislation Senator Collins and \nSenator Murray have shepherded, which the Presiding Officer has \ncontributed greatly to, we have made real progress; some would say \nmaybe not enough, but I think everybody would say measurable, palpable \nprogress.\n  I know there are folks who have been critical of the fact that we \nhave not included the rail and transit provisions in this final \nconference report, which were included in our Senate-passed version. I \nwish they were there. We have a lot of people who travel on the rail \nand transit systems, with, I think, about 9 billion trips this year, \nand there is a threat to many of them--not all of them but to many of \nthem.\n  But there is good work that has been done with respect to chemical \nsecurity. FEMA has been overhauled, and I think maybe not transformed \nbut I think significantly improved.\n  One of the constant threads within all of that has been Senator \nCollins, as the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee. I just want to stand here tonight and say that this \nis yet another conference she has helped to direct and steer, as it \ncomes to a conclusion. I commend her, and certainly Senator Murray, who \nhas worked closely with her. I commend them and the Presiding Officer \nand others for the good work they have done.\n  I acknowledge we have some more work to do with rail and transit \nsecurity. My hope is we will do that when we return next January.\n  Thank you very much. And I again thank my friend for yielding.\n\n[[Page S10634]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, every year since 1961, there has been an \nannual Defense authorization bill enacted. This year--\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator would yield to me \nfor a moment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. WARNER. For the purpose of putting in a quorum call.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, every year since 1961 there has been an \nannual Defense authorization bill enacted. This year, like the previous \n44 years, conferees and staff have worked extraordinarily hard and \ncooperated on a bi-partisan basis to get us to this point in our \ndeliberations on this bill that means so much to our country. The fact \nthat we are keeping up our decades-long tradition is reason enough to \nbe proud, but what I am even prouder of is the leadership that our \nchairman and my friend, Senator Warner, has invested in getting us to \nthis point.\n  This bill is essential to the men and women of our Armed Forces.\n  I am pleased that the conference report reflects Senate's \nlongstanding commitment to a larger Army and Marine Corps. We \nauthorized an increase of 1000 active duty marines for an authorized \nend strength of 180,000, 5,000 more than the administration requested. \nWe also authorized an active duty end strength for the Army of \n512,4000, 30,000 more than requested.\n  I am delighted that, after several years of fighting for it, we have \nfinally been able to authorize the TRICARE health care benefit for all \nmembers of the Selected Reserve and their families for a reasonable \npremium that is 28 percent of the cost of the program. I am also \npleased that the conference report prohibits the Department of Defense \nfrom increasing enrollment premiums for military retirees and cost \nshares for prescriptions filled through retail pharmacies while the GAO \nconducts an audit of the health care program and a Task Force completes \na comprehensive assessment of the future of military health care.\n  The conference report also contains numerous other provisions to \nenhance the quality of life of our service members and their families, \nincluding: paying full replacement value for household goods lost or \ndamaged in military moves; authorizing a total of $50 million in aid to \nlocal civilian schools, including $35 million in supplemental impact \naid for schools with large numbers of military dependents, $5 million \nchildren with severe disabilities, and $10 million for schools affected \nby significant changes in military dependent students as a result of \nforce structure changes, creation of new military units, and BRAC; and \nplacing restrictions on payday loans to service members and their \nfamilies.\n  The conference report also does not include a provision contained in \nthe House Bill that would have provided that ``each [military] chaplain \nshall have the prerogative to pray according to the dictates of the \nchaplain's own conscience, except as may be limited by military \nnecessity, with any such limitation being imposed in the least \nrestrictive manner feasible.''\n  This is a lot more complicated issue than it seems at the surface. \nMilitary chaplains not only minister to members of their own faith \ngroup, they also minister to the needs of a diverse group of military \nmembers and their families, including those of other faith groups and \nthose who claim no religious faith.\n  The military services respect the rights of military chaplains to \nadhere to the tenets of their respective faiths and give them virtually \nunrestricted discretion as to the content of their religious message \nwhen performing core ecclesiastical functions, including worship \nservices, teaching, bible study, counseling, hearing confessions, \npreaching, and performing religious ceremonies. However, when \nperforming functions at mandatory military events with multi-faith \naudiences, there is a longstanding military tradition of chaplains \noffering a prayer that demonstrates sensitivity, respect, and tolerance \nfor all faiths present. Military chaplains are trained and expected to \nuse good judgment when addressing pluralistic audiences at public, non-\nworship ceremonies, and they are never required to participate in \nreligious activities inconsistent with their beliefs.\n  The Chiefs of Chaplains from each of the military services have \nadvised us that, if enacted, the House provision would limit chaplain \neffectiveness and erode unit cohesion. They are concerned that \ncommanders would no longer invite chaplains to pray at ceremonies where \nfaith specific prayers might be offensive to members of other faiths \nwho are required to participate. We have also heard from the National \nConference on Ministry to the Armed Forces, an organization that \nrepresents the vast majority of military chaplains, and numerous \nother denominational and religious organizations that support military \nchaplaincy and respect religious freedom, who oppose the House \nprovision.\n\n  The decision that this provision will not be included in the \nconference report is the right answer in light of the fact that neither \nthe Senate nor the House has held hearings on this very important and \ncomplex issue.\n  Of course, we were not able to get everything we wanted in this \nconference. For example, I am very disappointed that we were not able \nto authorize federal pricing for prescriptions filled through the \nmilitary's TRICARE retail pharmacy program.\n  Over my objections, the conferees agreed to a House provision \nregarding an existing settlement agreement between the Federal \nGovernment and two private parties regarding the removal of non-native \nanimals from a national park on Santa Rosa Island, CA. This language is \nalso strongly opposed by the two California Senators and by the Energy \nCommittee, which has jurisdiction over this matter. This provision \ndirects the Secretary of Interior not to take certain actions which \nwere not the responsibility of the Secretary in the first place. \nTherefore, while I do not believe this conference agreement changes the \nlegal obligations of the two private parties to this settlement, I \nbelieve this provision is unnecessary and misguided and that it should \nnot have been included.\n  I am also disappointed that the conference report does not include \nthe Akaka-Collins-Levin amendment on whistleblower protection. This \namendment would have addressed gaps that have developed in the \nprotection of federal employee whistleblowers since the enactment of \nthe Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989.\n  However, the conferees did agree to a number of provisions designed \nto address wasteful practices and shortcomings in DoD management. These \ninclude: a provision prohibiting contractors who perform little or no \nwork on a project from charging excessive ``pass-through'' fees to the \nGovernment; a provision prohibiting the ``parking'' of funds in a \nparticular part of the Defense budget when the money is not really \nintended to be used for that purpose; a provision requiring contract \noversight mechanisms for the acquisition of major computer systems, \nsimilar to the mechanisms already in place for the acquisition of major \nweapon systems; a provision limiting the use of cost-type contracts for \nthe acquisition of major weapon systems; and a provision requiring that \nDOD hire and train government employees, in lieu of contractor \nemployees, to perform critical acquisition functions.\n  I am also pleased that the conferees included a provision that would \nrequire a new comprehensive National Intelligence Estimate, NIE, on \nIran. This provision also includes a requirement for the President to \nsubmit a report to Congress that would fully describe the U.S. policy \non Iran.\n  The conference report also authorizes a responsible budget that tries \nto balance the need to support current military operations while \ncontinuing the modernization and transformation of our armed forces.\n  To support continuing operations in Iraq and the global war on \nterrorism, the conference report authorizes a $70\n\n[[Page S10635]]\n\nbillion bridge supplemental for fiscal year 2007. Of this amount, $23 \nbillion is devoted to ``reset'', that is, repair or replacement of Army \nand Marine Corps equipment, based on detailed requests provided by the \nservices. The supplemental also includes a separate $2.1 billion \naccount for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization, \nJIEDDO, that is dedicated to countering improvised explosive devices.\n  The conferees agreed to an important provision that was sponsored by \nSenators McCain and Byrd, with the unanimous support of the Senate, \nthat would require the President to request funds for operations in \nIraq and Afghanistan in the regular budget beginning with the fiscal \nyear 2008 budget that will be submitted next February. I strongly \nsupported this provision. This administration has misled the American \npeople far too often with respect to the war in Iraq. I am pleased that \nwe have taken a major step in this bill to at least make our budgets \nmore honest in the future by including the substantial costs we know we \nare going to incur in Iraq and Afghanistan. In fiscal year 2006, those \ncosts reached a staggering $10 billion per month. It is irresponsible \nto make decisions on spending and taxation without including these \ncosts in our budgets, and in this conference report we are putting an \nend to that practice.\n\n  With the respect to the F-22 multiyear procurement authority, the \nconferees agreed to provide authority for the Air Force to enter a \nmultiyear contract for three years, subject to a certification by the \nSecretary of Defense that the savings are ``substantial'' in view of \nhistorical multiyear contracts.\n  The conferees also adopted Senate legislation that requires the \nSecretary of Defense to initiate an independent assessment of available \nforeign and domestic active protection systems to assess the \nfeasibility of their near term and long term development and \ndeployment. Active protection systems could be placed on vehicles like \nBradleys, Strykers, and tanks to shoot down incoming threats including \nrocket propelled grenades, RPGs, and mortars. These type of weapons \nrepresent a real and growing threat to our deployed forces.\n  In the area of nonproliferation programs, I am disappointed that the \nconference report does not include a Senate provision, authored by \nSenator Lugar, to repeal all of the annual Cooperative Threat \nReduction, CTR, certification requirements. These certifications have \nlong outlived their usefulness and now only needlessly delay the CTR \nprogram. This conference report does include, however, a provision that \nwould extend certain annual waiver authorities associated with \ndestruction of Russian chemical weapons and fully funds the CTR \nprograms at the Department of Defense at the budget request of $372.1 \nmillion.\n  Finally, the conferees authorized $11.7 billion for science and \ntechnology programs that will develop technologies to transform our \nmilitary. This is an increase of $575 million over the budget request. \nThis represents 2.7 percent of the DOD budget, still unfortunately \nfalling short of the congressional and QDR goal of a 3-percent \ninvestment level.\n  On five other occasions, Senator Warner has led us as chairman in \nproducing an annual defense authorization bill for the President to \nsign. Unfortunately, because of the 6-year term limitation imposed on \ncommittee chairmen by the Republican conference, this is the sixth and \nlast defense authorization bill that Chairman Warner will shepherd \nthrough the process. He will have to step down as our chairman next \nyear, but thankfully for the Nation and the Senate and for me \npersonally, he will continue serving as a member of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee.\n  This year's process to produce a bill has been particularly difficult \nas people outside our conference sought to inject extraneous items into \nthe conference. Throughout it all, Senator Warner refused to allow such \nmatters to be added--in the face of enormous pressure.\n  We all know that Senator Warner has led a distinguished life of \npublic service. He and I came to the Senate together in 1979 and we \nhave served side by side on this committee continuously for the past \n27-plus years. Defense authorization bills enacted over that entire \nperiod have always had John Warner's positive imprint on them.\n  Historically, our committee's chairmen--men such as Richard Russell \nand John Stennis and Sam Nunn--have been guided by one principle: Do \nwhat is right for our Nation and its military members. John Warner has \nfollowed in that fine tradition and we cannot thank him enough for it. \nIt is very fitting that this bill is going to be named after my dear \nfriend and our esteemed colleague, Senator John Warner. He is truly a \nman worthy of such a great honor.\n  I was keenly disappointed when the majority leader earlier tonight \nobjected to this vital bill being acted upon. I'm hopeful that he will \nwithdraw his objection before we adjourn, for the sake of the men and \nwomen in uniform and their families.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Under the previous order, H. Con. Res. 483 is agreed to, and the \nmotion to reconsider is laid on the table.\n  The resolution (H. Con. Res. 483) reads as follows:\n\n                            H. Con.

Mr. President, I want to make a few comments on the \nvote we had earlier tonight, 80 to 19, on a bill on border fencing \nalong our southern border, where 1.1 million people were apprehended \nlast year crossing that border. We have had a few comments, pro and con \ntoday, but there hasn't been a lot of debate. It represents the fourth \ntime we voted on this issue. So we know pretty much what the debate is. \nI saw no reason to delay our departure tonight. Other matters are being \nsettled as I speak now. I think it is appropriate to take a few moments \nto comment on it.\n  No. 1, of course, the fence is not the answer. There is no one answer \nto reestablishing a legal system of immigration in America, but that \nmust be our goal. If we aspire to be a great nation, a lawful nation, \nit is absolutely critical that we have a legal system of immigration. \nWe should not reward those\n\n[[Page S10636]]\n\nwho come illegally, but we should be generous to those who choose to \ncome legally and comply with our rules.\n  We are a Nation of immigrants. We will remain a Nation of immigrants. \nWe will continue to allow people to come to our country.\n  I want to say that no one thinks that building barriers at the border \nis going to solve, by itself, our immigration problem. But it is an \nimportant step. If we have to take 10 steps to cross the goal line, \nthis is probably two of the steps necessary to get there. There is no \nneed to delay. We need to get started. It takes some time to accomplish \nit. Fences multiply the ability of our Border Patrol agents to be \nsuccessful. We have seen that on the San Diego border. We have seen \njust how well it has helped bring down crime, how well the property \nvalues have surged on both sides of the border--an area that was \nlawless, crime ridden, and drug infested is moving forward with \ncommercial development in a healthy way. That is just the way it is. \nThere is not anything wrong, hateful, or mean-spirited to say that we \nintegrated a lawful border system in America. The American people \nunderstand that.\n  Indeed, I say to my colleagues that the American people have \nunderstood fundamentally and correctly the immigration question for 40 \nyears. They have asked Congress and they have repeatedly asked \nPresidents to make sure we have a legal system of immigration. But that \nhas not been accomplished. We have not responded to those requests.\n  Now we have reached an extraordinary point in our history where we \nhave over a million people apprehended annually coming in illegally, \nand probably, according to many experts, just as many getting by who \nare not apprehended. So it is time for us to confront and fix this \nproblem.\n  Another critical step in enforcement--absolutely critical--and it is \none that we can accomplish with far more ease than a lot of people \nthink, is to create a lawful system at the workplace. It is not \ndifficult, once we set up the effective rules, to send a message to all \nAmerican businesses that they need a certain kind of identification to \nhire someone who has come into our country. If they don't have this \nlegal document, they are not entitled to be hired. This will work. Most \nbusinesses will comply immediately when they are told precisely what is \nexpected of them. But that has not been the case. They have not been \ntold what is expected of them. They, in fact, have been told if they \nask too many questions of job applicants, they can be in violation of \nthe applicant's civil rights. So lawyers tell them don't ask too many \nquestions.\n  Then you complain that they have hired illegals, and they say: They \ngave me this document, and I didn't feel like I could inquire behind \nit.\n  So it can work. If we tell our business community what is reasonably \nexpected of them, they will comply with it. That will represent a major \nleap forward in enforcement. Then we have to ask ourselves what do we \ndo about people who only want to come here to work, and we need their \nlabor? I believe we can do as Canada and many other developed nations \nhave done--create a genuine temporary worker program, a genuine \nprogram.\n  The Senate bill passed in this body that had a section called \ntemporary guestworker. But there was nothing temporary about them. They \ncould come for 3 years and bring their families and their minor \nchildren, bring their wives, stay for 3 years, and then extend for 3 \nyears, and then do it again. After 6 years or 7 years, I believe, they \ncould apply for permanent resident status, apply for a green card. Then \na few years after that, they become a citizen. How temporary is that?\n  What Canada says is you can come and work for 8 months. A television \nshow interviewed some people in Canada, and they said: I may stay 4 \nmonths or 6 months. They may come and go in the interim many times \nbecause they have an identifying card that allows them to come and go \nfor a specified period of time. That could allow us to have the surge \nin seasonal labor that we need in agriculture and in some other areas. \nBut the agricultural community and other areas that say they need \ntemporary labor have to understand that they do not get to unilaterally \nset the Nation's immigration policy just so they can have the \nimmigration level, the work level, they need. They don't have that \nright. They are not speaking for the national interest.\n  This Senate speaks for the national interest. We must set the policy. \nYes, we have a large number of people who are here illegally. How many \nof those would want to stay permanently? I don't know. I know a number \nof them would. So I think we will reach the point--hopefully, we can do \nthis next year--where we confront as a Congress that dilemma.\n  I say to my colleagues as a person who was a Federal prosecutor for \nmany years, do not ever think that you can just grant amnesty to \nsomeone who violated the law and that will not have a corrosive effect \non respect for law in our country. Granting an amnesty is a very \nserious thing. It is not something you can just do because you just \nfeel like it, or you feel that is the right thing to do. We must think \nthat through.\n  My personal view is that for people who have been here a long time \nand had a good record and have done well but came illegally, we ought \nto be able to figure out a way that they can stay here and live here. \nThey should not be given every single benefit that we give American \ncitizens, or people who come here legally; otherwise, what is the \ndifference whether you came legally or illegally? Do you see the moral \npoint here. You simply cannot do that and think it has no consequences \non the rule of law. So we can reach an agreement on that. It is within \nour grasp, I suggest, to deal with that most difficult problem of how \nto deal with people who come to our country illegally.\n  Finally, the Nation's fundamental approach to immigration is fatally \nflawed. It makes no sense. It has been wrong for many years. Today, \nonly 20 percent of the people who come into our country come in on any \nmerit-based program. Most come in on relationships with someone already \nhere. Many have come illegally and they obtained amnesty in the past. \nThey look to do that again.\n  There are many other ways that people come here. But a very small \npercentage of the people who come to our country today come here as a \nresult of having met certain qualifications that relate to education or \njob skills. That is not the right approach.\n  I have looked and met with the top Canadian officials. I met with and \ntalked with top officials of the Australian Government to talk about \ntheir program. Both of those programs, and also New Zealand and the \nUnited Kingdom, to a lesser degree, France, and other countries are \nmoving to what they call a point system. This is a system by which \napplicants are evaluated on what they bring to the nation. It is \nfounded on a simple concept that those nations have decided is \nimportant to them.\n  The concept is this: Immigration should serve the national interest. \nHow simple is that? In my committee of Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions, and in my Committee on the Judiciary, we have had a few \nhearings on this at my request in both cases. Very few Senators \nattended, frankly.\n  Repeatedly the witnesses would say: The first question you people in \nthe United States, you policymakers need to decide is: Is the \nimmigration policy you wish to establish one that furthers the national \ninterest? If you want to further the national interest, then I can give \nyou good advice. If your goal is to help poor people all over the world \nand to take the national welfare approach, then we can tell you how to \ndo that. You have to decide what your best goals are. If your goal is \nsimply to allow everyone who is a part of a family, even distant \nrelatives, to come, if that is your No. 1 goal, we can create a system \nthat does that. But fundamentally they tell us, when pressed, that an \nimmigration system should serve the national interest.\n  Professor Borjas at Harvard wrote a book, probably the most \nauthoritative book on immigration that has been written. The name of it \nis ``Heaven's Door.'' He testified at our committee hearing. He made \nreference to the fact that we have within our immigration system a \nlottery. This lottery lets 50,000 people apply to come to our country \nfrom various countries all over the world. We draw 50,000 names out, \nand they get to come into the country,\n\n[[Page S10637]]\n\nnot on merit but just pure random choice.\n  It makes sense under the idea when it was originally created, which \nwas we needed more diversity, we needed people from different \ncountries, and this would give people from different countries a chance \nto apply.\n  Professor Borjas at the Kennedy School at Harvard, himself a Cuban \nrefugee, came here at age 12, said 5 million people apply to be in that \nlot from which we would choose 50,000--5 million. So if we have 5 \nmillion applicants, I ask my colleagues, and we are attempting to serve \nthe national interest, how would we choose from that 5 million if we \ncould only select and allow in 50,000? How would we choose if we are \nserving the national interest?\n  I submit we would do what Canada does. We would say: Do you already \nspeak English? How well? Do you have education? How much? Do you have \njob skills? Are they skills that we need in Canada? How old are you? \nCanada--I think Australia also--believes that the national interest is \nserved by having younger people come because they will work longer and \nthey will pay more taxes before they go on to the Medicare and health \ncare systems in their older age.\n  Are those evil concepts? Isn't it true that we would want to have \npeople come into our country who have the best chance to succeed? Or do \nwe believe the purpose of immigration is simply to allow certain \nbusinesses that use a lot of low-skilled labor to have all the low-\nskilled labor they choose to have? A willing employer and a willing \nworker.\n  Professor Borjas says there are millions and millions of people all \nover the world who would be delighted to come here for $7 an hour, \nwould love to and would come immediately if they could.\n  I was in South America recently. They had a poll in Nicaragua that \nsaid 60 percent of the people in Nicaragua said they would come to the \nUnited States if they could. I heard there was one in Peru where 70 \npercent of the people said they would come here if they could. What \nabout all the other countries, many of them poorer? Many of them would \nhave an even greater economic advantage to come to America than those \npeople coming from Peru.\n  Obviously, more people desire to come than can come.\n  They would ask: I am sure you guys have talked about this as you \ndealt with comprehensive immigration reform; what did you all decide?\n  My colleagues, we never discuss this issue. We simply expand the \nexisting program that this Government has that has failed and only 20 \npercent are given preference. We did add a program to give a certain \nnumber of higher educated people the right to come, but our \ncalculations indicate that still only about 20 percent of the people \nwho will be coming under the bill we passed will come on under a merit-\nbased system. Canada has over 60 percent come based on merit. New \nZealand I think is even higher than that.\n  What we want to do, of course, is select people who have a chance to \nbe productive, who are going to be successful, who can benefit from the \nAmerican dream. It is so within our grasp. I actually have come to \nbelieve and am excited about the concept that we actually could do \ncomprehensive reform. We can fix our borders. We absolutely can. We \nhave already made progress. We are reaching a point where we could \ncreate a lawful system at our borders.\n  In addition to that, we can confront the very tough choices about how \nto deal with people who are here illegally. And finally, we need to \ndevelop a system for the future flow of immigrants into America.\n  I believe the columnist Charles Krauthammer said we should do like \nthe National Football League does. We ought to look around the world at \nthe millions of people who would like to come to the United States and \npick the very best draft choices we can pick, pick the ones who will \nhelp America be a winning team. It will allow people to come into this \ncountry who are most likely to be successful, who speak our language, \nwho want to be a part of this Nation and contribute to it, who have \nproven capabilities that means they can take jobs and be successful at \nthem and can assimilate themselves easily into the structure of our \nGovernment.\n  It is exciting to think that possibility is out there. Yes, we have \nbeen talking about the fence and, yes, the fence can be seen as sort of \na grim enforcement question, but it is one part of the overall effort \nthat we are participating in at this point to create a new system of \nimmigration, comprehensively different than we have ever had before, \none that serves our national interest, one that selects the people who \nwant to come here based on their ability to succeed in our country and \nbe successful and be harmonious and be able to take advantage of the \ngreat opportunities this Nation provides.\n  It is so exciting to me, but we are going to have to let go of the \nbill that got through this Senate and that the House of Representatives \nwould not even look at. The bill was nothing more than a rehash of \ncurrent law, plus amnesty. It was a very, very, very bad piece of \nlegislation. A lot of people voted against it, but it passed in this \nbody. The House would not talk about it.\n  If we would take our blinders off and if we would go back and think \nclearly about how our Nation should do immigration and talk to one \nanother, I believe we can make more progress than people realize, and \nthe American people could be proud of our system.\n  I asked the people in Canada, and I asked the people in Australia: \nHow do people feel about this? Are they happy with it? Yes, they are \nproud of it.\n  I said: What do you think about us talking about your program?\n  They said: We are proud you are looking at our program. We think it \nworks. It is a compliment to us that you think there may be some value \nin it.\n  I don't know why we never talked about that. We never had a single \nhearing in which the Canadians or Australians were asked to testify. \nThese are countries that believe in the rule of law. Both of them say \nthey have a high degree of enforcement. Yes, there are people who abuse \nthe law, but they have a legal system and it works.\n  Canada has workers who come and work for 8 months, and they go back \nhome to their families. They can work 6 months; they can work 4 months. \nThat is a temporary guest worker program. Then they have an asylum \nprogram where they take a certain number of people, like we have always \ndone, who have been persecuted and oppressed. We will continue to do \nthat. That is not a merit-based system. That is a system where we do it \nfor humanitarian reasons.\n  Fundamentally, the principle of our Nation, as we develop a new \nimmigration policy, should be to serve our national interests. I \nbelieve we have that within our grasp.\n  This step of building border barriers is important for two reasons: \nOne, it is critical to creating a lawful system. No. 2, it is critical \nto establishing credibility with the American people because they \nrightly doubt our commitment, based on history, to do the right thing \nabout immigration. They doubt that we are committed to doing the right \nthing. This is a good step to show them that we are, and then I think \nas we talk about some of these more difficult issues, we can have some \ncredibility with our people when we ask them to make some tough \ndecisions about how to handle immigration in the future.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to share these \nthoughts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10637-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10637-S10639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nA LESSON IN CHERRY-PICKING AND POLITICIZING OUR NATION'S INTELLIGENCE: \n                     THE TERRORISM NIE DECLASSIFIED\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, with the President's recent \ndeclassification of the Key Judgments of the April National \nIntelligence Estimate, NIE, on Terrorism, the American public can get \nfrom the Democrats an object lesson in perfect irony.\n  For years, the Democrats have accused the Bush administration of \ncherry-picking intelligence to lead the country to war in Iraq. Yet \nhere they are cherry-picking intelligence out of this report to make a \nmedia circus right before the upcoming election.\n  First, let me define what I mean by ``cherry-picking.'' This refers \nto a selective use of intelligence to make a politically persuasive \nargument. It is a\n\n[[Page S10638]]\n\ndeliberate misrepresentation of a larger, often ambiguous body of \nintelligence reporting.\n  From my perspective, the Democrats' politicization of our Nation's \nintelligence is not a pretty picture. NIEs are the top-line product of \nthe entire intelligence community.\n  They are supposed to be regarded as serious, substantive, consensus \nanalysis for top policymakers. NIEs are one of thousands of \nintelligence products we review on the Intelligence Committee. I am on \nthat committee, first ranking on that committee on the Republican side.\n  Please recall that the Democrats accused the Republicans and the Bush \nadministration of cherry-picking intelligence prior to the Iraq war.\n  The Senate Select Intelligence Committee's comprehensive review of \nthe prewar Iraq intelligence was concluded in July 2004 and made \navailable to the public in a detailed 500-page report. It was \nunanimously supported by Democrats and Republicans of the committee. It \nwas thorough. It pulled no punches. It was highly critical of the \nsystematic failure of our intelligence on Iraq. Our faulty \nintelligence, as the world knows, was similar to the faulty \nintelligence of all of our allied partners.\n  The committee's report clearly shows, however, that there was no \ncherry-picking of intelligence because nearly all of the intelligence \nwas bad, and there was no finished intelligence that contradicted the \nfaulty conclusions our intelligence community reached before the war.\n  Recall also that the Democrats have regularly charged the Bush \nadministration with politicizing intelligence, implying that \nintelligence was manipulated for political reasons. For example, they \nsuggested that Vice President Cheney's visit to the Central \nIntelligence Agency prior to the Iraq war pressured analysts toward \nparticular conclusions. The July 2004 report, which was based on \nhundreds of hours of interviews with all these analysts, concluded that \nno such politicization took place. The intelligence was lousy, but it \nwasn't cooked.\n  Now comes the latest little circus by many Democrats and many in the \nmedia in a prepared campaign to manipulate a fragment of a leaked \nclassified document.\n  Putting aside for the moment the underlying question of whether the \nIraq war made us safer--a point I will address shortly--the Democrats \nclaimed over the weekend and earlier this week that the NIE proved \ntheir point that the Iraq war had made the terrorists stronger and \ntherefore the United States more vulnerable.\n  Here are the sentences they quoted as proof:\n\n       We assess that the Iraq jihad is shaping a new generation \n     of terrorist leaders and operatives; perceived jihadist \n     success there would inspire more fighters to continue the \n     struggle elsewhere.\n       The Iraq conflict has become the cause celebre for \n     jihadists, breeding a deep resentment of U.S. involvement in \n     the Muslim world and cultivating supporters for the global \n     jihadist movement.\n\n  This is the sentence the Democrats quoted as proof of their critique \nof the Iraq war.\n  Let us be honest: The sentence is true. But let us be even more \nhonest--and this is distinctly where the Democrats are being \ndeliberately dishonest--the sentence is out of context and ignores \nother parts of the NIE, such as the very next sentence, which reads:\n\n       Should jihadists leaving Iraq perceive themselves, and be \n     perceived, to have failed, we judge fewer fighters will be \n     inspired to carry on the fight.\n\n  Can we be honest and admit this sentence is true as well? And can we \nrecognize that the only way we prove this second sentence is to sustain \nthe fight in Iraq until we have achieved security and stability that \ncan be maintained by the Iraqis themselves?\n  This has been a classic exercise in spin, cherry-picking, and \npoliticization of intelligence, and it stinks.\n  The Democrats spun this story all weekend, knowing that responsible \nmembers of the Bush administration and the Republican Congress could \nnot respond without participating in leaking a classified document. The \nDemocrats cherry-picked sentences and deliberately used them out of \ncontext. They conducted this exercise for purposes of supporting their \nantiwar agenda, in an example of egregious politicization of this \nNation's valuable intelligence process.\n  As my colleague on the Intelligence Committee, Senator Bond, has \nsaid:\n\n       It is time to hit the baloney button.\n\n  We are conducting a war different from any in our Nation's history. \nOne of the unique aspects of this war against global terrorism is the \nunprecedented reliance we place on our intelligence community.\n  As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I am dedicated to \nsupporting this function of our foreign policy, even when that has \nincluded criticizing systematic failures in collection and analysis, as \nwe did with our phase I report released in July 2004. Every day, we see \nexamples that the intelligence community's capabilities have improved \nas a result of the lesson learned from that review. Republicans like \nmyself have criticized the intelligence community with the focus on \nimproving it and have done our best to support it in its vital function \nin this war in which we are engaged today.\n\n  As we have just seen, Democrats cook this Nation's intelligence, \ncallously undermining its importance and function. To win a war, you \nneed will, but you also need function.\n  ``Is the U.S. safer as a result of our invasion of Iraq?'' is a \ncentral policy question, one that could have been more honestly \naddressed without an exercise in cherry-picking and cooking \nintelligence.\n  I always thought that if you have to address an argument dishonestly, \nyour position must be weak.\n  Are we safer as a result of our invasion of Iraq? There is the \nassessment of the war situation now and the strategic answer. The NIE \nis correct that the Iraq war has opened the battlefront for the global \njihadists in Iraq. We knew this before the NIE was published last \nApril, of course. And we read that last April. I have seen no Bush \nadministration official deny this. In fact, General Abizaid in \nWashington last week was blunt about this: We are battling these \njihadists in Iraq today. And when we defeat them, that defeat will be \nfelt throughout the global jihadist movement.\n  If we follow some Democrats' advice to withdraw, we will give the \nglobal jihad movement another Somalia. Our withdrawal from Somalia in \n1993 gave bin Laden his first propaganda point. He concluded that the \nAmericans are weak, vulnerable, and easily defeated.\n  As far as strategic assessment, I believe the Iraq war has made us \nsafer.\n  On September 20, 2001, the President addressed the Congress, the \nNation, and the world in his first major policy address after the \nattacks of September 11. He articulated a new antiterrorism policy, one \nthat had not existed up to that point, one that had not been put in \nplace under the previous administration.\n  From that point on, President Bush said we would go after all terror \ngroups within global reach; we would no longer wait for them to attack \nus. The President put all nations that harbor terrorist organizations \non notice. Iraq was one of these nations. Iraq did not support al-Qaida \nand was not involved in 9/11, but it had a decades' long history of \nsupporting terrorists, a view no one in Congress disputed.\n  The rationale for Iraq has been criticized and exposed, but one fact \nremains clear: When we took down the Saddam regime, from that day on, \nno regime in the world could conclude that they could harbor terrorists \nwithout risking consequences. By invading and deposing Saddam, we \ndemonstrated to the world our resolve. Had we not done so, based on the \nempty threats and actions of previous administrations, nations \nentertaining terror links could doubt our resolve. From the day we \nacted to take down Saddam, we showed the world our intent behind our \nwords. Today, no Nation can doubt this. And in this very real sense, \nAmerica has been made safer. We need to finish the job in Iraq.\n  As I have said, that requires the functions of our foreign policy \napparatus to be fully supported--diplomacy, military, economic, and \nintelligence. I am dedicated to providing this support, positively but \nnot uncritically. We also need will. After last weekend's episode of \ncooking intelligence for political purposes, I question what such an \nexercise is intended to achieve when it comes to maintaining our will.\n\n[[Page S10639]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10637-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10637-S10639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nA LESSON IN CHERRY-PICKING AND POLITICIZING OUR NATION'S INTELLIGENCE: \n                     THE TERRORISM NIE DECLASSIFIED\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, today I recognize the accomplishments and \nefforts of Bill Woolf, a longtime Senate staffer and tireless advocate \nfor Alaska's interests. Bill will retire at the conclusion of this \nCongress and move to his family home on Marrowstone Island in \nWashington State.\n  For nearly 30 years, Bill has been an advocate for and friend to \nAlaska's fishermen. A former resident of Juneau, he began work in 1977 \nat the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. In 1983, Bill moved on to \nthe Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute, where he became familiar with \nour State's fishing industry. Bill quickly established a far-reaching \nbond with those affected by and working in this important industry.\n  For the past 20 years, Bill has worked in the U.S. Senate as a \nlegislative aide--serving on the staffs of both Frank Murkowski and \nSenator Lisa Murkowski. Staff members like Bill are the backbone of \nthis institution. They meet and work with the administration, State \nofficials, and constituents, and they help those elected to Congress \npursue initiatives which will serve their State and our Nation well.\n  During the two decades that he has worked in the Senate, Bill has \nbeen a vigorous advocate for the people and communities of Alaska. \nThose who have worked with him have the deepest respect for his \ncommitment and contributions.\n  On behalf of our Alaska congressional delegation and all Alaskans, I \nextend our appreciation to Bill for his service. We wish him the best \nin his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10639-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS INVESTMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I come to the floor to join more than 35 \nof our colleagues in support of the National Competitiveness Investment \nAct.\n  Our country's success is the direct result of our advancements in \nscience and technology. Throughout our history, our scientists and \nengineers have created new industries--and their efforts have ensured \nour country's competitiveness in the global economy. Two key reports \nnow raise serious concerns about our ability to continue this \ntradition.\n  The ``Innovate America'' report by the Council on Competitiveness and \nthe National Academies' ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' report, \nalso known as the ``Augustine Report,'' both conclude advancements in \nscience and technology are our country's best hope for the future. They \nidentify serious problems with our efforts in these areas. Sadly, this \nweek the World Economic Forum announced our country has dropped from \nfirst to sixth place in its ``global competitiveness index.''\n  Our comprehensive legislation addresses several of these issues, and \nall of us owe a great debt to Senator Ensign, who has shown tremendous \nleadership in the drafting of this bill. As the new chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, I asked Senator Ensign to chair our Subcommittee on \nTechnology, Innovation, and Competitiveness. Over the past 2 years, he \nhas held a series of hearings on this issue. He also introduced S. \n2802, the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act, which the \nCommerce Committee passed without opposition in May. Senator Ensign has \nworked on a bipartisan basis with our colleagues on the HELP and Energy \nCommittees.\n  This act is the culmination of these efforts. It will help our \ncountry remain competitive by increasing Federal investment in basic \nresearch and improving student opportunities in science, technology, \nengineering, and math. This bill also develops the infrastructure we \nneed to foster innovation in the 21st century.\n  While this bill alone will not solve all of our challenges, it is an \nimportant first step.\n  I urge each of our colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and vote \nin favor of its passage.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Child Custody Protection Act prohibits \ntaking a minor child across State lines for an abortion in \ncircumvention of a State law requiring parental notification or consent \nin that child's abortion. And it gives the victims of our imperfect \nlegal system a means of restitution.\n  This legislation also protects the integrity of State parental \nnotification laws, and helps ensure that they are honored. Without it, \nState laws regarding parental notification and consent for a minor's \nabortion can be flouted with impunity.\n  Right now, some abortion clinics even advertise to minors living in \nneighboring States with parental notice and consent laws.\n  Right now, we are increasing our pregnant minors' vulnerability to \nhealth complications. Patients receiving abortions at out-of-state \nclinics are less likely to return for followup care. And a teenager who \nhas an out-of-state abortion without her parents' knowledge or consent \nis even more unlikely to tell them she is having complications.\n  At its core, this bill is about protecting a minor's health and \nprotecting her from exploitation. It is about respecting and honoring \nState laws. And it is about ensuring parental involvement in the life-\nor-death decision of their child.\n  Forty-four States have already seen the grim irony in the fact that \nteenage students can't go on a field trip or receive aspirin from the \nschool nurse without parental consent, but a young girl can flout State \nlaws and have an abortion--a major surgical procedure--without \ninforming her parents.\n  This bill helps parental notification and consent laws remain \nenforceable and meaningful, and it keeps in place all judicial bypass \noptions and waiver provisions that States have enacted to accommodate \nyoung girls who come from troubled or abusive homes.\n  This simple, straightforward legislation was already passed by the \nSenate in July by a vote of 65 to 34. It received overwhelming \nbipartisan support. I am pleased that 14 of my Democratic colleagues, \nincluding the Senate minority leader, chose to join me and its sponsor, \nSenator Ensign, in support of this important bill. And I believe this \nlegislation was further improved by the adoption of the Boxer-Ensign \namendment, which strengthened provisions pertaining to minors who are \ncaught in abusive home situations.\n  So it was a disappointment when this legislation was blocked from \ngoing to conference by a parliamentary maneuver by my colleagues from \nacross the aisle. On multiple occasions, we sought to go to conference \nwith the House on this legislation, only to have this routine \nprocedural move obstructed.\n  I would like to commend the work of the bill's sponsor, my colleague \nJohn Ensign. I am glad that the House chose to pick up this legislation \nand pass it with instructions.\n  I believe it is important to pass this legislation, which has the \napproval of around 80 percent of the American public and is supported \non both sides of the aisle. It protects underage minors. It respects \nand protects parental involvement in the life-or-death decisions of \ntheir child. And it prevents the violation of State laws. It should not \nbe allowed to be blocked. I hope my colleagues will join me in voting \nfor S. 403, the Child Custody Protection Act, and passing this long-\nobstructed, overwhelmingly supported, commonsense legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10639-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10639-S10640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATO FREEDOM CONSOLIDATION ACT OF 2006\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for more than 50 years, the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization has served as a force for stability, security, and \npeace in Europe. It remains the foundation of security on the Continent \nand the cornerstone of U.S. engagement in Europe. Today it is the key \ninstitution helping to secure a Europe that is whole, free, and at \npeace.\n  Not only is it the most successful alliance in history, but NATO has \nalso contributed to the democratic transition of our former adversaries \nin Central and Eastern Europe by fostering the development of new, \nstrong, and democratic allies capable of contributing to our common \nsecurity goals. NATO's enlargement over the past decade has \nstrengthened the strongest alliance in history and helped spread \ndemocracy and liberty. For this reason, it is essential that we keep \nthe door to NATO accession open for others.\n  Today, I am proud to introduce the NATO Freedom Consolidation Act of \n2006, along with Senators Lugar,\n\n[[Page S10640]]\n\nBiden, Smith, and McCain. This legislation expresses the Senate's \nsupport for the accession of Albania, Croatia, Georgia, and Macedonia \nto NATO.\n  I welcome the progress made by these countries in implementing the \npolitical, economic, and military reforms needed to qualify for NATO \nmembership. Each of these countries has made substantive contributions \nto peace and stability in the region and has expressed a desire for \ncloser affiliation with this institution.\n  Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia have already made tremendous strides \nin implementing their National Programs under NATO's Membership Action \nPlan. The MAP remains the key vehicle for NATO to review and assess the \nreadiness of each aspirant for full membership. I am confident that \nthese three countries will continue to progress toward the goals \npursued through the MAP, and I look forward to future reports of each \ncountry's progress.\n  Georgia is also coordinating its reform efforts with NATO members to \nmeet the criteria for eventual membership in the Alliance. NATO \nrecently announced the launching of an intensified dialogue with the \nGeorgian Government. The United States stands ready to assist the \nGeorgian people as they continue their reform efforts.\n  In addition to expressing the Congress's support for their eventual \nNATO membership, this legislation also designates Albania, Croatia, \nGeorgia, and Macedonia as eligible to receive assistance under the NATO \nParticipation Act of 1994. To underscore this commitment, it authorizes \nsecurity assistance in the amount of $3.2 million for Albania, $3 \nmillion for Croatia, $10 million for Georgia, and $3.6 million for \nMacedonia.\n  Previous rounds of NATO enlargement have shown that the expansion of \nthis great alliance benefits not only the new members but the alliance \nitself. Albania, Croatia, Georgia, and Macedonia stand to gain as much \nfrom NATO membership as the current Allies do from their accession.\n  The United States cannot build a safer and better world alone. The \nsupport of our NATO allies and the strengthening of the alliance are \nessential in the global war on terrorism. The alliance will be critical \nin successfully dealing with the mutual challenges we will face in the \nyears ahead.\n  The United States will continue to work with these countries to \ninstitute the reforms necessary for NATO membership. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bipartisan legislation. And I look forward \nto the day when Albania, Croatia, Georgia, and Macedonia become \nAmerica's NATO allies and the most successful alliance in history \nbecomes even stronger.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10640-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MR. THOMAS KUSTER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndedicated first responder, Mr. Thomas Kuster. A former Louisville fire \nchief, Mr. Kuster made Kentucky his home after being stationed with the \nArmy at Fort Knox. He began his service to the Commonwealth of Kentucky \nby joining the Louisville Fire Department in 1957; he quickly rose \nthrough its ranks and was appointed fire chief in 1976.\n  While serving as Jefferson County judge-executive, I was pleased to \nname Mr. Kuster to head the county's fire protection in 1980. Years \nlater, he would finish his long career of public service as \nLouisville's public safety director, supervising the city's fire and \npolice departments, EMS, and health programs.\n  Earlier this month, Mr. Kuster passed away, and the Commonwealth of \nKentucky lost a loyal public servant. The Louisville Courier-Journal \npublished an article highlighting Mr. Kuster's career and dedication to \nthe safety of his fellow man. I ask that the full article be printed in \nthe Congressional Record and that the entire Senate join me in paying \nrespect to this honored Kentuckian.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Sept. 12, 2006]\n\n           Thomas Kuster, Former Louisville Fire Chief, Dies\n\n                            (By Paula Burba)\n\n       Retired Louisville Fire Chief Thomas Kuster, who also \n     served as Louisville's public safety director and Jefferson \n     County fire protection administrator, died Saturday at \n     Baptist Hospital East: He was 69.\n       ``Tom was a fireman's fireman, a true gentleman who cared \n     about public safety. He dedicated his life to protecting the \n     people of Louisville,'' Louisville Mayor Jerry Abramson said \n     in a statement yesterday.\n       A native of Newark, Ohio, Kuster was stationed at Fort Knox \n     for three years and decided to stay in Kentucky. He joined \n     the Louisville Fire Department in 1957 shortly after leaving \n     the Army. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1964, captain in \n     1966, district chief in 1970 and assistant chief five years \n     later.\n       He was appointed fire chief in 1976 by Mayor Harvey Sloane \n     and served in that position until 1979, years that included \n     the last strike by the city's firefighters.\n       ``He held things together,'' said Capt. Paul Routon, \n     current president of the firefighters Local 345. ``I think he \n     was the right guy at the time for it. When we came back to \n     work, his stance was `Let's put this behind us and move \n     forward.' I think he did it.''\n       ``Philosophically, I'm management,'' Kuster said in July \n     1978 when firefighters had finally voted to end the 95-hour \n     strike--during which he had slept about six hours and \n     responded to fire runs with other nonunion supervisors and \n     members of the National Guard. At the same time, Kuster said, \n     ``I understand, or feel like I understand their [striking \n     firefighters'] position.''\n       City officials praised his leadership, while firefighters \n     on the picket lines shook his hand.\n       ``He didn't demand respect. He knew how to get respect,'' \n     Assistant Chief Randy Winstead said yesterday.\n       Winstead described Kuster as ``real regimental, real \n     serious'' and credited Kuster's acceptance of ``social \n     change'' as one way ``he turned the fire department around.''\n       ``You look at (photos of) all the other chiefs,'' Winstead \n     said, ``they all look like your grandfather. Except there's \n     Tom with sideburns and long hair.''\n       He was also the first chief to allow firefighters to wear \n     T-shirts instead of uniform shirts inside the firehouse, \n     Winstead said.\n       Kuster resigned as fire chief in 1979 after successfully \n     resisting several efforts, according to newspaper stories, by \n     Mayor William Stansbury's administration to demote several \n     assistant chiefs for what he saw as political reasons.\n       Kuster worked in administration at the Louisville Water Co. \n     until then County Judge Mitch McConnell chose him to head the \n     county's fire protection in 1980.\n       In 1983, Kuster accepted a job as fire chief in Raleigh, \n     N.C., where he served until 1985.\n       He returned to Louisville as the first department head \n     named by Mayor-elect Abramson in 1985. He was appointed \n     Louisville's public safety director, overseeing the police \n     and fire departments, EMS and health programs. He held that \n     position until 1993.\n       ``Louisville will always be grateful for Tom's public \n     service,'' Abramson said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10640-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10640-S10641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LAJUANA WILCHER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize October as \nDomestic Violence Awareness Month. By bringing attention to this \nserious issue, I hope that we can make progress to break the cycle of \nviolence.\n  Not long ago, in communities across Nevada and our Nation, domestic \nviolence was a problem that was kept silent. Fortunately, by raising \nawareness of this issue, we are making great progress in breaking that \nsilence. Today, we can see notable progress in recognizing this problem \nas an epidemic that affects every community. Still, there is much work \nto do to heal the wounds and end the violence.\n  Each year, more than 32 million Americans are affected by physical, \nsexual, or psychological harm. Sadly, much of this harm occurs at the \nhands of those they should be able to trust the most--current and \nformer partners and spouses. Twenty-nine percent of women and 22 \npercent of men will directly experience harm from domestic violence \nduring their lifetime. Many experts think that these numbers are \ndrastically underrepresentative as well because many victims do not \nreport these crimes.\n  That is why we must do more. We can address the problem by supporting \nshelters and organizations with our financial resources and our time. \nIn Nevada, for instance, domestic violence centers report lengthy \nwaiting lists--for space in the shelter, for treatment programs for \nbatters, and for victim counseling. Many shelters lack sufficient \nprovisions like personal care products, clothing, and children's and \nmedical supplies.\n  We must also dispel the myths surrounding domestic violence. It does \nnot discriminate. Its perpetrators hide behind many different faces. \nIts victims answer to many different names. Domestic violence crosses \nall racial, economic, and societal barriers. It affects the strong as \nwell as the weak.\n  Of course, my home State of Nevada is not immune from the tragic \neffects of domestic violence. I would relate the story of Ana Outcalt, \nwho was murdered at the hands of her boyfriend, even after she had \nobtained a restraining order against him. Ana's sister, Maria, tells \nthis story whenever she gets the chance in the hope that she may be \nable to help others.\n  I am proud to report that many other individuals and organizations in \nNevada are working passionately this month to increase understanding of \nthis devastating problem. On October 12, 2006, for example, Safe Nest \nwill be holding an interfaith candlelight vigil in Las Vegas to \ncelebrate survivors of domestic violence and remember its victims like \nAna Outcalt. On October 21, 2006, the Family Development Foundation \nwill be hosting its Community United for Healthy Families event, which \nis open to the public free of charge. On October 23, 2006, S.A.F.E. \nHouse in Henderson, NV, is holding its annual golf tournament with all \nproceeds benefiting the organization.\n  I have been a longtime supporter of legislation aimed at eradicating \nviolence from our Nation's homes, including the Violence Against Women \nAct. But I encourage Members of this body and Americans nationwide to \ndo more. We should all view Domestic Violence Month as an opportunity \nto help prevent this problem.\n  Today, I am pleased to recognize Domestic Violence Month and the \nefforts of many organizations across Nevada who work to stop the \nviolence in our communities. Together, we can make a difference on this \nimportant issue and break the cycle of violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10641-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NEVADA NORTHERN RAILWAY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the centennial of \nthe Nevada Northern Railway. September 29 marks the 100-year \nanniversary of the completion of the railway from Cobre to Ely, NV. \nNumerous events are planned at the Nevada Northern Railway Museum this \nweekend to commemorate this special day, including a reenactment of the \ndriving of the Copper spike, which originally signaled the completion \nof the Nevada Northern Railway to Ely, NV.\n  Nevada's early growth as a State would not have been possible without \nour Nation's mighty railroads. Towns like Ely changed from sparse camps \nto real towns when tracks were laid into areas that were previously \naccessibly only by horse or on foot. In 1904, the Nevada Consolidated \nCopper Company brought Nevada Northern Railway to life in order to move \nvaluable copper ore that had been discovered in the region. And with \nthat new connection to the outside world, a new chapter began in the \nlife of Ely and of all the communities in eastern Nevada.\n  During its 77 years of service the Nevada Northern Railway carried \nore, passengers and express deliveries between Ely, Cobre and McGill, \nbut in 1983 the operation was closed and the railway stood still. Since \nthat time, the people of Ely have worked to preserve this unique part \nof their history. Through the efforts of countless volunteers and staff \nthey have turned this once vacated railway complex into a unique \nenterprise and popular destination for railroad enthusiasts and history \nbuffs alike.\n  One of the most distinct aspects of the Nevada Northern Railway is \nthat the original buildings, equipment, rolling stock and the majority \nof the company's early paper records still survive today. Walking \nthrough the Machine Shop and Engine House one can still find safety \nsigns and employee notices that were posted on the wall duiing the \npresidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n  I was so pleased, Mr. President, to see the Nevada Northern Railway \ndesignated as a National Historic Landmark this week--just in time for \nthe centennial celebration. This designation is the highest such \nrecognition accorded by our Nation to historic sites and will place the \nNevada Northern Railway in distinguished company. This recognition is \nwell deserved.\n  I thank all those who have made this listing possible--the National \nPark Service, Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne, the staff and \nvolunteers for the Nevada Northern Railway, the people of Ely, Ron \nJames, the Nevada State Historic Preservation Officer, and many others.\n  The Northern Nevada Railway is an incredible asset for Nevada and the \nNation. Hundreds of people will gather in Ely this weekend to talk \nabout the past of this great site and to lay plans for the future. I \nwish them well, and I share their appreciation for this incredible \npiece of Nevada's history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10641-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10641-S10642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMMENDING CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERT E. ROSE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an exceptional \nmember of my community and a close friend, Nevada Supreme Court Chief \nJustice Robert E. Rose. Justice Rose has been a tremendous asset to \nNevada as a longstanding member of our legal community and, for the \npast 18 years, a Justice of the Nevada Supreme Court.\n  Justice Rose was recently recognized for his outstanding commitment \nto civil liberties. The American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada \npresented Chief Justice Rose with the Emilie Wanderer Civil Libertarian \nof the Year Award. The award, named after one of the first women \nadmitted to the Nevada Bar Association, is given in honor of career \nachievement in the area of civil liberties and reflects the collective \ndecision of representatives of Nevada's criminal defense, civil \nliberties, civil rights attorneys, and civil rights activists.\n  Chief Justice Rose is a worthy recipient of this award, and it is \nfitting that he should be recognized for his accomplishments to promote \njustice in Nevada. Serving three times as Chief Justice of the Nevada \nSupreme Court, he has a reputation in the legal community and on the \nCourt as a reformer. Among the ways Justice Rose promoted the rule of \nlaw in Nevada, are the Nevada Jury Improvement Commission and the Blue \nRibbon Judicial Assessment Commission. The Assessment Commission \nconducted a broad study of the judicial system and recommended \nimprovements; many of those improvements have greatly advanced the \nNevada justice system.\n  During his legal career in Nevada, spanning from his days as a law \nclerk for the Nevada Supreme Court to his present position as a three-\nterm chief justice of the court, Justice Rose has had a profound impact \non Nevada. He was my successor as Nevada's lieutenant governor, and his \nwork presiding\n\n[[Page S10642]]\n\nover the Nevada Senate was outstanding. His efforts as a judge to \nimprove our legal system and his pursuit of fairness and justice have \nbenefited every individual in my State.\n  In closing, I feel privileged to have Bob Rose as a friend. I \nappreciate all that he has done for Nevada, and know that he will \ncontinue working to protect the rights of the citizens of our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10642-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING THE NEVADA NEWSPAPER HALL OF FAME\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the newest members of \nthe Nevada Newspaper Hall of Fame. This month, the Nevada Press \nAssociation inducted Frank, Tony, and Ted Hughes into the Hall of Fame \nfor their contributions to journalism in Nevada.\n  For more than 75 years, the Mineral County Independent News has \nprovided the small town of Hawthorne with valuable news and information \nabout their community. For more than 50 of those 75 years, the Hughes \nbrothers have used their skill for journalism and hometown pride to \nmake the Independent News thrive.\n  Each of the Hughes brothers started at the Independent News at an \nearly age. Tony Hughes was a paperboy. He would later sweep floors and \nfold papers on the weekends. Soon after his graduation from high \nschool, Tony was hired full time.\n  While Tony was the first member of the Hughes family to join the \npaper, his brothers would soon follow. Frank and Ted Hughes joined Tony \nto help run the printing presses, sell advertisements and shoot \nphotographs. Today, the brothers manage the day-to-day operations of \nthe Independent News, and each is responsible for writing stories and \nreporting on the Community.\n  As I have expressed, the Independent News is a true family business. \nThe paper has a total of four employees. Frank, Tony, and Ted are \nhelped by Heidi Bunch, a receptionist who manages the office.\n  In an age of large media conglomerates and corporate news, it is \nrefreshing to get the local community angle from the Independent News. \nEvery Thursday, the residents of Hawthorne look to the Independent News \nto read about community events at local churches, the American Legion, \nand Schurz Elementary. Subscribers can also read about the local \nSerpents' football or basketball game as well as view important \nannouncements about the Mineral County school system.\n  One of the most interesting features to me, though, is the paper's \n``Reflections on the Past.'' There you can view a summary of the events \nin Hawthorne from 20,50, and even 70 years ago. It is an amazing \ncollection of Northern Nevada's rich culture and history.\n  All of this success is a direct result of the Hughes family. Without \ntheir hard work and dedication, this local paper might not be in \nexistence today. I am pleased that Tony, Frank, and Ted Hughes have \nbeen recognized for their excellence in journalism, and I am proud to \nhave the opportunity to pay tribute to them before the Senate today. I \nlook forward to continuing to read the Independent News for years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10642-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10642-S10643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DARFUR PEACE AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for over 3 years, genocide has been the \norder of the day in Darfur. For nearly as long, from pulpits, from \nstreet corners, from the world's editorial pages, from the floor of \nCongress, from the rostrum of the United Nations, and from the White \nHouse, people have decried the killing. But we haven't stopped it.\n  Today Darfur is on the edge of an abyss, teetering on the rim of even \ngreater catastrophe. Unknown numbers have been killed, raped, and \nbutchered. Millions of people have been driven from their homes. An \nestimated half a million people are beyond the reach of humanitarian \naid today.\n  Humanitarian groups themselves are under attack and many are pulling \nback.\n  The Khartoum Government is reportedly engaging in indiscriminate \nbombing and massing forces in the region.\n  The U.N. Security Council has passed a resolution authorizing a \n20,000 person peacekeeping force, but the Khartoum Government continues \nto reject it and to deny the deaths of hundreds of thousands of its \ncitizens and endanger and threaten hundreds of thousands of others.\n  Now all of us who have spoken out have an obligation to do what we \ncan to make that peacekeeping mission a reality, to help bring an end \nto genocide.\n  For the third time now, the Senate has passed a Darfur Peace and \nAccountability Act. I was an original cosponsor of the first of these \nbills and continue to support and work toward enactment of this \nimportant legislation.\n  This bill will impose sanctions against individuals responsible for \ngenocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity; will support \nmeasures for the protection of civilians and humanitarian operations; \nand will support peace efforts in the Darfur region.\n  Those efforts are in grave jeopardy. The hopes to see the Darfur \nPeace Agreement between the Khartoum Government and one of the \nopposition groups implemented, enforced, and expanded have not been \nfulfilled.\n  We must do all that we can to ensure that the peacekeeping mission \nauthorized by the nations of the world through the United Nations under \nU.N. Security Resolution 2706 is deployed as soon as possible. This \nmission will build on the efforts of the African Union and will include \nAfrican forces at its core.\n  The Darfur Peace and Accountability Act supports these measures. \nConsistent with the goals of this bill, a number of States have already \nacted to do their part to stop genocide.\n  My home State of Illinois was the first to enact a law suspending \nState investment in companies that conduct business in Sudan or with \nthe Sudanese Government. The law mandates the divestment from all \nIllinois State Pension Systems of securities issued by any company \ndoing business in Sudan and prohibits the State from investing in \nforeign government bonds of Sudan.\n  Illinois is following a tradition established during the campaign \nagainst apartheid in South Africa. Like that campaign, the Illinois law \nis a public expression that the citizens of my State and others that \nhave passed similar legislation do not want to be party to supporting a \nforeign government that preys upon its own people. It is both symbolic \nand very tangible: the people of Illinois are choosing how they will \ninvest their money. That is an act very much within their rights, and I \nsalute their efforts.\n  Passage of the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act is an important \nand overdue step. But we must do more to ensure that the United Nations \npeacekeeping mission is implemented: the people of Darfur need UN boots \non the ground, and the world must live up to its promises to end the \ngenocide.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Because Senator Durbin has hit the major points, I will \nsimply say that the atrocities in Darfur are a moral and humanitarian \nemergency, and the people of the United States should be searching for \neffective tools to help end this violence and bloodshed. While not the \nonly answer, I believe that divestment by individual States can be a \npart of the solution--it certainly was so during the fight to end \napartheid in South Africa.\n  I strongly support the provision in the House-passed bill on this \nissue. My sense is that there was bipartisan, bicameral support for \nthis provision. But because of the objections of a few key members of \nCongress, this provision was dropped in the interest of passing the \nDarfur Peace and Accountability Act, which I believe has some important \nprovisions, before the Congress recesses at the end of this month.\n  I am wondering if the senior Senator from Illinois, who is also the \nAssistant Democratic Leader, shares this view and if he could comment \non this issue.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree with the junior Senator from Illinois. There is a \nvery powerful commitment in both Houses to take a meaningful stand \nagainst the genocide in Sudan. State governments, universities, and \nother institutions from coast to coast have passed divestment measures. \nThose voices have been heard in Congress, and I agree there is strong \nbicameral, bipartisan support for divestment, but that no single \nprovision could be allowed to jeopardize passage of this important \nlegislation, given the situation on the ground in Darfur.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I thank the senior Senator from Illinois. As Senator \nDurbin\n\n[[Page S10643]]\n\noutlined, the State of Illinois has a long and proud history on the \nissue of divestment. I know that we will both continue to engage to \npush our government and the international community to do all it can to \nhalt the violence in Darfur and, as part of our efforts, search to \nenact divestment language into law. I hope to draw upon the support, \njust mentioned by Senator Durbin, in pushing this measure forward over \nthe coming months.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10643-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CONGRATULATIONS, TERRY SAUVAIN, THE ``MAN FROM NOTRE DAME''\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, every year, the University of Notre Dame \npresents its annual Rev. John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C., Award to one of its \nalumni for extraordinary accomplishment in the field of public service. \nThis prestigious award, which was established in 1985, is named in \nhonor of the University's 14th president, the Rev. John J. Cavanaugh.\n  I am most pleased and proud to announce that the 2006 Cavanaugh Award \nis being presented to one of the Senate's very own, Mr. Terrence E. \nSauvain, the minority staff director of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  Terry graduated from Notre Dame in 1963. He is tremendously proud to \nbe a graduate of that great university. In fact, I have often referred \nto him as ``the man from Notre Dame.'' Notre Dame is the university \nthat has given us such American legends as Knute Rockne, George Gipp, \nand the Four Horsemen. Now, up there with them on Notre Dame's roll of \nhonor will be Terry Sauvain.\n  After graduating from Notre Dame, and earning a master's degree from \nGeorge Washington University, Terry worked for several Federal \nagencies, including the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. \nDepartment of Health, Education, and Welfare.\n  In 1973, Terry worked as a clerk on the DC Appropriations \nSubcommittee in the service of Senator Birch Bayh, and that launched \nhis remarkable career on this important Senate committee. He has \nperformed in a number of capacities on the Appropriations Committee, \nincluding serving as the majority staff director, when I was chairman \nbetween 2001-2003. Terry is only 14th person to hold that position \nsince the creation of the Appropriations Committee in 1867.\n  I have been indeed fortunate to have Terry on my staff for so many \nyears. In every task I have asked him to undertake, including 2 years \nof service as the Secretary to the minority leader, Terry has performed \nhis duties with courtesy, dedication, efficiency, and diligence. In \nevery position, he has gone above and beyond the call of duty in \nperforming the work of the Senate, and for that, I am truly grateful.\n  His outstanding service to the Senate has earned him a variety of \nhonors and recognitions. A few years ago, he was awarded an honorary \ndoctorate of humane letters from Wheeling Jesuit University in West \nVirginia. Last year, he received the Nyumbant Medallion of Hope for his \nwork in assisting me in the humanitarian fight to bring relief to \nchildren with HIV/AIDS in Africa. He is a perennial selection to Roll \nCall's ``Fabulous Fifty'' list of top congressional staffers.\n  In addition to his work in the Senate, Terry served our country for \nmore than 30 years--1963-1994--in the US Coast Guard, where he attained \nthe rank of captain. Once again, he has been the recipient of various \nhonors. He has earned the National Guard's Eagle Award for his role in \nthe U.S. Coast Guard-U.S. National Guard Counter-Drug Program, and the \nCoast Guard's Meritorious Service Medal.\n  I have always maintained that, ``there are three things that drive \nTerry Sauvain: his family, his service to our country . . . and Notre \nDame.'' Now Terry receives this well-deserved, prestigious award from \nhis beloved alma mater. I know he is thrilled. I am thrilled for him \nfor his lovely wife of 38 years, Veronica, and their three children, \nMarie Robertson, Catherine, and Terry, Jr.\n  Mr. President, I sincerely thank the University of Notre Dame for \nhonoring Terry for his years of dedicated public service to the Senate \nand to our country. And I congratulate him for being the recipient of \nthis distinguished award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10643-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO GENERAL MICHAEL HAGEE\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to GEN \nMichael W. Hagee, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, as he prepares to \nrelinquish the helm of the Corps and retire to private life after more \nthan 38 years of selfless service to our Nation as a U.S. Marine.\n  Mike Hagee was well prepared for leadership. Raised in \nFredericksburg, TX, as the son of a Navy veteran, General Hagee \nreceived an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy. After graduating \nwith distinction, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1968. \nGeneral Hagee also holds a master of science degree in electrical \nengineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, a master of arts \ndegree in National Security and Strategic Studies from the Naval War \nCollege, and is a graduate of the Marine Corps Command and Staff \nCollege.\n  General Hagee is a Marine's marine. As a battle-tested infantry \nofficer, he served as an infantry platoon and company commander in \nVietnam, a battalion commander, Marine expeditionary unit commander, \nand as the commanding general of the First Marine Division and the \nFirst Marine Expeditionary Force. From the fire-swept rice paddies of \nVietnam to Operation Iraqi Freedom, his keen vision and steadfast \nleadership have set the standard for future generations of marines. In \naddition to these commands, General Hagee's professional career has \nincluded a wide variety of other command and staff assignments \nincluding two tours of duty instructing at the U.S. Naval Academy and a \ntour in the Office of the Director of Central Intelligence.\n  General Hagee's impeccable service and brave leadership are also \nreflected in the awards he has received throughout his career. His \npersonal decorations include the Defense Distinguished Service Medal \nwith palm, Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit with two \nGold Stars, Bronze Star with Combat ``V,'' Defense Meritorious Service \nMedal, Meritorious Service Medal with one Gold Star, Navy Achievement \nMedal with one Gold Star, the Combat Action Ribbon, and the National \nIntelligence Distinguished Service Medal.\n  In early 2003, General Hagee became the 33rd Commandant of a Marine \nCorps that was fully engaged in the global war on terror. Since then, \nmany of us in these Chambers have had the privilege to work with \nGeneral Hagee on matters of great importance to our Nation's defense. \nThe Marine Corps' professionalism, adaptability, and excellence as they \noperate across the full spectrum of conflict are a testament to his \nvision and exemplary leadership.\n  I know that a grateful Nation shares my admiration for the general--a \ncourageous leader whose discerning wisdom and deep sense of duty have \nbeen a linchpin to the security of this Nation during a truly \nchallenging time--we have been fortunate in having him as the \nCommandant of our Corps of Marines. I am confident that my colleagues \njoin me in expressing the gratefulness of the U.S. Senate, as well as \nthanking his wife Silke and their children for the years they have \nshared him with his country. Godspeed, General Hagee we wish you well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10643-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10643-S10645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, most American families have lost ground in \nthe Bush economy and are working harder than ever to keep up with \nrising living expenses.\n  The administration is trying to paint a rosy picture of the economy, \nbut the American people know better. They know that the President's \npolicies are not working for them.\n  Despite 4 years of economic expansion, job growth has been modest, \nwages are failing to keep pace with inflation, real incomes are \nfalling, household debt is rising, employer-provided health insurance \ncoverage is declining, and private pensions are in jeopardy.\n  Slow job growth and stagnant wages during the Bush administration \nhave depressed families' incomes. Adjusted for inflation, median \nhousehold income in 2005 was 2.7 percent lower than it was in 2000 a \nloss of nearly $1,300 during President Bush's time in office.\n\n[[Page S10644]]\n\n  Strong productivity growth has translated into higher profits for \nbusinesses, but not more take-home pay for average workers. Wages, the \nmost important source of income for most families, have not kept pace \nwith skyrocketing costs for many living expenses and many households \nare sending more family members to work in order to maintain their \ncurrent living standards. This trend is likely to continue, since \nworkers may find it even harder to get pay raises now that economic \ngrowth and job creation have begun to slow.\n  Indeed, as a recent Washington Post editorial observed: ``[T]he \nrecent phenomenon of wages falling even during good times is disturbing \nand exceptional.'' Mr. President, I would like to enter the entire \nWashington Post editorial from September 4, 2006, into the Record, and \nnote that the editorial goes on to say: ``So whereas past presidents \ncould declare that a rising tide lifted all boats, Mr. Bush cannot \nhonestly do so.''\n  Higher prices for gasoline, college education, and medical care are \nsqueezing the take-home pay of workers. College tuition is up 44 \npercent; health insurance premiums are up 87 percent; and the price of \ngasoline was only $1.45 per gallon when the President took office.\n  A recent survey by Lake Research found that 3 out of 10 workers have \ntaken on debt for necessities like food, utility costs, and gasoline. \nThat is shocking on its face, but not surprising when you learn that \nhousehold debt hit a record high this year. Average household debt has \nincreased by more than $26,000 since 2000, from about $75,400 to \n$101,700 per household. For the first time since the Great Depression, \nthe Nation registered a negative personal savings rate last year. Far \ntoo many Americans are forced to spend more than they earn just to get \nby.\n  Sadly, the administration has made no real progress against the \nrising tide of poverty in America. Nearly 5\\1/2\\ and a half million \nmore Americans have fallen into poverty since President Bush took \noffice--37 million Americans are now living in poverty, including 13 \nmillion children.\n  We are the richest Nation in the world and yet more than 1 in 6 \nAmerican children lives in poverty. The number of poor children has \nincreased by more than 11 percent during the first 5 years of the Bush \nadministration, but the number of children receiving temporary \nassistance for needy families, TANF, has declined by 15.5 percent over \nthe same time period, according to the Department of Health and Human \nServices.\n  So while the President stumps for more tax cuts for people who don't \nneed them, the basic needs of millions of children go unmet. Even after \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita put the spotlight on this shameful problem, \nAmericans are slipping into poverty much more easily than before and \nfinding it so much harder to escape once they are there.\n  What must the American people think about this Congress's priorities \nwhen the Republican majority is more interested in finding a way to \nrepeal the estate tax than in finding a way to reduce poverty? As \nSenator Grassley, chairman of the Finance Committee, put it last year \nafter the hurricanes, ``It's a little unseemly to be talking about \neliminating the estate tax at a time when people are suffering.''\n  The majority in Congress has thwarted efforts to address the needs of \npeople living in poverty but twice tried to roll back the estate tax \nthis year. Ninety-nine percent of estates pay no estate tax at all and \nthose who do are multimillion-dollar estates. Far from being a ``death \ntax,'' the estate tax falls on heirs who seldom had any real role in \nearning the wealth built up by the estate holder.\n  The minimum wage--which hasn't been raised in 9 years is an important \npolicy tool to lift low-income families out of poverty, but the \nmajority in Congress won't let us have an up-or-down vote without \npoison pills like the estate tax.\n  No one who works full time should have to live in poverty, but the \ncurrent minimum wage isn't enough to bring even a single parent with \none child over the poverty line--even if the parent works 40 hours a \nweek, 52 weeks a year. The average minimum wage worker brings home more \nthan half of their family's weekly earnings, and 80 percent of those \nwho would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage are adult \nworkers,\n  The policy priorities of the administration and the majority in \nCongress are truly misplaced.\n  The ranks of those without health insurance have also grown by nearly \n7 million on President Bush's watch. The number of uninsured increased \nto a record high 46.6 million in 2005--1.3 million more than in 2004. \nMore Americans are now without health insurance than at any point since \nthe Census Bureau began collecting comparable data nearly 20 years ago.\n  Soaring health care costs have contributed to the decline of \nemployer-sponsored health insurance, which is the largest component of \nthe U.S. health insurance system. The percentage of Americans with \nemployment-based health insurance fell to 59.5 percent in 2005, which \nis the lowest it has been since 1993.\n  If you are lucky enough to have health insurance, you are paying a \nlot more for it. Health insurance premiums for the average family have \nsoared by 87 percent--a stunning $5,325 jump, from $6,155 in 2000 to \n$11,480 in 2006.\n  At the same time that earnings are stagnating and costs are rising, \nthe average worker's retirement prospects are more uncertain than ever. \nThe number of workers employed by firms that sponsored some type of \nretirement plan fell by 3.7 million since President Bush took office--\nfrom 56 million in 2000 to 53 million in 2005. This reversed a trend of \npositive growth in employer-sponsored retirement plans in the previous \n5 years.\n  Twenty years ago, most workers with a pension plan could expect to \nreceive a defined benefit based on years of service and salary. Today, \ndefined contribution plans--which shift most of the investment risk and \nresponsibility onto workers--have become the dominant form of pension \ncoverage. As a result of this increased risk and responsibility, \naverage workers may end up with inadequate retirement savings.\n  In fact, the weakness of traditional pensions underscores the \nimportance of the current Social Security Program. For over 60 years, \nSocial Security has provided a dependable and predictable stream of \nincome to retired or disabled workers, their dependents, and their \nsurvivors. Forty-eight million men, women, and children rely on Social \nSecurity benefits each month to help them live with dignity.\n  Social Security benefits are protected from inflation and you can't \noutlive them. Yet the President supports privatizing Social Security, \nputting the guaranteed benefits of retirees, survivors, and the \ndisabled at risk.\n  We need to strengthen Social Security and improve our pensions system \nto ensure that Americans who work their entire lives have the financial \nsecurity they deserve and worked so hard for when they retire. And \nalthough we recently enacted a pension bill, this should not be viewed \nas mission accomplished.\n  The President's deficits will only exacerbate the economic problems \nof middle- and low-income families.\n  A $5.6 trillion 10-year projected surplus from 2002 to 2011 has \nturned into a deficit of $2.7 trillion, based on actual deficits so far \nand on CBO baseline projections for the remaining years. Realistically, \nthe 10-year deficit is probably much higher than that because this \nadministration has a history of leaving out big-ticket items such as \nwar costs or fixing the alternative minimum tax in its projection of \nfuture budget deficits.\n  Irresponsible budget policies pursued over the past 5 years by the \nBush administration and the Republican Congress have mortgaged our \nfuture to foreign investors and foreign governments and damaged our \ninternational competitiveness. A little over a decade ago, the Clinton \nadministration stepped in to stabilize the Mexican economy in the midst \nof a currency crisis, and today Mexico is the 10th largest holder of \nU.S. Treasury debt.\n  In this year's global competitiveness report from the World Economic \nForum, the United States fell from first place last year to sixth place \nas high budget deficits and record trade imbalances have begun to \nseriously erode this country's international competitiveness.\n\n[[Page S10645]]\n\n  Instead of sound budget policies aimed at preparing for the imminent \nretirement of the baby-boom generation, the Bush administration and the \nmajority in Congress have refused to adopt the kinds of budget \nenforcement rules that helped achieve fiscal discipline in the 1990s; \nhave pursued an open-ended commitment to rebuilding Iraq that relies on \nsupplemental appropriations rather than the normal budget process; and \nhave remained committed to extending irresponsible tax cuts that will \nadd further to the budget deficit. All of this comes at the cost of \ndestroying greater economic opportunities for most American families.\n  That, of course, is not what we are hearing from the administration \nand its supporters, who keep telling us that the economy is doing well, \nthat their tax cuts are an important reason why, and that everyone is \nbenefiting. It should not be surprising that this is not a message that \nresonates with the American people because, in fact, the current \neconomic recovery has been weaker than the typical business-cycle \nrecovery since the end of World War II, and large numbers of Americans \nare still waiting to benefit from any economic growth.\n  This administration touts its tax cuts, but these cuts haven't made a \ndent in the pocket books of most American families.\n  The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates that this year's tax cut \nwill only save middle-income families about $55--about what it now \ncosts to fill the gas tank of their minivan. But taxpayers making over \n$1 million will receive a cut of nearly $38,000--enough to buy a new \nMercedes.\n  Middle and lower income families are paying the price for the \nPresident's tax cuts for the wealthiest, as investments in programs \nthat promote greater economic prosperity for ordinary Americans have \nbecome candidates for budget cutting.\n  Regrettably, it is not surprising how under the Republican \nleadership, low-income families have been abandoned but what is \nsurprising is how the administration and Republican majority in \nCongress have also squeezed the middle class.\n  The President has proposed cuts to elementary and secondary \neducation, student aid and loan assistance for higher education, job \ntraining for displaced workers, childcare assistance so that parents \ncan go to work, and community development grants aimed at expanding \nsmall businesses. The President is also shortchanging investments in \nresearch and technologies that will create the high-wage jobs of the \nfuture.\n  Unfortunately, the rising tide is no longer lifting all boats. The \nbenefits of this economic recovery are simply not going to ordinary \nAmericans. Most Americans are concerned that this is as good as \neconomic conditions will get under the Bush economic policies. Our \nfocus should be on strengthening the safety net for American families--\nwhether it is raising the minimum wage or preserving Social Security, \npensions, and health insurance coverage.\n  That is why we need a new direction for America--one that focuses on \ncreating greater economic opportunities for all families.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Washington \nPost editorial dated September 4, 2006.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Mr. Bush and Labor Day--Workers Aren't Benefiting From Growth\n\n       Emerging from a meeting with his economic team at Camp \n     David on Aug. 18, President Bush declared that ``solid \n     economic growth is creating real benefits for American \n     workers and families.'' This assertion was false. Mr. Bush \n     should use this Labor Day to rethink his rhetoric and adjust \n     his policies.\n       The latest evidence on what the economy is doing for \n     workers comes from last week's Census Bureau report. This \n     showed that the growth cycle that began at the end of 2001 \n     has in fact created remarkably few benefits for most \n     Americans. Between 2001 and 2005 the income of the typical, \n     or median, household actually fell by 0.5 percent after \n     accounting for inflation, even as workers' productivity grew \n     by 14 percent.\n       The picture is hardly any better if you consider 2005 \n     alone. Workers' pay usually takes a while to pick up after a \n     recession: In the first stage of a recovery, unemployment \n     falls; in the second stage, a tight labor market pushes up \n     wages. But this second stage is taking an awfully long time \n     to arrive. In 2005, the fourth year of the expansion, the \n     median income did rise slightly, but that reflected a gain \n     for retirees. The typical full-time worker continued to fall \n     backward.\n       Since 1980 the wages of the typical worker have tended to \n     decline during bad times and recoup the losses during good \n     ones, with the overall result that they've been stagnant. \n     That stagnation, which contrasted with rapid gains for \n     workers at the top, was bad enough. But the recent phenomenon \n     of wages falling even during good times is disturbing and \n     exceptional. In the first four years of the last expansion, \n     from 1991 to 1995, median income rose 2.9 percent; in the two \n     upswings before that, the first four years delivered gains of \n     more than 8 percent. So whereas past presidents could declare \n     that a rising tide lifted all boats, Mr. Bush cannot honestly \n     do so.\n       The current growth cycle has also failed to dent poverty. \n     In fact, between 2001 and 2005, the poverty rate rose from \n     11.7 percent to 12.6 percent. Again, this is exceptional: In \n     the previous five economic cycles, the poverty rate fell \n     during the first four years of the recovery. Moreover, 5.4 \n     percent of the population now occupies the ranks of the \n     extremely poor, with incomes less than half the poverty line. \n     That's the highest rate of deep poverty since 1997.\n       In a speech at Columbia University on Aug. 1, Treasury \n     Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. rightly acknowledged that \n     ``amid this country's strong economic expansion, many \n     Americans simply aren't feeling the benefits.'' Mr. Paulson \n     needs to explain this point to Mr. Bush, who appears to see \n     things differently. But beyond a change of language, the \n     president needs to understand that his tax and spending \n     policies must do more than target growth. If policies do not \n     take inequality into account, the majority of Americans won't \n     benefit from economic expansion--and popular support for free \n     trade and other pro-growth ideas will continue to \n     deteriorate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10645-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         VERMONT LAKE MONSTERS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

This new agreement will keep \nVermont as the New York-Penn League affiliate for Washington through at \nleast the 2008 season.\n  Vermont has been the NY-Penn League affiliate of the Montreal Expos/\nWashington Nationals since joining the league in 1994, and the Vermont-\nMontreal/Washington affiliation is now the longest current partnership \nin the league. The Vermont team's on-field success is highlighted by \nwinning the New York-Penn League championship in 1996.\n  Since beginning the partnership in 1994, Vermont has seen 46 of its \nplayers reach the Major Leagues. Eighteen of those 46 players were on \nMajor League rosters during the 2006 season. On top of that, two \nplayers have been part of World Series championship teams--Geoff Blum \nfor the Chicago White Sox in 2005, and Orlando Cabrera for the Boston \nRed Sox in 2004.\n  While the teams have struggled on the field of late, I am confident \nthat the new Washington ownership will make a firm commitment to \nbolstering their player development program. The Lake Monsters' owner \nRay Pecor and general manager C.J. Knudsen also should be commended for \ntheir hard work and dedication in running a top-notch franchise in \nVermont.

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity at the \nend of a Congress to express may gratitude and best wishes to Ken \nCunningham, a long-time friend and staffer who has been like family to \nmy wife Barbara and me for more than 25 years and left my staff a few \nmonths ago.\n  He served me in a number of positions during those years, including \nchief of staff general counsel, legislative director, and legislative \nassistant--sometimes juggling multiple positions at once. I used to \njoke with him about all the titles that he had accumulated.\n  But now faced with growing family obligations, he has left my staff \nto set up his own government relations firm.\n  After 2 years working for former Congressman Tom Tauke, Ken joined my \nnew Senate staff in 1981 to handle several legislative and regulatory \nareas initially focusing on commerce, telecommunications, \ntransportation, and agriculture. In fact, my very first Senate \nlegislative victories came with Ken's help on the 1981 farm bill.\n\n[[Page S10646]]\n\n  Ken and his wife Sherry lived near Barbara and me, so he and I would \ndrive to and from work together. We got to know each other well during \nthose commutes and quickly became good friends. It was clear that my \nnew staffer possessed sound judgment, integrity, a strong work ethic, \nand a passion for serving our constituents.\n  He worked many years in the Senate before it became popular around \nhere to talk about the need for a ``family friendly'' schedule. And yet \nKen found the time and energy to earn his law degree at the Georgetown \nLaw Center. But I knew that I could always count on him to make the \nnecessary sacrifices to get the job done here in the Senate no matter \nhow long the hours. He probably set an office record in the early \neighties during the crunch time of an ending Congress. As he juggled \nseveral pending legislative issues, he took only 7 hours of sleep for \nthe entire week.\n  As some know, the devastation of the farm crisis of the middle \neighties so discouraged me that I almost did not run for reelection. \nBut Ken, like me, grew up farming. He, too, had friends back home and \nwas likewise crushed by their suffering. He worked tirelessly to help \nme fight for every bit of relief and assistance possible to help rural \nAmericans through that tragic time.\n  As partial testament to his effectiveness, when I did decide to run \nagain, and we did some polling, my highest approval ratings came from \nfarmers and their families. And while the farm crisis led to the defeat \nof many Midwest legislators, I was reelected by a wide margin.\n  My good friend, former Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, has called \nKen Cunningham the smartest staff man on Capitol Hill, and said that I \nam lucky to have him. Given the number of staffers Senator Dole has \nknown over the decades, that is indeed a remarkable compliment. But Ken \nhas proven time and again that he deserves that reputation.\n  Ken has always been quick to grasp the complex. He possesses \nincredible discernment and political instincts. He has an intense \ncompetitive spirit.\n  And he is tenacious--almost as tenacious as me. He probably learned \nthat from me.\n  Given these positive traits, combined with his understanding of \nSenate legislative rules and procedure, Ken can be either a great ally, \nor a most formidable opponent.\n  Let me give you an example.\n  Ken's expertise and qualities proved crucial in reversing a \ndevastating tax legislation defeat handed to us by the House of \nRepresentatives, led by then-Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, \nduring consideration of the 1997 reconciliation bill.\n  Chairman Archer and big oil had long despised tax incentives for \nethanol, one of America's few energy independence success stories, and \nthe source of billions of dollars of income and thousands of jobs for \nrural Americans and farmers.\n  By using reconciliation to kill these tax incentives and thus \ncreating tax savings that protected other popular programs, Chairman \nArcher had devised and executed a plan to kill these tax incentives \nthat were procedurally and politically virtually impossible to stop. He \nrammed it through his committee and then rammed it through the full \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Pro-ethanol allies in both the House and the Senate faced what seemed \nlike one of those ``deer-in-the-headlights'' moments.\n  As the Senate Finance Committee prepared to take up the \nreconciliation package, farm and renewable fuels groups looked to me to \nlead the fight. But cracking reconciliation's procedural nut at this \npoint was a daunting challenge at best.\n  Ken, however, formulated a legislative response that overcame these \nobstacles. One Finance Committee tax counsel wryly characterized it as \n``clever.''\n  The amendment was designed not only to stop Chairman Archer's \nhandiwork, but also to extend the ethanol tax provisions by several \nyears. This was a bold move for a number of reasons, not the least of \nwhich was the fact that it drew opposition from both the Finance \nCommittee's chairman and ranking Democrat.\n  The political obstacles were even more challenging than the \nlegislative and procedural.\n  Many Democrats were outright giddy with the prospects of taking back \ncontrol of Congress by blaming Republicans for the loss of the ethanol \nprogram and the resulting harm to rural America.\n  In recognition of this temptation, Ken recommended a particular \nDemocratic cosponsor who, though not recognized as the most experienced \nin these battles, we felt would fight hard against political \ngamesmanship. He also devised a plan that did not depend upon the \nClinton administration's help to ensure success.\n  I will never forget how quickly the loud chortling of the big oil \nlobbyists fell silent as they were stunned the night my amendment \npassed the Senate Finance Committee by a vote of 16 to 4.\n  And to the amazement of many, we fought to a draw during the 1997 \nreconciliation battle. Both Chairman Archer's and my provisions were \ndropped in conference. We then braced for Chairman Archer's next attack \nthat came with the 1998 highway bill. This time, however, Speaker \nGingrich quietly assured me that if we could get my tax amendment \npassed once again in the Senate, he would find a way to help me in \nconference.\n  As the time came close for the House/Senate conference, the Speaker \nhad not yet said what he would do to help. Ken explored a number of \nideas. It was common practice for House committee chairmen to designate \nmembers of their party and committee to attend conferences. But \nresearching House rules, and seeking confirmation from the House \nParliamentarian, Ken determined that the actual power of appointment \nresides with the Speaker.\n  We approached the Speaker to suggest that he consider exercising this \npower. And indeed, that is ultimately what the Speaker did: he \nappointed pro-ethanol House conferees, and my legislation extending the \nethanol tax incentive prevailed, while the Ways and Means chairman's \nlanguage to kill the program was dropped.\n  When I became the new chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Mark \nPrater, the committee's chief tax counsel, told me that this was by far \nthe biggest victory he had witnessed of me. It was unheard of and \nastounding for a mid-level member of the Finance Committee to defeat, \nas I did, a Ways and Means chairman on one of his top priorities.\n  Mr. President, even House Speaker Gingrich was amazed as the dust \nsettled and we emerged victorious. Addressing a group of my \nconstituents, the Speaker characterized legislate battle as, and I \nquote, ``the substance about which great novels are written.''\n  I will be first to acknowledge and express gratitude for all the help \nthat many, many people provided in this fight, but I am convinced that \nwe would have lost and there would be no ethanol program today had Ken \nCunningham not come up with the right analyses and solutions at each \nand every critical juncture.\n  Over the years, Ken helped me at one time or another in just about \nevery area of legislation and committee assignment, but he also \ncontributed greatly to my office as a manager--first as legislative \ndirector and then as chief of staff.\n  He is very good with people--tactful and empathetic. He is firm, but \nalways fair and even-handed. He has a way of bringing calm and \nresolution to tensions and conflict among staff. He is a good problem \nsolver, teacher, and coach.\n  It is said that actions speak louder than words. And although I am \nnot at a loss for words of praise for Ken, I think one of my last acts \nbefore he left speaks volumes about my confidence in Ken's judgment, \nloyalty, friendship.\n  I asked him to find and hire his own replacement--someone who was \njust as good with the same experience. I knew he would not let me down, \nand I think he did a pretty good job on that last assignment.\n  Ken has a wonderful wife and four growing boys. Barbara and I extend \nour blessings and best wishes for Ken and his family. And we have \nabsolute confidence that he will be successful in his new business.\n  We miss seeing him at the office every day but know we will always be \nclose friends.\n  So, Ken, to a valued public servant and a trusted friend, Barbara and \nI say\n\n[[Page S10647]]\n\nthank you for your long-standing service to Iowa and the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10647-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10647-S10648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BANKRUPTCY REFORM\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the impact of \nPublic Law 109-8, the bankruptcy reform legislation of which I was the \nlead sponsor here in the U.S. Senate. On October 17, 2006, we will see \nthe one-year anniversary of the new law. This law was the result of \nmany years of comprehensive study and intense debate in Congress. There \nwas much give and take among all interested parties over several \nCongresses, and the final bill that was signed into law was the result \nof compromise, upon compromise, upon compromise. In fact, people tend \nto forget that this law passed both the House and Senate by wide \nbipartisan margins. It is a law that was sorely needed. It is a law \nwhose central premise--if an individual wants to file for bankruptcy \nand can repay some of his debt, he should do just that, repay some of \nthat debt--is supported by almost everyone. The law's central premise \nis about fairness. It is about good old common sense.\n  The bankruptcy reform legislation was driven by a desire to restore \nbalance to a system that had become too easy: a system where clever \nlawyers gamed the integrity of the bankruptcy system for the benefit of \nthose who wanted to get out of their debts scott-free and to the \ndetriment of those who played by the rules. In fact, bankruptcy rates \nin the 1990s and early 2000 timeframe exceeded bankruptcy rates during \nthe Great Depression, despite the fact that the economy was going \nstrong during much of this time. So with this law we closed some \nloopholes, made upper-income Americans repay more of their debts if \nthey were going to seek bankruptcy, and enacted important consumer \nprotection provisions so people could be more knowledgeable about their \nfinances. The law retained bankruptcy for those who truly are in need \nof that relief, while injecting more integrity and fairness in the \nbankruptcy system.\n  So how has the new bankruptcy law worked? So far, I think it is too \nsoon to make firm judgments. But early reports indicate the new law has \nbeen working very well. We have seen bankruptcy rates fall dramatically \nfrom about 2 million bankruptcies in 2005 to the point where I doubt \nthere will be over 1 million bankruptcies in 2006, if current trends \ncontinue. In my mind, this is bound to help the American economy. Fewer \nbankruptcy filings lead me to believe that only those individuals who \ntruly are in need of a fresh start are filing for relief. Furthermore, \na natural outgrowth of fewer bankruptcy filings is a much lower cost to \nthe American consumer and the U.S. economy.\n  As my colleagues may recall, the Clinton administration's Treasury \nSecretary, Larry Summers, told Congress that high levels of \nbankruptcies tend to push up interest rates. I have called that the \n``bankruptcy drag'' on the economy. It is just common sense. When a \nbusiness loses money because a customer files for bankruptcy instead of \npaying his bill, that business has a couple of options: Either the \nbusiness can absorb the loss and spend less on growth and expansion or \nthe business can increase what it charges other customers to offset the \nloss, imposing what many of us in Congress called a bankruptcy tax. It \nfollows that businesses can weather the storm when the occasions where \ncustomers don't pay their bills are relatively rare, but when you have \na scenario where filing bankruptcy is easy and customers are filing \nbankruptcy on a regular basis--whether they really need it or not, no \nquestions asked--and they aren't paying their bills, well, then \nbusinesses get into trouble. Unfortunately, businesses that don't get \npaid aren't the only ones impacted by this.\n  The reality is, either way, u1timately it is the consumers and the \neconomy that suffer the most when bankruptcies spiral out of control. \nPeople who play by the rules and pay their way are the ones who end up \npicking up the tab. I would rather see the ``bankruptcy drag'' reduced, \nfreeing up businesses to grow, add jobs, and contribute to the Nation's \neconomy and the people's prosperity. I would rather see the $400 \n``bankruptcy tax'' burdening American families each year reduced so \nthey can spend their money in a more productive way. And based merely \non the bankruptcy filing numbers available from the Federal courts, I \nthink that it is fair to say that Public Law 109-8 has been a success \nfor our economy. Public Law 109-8 has driven a stake through the heart \nof this bankruptcy drag.\n  I have struggled with how to put a dollar figure on how much \nbankruptcy reform has saved the economy since it became the law of the \nland. During Congressional debate, we received testimony that the \naverage amount discharged in bankruptcy is $41,000 per filing. If one \ndoes some simple math, taking the total number of consumer bankruptcies \nfiled in the first half of this year and doubling that number, it seems \nwe could see about 550,000 consumer bankruptcies in 2006--perhaps a \nlittle more, perhaps a little less.\n  As I said, the Federal courts reported that we had just over 2 \nmillion consumer bankruptcies filed in 2005. So using the $41,000 \nfigure, bankruptcy losses cost our economy $82 billion in 2005. On the \nother hand, it looks as if, because of the new law, bankruptcy losses \nfor 2006 will only be about $22.5 billion. Let me repeat: $82 billion \nin 2005 and $22.5 billion in 2006 after the law was put in effect.\n  We are not talking peanuts. That is a substantial savings for our \neconomy. That is around $60 billion that would have been lost, that \nwould have put a drag on our economy. And I am confidant that at least \nsome of that money has been or will be redirected to economic growth. \nIf this isn't success, I don't know what is.\n  It is also important to remember the unprecedented new consumer \nprotections included in the new bankruptcy law. Let me mention some of \nthem. Retirement savings receive more protections from the reach of \ncreditors. Likewise, education savings also receive enhanced \nprotections under the new law. And lenders who won't compromise with \nfinancially-troubled borrowers can be penalized for not negotiating \nout-of-court settlements.\n  People considering filing for bankruptcy now have access to no-cost \nor low-cost credit counseling and financial education. We want people \nwho make bad financial choices to learn how to deal with their finances \nand quit the spending cycle. After all, better educated consumers are a \nbenefit to everyone. The law even encourages education of young people \non how to manage their money. And credit card companies are required by \nthe new law to warn consumers about the dangers of making only minimum \npayments and to clearly identify payment amounts.\n  Moreover, bankruptcy mills that deceived people into filing for \nbankruptcy when they had other options available are now subject to new \nregulation. People should be aware that bankruptcy is not the only way \nout in times of financial trouble. Even a Federal Trade Commission \nAlert warned against bankruptcy mills and advised the American consumer \nthat filing for bankruptcy adversely affects an individual's credit \nrating. Bankruptcy should be a last resort, rather than the first stop \nin regaining one's financial bearings.\n  So, all in all, Public Law 109-8 contains some of the most sweeping \nconsumer protections enacted by Congress in a long time.\n  Of course, as I said earlier, it is too early to gauge the full \nimpact of Public Law 109-8. Bankruptcy attorneys so frightened \nconsumers by exaggerating the impact of bankruptcy reform that many \nconsumers rushed to file prior to enactment of the law. And after the \nlaw was enacted, many consumers who truly need bankruptcy were scared \naway.\n  Some of the consumer protections contained in the law--such as \nminimum-payment warnings for credit cards and the like--have not yet \nbeen implemented by the Federal Reserve.\n  Also, the debtor attorneys who want to operate bankruptcy mills are \nseeking to get out from under the new regulations by claiming in court \nto have a constitutional right to advise consumers to run up debt on \nthe eve of bankruptcy and not comply with the new law. I am pleased \nthat the Justice Department is aggressively resisting this effort. \nThese lawyers just want a license to go back to their old ways of \nmaking a quick buck by shuffling unsuspecting consumers into bankruptcy \nwithout advising them of the\n\n[[Page S10648]]\n\ndownsides of bankruptcy or their alternatives. These lawyers also are \ndragging down our economy. Bankruptcy should be reserved for those \npersons who have no other options, not for people who use clever legal \nadvice to make big purchases on the eve of bankruptcy with no intention \nof ever repaying the debt because they can wipe away their debts clean, \nno questions asked.\n  So I will keep a watchful eye on developments in the future. But for \nnow, almost one year later, bankruptcy reform seems to have been a \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10648-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF ANTHRAX ATTACKS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, In the autumn of 2001, while the Nation was \nstill reeling from the reality of our airplanes being turned into \nweapons of terror, someone, somewhere, launched another deadly \nterrorist attack using our postal system to deliver their weapon of \nchoice--anthrax. Those anthrax-laced letters targeting several \njournalists and public officials, among them Senator Daschle and \nmyself, jarring an already fearful Nation.\n  Receiving that letter was a chilling and personal reminder that the \nthreat of terrorism was not temporary, nor was it an ocean away. \nThankfully, my staff and I were unharmed, but others were not so lucky. \nThe terrorists who sent these letters struck 22 people ranging in age \nfrom 7 months to 94 years, and the attacks resulted in the deaths of \nfive Americans. They were people who died by simply touching an \nenvelope--in some cases the mail was addressed to them, and in other \ninstances, it was an envelope meant for someone else. Yet all of these \npeople died as a result of doing what so many of us do every day--our \njobs.\n  Five years after those attacks and 5 years into the global war on \nterror, there is still no perpetrator who has been arrested or \nconvicted for these attacks. Every year around the time of the \nanniversary--we learn that the FBI is still working on this case and \nthat it remains a high priority for the Bureau. Many skilled and \ntalented people have worked diligently on this case, bringing to bear \nsome of the most advanced forensic technology in the world.\n  The victims of the anthrax attacks varied in gender, race, religion, \nage, economic status and locale, but they all shared in the suffering. \nThe victims who suffered the most were employees of the U.S. Postal \nService, of the Department of State, of news organizations and of the \nSenate, and the aides, the children, and the senior citizens whose mail \ncame in contact with the anthrax-laden letters.\n  Robert Stevens, a photo editor at The Sun newspaper in Boca Raton, \nFlorida, died on October 5, 2001, at the age of 63. Thomas Morris, Jr., \na Washington, DC, postal worker, died on October 21 at the age of 55. \nJoseph Curseen, also a Washington, DC, postal worker, died on October \n22 at the age of 47. Kathy T. Nguyen, a New York City hospital worker, \ndied on October 31 at the age of 61. And Ottilie Lundgren, a 94-year-\nold Connecticut retiree, died on November 21.\n  Many of those who survived anthrax exposure remain severely \ndebilitated, suffering from chronic cough, fatigue, joint swelling and \npain, and memory loss. Several victims have been diagnosed with \ndepression and anxiety and are still tormented by nightmares. Many \ncannot return to work, and some of those who have returned are unable \nto do even routine tasks without difficulty. Victims say they \ncommunicate very little with one another, mostly fighting their battles \nalone.\n  On October 16, 2003, I introduced a bill to amend the September 11th \nVictim Compensation Fund of 2001 to provide compensation for anthrax \nvictims on the same basis as compensation is provided to victims of \nSeptember 11. The bill never made it out of the Judiciary Committee. \nWithout this appropriate help, the surviving victims struggle to pay \ntheir medical bills and get by on worker's compensation, and many \nreport feeling like they have borne the brunt of the anthrax attacks \nalone. This surely exacerbates the emotional and psychological \ndifficulties that many anthrax victims experience. Congress should act \nto help these people, who are victims of the national experience of \nthese terrorist attacks, and they should be treated accordingly.\n  Congress and the American people hope for answers and for a \nresolution of this case. We hope that lessons have been learned from it \nthat will help prevent or minimize future biological attacks. In the \nmeantime, let us remember the loss and the suffering of those who fell \nvictim to this deadly episode of terrorism on our soil.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10648-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10648-S10649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IRAQ AND U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have listened intently over the past \nfew weeks as the President, members of his Cabinet, and Members of this \nChamber have discussed Iraq, the war on terror, and ways to strengthen \nour national security.\n  For years, now, I have opposed this administration's policies in Iraq \nas a diversion from the fight against terrorism. But I have never been \nso sure of the fact that this administration misunderstands the nature \nof the threats that face our country. I am also more sure than ever and \nit gives me no pleasure to say this--that this President is incapable \nof developing and executing a national security strategy that will make \nour country safer.\n  As we marked the fifth anniversary of 9/11 this month, we recalled \nthat tragic day and the lives that were lost in New York, at the \nPentagon, and in Pennsylvania. And we all recalled the anger and \nresolve we felt to fight back against those that attacked us. This body \nwas united and was supportive of the administration's decision to \nattack al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan. No one disputed that \ndecision.\n  That is because our top priority immediately following 9/11 was \ndefeating the terrorists that attacked us. The American people expected \nus to devote most of our national security resources to that effort, \nand rightly so. But unfortunately, 5 years later, our efforts to defeat \nal-Qaida and its supporters have gone badly astray. The administration \ntook its eye off the ball. Instead of focusing on the pursuit of al-\nQaida in Afghanistan, it launched a politically motivated diversion \ninto Iraq--a country with no connection to the terrorists who attacked \nus. In fact, the President's decision to invade Iraq has emboldened the \nterrorists and has played into their hands by allowing them to falsely \nsuggest that our fight against terrorism is anti-Muslim and anti-Arab, \nwhen nothing could be further from the truth.\n  But instead of recognizing that our current policy in Iraq is \ndamaging our national security, the President continues to argue that \nthe best way to fight terrorists is to stay in Iraq. He even quotes \nterrorists to bolster his argument that Iraq is the central front in \nthe war on terror. Just recently, he told the country that Osama bin \nLaden has proclaimed that the ``third world war is raging'' in Iraq'' \nand that this is ``a war of destiny between infidelity and Islam.''\n  Instead of letting the terrorists decide where we will fight them, \nthe President should remember what he said on September 14, just 2 days \nafter 9/11. He said, and I quote, ``[t]his conflict was begun on the \ntiming and terms of others. It will end in a way, and at an hour, of \nour choosing.'' The President was right when he said that, and he is \nwrong to suggest that we must stay in Iraq because that is where the \nterrorists want to fight us. We must fight the terrorists where they \ndon't want to fight us--and that means engaging in a global campaign, \nnot focusing all of our resources on one country.\n  The way to win a war against global terrorist networks is not to keep \n140,000 American troops in Iraq indefinitely. We will weaken, not \nstrengthen, our national security by continuing to pour a \ndisproportionate level of our military and intelligence and fiscal \nresources into Iraq.\n  Unfortunately, because of our disproportionate focus on Iraq, we are \nnot using enough of our military and intelligence capabilities for \ndefeating al-Qaida and other terrorist networks around the world. While \nwe have been distracted in Iraq, terrorist networks have developed new \ncapabilities and found new sources of support throughout the world. We \nhave seen terrorist attacks in India, Morocco, Turkey, Afghanistan, \nIndonesia, Spain, Great Britain, and elsewhere. The administration has \nfailed to adequately address the terrorist safe haven that has\n\n[[Page S10649]]\n\nexisted for years in Somalia or the recent instability that has \nthreatened to destabilize the region. And resurgent Taliban forces are \ncontributing to growing levels of instability in Afghanistan.\n  Meanwhile, the U.S. presence in Iraq is being used as a recruiting \ntool for terrorist organizations from around the world. In Indonesia, \nhome to historically moderate Islamic communities, conservative \nreligious groups are becoming increasingly hostile towards the United \nStates. In countries like Thailand, Nigeria, Mali, the Philippines, and \nelsewhere, militant groups are using U.S. policies in Iraq to fuel \nhatred towards the West.\n  The war in Iraq was, and remains, a war of choice. Some in this body, \neven those who have questioned the initial rationale for the war, \nsuggest that we have no option but to remain in Iraq indefinitely. That \nargument is mistaken. We do have a choice, and that is whether we \ncontinue to devote so much of our resources to Iraq or whether we \ndevote our resources to waging a global campaign against al-Qaida and \nits allies. We cannot do both.\n  If we choose to stay the course in Iraq, that means keeping large \nnumbers of U.S. military personnel in Iraq indefinitely. It means \ncontinuing to ask our brave service members to somehow provide a \nmilitary solution to a political problem, one that will require the \nwill of the Iraqi people to resolve. Our military has achieved its \nmission in Iraq. Until we redeploy from Iraq, our very presence there \nwill continue to generate new terrorists from around the world that \nwill come to Iraq to attack U.S. troops.\n  Staying the course also means that our military's readiness levels \nwill continue to deteriorate. It means that a disproportionate level of \nour military resources will continue to be focused on Iraq while \nterrorist networks strengthen their efforts worldwide.\n  The fight against the Taliban and al-Qaida in Afghanistan, too, will \ncontinue to suffer, as it has since we invaded Iraq. If we stay the \ncourse in Iraq, we won't be able to finish the job in Afghanistan.\n  Finally, if this were our Nation's choice, the safety of our country \nwould be uncertain, at best. Terrorist organizations and insurgencies \naround the world will continue to use our presence in Iraq as rallying \ncry and recruiting slogan. Terrorist networks will continue to increase \ntheir sophistication and reach as our military capabilities are \nstrained in Iraq.\n  I think we can see why this approach plays into the terrorists' \nhands--and even why bin Laden might suggest that the U.S. presence in \nIraq is beneficial to his cause.\n  Of course, staying the course isn't a necessity.\n  The alternative is to establish a new national security strategy that \naddresses the wide-ranging nature of the threats that face our country.\n  This second choice will require replacing our current self-defeating \nnational security strategy with a comprehensive one to defeat the \nterrorist networks that attacked us on 9/11. It will require a \nrealignment of our finite resources. And it will also require a change \nin the way we view and discuss the threat to our country. We must \nreject phrases like ``Islamic fascism,'' which are inaccurate and \npotentially offensive to peace-loving Muslims around the world. And we \nneed to understand that there is no ``central front'' in this war, as \nthe President argues.\n  The threats to our country are global, unlike any we have encountered \nin the past. Our enemy is not a state with clearly defined borders. We \nmust respond instead to what is a loose network of terrorist \norganizations that do not function according to a strict hierarchy. Our \nenemy isn't one organization. It is a series of highly mobile, diffuse \nentities that operate largely beyond the reach of our conventional \nwarfighting techniques. The only way to defeat them is to adapt our \nstrategy and our capabilities and to engage the enemy on our terms and \nby using our advantages.\n  We have proven that we can not do that with our current approach in \nIraq.\n  This choice--this new strategy--would require redeploying from Iraq \nand recalibrating our military posture overseas. It would require \nfinishing the job in Afghanistan with increased resources, troops, and \nequipment. It would require a new form of diplomacy, scrapping the \n``transformational diplomacy'' this administration has used to offend, \npush away, and ultimately alienate so many of our friends and allies, \nand replacing it with an aggressive, multilateral approach that would \nleverage the strength of our friends to defeat our common enemies.\n  It would also require the infusion of new capabilities and strength \nfor our Armed Forces. By freeing up our special forces assets and \nredeploying our military power from Iraq, we would be better positioned \nto handle global threats and future contingencies. Our current state of \nreadiness is unacceptable and must be repaired. Our National Guard, \ntoo, must be capable of responding to natural disasters and future \ncontingencies.\n  Finally, this new approach would make our country safer. It would \nenable our Government to spend time addressing the wide range of \nthreats our country faces. It would free up strategic capacity to deal \nwith Iran, North Korea, and the Middle East, and to provide real \nleadership internationally against other enemies we all face, like \npoverty, HIV/AIDS, and corruption.\n  In sum, it would help return the United States to a place of \npreeminence in the world and would give us the opportunity to address \nthe very real threats we face in the 21st century.\n  The bottom line is that we cannot afford to continue down the path \nthe President has set forth. We face real threats from al-Qaida and \nother terrorist organizations. Accordingly, we need to strengthen our \nmilitary, diplomatic, and intelligence capabilities.

However, I would like to raise \ntwo issues.\n  First, I would have preferred a clean extension of this act as the \nother extensions have been.\n  Second, I am concerned about the impact this extension will have on \nthe many other graduate students nationwide who rely on financial \nassistance, including students at Florida's Nova Southeastern \nUniversity.\n  Nova Southeastern University's student body is unique with eighty \npercent pursuing graduate studies. This is the opposite of typical \ninstitutions where 80 percent of students are at the undergraduate \nlevel.\n  Nova holds the distinction of leading the Nation in postgraduate \ndegrees awarded to Hispanic students.\n  Nova is also the largest originator of School as Lender loans in the \ncountry, and thus, is disproportionately affected by changes to the \nSchool as Lender Program.\n  The School as Lender Program allowed Nova to provide hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in low-cost loans to students.\n  Premiums from the sale of those loans provided the university with \nmillions of dollars annually which it used to educate its students. \nNova maintains it helped keep their tuition rates down.\n  Denying Nova its ability to use these premiums for all students will \nhurt thousands of Nova students each year.\n  This extension also eliminates the ability of school lenders and \neligible lender trustees to issue low-cost PLUS loans to graduate \nstudents. This change could increase the cost of graduate school for \nmany students who need multiple loans to finish their degree.\n  For these reasons, I am disappointed this is not a clean extension, \nand I will continue to engage our Senate Education Committee leaders \nabout this issue in the months ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10649-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10649-S10650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Lance Corporal Philip Johnson\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to U.S. Marine \nCorps LCpl Philip A. Johnson, of Enfield, CT, a heroic young man who \nlost his life serving his country in Iraq on September 2, 2006. He was \n19 years old.\n\n[[Page S10650]]\n\n  Lance Corporal Johnson, a member of the weapons company of the 3rd \nBattalion, Second Marine Division based at Camp Lejeune, NC, was killed \nalong with one other marine when a roadside bomb detonated as their \nunit was traveling from Ramadi.\n  Philip Johnson was the consummate American patriot. He dedicated his \nlife to the U.S. Marine Corps and took immense pride in serving his \ncountry. As a little boy, Philip dreamed of being a marine and wasted \nno time in pursuing his goal. He joined a youth education and service \norganization named the Westover Young Marines at the age of 11, where \nhe attained the rank of staff sergeant and served as a role model for \nyounger members. Many who knew him remember his lifelong love of the \nMarine Corps, but they also remember him as a focused and thoughtful \nyoung man with a drive to help people. Philip was active in his church \nand committed to his faith.\n  Above all, Philip was eager to serve his country, so shortly after \ngraduating from Enfield High School in 2005 he fulfilled his childhood \ndream by enlisting in the Marine Corps. As a marine, he continued to \nexhibit the exceptional determination and focus that defined his youth. \nPhilip attained the rank of lance corporal in less than a year, an \nimpressive feat that speaks volumes about his dedication to the Marine \nCorps.\n  Philip Johnson was a model marine, prepared to fight America's worst \nenemies and deeply committed to both the Corps and our Nation. Lance \nCorporal Johnson and others like him have made the ultimate sacrifice \nso that their fellow Americans can live in peace and security, and for \nthat, we should be eternally grateful.\n  So today I salute Philip Johnson for his unwavering commitment to our \nNation and the principles for which it stands. He was a young man of \nexceptional integrity and will be greatly missed. I wish to extend my \ndeepest sympathies to his parents, Louis and Kathy, his sister, \nJessica, and to all those who knew and loved him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10650-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ARMY PFC NICHOLAS MADARAS\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I wish to speak in honor of U.S. Army \nPFC Nicholas Madaras, of Wilton, CT, who was killed in Iraq on \nSeptember 3, 2006. He was 19 years old.\n  Private Madaras, a member of the 1st Battalion, 68th Armor Regiment, \n3rd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, was fatally wounded \nwhen a bomb detonated near his dismounted patrol in Baqouba, Iraq.\n  A 2005 graduate of Wilton High School, Nicholas excelled both in the \nclassroom and on the soccer field, where he started for 3 years and \nserved as the team manager. Among the students, teachers, and coaches, \nhe was known as a genuine person, one who led by example and cared \nabout the people around him.\n  Nicholas enlisted in the Army shortly before graduation and arrived \nin Iraq in February of this year. He was proud to be a soldier and \napproached his assignment as a driver of a Humvee in a security escort \nwith the same leadership and intensity that he brought to the soccer \nfield. Despite the unimaginable hardships of war, Nicholas never lost \nhis generous spirit. He persuaded his father to mail dozens of used \nsoccer balls to his base because he could not stand to see the local \nchildren kicking tin cans. This act of kindness in the midst of cruelty \nand chaos clearly demonstrated the character of this exemplary young \nman.\n  PFC Nicholas Madaras was a patriot in the best sense of the word. He \nand others like him have given their lives in defense of our Nation's \nprinciples, and for that, all of us in Connecticut and across America \nowe them a deep debt of gratitude.\n  I salute Private Madaras for his tremendous service to our country, \nand wish to offer my deepest sympathies to his parents, William and \nShalini, his sister Marie, his brother Christopher, and to everyone who \nknew and loved him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10650-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NATIONAL CAPITAL TRANSPORTATION AMENDMENTS ACT\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this legislation, the National Capital \nTransportation Amendments Act of 2006, authorizes a total of \n$1,500,000,000 in matching Federal funds over the next 10 years to help \nsustain the Federal Government's longstanding commitment to the \nWashington Metropolitan area's Metrorail system.\n  In March, 2006, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority \ncelebrated the 30th anniversary of passenger service on the Metrorail \nsystem. Since service first began in 1976, Metrorail has grown from a \n4.6-mile, five-station, 22,000-passenger system into the Nation's \nsecond busiest rapid transit operation. Today the Metrorail system \nconsists of 106.3 miles, 86 stations and carries more than 100 million \npassengers a year. The Metrorail system provides a unified and \ncoordinated transportation system for the region, enhances mobility for \nthe millions of residents, visitors, and the Federal workforce in the \nregion, promotes orderly growth and development of the region, enhances \nour environment, and preserves the beauty and dignity of our Nation's \nCapital. It is also an example of an unparalleled partnership that \nspans every level of government from city to State to Federal.\n  As the largest employer in this region, the Federal Government has \nhad a longstanding and unique responsibility to support the Metro \nsystem. This special responsibility was recognized more than 40 years \nago in the National Capital Transportation Act of 1960, when Congress \nfound that ``an improved transportation system for the National Capital \nregion is essential for the continued and effective performance of the \nfunctions of the Government of the United States.'' Today more than a \nthird of Federal employees in this region rely on Metrorail to get to \nwork, and at rush hour, more than 40 percent of Metro's riders are \nFederal employees. The service that WMATA provides is also a critical \ncomponent of Federal emergency evacuation plans for the region. The \nFederal Government's interest in Metro is ``unique and enduring.''\n  It took extraordinary perseverance and effort to build the 106-mile \nMetrorail system. From its origins in legislation first approved by the \nCongress during the Eisenhower administration, three major statutes--\nthe National Capital Transportation Act of 1969, the National Capital \nTransportation amendments of 1979, and the National Capital \nTransportation amendments of 1990--were enacted to provide Federal and \nmatching local funds for construction of the system. In addition, in \nISTEA, TEA-21 and most recently in SAFETEA-LU, we made the Metrorail \neligible for millions of dollars in Federal funds annually to maintain \nand modernize the system, and provided an additional $104 million for \nWMATA's procurement of 52 rail cars and construction of upgrades to \ntraction power equipment on 20 stations to allow the transit agency to \nexpand many of its trains from six to eight-cars.\n  But the system is aging and has been experiencing increasing \nincidents of equipment breakdowns, delays in scheduled service, and \nunprecedented crowding on trains. In 2004, WMATA released a ``Metro \nMatters'' report which found a $1.5 billion shortfall in funding over 6 \nyears to meet WMATA's capital and operating needs. A blue-ribbon panel, \nsponsored by the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, the \nGreater Washington Board of Trade and the Federal City Council, \npublished a report a year later which concluded that WMATA faces an \naverage annual operating and capital shortfall of approximately $300 \nmillion between fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2015.\n  This legislation seeks to provide additional Federal funds to help \nclose this gap. To be eligible for any Federals funds that may be \nappropriated annually under this legislation, the District of Columbia, \nthe State of Maryland, and the Commonwealth of Virginia must first \nenact the required Compact amendments and either establish or use an \nexisting dedicated funding source, such as Maryland's transportation \ntrust fund, to provide the local matching funds. The legislation is \nstill subject to the annual appropriations process, and it is my hope \nthat Federal funding authorized under this act will be forthcoming in \nfuture years. I urge adoption of the legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10650-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10650-S10652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PREVENTING CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. The heart wrenching reports of civilian casualties in \nIraq,\n\n[[Page S10651]]\n\neach one of whom represents a mother, father, son or daughter who has \nbeen injured or killed in the crossfire or as a result of deliberate \nattacks, should deeply concern us. Thousands of innocent Iraqi men, \nwomen and children have died as a result of suicide bombs, shootings, \nimprovised explosive devices, or from tragic mistakes at U.S. military \ncheckpoints.\n  There is not enough time today to discuss this issue in depth. There \nare too many incidents, and too many issues, from the widespread and \ninappropriate use of cluster munitions in populated areas which \nindiscriminately and disproportionately injure and kill civilians, to \nthe despicable acts of terrorism that are designed to cause the maximum \namount of suffering among innocent people.\n  I do want to mention that both the Department of Defense and the U.S. \nAgency for International Development have programs in both Iraq and \nAfghanistan to provide condolence payments or assistance to civilians \nwho have been injured or the families of those killed as a result of \nU.S. military operations. The USAID program is named after Marla \nRuzicka who died in a car bombing in Baghdad on April 16, 2005, at the \nage of 28. Marla devoted the last years of her life getting assistance \nto innocent victims of the military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, \nand the organization she founded, Campaign for Innocent Victims in \nConflict, continues to work on these issues in both countries.\n  The Pentagon's condolence program, which is administered by Judge \nAdvocate General officers in the field, provides limited amounts of \ncompensation depending on the nature of the loss. The program has \nsuffered from some administrative weaknesses which I will speak about \nat greater length at another time. However, it does represent an \nacknowledgement by U.S. military commanders that it is neither right, \nnor is it in our interest, to turn our backs on innocent people who \nhave been harmed as a result of our mistakes.\n  I also want to mention a June 6, 2006, Wall Street Journal article \nentitled ``U.S. Curbs Iraqi Civilian Deaths In Checkpoint, Convoy \nIncidents,'' and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. This article describes laudable efforts by the Department \nof Defense to reduce civilian casualties that have so often resulted \nfrom mistakes that could have been avoided with relatively simple \nprecautions at checkpoints.\n  For years, I and others urged the Pentagon to ensure that U.S. \ncheckpoints were clearly marked and that soldiers at checkpoints in \nIraq are trained to warn drivers in ways that avoid confusion, not \nsimply with lights or by firing their guns into the air which a driver \nmight not see or that could cause a driver to panic. For years, we were \nignored, with horrific incident after horrific incident, whole families \ngunned down, or only young children left alive after their parents in \nthe front seat were riddled with bullets.\n  Iraq is an extraordinarily dangerous place and attacks against our \ntroops often happen without a moment's notice. Split second decisions \nare sometimes necessary. No one suggests that our troops should not be \nable to defend themselves or that they should be penalized for \nunavoidable mistakes. But Pentagon officials stubbornly refused to heed \nthe most reasonable, constructive suggestions, always insisting that \nthey were acting according to procedures.\n  Those procedures were woefully inadequate and they devalued innocent \nIraqi lives. It is inexcusable, because it was so obvious and many \ncasualties could have been avoided with the changes that field \ncommanders have recently made. All it took was caring enough to do it.\n  The article also mentions that the Pentagon has finally been \ninvestigating and reporting on civilian casualties. It is not an exact \nscience, since sometimes a person dressed like a civilian is actually \nan enemy combatant, but it is vitally important that we do our best to \ndetermine the cause of civilian casualties that result from our \nactions.\n  Section 1223 of H.R. 1815, the fiscal year 2006 Defense Authorization \nAct, requires a report on the Pentagon's procedures for recording \ncivilian casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan. That report, a copy of \nwhich I only just received, is an embarrassment. It totals just two \npages and it makes clear that the Pentagon does very little to \ndetermine the cause of civilian casualties or to keep a record of \ncivilian victims.\n  No one expects our troops to be forensic investigators, but we do \nexpect the Pentagon to take this issue seriously and to do its best to \ndocument and maintain a record of civilian casualties. By doing so we \ncan make clear that we value innocent lives, we are better able to know \nwhen and how to assist the families of those injured or killed, and we \ncan make changes to procedures to prevent such mistakes in the future.\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, June 6, 2006]\n\n    U.S. Curbs Iraqi Civilian Deaths In Checkpoint, Convoy Incidents\n\n                            (By Greg Jaffe)\n\n       Washington--The U.S. military has cut the number of Iraqi \n     civilians killed at U.S. checkpoints or shot by U.S. convoys \n     to about one a week today from about seven a week in July, \n     according to U.S. defense officials in Iraq.\n       The reduction in civilian casualties shows that months \n     before the killing of 24 Iraqis in the western Iraqi town of \n     Haditha came to light, the military was pushing to reduce the \n     number of Iraqi civilians killed or wounded at the hands of \n     U.S. forces. The drop since July, however, suggests that \n     hundreds of Iraqi civilians were killed at U.S. checkpoints \n     or on Iraqi highways during the first two years of the war.\n       The shooting of civilians in such instances has angered \n     Iraqi civilians and political leaders. It also likely has \n     helped fuel the insurgency. Last week, Iraqi Prime Minister \n     Nouri al-Maliki lashed out at U.S. forces for showing ``no \n     respect for citizens, smashing civilian cars and killing on a \n     suspicion or a hunch.'' Mr. Maliki's comments were driven in \n     part by the news that U.S. military investigators had opened \n     a pair of formal probes into the mid-November incident in \n     Haditha in which Marines allegedly killed two dozen unarmed \n     civilians, including several women and children without \n     provocation. Evidence indicates that the Marines tried to \n     blame the incident on a roadside bomb and an ambush from \n     insurgents, say lawmakers and U.S. officials familiar with \n     the probes.\n       In contrast with the Haditha incident, where the killings \n     are alleged to be intentional, checkpoint and convoy \n     shootings are almost always the result of mistakes in which \n     confused or disoriented Iraqi drivers don't respond to \n     initial warnings from U.S. forces to slow down or back off, \n     U.S. officials say. U.S. forces, worried about their own \n     security and that of their colleagues, must make split-second \n     decisions to fire warning shots or open fire.\n       Such shooting incidents--or escalation-of-force incidents, \n     as military officials call them--result in civilian \n     casualties in 12% of the cases. The numbers don't include \n     civilians killed in raids resulting from bad intelligence or \n     Iraqis killed in the crossfire of battles with insurgents.\n       Until July 2005, the U.S. military didn't track civilian \n     casualties in these incidents, senior military officials say. \n     In December, President Bush estimated that about 30,000 Iraqi \n     civilians had been killed since the war started. His \n     spokesman, however, said the estimate was based on media \n     reports and not a formal military count.\n       The military's failure to track such killings has drawn \n     criticism from human-rights experts. ``If you don't keep \n     track of the civilians you harm, you don't know how you are \n     doing,'' said Sarah Sewall, director of the Carr Center for-\n     Human Rights Policy at Harvard University. She praised the \n     military for paying more attention to the problem but \n     lamented that it took so long.\n       Since arriving in Iraq as the No.2 military official in \n     January, Lt. Gen. Peter Chiarelli has made reducing Iraqi \n     civilian casualties in escalation-of-force incidents a bigger \n     priority. Gen. Chiarelli has been critical of the U.S. \n     military for using force too quickly.\n       ``It is something he has been pushing since we got into \n     theater, and we have been making good progress,'' said a \n     military officer familiar with the general's efforts. Some of \n     the decrease has been the result of changes in tactics and \n     training. Military commanders have been ordered to ensure \n     that their checkpoints all use the same signs and setup to \n     minimize confusion.\n       U.S. soldiers have been given new equipment such as sirens \n     and green lasers that allow them to get Iraqi drivers' \n     attention without firing warning shots. Soldiers also have \n     been schooled in new ways of spotting suicide bombers.\n       In April, Gen. Chiarelli directed his subordinate \n     commanders to investigate all escalation-of-force incidents \n     that result in an Iraqi being seriously wounded or killed or \n     cause more than $10,000 in property damage. The results must \n     be sent to Gen. Chiarelli's Baghdad headquarters. Before his \n     order, such incidents weren't always investigated.\n       In recent months, senior military officials have focused \n     less on finding insurgents and\n\n[[Page S10652]]\n\n     more on keeping soldiers in one place, where they provide \n     daily security for the population. ``They are getting into \n     small towns more and staying for a longer period of time. \n     That cuts down on mistakes,'' says Andrew Krepinevich, \n     executive director of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary \n     Assessments, a Washington defense think tank.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10652-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am grateful for the opportunity to \ndiscuss the importance of breast cancer awareness and to highlight \nBreast Cancer Awareness Month, which takes place this October.\n  We celebrate Breast Cancer Awareness Month every October in order to \nraise awareness of the disease and to stress the importance of early \ndetection through an annual mammogram for women over 40, or earlier for \nwomen with increased risk factors. I say that we celebrate Breast \nCancer Awareness Month because in my family, we truly do celebrate. \nWere it not for the efforts of so many fine individuals and \norganizations to raise awareness of this disease, my wife Barbara might \nnot have sought early treatment and won two battles with breast cancer. \nBarbara's triumphs truly give our family reason to celebrate.\n  Yet the numbers remind us that we have more work to do. Breast cancer \nis the most common nonskin cancer and the second leading cause of \ncancer-related death among women. We know we are making strides against \nthis disease because while the breast cancer diagnosis rate has \nincreased, the overall breast cancer death rate has decreased. Simply \nput, although more women are personally fighting breast cancer, more \nwomen are winning.\n  One of the most effective ways for women to win their battle against \nbreast cancer is through early detection and treatment, and \nhighlighting this fact is a fundamental goal of Breast Cancer Awareness \nMonth. In this spirit, Barbara and I sponsor a mammogram van every year \nat the South Dakota State Fair in Huron, SD. The van, which our \ngenerous sponsors help us provide free of charge, offers 2 days of free \nmammograms for uninsured women. We are so proud to have the opportunity \nto offer this important screening to so many women.\n  I am disappointed that the President's budget request for fiscal year \n2007 does not prioritize funding for cancer programs in a way that \nallows us to move quickly forward in the fight against breast cancer. \nThe President requested level funding for the National Institutes of \nHealth, NIH, the world's largest and most distinguished organization \ndedicated to maintaining and improving health through medical science. \nThis proposed budget would cut funding for 18 of the 19 Institutes at \nNIH, including a $40 million cut for the National Cancer Institute.\n  I am pleased that the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education \nappropriations bill approved by the Appropriations Committee, on which \nI serve, in July not only restored funding for the National Cancer \nInstitute, but also included a $9 million increase over the fiscal year \n2006 level. While we must still travel a long path to passing this \nappropriations bill, I am committed to maintaining and, if possible, \nincreasing this funding level.\n  Earlier this year, I joined 73 Senators in voting to add $7 billion \nto the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education appropriations \nbill. Unfortunately, the fiscal year 2006 emergency supplemental bill \ncontained a ``deeming resolution'' that forced the Senate to make \nsignificant spending cuts in domestic programs. As a result, on July \n20, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported out a bill that is $2 \nbillion short of the fiscal year 2005 level. I am committed to securing \nthe rest of the funds that so many of my colleagues and I support and \nto ensuring that important programs like breast cancer research and \nscreening and treatment programs receive the benefit of these \nadditional funds. We can only expect to conquer breast cancer and other \nforms of cancer if we commit the funds necessary to researching, \nunderstanding, and preventing this disease.\n  During the month of October, I urge my Senate colleagues, my \nconstituents in South Dakota, and all Americans to join me in \ncelebrating Breast Cancer Awareness Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10652-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        BI-NATIONAL HEALTH WEEK\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend \nfrom Iowa, the ranking minority member of the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition and Forestry, to salute a dedicated public servant, Mr. Frank \nIppolito, who is retiring after more than 30 years of distinguished \nservice to the U.S. Government, including 24 years at the Department of \nAgriculture, USDA.\n  As the Director of the Governmental Affairs Office at USDA's Food and \nNutrition Service, FNS, Mr. Ippolito is the career civil servant \nresponsible for communications between FNS and Congress and for \ncoordinating logistics for hearings, briefings, and legislative policy \nfor the Under Secretary of Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services and \nFNS staff.\n  FNS accounts for over half of USDA's annual budget. It serves a \nmonthly average of over 25.9 million people in the Food Stamp Program, \n8.22 million people in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for \nWomen, Infants, and Children, WIC, and provides daily meal service to \nover 30.9 million students through the National School Lunch Program \nand 10.3 million students in the National School Breakfast Program. Mr. \nIppolito is the bridge between this important agency and the Congress.\n  Mr. Ippolito was born and raised in Birmingham, AL. He graduated from \nthe Birmingham Public School System in 1965, earned a B.S. in chemistry \nfrom the University of Alabama in 1969 and a law degree from the \nUniversity of Alabama School of Law in 1973.\n  Mr. Ippolito first worked as general counsel of the Alabama Air \nPollution Commission in the State capital. In 1975, he came to \nWashington to work for the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and \nWelfare, now known as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \nand worked for the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Defense \nInvestigative Agency.\n  In 1982, Mr. Ippolito came to FNS in the Office of Governmental \nAffairs as a legislative specialist. In 1988, he was named Director of \nGovernmental Affairs, the position he has held for the past 18 years. \nAs Director, he has provided invaluable guidance on FNS programs and \nactivities both to the Under\n\n[[Page S10653]]\n\nSecretary and Secretary of Agriculture and to Members of Congress for \nfive farm bills and five child nutrition and WIC reauthorizations.\n  Over the course of his career, Mr. Ippolito served under six \nPresidents and eight Secretaries of Agriculture, five Chairmen of the \nU.S. House of Representatives Committee on Agriculture, and six \nchairmen of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  In the Senate Agriculture Committee, in exercising our jurisdiction \nover FNS we not only work in a bipartisan fashion, we also work closely \nwith the administration. When writing a farm bill or child nutrition \nand WIC reauthorization, we often call upon FNS staff, including Mr. \nIppolito, for expertise. He put in many Saturday afternoons and late \nnights past 2:00 a.m. during legislative discussions and negotiations \nbecause of his dedication to providing Representatives, Senators, and \nour staff access to the information we need to serve the American \npeople.\n  I commend Mr. Frank Ippolito for his many years of dedicated service \nto the U.S. Government and for the outstanding work he has done \nthroughout his distinguished career. I congratulate him on the occasion \nof his retirement and extend my best wishes to him and his wife, Donna, \nin the years ahead.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I too wish to pay tribute to the \naccomplishments of Mr. Frank Ippolito and thank him for his many years \nof dedicated service to the American people and especially to the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service, FNS. Mr. \nIppolito has done an outstanding job as the career civil servant \nresponsible for communications between FNS and Congress. During his \nlong tenure, this critical agency, which benefits millions of \nAmericans, has been greatly improved.\n  Mr. Ippolito has crossed many a path with countless elected officials \nand staff over the years, and without regard to party affiliation, he \nhas treated each and every one of us with dignity, respect, and a \nhelpful attitude that allows the work of Government to be performed \nefficiently and effectively. And in addition to his professionalism and \ncompetence, he has always carried out his work with a generous spirit \nand a cheerful personality.\n  In sum, Mr. Ippolito exemplifies the very model of a public servant. \nFrank Ippolito reminds us that, at its best, working for the Federal \nGovernment is ultimately about working for the people of the United \nStates. At the end of a career, all of us who have worked in the \nGovernment or elected office should ask ourselves if, as a result of \nour careers, the people throughout America are better off as the result \nof our efforts. I am confident that Frank can enter retirement after \nthree decades secure in his knowledge that the answer to that question \nis an emphatic yes.\n  I thank Mr. Frank Ippolito for his years of extraordinary service and \nwish him and his wife Donna all the best on this occasion for his \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10653-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MISSED OPPORTUNITIES IN HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this Congress has made little progress on \nhealth care.\n  We know the problems. Health costs are rising. The number of \nuninsured is growing. American companies, burdened by growing health-\ncare obligations, are struggling to compete. And what has Congress done \nabout it? Not much.\n  The trends are worsening. Last month, we learned that nearly 47 \nmillion Americans lack health insurance. That is up from a bit over 40 \nmillion in 2001. Last week we learned that health insurance premiums \nrose 7.7 percent last year. That is twice the rate of inflation. And \nnearly every day, I hear from an employer concerned about the rising \ncost of health care.\n  Unfortunately, this Congress has not made progress on these top-tier \nhealth issues. Congress has not made progress even where wide agreement \nexists.\n  There is wide agreement on health information technology, or health \nIT. Most experts agree that smarter use of health IT would cut costs. \nIt would increase efficiency. It would reduce medical errors. And it \nwould save lives.\n  Furthermore, health IT would help us to move to system of paying \nhealth care providers for the quality of care that they provide. That \nis an important priority of mine.\n  Last November, the Senate passed a health IT bill unanimously. That \nwas nearly 11 months ago. Yet an agreement has still not been reached \nwith the House on a compromise health IT bill.\n  This bill started with broad support across the Senate. But \ndeliberations on this bill have now turned partisan. Recently, the \nmajority has excluded Democrats from the conference committee \ndeliberations.\n  There is also wide agreement on Medicare physician reimbursements. An \noverwhelming majority of Senators have urged action to prevent a \npending 5.1 percent cut in the Medicare physician fee schedule for \n2007. And there is broad agreement on the need to start rewarding \nquality in Medicare. But despite agreement on both issues, Congress has \nyet to act.\n  There is also wide agreement on helping seniors confused by the new \nMedicare drug benefit. The new Medicare drug program imposes a penalty \non those who sign up after the enrollment deadline. But the way that \nthe Government implemented the new Medicare drug program confused \nseniors.\n  In response, Chairman Grassley and I joined a wide group of Senators \nto introduce legislation to waive the penalty for this year. But \ndespite broad support for this measure, it remains unaddressed.\n  There is also wide agreement that we need to sustain important health \nsafety net programs. In 3 months, funding for transitional medical \nassistance--TMA --ill expire. TMA provides temporary health coverage to \nlow-income working parents moving from welfare to work. Without a TMA \nextension, nearly 800,000 working parents will lose the temporary \nhealth coverage that they need to leave welfare and lead independent \nlives.\n  There is also wide agreement that we need to enact technical \ncorrections to last year's Deficit Reduction Act. While I did not vote \nfor that bill, it is important that Congress clarify any \nmisunderstandings over its intent. I know that Chairman Grassley shares \nmy interest in getting this done as soon as possible.\n  There is also wide agreement to support the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, or CHIP. CHIP has helped cut the number of uninsured \nkids from 10.7 million in 1997 to 8.3 million in 2005. But despite this \nsuccess, 17 States face federal funding shortfalls in their CHIP \nprograms. These shortfalls potentially jeopardize coverage for hundreds \nof thousands of kids. We cannot afford to lose ground in our fight to \nprovide more health coverage for children.\n  There is also wide agreement that we need to improve health care in \nIndian Country. In June, the Finance Committee reported legislation to \nimprove access to Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP in Indian Country. That \nbill is now part of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. That bill \nis being held hostage by a handful of opponents on the other side.\n  There is no shortage of important health issues. Many health issues \nspark intense partisan disagreement. But that is generally not true \nabout the ones that I just described.\n  That is why it is so disappointing that these issues--from Medicare \nphysician payments to transitional Medicaid--remain unaddressed.\n  If we are ever going to make progress on the most difficult problems \nfacing our health system--rising costs, the uninsured, threats to \nAmerican competitiveness--we will have to work together and pass \nlegislation. That we cannot even work together on issues with wide \nagreement is deeply troubling.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10653-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10653-S10654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL EMPLOY OLDER WORKERS WEEK\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of National \nEmploy Older Workers Week, celebrated September 24-30, 2006. All too \noften we concentrate only on the social and economic challenges that \nthe rapidly increasing numbers of older Americans present this Nation. \nThis week's designation provides the opportunity to highlight the vital \nrole that older workers can and do play in fostering a competitive \neconomy through their workplace contributions.\n  As the baby boomer generation has begun to reach traditional \nretirement\n\n[[Page S10654]]\n\nage, this mature workforce is breaking down the negative stereotypes \nthat cast older workers as frail, unproductive, and resistant to \ntechnological advances. Today's older generation of Americans has \npersevered through economic hard times and flourished in prosperity, \nendured war and enjoyed peace, and embraced more dramatic technological \nadvances in science, medicine, transportation and communications than \nany other generation in our history. This breadth of experience should \nbe viewed as a valuable asset bridging this country's past and future. \nNational Employ Older Workers Week is our opportunity to recognize the \nwealth of experience older Americans have acquired and can contribute \nto the 21st century workplace, as well as the importance of work in \nhelping seniors maintain their independence, health, and well--being.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to join me in recognition of \nNational Employ Older Workers Week. As chairman of the Senate Special \nCommittee on Aging, I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nencourage the hiring and retention of older workers. We honor these \nworkers for their experience and the contributions they have made \nthroughout their lifetimes, and look forward to their continued \ncontributions to our country's prosperity. .\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10654-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             IMPROVING ELECTION PRACTICES FOR NOVEMBER 7TH\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, there has been much discussion and debate \nover the last 6 years on the best way to modernize the way we run \nFederal elections. As a result of the Help America Vote Act of 2002, \nHAVA, the Election Assistance Commission, EAC, a bipartisan independent \nagency, was created. One of the EAC's duties is to serve as a \nclearinghouse of election administration information for the use of \nelection officials, the information of voters, and the good of our \ndemocracy.\n  The Election Assistance Commission has recently released four \ndocuments that serve as an overview on good election administration \npractices in preparation for the November 7 Federal elections. States \nare making the final push to implement the new election administration \nrequirements enacted in HAVA which must be in place by November. As \nwith any new Federal requirements, it is anticipated that there may be \nproblems with new technologies, administrative failures, or human \nerror. In light of some of the challenges faced by election officials \nin primaries over the last few weeks, these best practices guidelines \nare both timely and instructive for those who are responsible for \nconducting our Federal elections this fall.\n  The first document, ``Quick Start Management Guide for New Voting \nSystems,'' covers basic polling place planning and management \noperations for those jurisdictions that have recently purchased new \nvoting equipment. This document includes recommendations on contingency \nplans, testing procedures, and security.\n  The second document, ``Quick Start Management Guide for Poll \nWorkers,'' discusses best practices for recruiting, training, and \nretaining poll workers. These best practices include election day \nrecommendations for establishing a dedicated phone line for poll \nworkers and creating a troubleshooting guide for problems at the polls.\n  A third guide, ``Quick Start Management Guide for Voting System \nSecurity,'' discusses methods of assessing technological or procedural \nflaws in election security, and suggests protocols on how to improve \nthe secure functioning of the elections process. These protocols \ninclude installing only certified software, implementing procedures and \nsystems to control physical access to voting systems, and maintaining \nan inventory of all election materials.\n  Finally, the fourth guide, ``Quick Start Management Guide for Ballot \nPreparation/Printing and Pre-election Testing,'' provides \nrecommendations for ballot preparation and logic and accuracy testing \nof systems. These best practices include testing all components of the \nsystem prior to election day, replacing all batteries before each \nelection, and ensuring that all state laws and procedures for logic and \naccuracy testing have been followed.\n  These guides have been developed based on best practices used \nsuccessfully by election officials across this Nation. While many \njurisdictions may already be considering these procedures, I wanted to \nbring these guides to the attention of my colleagues in the hope that \nthey will pass this information on to their state and local election \nofficials for use in the November Federal elections.\n  These recommendations may not cover every potential election problem \nfaced by poll workers and voters in the fall elections. State law in \nsome jurisdictions may even preclude election officials from \nimplementing some of these best practices. However, these documents \nraise potential issues for everyone involved in the elections process \nto consider, and offer concrete solutions to the challenging \nadministrative problems that impact state and local election officials. \nMost importantly, these procedures can help ensure that every eligible \nAmerican will have an equal opportunity to cast a vote and have that \nvote counted in the November Federal elections.\n  The text of these four Quick Start Guides can be accessed on the \nElection Assistance Commission Internet Web site, http://www.eac.gov by \nfollowing links to: Guide for New Voting Systems; Voting System \nSecurity Guide; Poll Workers Guide; and Ballot Preparation/Printing & \nPre-Election Testing Guide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10654-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10654-S10656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE KYOTO DECLARATION OF RELIGIONS FOR PEACE\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the organization known as Religions for \nPeace constitutes a global network of interreligious councils and \naffiliated groups, harnessed to encourage cooperation among the world's \nreligious communities to transform conflict, build peace and advance \nsustainable development.\n  Founded in 1970 as an international, nonsectarian organization, \nReligions for Peace is now the largest coalition of the world's \nreligious communities.\n  President of Religions for Peace is His Royal Highness Prince El \nHassan bin Talal of Jordan.\n  Secretary General of WCRP, as the organization is known, is Dr. \nWilliam F. Vendley, of the United States.\n  Our former colleague and my fellow Hoosier, John Brademas, who served \nin the House of Representatives from Indiana for 22 years and then \nbecame president of New York University, which he now serves as \nPresident Emeritus, is an International Trustee of Religions for Peace.\n  Last month, in Kyoto, Japan, more than 800 religious leaders, from \nall major traditions and over 100 countries, met at the Eighth World \nAssembly of the World Conference of Religions for Peace.\n  The theme of this assembly was Confronting Violence and Advancing \nShared Security.\n  At the request of our former colleague Representative Brademas, I ask \nunanimous consent to have the final statement issued by the Kyoto \nAssembly printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  The Kyoto Declaration on Confronting Violence and Advancing Shared \n          Security--Religions for Peace Eighth World Assembly\n\n\n                                Preamble\n\n       Representing all major religious traditions and every \n     region of the world, more than eight hundred religious \n     leaders from over one hundred countries convened in Kyoto, \n     Japan as the Eighth World Assembly of the World Conference of \n     Religions for Peace to address the theme, ``Confronting \n     Violence and Advancing Shared Security.'' We, the Assembly \n     Delegates, come from the global Religions for Peace network \n     of local, national, regional, and international inter-\n     religious councils and groups, as well as networks of youth \n     and women of faith. We recognize and build on the significant \n     contributions and statements of youth and women of faith made \n     in their respective assemblies.\n       The first Religions for Peace World Assembly that convened \n     in Kyoto in 1970, and every Assembly since, affirmed deeply \n     held and widely shared religious principles that still \n     inspire our search for peace with justice today. We share a \n     conviction of the fundamental unity of the human family, and \n     the equality and dignity of all human beings. We affirm the \n     sacredness of the individual person and the importance of his \n     or her freedom of conscience. We are committed to the ethical \n     values and attitudes commonly shared by our religious \n     traditions. We uphold the value of life manifest in human \n     community\n\n[[Page S10655]]\n\n     and in all creation. We acknowledge the importance of the \n     environment to sustain life for the human family. We realize \n     that human power is neither self-sufficient nor absolute, and \n     that the spirit of love, compassion, selflessness, and the \n     force of inner truthfulness ultimately have greater power \n     than prejudice, hate, enmity or violence. Meeting in Japan, \n     the nation that experienced the horrors of nuclear attacks, \n     we commit ourselves to continue to struggle toward \n     comprehensive nuclear disarmament and against the \n     proliferation of arms.\n       The first Assembly of Religions for Peace declared: ``As \n     men and women of religions, we confess in humility and \n     penitence that we have very often betrayed our religious \n     ideals and our commitment to peace. It is not religion that \n     has failed the cause of peace, but religious people. This \n     betrayal of religion can and must be corrected.'' It is \n     crucial now to engrave the reflection of our respected \n     predecessors deeply in our hearts.\n       Today, we live in a world in the grip of many forms of \n     violence, both direct and structural. Violent conflicts--\n     within states and across borders, carried out by both state \n     and non-state actors--take lives and destroy communities. \n     They cause more civilian than military casualties and their \n     disproportionate impact is on vulnerable populations.\n       Religious communities in particular must play a central \n     role identifying and confronting violence in all its forms \n     and manifestations. The world's religions have experienced \n     abuse by those who seek to misuse religion for their own \n     purposes. In ongoing violent conflicts around the world, \n     religion is being used as a justification or excuse for \n     violence. We must regretfully accept that some groups within \n     our religious communities have indeed sought to employ \n     violence. We must reject this and recommit religions to the \n     way of peace. Religious communities and leaders must stand \n     up, speak out, and take action against the misuse of \n     religion.\n       The diverse and interconnected threats currently \n     experienced by innumerable members of the human family call \n     for a much broader understanding of violence in the world. \n     The world's religious communities must play a central role \n     partnering with one another and all sectors of society, to \n     prevent and stop war, expose injustice, combat poverty, and \n     protect the earth.\n       The time to do this is now; and our key to confronting \n     violence is cooperation based on mutual respect and \n     acceptance.\n\n\n                          Confronting Violence\n\n       Today, genocide, state-sponsored repression, terrorism, and \n     other forms of human rights abuse violate international law, \n     target innocent civilians, and threaten the safety of many \n     communities. State laws restricting human rights and civil \n     liberties are also a form of violence. Conflict-related \n     disease, famine, displacement and environmental catastrophes \n     constitute serious threats to life. Violence against women \n     and children, including rape, forced pregnancy, enslavement, \n     forced labor, prostitution, the use of child soldiers, and \n     trafficking, has become a tactic of warfare in many \n     conflicts.\n       Direct physical threats are the most commonly offered \n     definition of violence, but the reality of the diverse and \n     interconnected chronic threats to human survival experienced \n     by millions calls for a much broader understanding of \n     violence in the world. Economic injustices leading to extreme \n     poverty and hunger kill 50,000 people each day. Preventable \n     and treatable diseases kill millions. Twenty-five million \n     people have already died from AIDS, while approximately forty \n     million more are living with HIV and AIDS, and the impact on \n     our communities is devastating. Many corporations, especially \n     at the multinational level, set their business interests \n     without concern for values that foster sustainable \n     development. Environmental degradation and dwindling \n     resources threaten our planet's ability to sustain life.\n       The poor, the powerless, and the most vulnerable \n     populations disproportionately suffer the consequences of \n     violence in all its forms, ranging from armed conflict to \n     extreme poverty to environmental degradation.\n       Unfortunately, religion plays a significant role in some of \n     the most intractable and violent conflicts around the world. \n     Religion is being hijacked by extremists, and too often by \n     politicians, and by the media. Extremists use religion to \n     incite violence and hatred and foster sectarian conflict, \n     contrary to our most deeply held beliefs. Religious people \n     need to recognize the reasons why religions are being \n     hijacked, such as through manipulation and misuse of their \n     central principles. Politicians often exploit and manipulate \n     sectarian differences to serve their own ends, frequently \n     dragging religion into social, economic and political \n     disputes. The media also contribute to the scapegoating of \n     religions in conflict situations through disrespectful \n     representations. They also too easily identify parties to a \n     conflict by religious labels and present religion as a source \n     of conflict without reporting the diversity within religious \n     traditions and the many ways that religious communities are \n     confronting violence and working for peace.\n\n\n                       A Multi-Religious Response\n\n       As people of religious conviction, we hold the \n     responsibility to effectively confront violence within our \n     own communities whenever religion is misused as a \n     justification or excuse for violence. Religious communities \n     need to express their opposition whenever religion and its \n     sacred principles are distorted in the service of violence. \n     They should take appropriate steps to exercise their moral \n     authority to oppose attempts to misuse religion.\n       There are religious and ethical imperatives for multi-\n     religious cooperation to resist and reject violence, prevent \n     it when possible, as well as promote reconciliation and \n     healing.\n       Our religious traditions call us to care for one another \n     and to treat the problems faced by others as our own. \n     Violence against any individual is an attack against all and \n     should prompt our concern. Religious communities know that \n     they are especially called to stand on the side of the most \n     vulnerable, including the poor, the marginalized, and the \n     defenseless. Our religious traditions acknowledge the \n     fundamental vulnerability of human life. The vulnerability of \n     each person should make us recognize the need to respond to \n     the vulnerability of all persons.\n       There are also practical grounds for cooperation. No group \n     is immune to violence or its consequences. War, poverty, \n     disease, and the destruction of the environment have direct \n     or indirect impacts on all of us. Individuals and communities \n     deceive themselves if they believe they are secure while \n     others are suffering. Walls can never be high enough to \n     insulate us from the impacts of the genuine needs and \n     vulnerabilities of others. No nation can be secure while \n     other nations are threatened. We are no safer than the most \n     vulnerable among us.\n       The efforts of individual religious communities are made \n     vastly more effective through multi-religious cooperation. \n     Religious communities working together can be powerful actors \n     to prevent violence before it erupts, diffuse conflict, \n     mediate among armed groups in the midst of conflict, and lead \n     their communities to rebuild war-torn societies.\n       Religious communities are called not only to reject war and \n     foreign occupation, sectarian violence, weapons \n     proliferation, and human rights abuse, but also to identify \n     and confront the root causes of injustice, economic \n     inequalities, governance failures, development obstacles, \n     social exclusions, and environmental abuses.\n\n\n                            Shared Security\n\n       The moral and ethical convictions of our diverse religious \n     traditions provide a moral foundation for confronting \n     violence in its many forms and for suggesting a vision of \n     shared security.\n       Existing notions of security inadequately address violence \n     in its many forms. National security does not necessarily \n     ensure peace; in fact, it often promotes violence and foments \n     insecurity. Armed conflict takes place between states, and \n     increasingly within states and among non-state actors. Human \n     security acknowledges the solidarity of the human family by \n     approaching security from the perspective of human rights and \n     needs. But defining human security in these terms fails to \n     address adequately how these needs are to be met and who is \n     responsible for ensuring them.\n       A well-developed concept of shared security articulates \n     security needs, how they are to be met, and the necessary \n     agents, instruments, and relationships to achieve it.\n       Importantly, shared security would highlight the collective \n     responsibility of all people to meet our common need for \n     security.\n       Shared security requires all sectors of society to \n     acknowledge our common vulnerabilities and our shared \n     responsibility to address them. It is undertaken collectively \n     by multiple stakeholders acknowledging that every sector of \n     society must confront violence if we hope to do so \n     effectively. It supports participatory and democratic forms \n     of governance. Governments, international organizations, \n     civil society, and religious communities themselves must all \n     advance shared security. Effective shared security spans \n     boundaries of geography, nationality, ethnicity, and \n     religion. It marshals human responsibility, accountability \n     and capacity wherever it exists.\n       Effective shared security, at all levels of community, \n     meets national security needs; acknowledges and addresses \n     both direct and chronic threats to individual physical \n     security; and protects the poor, the powerless and the most \n     vulnerable. It strengthens governance efforts and addresses \n     the disparities and inequities of globalization. Shared \n     security supports religious communities and religious leaders \n     in their efforts to oppose the abuse of religion for violent \n     ends and to build institutions for collaboration among \n     governments, all elements of civil society and religious \n     communities. A commitment to shared security enables multi-\n     religious networks, such as the global Religions for Peace \n     network, in their efforts to transform conflict, build peace, \n     struggle for justice, and advance sustainable development.\n\n\n                          Religions for Peace\n\n       Religions for Peace has become a major global multi-\n     religious voice and agent for peace. Guided by respect for \n     religious differences, the global Religions for Peace network \n     fosters multi-religious collaboration harnessing the power of \n     religious communities to transform conflict, build peace, and \n     advance sustainable development.\n       We, the delegates of the Eighth World Assembly of Religions \n     for Peace, are firmly united in our commitment to prevent and \n     confront violence in all its forms and confident in the power \n     of multi-religious cooperation to advance a common vision of \n     shared security. We are determined to mobilize our religious \n     communities to work together and with all sectors of society \n     to stop\n\n[[Page S10656]]\n\n     war, struggle to build more just communities, foster \n     education for justice and peace, eliminate poverty and \n     advance sustainable development for future generations.\n\n\n                    A Multi-Religious Call to Action\n\n       As religious leaders, we commit ourselves to advance shared \n     security through advocacy, education, and other forms of \n     multi-religious action, and to share this Kyoto Declaration \n     within our religious communities.\n       We call on all sectors of society--public and private, \n     religious and secular--to work together to achieve shared \n     security for the human family.\n       Specifically, the Religions for Peace World Assembly calls \n     on:\n       (1) Religious communities to:\n       Resist and confront any misuse of religion for violent \n     purposes;\n       Become effective educators, advocates and actors for \n     conflict transformation, fostering justice, peacebuilding, \n     and sustainable development;\n       Draw upon their individual spiritual traditions to educate \n     their members on our shared responsibilities to advance \n     shared security;\n       Strengthen peace education on all levels;\n       Hold governments accountable for the commitments they make \n     on behalf of their peoples;\n       Network locally, nationally, regionally and globally to \n     foster multi-religious cooperation among the world's \n     religious bodies; and\n       Partner with governments, international organizations and \n     other sectors of society to confront violence and advance a \n     new notion of shared security.\n       (2) The global network of Religions for Peace to:\n       Foster high-level multi-religious cooperation around the \n     issue of shared security;\n       Build, equip, and network inter-religious councils locally, \n     nationally, and regionally;\n       Strengthen the global Religions for Peace network as a \n     platform for collaboration to advance shared security;\n       Further commit to actions for women's empowerment and \n     women's human rights within its structures at all levels;\n       Embrace the central position of religious women and place \n     gender concerns at the center of the shared security agenda;\n       Keep religious youth and their concerns at the center of \n     its agenda and promote their full involvement in advancing \n     shared security;\n       Support and collaborate with the Peacebuilding Commission \n     of the United Nations;\n       Advocate practices that advance sustainable development and \n     environmental protection; and\n       Partner with all sectors of society, especially in the \n     fight against HIV/AIDS.\n       (3) Governments, International Organizations, and the \n     Business Sector to:\n       Support the efforts of religious leaders to address \n     violence within and beyond their communities, and include \n     them as appropriate in political negotiations surrounding \n     conflict situations;\n       Forge partnerships with religious communities to achieve \n     the Millennium Development Goals to eradicate extreme poverty \n     and hunger, combat disease, and advance sustainable \n     development;\n       Harness advances in science and technology toward peaceful \n     purposes and to eliminate poverty and advance sustainable \n     development; and\n       Seek out religious networks for their ability to reach vast \n     numbers of people and their capacity to effect change.\n       We ask all people of goodwill to support and collaborate \n     with religious communities as we work toward shared security \n     for all.\n       These commitments and the calls to action that arise from \n     them express our most deeply held and widely shared religious \n     beliefs.--Kyoto, Japan, August 29, 2006.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10656-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             TELECOM REFORM\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today to highlight the critical \nneed we have in this country for broadband deployment. We are currently \nranked 12th in the world in broadband deployment, and we must improve \non this meager standing to be competitive in the world market.\n  The telecom reform legislation that has been reported by the Senate \nCommerce Committee is the right step in encouraging more broadband. I \napplaud Chairman Stevens and the rest of the committee for reporting \nthis important bill. We need to end bureaucratic regulation on the \nvideo and broadband markets so that more competition will come to the \nmarketplace. Americans deserve to have choices in who provides their \ntelephone service, their cable service, and their broadband internet \nservice. We have the opportunity to get this done for our constituents, \nand I urge the Senate to pass H.R. 5252, The Advanced \nTelecommunications and Opportunity Reform Act of 2006, expeditiously.\n  Telecom reform has hit the national stage, and I was proud to support \nthe Advanced Telecommunications and Opportunity Reform Act of 2006 when \nthe Commerce Committee carefully considered the legislation. Our \ncommittee voted on this bill over 10 weeks ago, so it's time for the \nSenate to act. This is our chance to get it right on telecom reform and \nsave cable consumers money on their bills. Despite the hard work of the \nCommerce Committee, some of our colleagues are holding up this \nimportant bill. I believe it is past time to bring this bill to the \nfloor for a debate and a vote.\n  This legislation will usher video competition into communities across \nthe U.S., and it will catapult rural areas into the 21st century \ndigital era. By setting national franchise standards, negotiations \nbetween video service providers and local authorities will change from \na years-long struggle to a maximum of 90 days. Accelerating the \nentrance of new companies into our communities will increase television \nchoices, which ultimately lead providers to lower their rates and \nimprove their service.\n  By doing away with the unnecessarily long local franchise process, \ncurrent and new companies can quickly reach rural communities, where we \nneed it most. Small companies that can't possibly break through the \nexisting red tape will be able to quickly roll out quality service to \ncable- and high-speed-deprived areas. At the same time, larger \ncompanies will have opportunities to increase their investment and \nbuild better services to reach even more customers. This is a win-win \nsituation for my State and the country.\n  Also, this bill has numerous other critical components--one of which \nbeing the assistance it provides to our Nation's first responders. The \nFirst Responder Coalition, a group consisting of tens of thousands of \nconcerned citizens and first responders, strongly supports this \nlegislation as it delivers key assistance for interoperability. \n``Interoperability'' is a term that refers to local, State, and Federal \nagencies being able to communicate effectively during the time of a \ncrisis. This legislation will allocate up to $1 billion in much-needed \nfunds to first responders specifically for interoperable \ncommunications, and my amendment adopted in committee will speed up the \ndelivery of that important funding. As we witnessed in last year's \ndevastating hurricane season, local governments need dedicated and \neasily accessible technology so they can communicate with each other, \nas well as State and Federal authorities in the event of similar \ncircumstances that require critical early responses. In Louisiana, \nnothing could be more important for us.\n  I am asking us today to heed the call for the entire country \ndeserving for the great benefits of this bill. We have an opportunity \nto get the job done right--once and for all--for America's consumers. \nWe need choices in television providers, more broadband deployment, \nvital interoperability funding, and more technology to rural areas. The \nAdvanced Telecommunications Opportunity Reform Act of 2006 is the right \nnext step for us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10656-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10656-S10657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today and throughout Hispanic Heritage \nMonth, we honor the proud history of our Nation's Hispanic community, \nand we pay tribute to the extraordinary contributions that people of \nHispanic heritage have made and continue to make to the United States.\n  In 1968, Congress authorized President Lyndon Johnson to proclaim a \nweek in September as National Hispanic Heritage Week. The observance \nwas expanded in 1988 to a month-long celebration. During this month, \nAmerica celebrates the culture and traditions of Spain, Mexico and the \nSpanish-speaking nations of Central America, South America and the \nCaribbean. The celebration begins on September 15 because that is the \nanniversary of independence of five Latin American countries--Costa \nRica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. In addition, \nMexico and Chile celebrate their independence days on September 16 and \nSeptember 18, respectively.\n  National Hispanic Heritage Month celebrates people whose roots extend \nback to more than 20 different nations around the world and who are an \nintegral part of America's communities. Currently, there are more than \n43 million Hispanic Americans, the fastest growing ethnic group in the \nUnited States. Hispanic Americans are the\n\n[[Page S10657]]\n\nmost decorated ethnic group in the history of our military, and we are \ndeeply grateful for their contributions to our Nation's defense.\n  Hispanic Americans have made invaluable contributions to every part \nof American society, from the arts, to medicine to politics to our \neconomy. We are a richer nation in every sense because of those \ncontributions, and because of what they represent--a country that draws \nstrength from its great diversity.\n  But as we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, it is also time to \naddress the challenges that face the Hispanic community, such as lack \nof access to education and health care, inadequate working conditions, \nracial profiling and, for many, the difficulty of keeping their \nfamilies together while working to become legal, permanent residents of \nthis great country.\n  This celebration should serve as a call to action for Congress. We \nmust ensure that Hispanic Americans have access to educational and \neconomic opportunities as they pursue the American dream. I have long \nfought attempts to cut funding for important programs such as Pell \ngrants, the High School Equivalency Program, and College Assistance \nMigrant Program. I have cosponsored the DREAM Act--the Development, \nRelief, and Education for Alien Minors Act--which would provide higher \neducation opportunities for children who are long-term U.S. residents \nof good moral character, and who came to this country illegally as \nchildren through no fault of their own.\n  Another crucial piece of legislation is AgJOBS--the Agricultural Job \nOpportunities, Benefits, and Security Act. This proposal would enable \nundocumented agricultural workers to legalize their status, and would \nreform the H2-A agricultural worker visa program so that growers and \nworkers will not continue to rely on illegal paths to employment in the \nfuture.\n  Congress must also continue working toward establishing a realistic \nimmigration system that has adequate opportunities for people to come \nto the United States legally. In Wisconsin, businessowners have come to \nrely on foreign workers for their economic success. Simply imposing new \nborder security measures alone, which some have advocated, is not \nenough.\n  In closing, I want to express my hope that Congress will work to \naddress these issues and other urgent matters for Hispanic Americans \nacross the country. We should not limit our celebration of Hispanic \nHeritage to one month but rather work all year long to ensure that all \nHispanic Americans can equally participate in, and contribute to, the \nprogress of our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10657-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRAGEDY STRIKES AGAIN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is unfortunate that it sometimes seems \nto require high profile tragic school shootings to focus the Nation's \nattention on the easy access to guns by young adults and children. \nSadly, we find ourselves once again examining the subject in the \naftermath of not one, but two shootings.\n  On April 27, 1999, we paused in the Senate to observe a moment of \nsilence in tribute to those who died at Columbine High School and to \nexpress our sympathy for their loved ones. Since that tragedy, tens of \nthousands of people have been killed by guns and, according to the \nBrady Campaign, there is an unlocked gun in one of every eight family \nhomes.\n  On September 13, 2006, a 25-year-old-man opened fire in the cafeteria \nat Dawson College in Montreal, Canada. He began firing randomly at \nstudents killing one and injuring 19 others. Five of those injured are \nin critical condition. Wielding a rapid-fire rifle in addition to two \nother weapons, the shooter walked through the halls of the college \nshooting indiscriminately. Prior to the incident, the shooter had \nopenly expressed his fondness for the events surrounding the 1999 \nslaughter at Columbine High School. While this episode took place in \nCanada, similar incidences have occurred all too frequently in the \nUnited States.\n  On September 17, 2006, five Duquesne University basketball players \nwere shot while leaving a school dance. So far, two young men have been \narraigned on charges of attempted homicide, aggravated assault, \ncriminal conspiracy and weapons-related offenses. A 19-year-old woman \nhas been arrested on charges of reckless endangerment, carrying a \nfirearm without a license and criminal conspiracy. One player, remains \nin critical condition with one bullet and fragments of another in his \nhead.\n  It is impossible to come to terms with these or any of the other \nshooting tragedies that have claimed the lives of far too many young \npeople. Yet after such tragedies, we ask ourselves if they might have \nbeen prevented. The answer, of course, at least in part is yes. \nCongress can and must work to keep guns out of the hands of young \npeople.\n  What will it take to pass legislation that requires firearms to be \nsold or transferred with storage or safety devices? What will it take \nto pass child access prevention legislation, which would require adults \nto store firearms safely and securely in places that are reasonably \ninaccessible to children? Congress and the President should work to \nenact these and other common-sense gun safety reforms that will keep \nour young people alive and safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10657-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10657-S10658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PHYSICIAN REIMBURSEMENT\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak about \nan issue that would greatly impact this country's physicians and our \nconstituents ability to access care. The issue of physician \nreimbursements under Medicare is important to me and my Colorado \nconstituents. Congress was able to take steps to address the \nreimbursement issue for 2006, but once again physicians are faced with \nthe possibility of a decreased reimbursement for 2007. Many physicians \nand physician groups have contacted Congress, requesting that the \nproblem be addressed.\n  Ellice Zirinski, who works in Family Practice in Arvada, CO, wanted \nCongress to know that she would strongly urge them to take action and \nincrease Medicare reimbursement to physicians. Should reimbursement \ndecline as legislated, she could no longer afford to give care to her \npatients and stay in practice. She does not want to jeopardize her \npatients' access to care. We need to find a way to provide physicians \nwith a positive reimbursement before January 2007. For some time, \nphysicians in Colorado have been concerned with the possibility of a \nreduction in their reimbursement schedule.\n  I am greatly concerned with the fact that hospitals, nursing homes, \nand other Medicare providers continue to receive positive updates, \nwhile private physicians are forced to no longer accept Medicare \npatients, or, even worse, forced out of practice. Tom Mino, a Doctor of \nOsteopathy in Broomfield, CO, told me, ``I may have to consider a \nchange in occupation--or at least move away from solo practice.'' This \ntrend could result in more physicians practicing in an institutional \nsetting instead of private practice.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Religious \nLiberty and Charitable Donation Clarification Act of 2006. My \ndistinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator Obama, and I have worked \ndiligently and quickly to clarify the treatment of charitable \ncontributions in chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. As many of my \ncolleagues know, a bankruptcy court in the Northern District of New \nYork recently upheld an objection to the confirmation of a chapter 13 \nplan due to the inclusion of a charitable contribution in the \ndisposable income calculation. Shortly after learning of the decision \nI, along with Senators Grassley and Sessions, sent a letter to the \nDepartment of Justice expressing my concern about the treatment of \ncharitable contributions in the Chapter 13 context, and while I believe \nthe Department of Justice will affirm its policy of allowing charitable \ncontributions that are consistent with the Religious Liberty and \nCharitable Contribution Protection Act of 1998, I do not want the \nreligious practices and beliefs of individuals subject to the vagaries \nof judicial interpretation.\n  As a whole, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection \nAct of 2005, BAPCPA, was--and still is--a good bill. However, like many \nlarge bills, it was not perfect. As a key architect of the recent \nbankruptcy reforms, I can say without equivocation that Congress \nintended to preserve the Religious Liberty and Charitable Contribution \nProtection Act of 1998 in BAPCPA. Unfortunately, the Northern District \nof New York thought differently.\n  I do not like impromptu legislative responses to judicial decisions, \nparticularly ones with limited precedential value; however, I believe \nthat Senator Obama and I have put together a narrowly-tailored \nclarification that leaves little doubt about Congress' intent when it \npassed BAPCPA. I want to make it very clear that this bill does not, in \nany way, affirm the Northern District of New York Bankruptcy Court's \nreasoning in In re Diagostino. I agree with the Department of Justice's \nposition that charitable contributions consistent with the requirements \nof the 1998 Religious Liberty and Charitable Contribution Protection \nAct should be allowed under the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and \nConsumer Protection Act of 2005. The bill that Senator Obama and I \nintroduced is meant to simply clarify existing law in furtherance of \nthe Department's interpretation and Congress's intent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10658-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING AMERICAN INDIAN CODE TALKERS\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish to speak today of the Code Talkers \nRecognition Act, which passed the Senate last week with 79 cosponsors. \nThis bill would present commemorative medals to Sioux, Comanche, \nChoctaw, Sac and Fox, and any other Native American code talkers that \nserved during World War I and World War II in recognition of the \ncontributions of their service to the United States.\n  Earlier this summer, I, along with Senator John Thune, were able to \npresent Clarence Wolf Guts, our last remaining Lakota code talker, with \na star quilt on behalf of the National Indian Education Association. \nMr. Wolf Guts is now 83 years old and is of Oglala and Rosebud descent. \nMr. Wolf Guts attended St. Francis Indian School in Marty, SD, and \nspent most of his life living on the Pine Ridge Reservation. He now \nlives in a state veteran's home in Hot Springs, SD.\n  In his late teens, Mr. Wolf Guts enlisted in the Marines and served \nas a radio operator during World War II. He has become a spokesman \namong tribal elders and traditional leaders about the importance of \nkeeping native languages alive for future generations. He is very proud \nto be a veteran, a full-blooded Lakota, and a Lakota speaker.\n  Earlier this year, another Lakota code talker, Charles Whitepipe, \npassed away. Mr. Whitepipe, a Sicangu Lakota from the Rosebud tribe, \nvaliantly served in the Army as a Code Talker in World War II. He \nserved as a ``Forward Observer'' on Japanese-held islands in the South \nPacific, communicating by radio with a ship-based partner, using the \nLakota language to direct artillery fire from ships at sea onto the \nislands.\n  Other Lakota code talkers that will also be recognized in this \nlegislation include Eddie Eagle Boy, Simon Brokenleg, Iver Crow Eagle, \nSr., Edmund St. John, Walter C. John, John Bear King, Phillip \n``Stoney'' LaBlanc, Baptiste Pumpkinseed, and Guy Rondell.\n  During World War II, these men were Army radio operators who used \ntheir native Lakota, Nakota, and Dakota dialects to transmit strategic \nmessages to foil enemy surveillance in both the Pacific and European \ntheaters. There is no doubt that the bravery and the courage of Mr. \nWhitepipe and Mr. Wolf Guts, as well as the other code talkers, helped \nto make the United States the free and proud place it is today. While \nNavajos have received the most recognition, it is important to remember \nthat members of at least 17 other tribes also served as code talkers in \nWorld War I and World War II.\n  The syntax and tonal qualities of the native languages were so \ncomplex that no message transmitted by any code talker was ever decoded \nby the enemy. However, for the code talkers who returned home, there \nwere no parades or special recognition, as they were sworn to secrecy, \nan oath they kept and honored but one that robbed them of the accolades \nand place in history that they rightfully deserved.\n  The accomplishments of the code talkers were even more heroic, given \nthe cultural context in which they were operating. Subjected to \nalienation in their homeland and discouraged from speaking their native \nlanguages, they still stepped forward and developed the most \nsignificant and successful military code of their time. That spirit of \nmilitary service continues today. Native Americans make up a higher \npercentage of servicemen and servicewomen in the Armed Forces than any \nother ethnic group in America. They have served with honor in all of \nAmerica's wars, beginning with the Revolutionary War and on through our \ncurrent operations in Iraq.\n  I commend the work of Senators Inhofe, Grassley, Harkin and Thune for \ntheir work in moving this bill forward, as well as the leadership of \nthe Banking Committee, Senators Shelby and Sarbanes. It is now time to \nhonor all of our native code talkers that have contributed to the \nsafety of our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10658-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10658-S10659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TELEPHONE RECORDS AND PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT OF 2006\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have recently been reminded of the \ntremendous threat to consumer privacy posed by what is known as phone \npretexting--the use of fraud and deception to acquire consumer phone \nrecords. The investigation into pretexting at Hewlett-Packard is just \nthe latest example of why there is a need to enact legislation to \nsafeguard the privacy and security of Americans' sensitive personal \ndata.\n  Consumer telephone records have become a hot commodity and this \ninformation is a treasure trove for those who would misuse it to make a \nprofit or who exploit it for harmful purposes. More and more, this \nsensitive personal information is being collected, stored and \ndisseminated without our knowledge or consent.\n  Last Spring, the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously reported a \nbipartisan bill that would protect the privacy interests of millions of \nAmerican consumers who use cell phones, by making the act of pretexting \nillegal. The Telephone Records and Privacy Protection Act--TRAPP Act--\nS. 2178, clarifies that it is illegal to use deception and fraud to \nobtain and sell confidential phone records. The bill ensures that the \nDepartment of Justice has the legal authority to seek criminal \npenalties and up to 10 years imprisonment for anyone who engages in \npretexting. The legislation also preserves the rights of State and \nlocal governments to enforce their own privacy laws, to best protect \nthe privacy rights of consumers.\n  In April, the House unanimously passed an essentially identical phone \npretexting bill, H.R. 4709. The language used in that bill was worked \nout with Senators from both sides of the aisle before it was considered \nby the House, so that when adopted by the Senate it could be sent \ndirectly to the President\n\n[[Page S10659]]\n\nfor his signature. I have worked for months now to make progress on \nthat bill and it has been cleared for passage twice by all Democratic \nSenators. First, we cleared it with an amendment that would have also \npassed the Second Chance Act and consensus court security measures. \nWhen Senate Republicans refused to clear that measure, Senate Democrats \nalso cleared the bill for passage in the identical form that it passed \nthe House and without any amendments. An anonymous Republican hold on \nthe measure is preventing its passage.\n  I know of no legitimate reason for this delay. The Senate could pass \nthis bill today and send it to the President to be signed into law. \nInstead of passing this bipartisan privacy legislation, it appears this \nRepublican-led Congress will recess without acting on this bill--\nforcing millions of Americans to continue to play Russian roulette with \ntheir sensitive personal information.\n  This week the former chair of Hewlett Packard, Patricia Dunn, called \non Congress to pass bright-line laws regarding phone pretexting to \navoid a repeat of the fiasco at HP. The TRAPP Act would do exactly \nthat. This bill would help shut down the growing black market for \nconsumer telephone records.\n  I support this bill and I commend the bill's lead cosponsors in the \nSenate and the House--Senators Specter, Schumer and Durbin, and \nRepresentatives Lamar Smith and John Conyers--for their leadership on \nthis privacy issue. I hope whoever is objecting on the Republican side \nwill stop the needless delay of this legislation. If there is a \nlegitimate concern, come forward and work with us.\n  The Senate should also act on a more comprehensive privacy bill that \nChairman Specter and I have cosponsored--the Personal Data Privacy and \nSecurity Act, S. 1789. This important measure was favorably reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee last November. But, the Republican Senate \nleadership would not allow this bill to be considered by this Congress \neither.\n  Our bill requires companies that have databases with sensitive \npersonal information about Americans to establish and implement data \nprivacy and security programs. The bill also requires data brokers to \nprovide notice to consumers when their sensitive personal information \nhas been compromised.\n  We have a bill that significantly advances the ball in protecting the \nprivacy of all Americans, and I will continue to work to move this \nlegislation toward passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10659-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               U.N. SUPPORT OF THE CYPRIOT PEACE PROCESS\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the country of Cyprus has occupied a \nspecial place in my heart for many years. My admiration for the island \nand its people grew in recent months as Cypriots opened their arms to \nassist the thousands of American citizens who fled from Lebanon during \nthis summer's fighting between Hezbollah and Israel. This exceptional \ndisplay of Hellenic hospitality has reaffirmed Cyprus's importance as a \nsafe harbor amid the unsettled waters of the eastern Mediterranean and \na key partner for the United States.\n  For far too long, however, Cyprus has existed as an island divided. \nAn invasion by Turkey in 1974 needlessly separated the island's \nethnically Greek and Turkish citizens--two communities that had \nsuccessfully coexisted for centuries. A generation has now grown to \nadulthood on either side of a Green Line that segregates Cypriots from \nboth their peaceful shared history and their promising shared destiny. \nMr. President, I believe we must correct this wrong before another \ngeneration endures a similar fate.\n  In 2004, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan presented a plan \nto reunite the island's two communities. The Annan plan certainly \nwasn't perfect, but it brought the island closer to reunification than \nany peace initiative in the past three decades. After the plan failed \nto gain the support of the Greek Cypriot community in an April 2004 \nreferendum, the drive to unify the island largely stagnated, and the \nU.N. closed its ``good offices'' mission in Nicosia that had worked to \nfacilitate peace negotiations.\n  Over the summer, I have been encouraged by the first real signs of \nmovement toward a settlement since the Annan plan was rejected. Ibrahim \nGambari, the United Nations Under Secretary General for Political \nAffairs, visited Cyprus in July and presided over a joint meeting \nbetween the President of the Republic of Cyprus, Tassos Papadopoulos, \nand the head of the Turkish Cypriot community, Mehmet Ali Talat. The \ntwo leaders reaffirmed their commitment to seek a political settlement \nin an agreement signed on July 8. They are now poised to begin a new \nround of technical talks that I hope will move the peace process \nforward.\n  Mr. President, others have rightly stated that Cypriot problems need \nCypriot solutions, but I am convinced that those solutions won't be \nforthcoming without the forceful support of the international \ncommunity. For years, the United Nations has played a critical role in \nCyprus, maintaining a ceasefire and facilitating a political \nsettlement. Under Secretary Gambari will report to the U.N. Security \nCouncil in the beginning of December, and the Security Council and \nSecretary General will subsequently decide whether to renew the mandate \nof UNFICYP, the U.N. Peacekeeping mission in Cyprus, and reopen the \nSecretary General's good offices mission in Nicosia.\n  Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders should take advantage of this \nwindow of opportunity and launch the technical talks they committed to \nas part of the July 8 agreement. Once they do, the international \ncommunity should be ready to support them. I am convinced that given \nthe right conditions and adequate international backing, a solution in \nCyprus is both possible and attainable. I hope that members of the \nSecurity Council will reach the same conclusion and act accordingly \nwhen the issue is before them, and that the new U.N. Secretary General \nwill build on Secretary General Annan's leadership to facilitate a \npeaceful resolution of this long-running conflict.\n  When it finally happens, the reunification of Cyprus will have \nsignificance far beyond the shores of the Mediterranean. A united \nCyprus will stand as an example to the world of how different ethnic \ngroups can overcome past wrongs, bridge differences, and live together \nas neighbors. At a time when too many countries are beset by demons of \nethnic and sectarian hatred, it is more important than ever to find an \nanswer to the Cyprus question. If the United States and other members \nof the international community are willing to act as catalysts for a \npolitical settlement, I am confident that future generations of \nCypriots can enjoy the peace they rightly deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10659-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10659-S10660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PROSTATE CANCER AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, September is Prostate Cancer Awareness \nMonth, and I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to remind \nmen and the women who love them that early detection saves lives.\n  Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed nonskin cancer in \nAmerican men and it is one of the leading causes of cancer-related \ndeath among men. Approximately one out of every six men will develop it \nat some point in their lives. In fact, according to the American Cancer \nSociety, more than 230,000 new cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed \neach year in the United States and, sadly, about 27,000 sons, fathers, \nbrothers and husbands will die of the disease. Fortunately, through \nearly detection and treatment, fewer men are dying and more men are \nliving long and healthy lives following their diagnosis.\n  A simple blood test, the prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, test can \ndetect prostate cancer, and is usually administered by your regular \ndoctor. Health experts recommend that doctors offer men yearly \nscreening beginning at age 50. However, men with one or more high risk \nfactors should consider starting yearly testing at age 45 or earlier \nand some may choose to take a PSA test at age 40, to establish a \nbaseline level for future comparison.\n  Each year my wife Barbara and I sponsor a cancer booth at the South \nDakota State Fair in Huron, SD. For many years, we have been able to \nprovide free PSA tests to hundreds of men, and several people have \nreturned to the booth to tell us that the PSA test they\n\n[[Page S10660]]\n\ntook at the fair detected their cancer, and they are now on the road to \na full recovery. Barb and I are grateful that we are able to offer this \nservice, and that it is making a difference for South Dakotans.\n  Many individuals have had their own lives or the lives of family and \nfriends touched by cancer; I am so grateful that my own battle with \nthis disease had a successful outcome. Prostate cancer is often not an \neasy subject to discuss, but uncomfortable though the topic may be for \nsome, we must remember that early detection saves lives. My wife \nBarbara is a two-time cancer survivor, and her experience taught me \nthat early detection and swift treatment is the best defense in \nfighting any form of cancer.\n  I am proud to add my voice to those who are working to fight prostate \ncancer, and to commend them on their indefatigable efforts to raise \nawareness of the risks, to promote early detection and treatment, and \nto further our efforts to understand and eliminate this disease. I urge \nmen to discuss their risks and screening options with their doctor, and \nI urge women to raise this important topic with the men in their lives. \nThrough screening and early detection, we truly can save lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10660-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10660-S10661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HEARING CANCELLATION\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nwas supposed to hold its third hearing on Darfur in as many years this \nweek, but it was postponed because the administration couldn't field \nthe appropriate witnesses. In a region where each day means hundreds of \ninnocent lives lost and thousands more terrorized and displaced, time \nis not on our side.\n  I want to begin my statement today by acknowledging that there have \nbeen some positive developments over the past month relating to the \ninternational community's response to the violence in Darfur. I \nwelcomed the passage of United Nations Resolution 1706, a U.S.-backed \ninitiative authorizing a 22,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping force for \nDarfur. The President's appointment of Andrew Natsios as his Special \nEnvoy to Sudan was long overdue. And, while it isn't perfect, the \nrecently passed bipartisan Darfur Peace and Accountability Act is a \nfirst step that reaffirms the United States' determination to lead the \nway on the long path ahead to achieving a sustainable peace in Sudan.\n  Unfortunately, none of these developments have changed conditions on \nthe ground. Nor have the strong words that our Government or the \ninternational community used to condemn the perpetrators of violence in \nDarfur over the past few years. In December 2003, the administration \nissued a statement expressing ``deep concern'' about the humanitarian \nand security situation in Darfur and calling ``on the Government of \nSudan to take concrete steps to control the militia groups it has \narmed, to avoid attacks against civilians and to fully facilitate the \nefforts of the international humanitarian community to respond to \ncivilian needs.''\n  Had Secretary Rice or Ambassador Bolton found the time to speak with \nus this week, they no doubt would have reiterated the administration's \nboast that the United States has been the largest single contributor of \nhumanitarian aid to Darfur and the most generous supporter of the \nexisting African Union force. Similarly, some of my colleagues in the \nSenate are quick to point out that we were the first to condemn the \natrocities in Darfur as genocide in July 2004 and have appropriated \nmore than $1.5 billion to ease the suffering of innocent Darfurians \nsince then.\n  I do not wish to imply that these statements and funds are \nunimportant. But they are not enough.\n  For those of us with a long history of engagement in Africa, today's \ncrisis in Darfur is eerily familiar. After all, this is the same regime \nwe saw attack its own citizens in indiscriminate bombing raids and \nobstruct humanitarian access during two decades of bloody civil war \nwith southern Sudan. The genocide underway in Darfur should not be \nconsidered in isolation but in the larger context of Sudan's tumultuous \nhistory. We cannot afford to forget that more than 2 million Sudanese \nwere killed and 4.5 million displaced in the north-south civil war that \nended with last year's Comprehensive Peace Agreement. That fragile \npeace, as well as May's Darfur Peace Agreement, now hang in the balance \nas the Sudanese Government renews its practice of organized atrocities \nas a method of governance.\n  More than 2 years after our Government called the violence in Darfur \na ``genocide,'' the United States must lead the international community \nin taking action to stop the ongoing violence and to mitigate further \nviolence.\n  First, the United States must throw its entire weight behind \nconcerted diplomatic action to convince Khartoum to allow a U.N. \npeacekeeping force into Darfur. This means that the full array of \neconomic and political incentives at our disposal should be devoted to \npressuring those who persist in supporting Khartoum--namely, China, \nRussia, and the Arab League--to isolate the genocidal regime until it \nstops targeting civilians and cooperates with U.N. peacekeepers. These \ncountries must not allow their complacency to become complicity in the \ncrimes against humanity being perpetrated in Darfur.\n  Second, it means bolstering the courageous but inadequate African \nUnion peacekeeping force that has been doing its best to protect the \npeople of Darfur for more than 2 years. At this point, the A.U. force \nis our only vehicle for establishing stability throughout the region. \nUnfortunately, in its current form, it is incapable of doing so without \nsignificant assistance from the international community. The United \nStates must lead a renewed international effort to provide whatever \nfinancial, logistical, technical, and military resources are necessary \nfor the deployment of the robust United Nations peacekeeping force as \nsoon as possible.\n  Third, the U.S. Government must engage fully in the work required to \nfind a political solution to conflict in Darfur. This means \nestablishing a peace process that will expand the Darfur Peace \nAgreement to incorporate all militias and political factions in Darfur, \nalong with the Government in Khartoum. While I do not doubt the good \nintentions of former Deputy Secretary Zoellick, his efforts to create a \npeace agreement were hasty and incomplete. We will need sustained, \ndetailed, and aggressive engagement with all of the parties to the \nconflict before we can expect lasting results. While I would like to \nthink that building on the Darfur Peace Agreement might work, it may \nnot. We need to be prepared to start from scratch and build an \nagreement in which all parties can find common ground.\n  We also need to begin preparing to introduce additional, more \nforceful options to stop the genocide. We must signal to Khartoum that \nthe international community will not tolerate continued violence and \nthat it is prepared to use forceful measures to stop it. A NATO-\nenforced no-fly zone over Darfur would halt the Sudanese Government's \nindiscriminate bombing campaign and escorts for humanitarian envoys \nwould ensure that aid reaches those who desperately need it. We need to \nexplore this option and identify other avenues to create humanitarian \nspace throughout the region.\n  The President's new special envoy must get to work immediately. He \nmust work to bring an unprecedented diplomatic force on Khartoum, and \nhe must begin preparing other, more aggressive options should \nconditions continue to worsen.\n  Finally, we must signal clearly to those who commit crimes against \nhumanity that the world is watching and that they will be held \naccountable for their actions via targeted and aggressive sanctions--\nincluding financial and travel restrictions--and criminal prosecution. \nThis climate of impunity must be eliminated so that organized \natrocities do not become a widespread governance tool.\n  I would like to close by saying that we should not lose sight of the \nbroader, long-term objective of sustainable peace throughout Sudan. We \nmust devise a comprehensive strategy for expanding the Darfur Peace \nAgreement to include those parties that have not yet signed and for \ninstituting and strengthening mechanisms to prevent parties from \nbacksliding into full-scale conflict.\n  Our experience with the Sudanese Government over the past two decades \nhas shown that words mean little. Without immediate and vigorous \naction, these are only more empty promises to the people of Darfur. \nTime is\n\n[[Page S10661]]\n\nnot on our side; we cannot afford to delay any longer or defer to the \nobstructionist tactics of brutal regimes. The people of Sudan deserve \nmore than our outrage; they deserve our action. And the time to act is \nnow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10661-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE NEED FOR REAUTHORIZATION OF PUBLIC LAW 106-393\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to make a few comments regarding the \nSecure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act, or County \nPayments Act as it has been nicknamed.\n  Today is a sad day for the 780 counties that benefit from the County \nPayment Act because with the last day of this fiscal year, the act \nexpires.\n  In 2000, the Congress passed Public Law 106-393 to address the needs \nof the forest counties of America and to focus on creating a new \ncooperative partnership between citizens in forest counties and our \nFederal land management to develop forest health improvement projects \non public lands and simultaneously stimulate job development and \ncommunity economic stability.\n  The act has been an enormous success in achieving and even surpassing \nthe goals of Congress. This act has restored programs for students in \nrural schools and prevented the closure of numerous isolated rural \nschools. It has been a primary funding mechanism to provide rural \nschool students with educational opportunities comparable to suburban \nand urban students. Over 4,400 rural schools receive funds because of \nthis act.\n  Next, the act has allowed rural county road districts and county road \ndepartments to address the severe maintenance backlog. Snow removal has \nbeen restored for citizens, tourists, and school buses. Bridges have \nbeen upgraded and replaced and culverts that are hazardous to fish \npassage have been upgraded and replaced.\n  In addition, over 70 Resource Advisory Committees, or RACs have been \nformed. These RACs cover our largest 150 forest counties. Nationally \nthese l5-person diverse RAC stakeholder committees have studied and \napproved over 2,500 projects on Federal forestlands and adjacent public \nand private lands. These projects have addressed a wide variety of \nimprovements drastically needed on our national forests. Projects have \nincluded fuels reduction, habitat improvement, watershed restoration, \nroad maintenance and rehabilitation, reforestation, campground and \ntrail improvement, and noxious weed eradication.\n  RACs are a new and powerful partnership between county governments \nand the land management agencies. They are rapidly building the \ncapacity for collaborative public land management decisionmaking in \nover 150 of our largest forest counties in America and are reducing the \ngridlock over public land management, community by community.\n  The legacy of this act over the last few years is positive and \nsubstantial. This law should be extended so it can continue to benefit \nthe forest counties, their schools, and continue to contribute to \nimproving the health of our national forests.\n  If we do not work to reauthorize this act, all of the progress of the \nlast 6 years will be lost. Schools in timber-dependent communities will \nlose a substantial part of their funding. These school districts will \nhave to start making tough budget decisions such as keeping or \ncanceling after school programs, sports programs, music programs, and \ntrying to determine what is the basic educational needs of our \nchildren. Next, counties will have to reprioritize road maintenance so \nthat only the essential services of the county are met because that is \nall they will be able to afford.\n  Thirty of our colleagues have joined Mr. Wyden and myself in \nrecognizing the importance of the reauthorization of this act by \ncosponsoring S. 267. And while we have run out of time in this fiscal \nyear, I look forward to working with my colleagues in the lameduck \nsession to address this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10661-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING NATIONAL PUBLIC LANDS DAY\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, on September 30, will once again observe \nNational Public Lands Day. For the 13th straight year, thousands of \ncitizens across the country help clean up public parks, rivers, lakes, \nforests, rangelands, and beaches. These volunteers will hit the ground \nrunning and spruce up trails, build bridges, plant trees, and much \nmore. I commend each and everyone of them for their important public \nservice. Their work inspires us to step back and consider just what our \npublic lands mean to us.\n  Almost 100 years ago, the great conservationist President Teddy \nRoosevelt addressed a special session of Congress on the subject of our \nnatural resources and spoke words that should be listened to carefully \nby everyone who has an interest in keeping the United States the most \nprosperous and dynamic nation on the face of the Earth. ``These \nresources, which form the common basis of our welfare, can be wisely \ndeveloped, rightly used, and prudently conserved only by the common \naction of all the people . . .'' Listen to those words and notice the \nwise approach of a man considered one of our most radical \nconservationists, a President who put 234 million acres into the public \ntrust. This is not a man who lived on the ideological extremes. He did \nnot advocate roping off all the land and allowing no admittance. Nor \nwould he stand by and let the land be ransacked and misused. Let me \nspeak again his words: ``. . . wisely developed, rightly used, and \nprudently conserved . . .'' That approach was correct in 1909, and it \nis the right one now.\n  Today's younger generation understands that our natural resources are \nnot limitless, that we can not endlessly exploit them. They are more \nenvironmentally savvy perhaps than their parents. And I believe they \nalso grasp the need for smart conservation, for devising collaborative \npolicies that ensure public access to public land now and in the \nfuture.\n  Some lands ought to have restrictions on use. I do not dispute that, \nand I do not advocate any careless ``rollback'' of environmental \nregulations. But this is not a time to exact an economic toll on our \ncountry by ignoring the resources available for use in our public \nlands. It is a time to tap into our ingenuity and devise ways to \nutilize them while responsibly mitigating any environmental impact. \nThis is not an insurmountable challenge; Americans have accomplished \nmore difficult tasks in our history.\n  Lastly, I would like to emphasize the issue of public ownership. \nThese lands are owned by the people. We policymakers need to always \nkeep that in mind and not just pay this fact lipservice. National \nPublic Lands Day is a perfect time to remind ourselves who owns this \nland. We must be flexible with the different types of recreation and \naccess to public land that people want.\n  Mr. President, in closing, let me add that Americans have always had \na strong relationship with public lands and have always understood the \nneed to preserve them for posterity. Sometimes we hear it said that \npeople only care for what they themselves privately owned that what is \nheld in common will often fall into disrepair. The work that will be \naccomplished this September 30th disproves that idea. And I am \noptimistic that future generations will be enjoying the same public \nlands we do today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10661-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10661-S10662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF RICHARD HOAGLAND\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to speak today about an issue of \ngreat importance to the Armenian community, the nomination of Richard \nHoagland to be the next U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Armenia.\n  I respect the office of the President and the powers that are granted \nto appoint individuals that are in support of the administration's \nagenda; however, there is justifiable concern about the recall of our \nAmbassador to a regionally important country and the subsequent \nnomination of his replacement. The reported reason for the recall of \nAmbassador Evans revolves around the failure of our Government to \nofficially recognize the Armenian genocide. That is unacceptable.\n  Once again, I want to go on record as being opposed to the continued \ndenial of the Armenian genocide. The bigger issue is not that of an \nappointment of this or any official who recognizes his duties and will \nbe diligent in carrying them out but of acknowledging the genocide as \npart of an appropriate foreign policy.\n\n[[Page S10662]]\n\n  I have long sought to bring recognition to the crimes perpetuated \nagainst the Armenian people as genocide. In fact, I have introduced S. \nRes. 320, which affirms the Armenian genocide. The resolution calls on \nthe President to state that the slaughter of Armenians by the Ottoman \nEmpire was genocide and to recall the proud history of U.S. \nintervention in opposition to the Armenian genocide. It is important \nthat the U.S. once and for all reaffirms the incontestable facts of \nhistory and allows our representatives to speak out about the crimes \nperpetuated against the Armenian people from 1915 to 1923. It is my \nsincere hope that this legislation comes before the full Senate soon.\n  As we fight to ensure freedom around the globe, we must ensure that \nour future reflects the lessons of the past. In this case the facts are \nincontestable. Armenians were subjected to deportation, expropriation, \nabduction, torture, massacre, and starvation. Yes, the Armenian people \nwere victims of genocide. Genocide at any time, at any place, is wrong \nand needs to be confronted and remembered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10662-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          UNFINISHED BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as the Republican leadership gavels this \nsession to a close, I am disappointed by the inaction and missed \nopportunities on America's most crucial priorities.\n  First, although we did finally pass a long overdue port security \nbill, we still have a long way to go to protect our infrastructure. We \nknew before 9/11 that our ports are soft targets, and since that \nterrible day, many experts have continued to warn us that they are \nvulnerable to attack.\n  Since the 9/11 attacks, we have spent only $984 million on port \nsecurity grants, despite Coast Guard estimates that $5.4 billion is \nneeded over 10 years. That total includes the grants that were released \nthis week.\n  To make matters worse, port security funds aren't reaching the ports \nthat need them the most. In California, port security grants awarded by \nthe Bush administration have fallen from $33.3 million in fiscal year \n2005 to $13.3 million in fiscal year 2006, a staggering 60 percent \nreduction. Despite the fact that California's ports carry over 47 \npercent of all goods imported into the United States, we are receiving \nonly eight percent of the total port security grants funding.\n  In addition, the final port security bill lacks the Senate-passed \ntransit and rail security provisions. The last three major attacks have \nbeen on transit systems in Madrid, London, and in July, Mumbai. \nAccording to APTA, there are $6 billion in transit security needs \nacross the country. But last year, Congress appropriated only $150 \nmillion for transit and rail security. That is barely a drop in the \nbucket. Americans take 33 million trips on transit each day. We must do \nmore to protect them.\n  The Senate bill also does not consider aviation security. Yes, \naviation security has improved greatly in the last five years. But five \nyears after 9/11, we are still not screening cargo loaded on board \npassenger planes. I am pleased that DHS will launch a pilot program at \nSan Francisco Airport, SFO, this October to check all commercial cargo \nfor explosives on passenger flights, but we should be doing this at \nevery airport in America to ensure the safety of passengers and the \nsolvency of the airline industry.\n  But until that time, at the very least, we need to use at least one \nblast resistant cargo container on passenger planes that carry cargo. \nThis was one of the major recommendations of the \n9/11 Commission. When I tried to offer an amendment to do just that, \nthe Republican managers of the bill blocked my amendment.\n  Cost is not the problem here. The price to place one blast-resistant \ncontainer on planes is about $75 million or a little more than the \nprice of 5 hours in Iraq. The American people deserve to know that we \nare doing everything we can to keep them safe. We cannot allow \nterrorists to exploit holes in our aviation security system.\n  Second, although we passed border fence legislation, we failed to act \non the AgJOBS bill, which would provide a much-needed solution to the \nfarm labor shortage crisis that is threatening our nation's farm \neconomy. In California and across America, fruit and vegetables are \ndying on the vine and rotting in the fields because there are no \nworkers to harvest the crops.\n  Earlier today, my friend from Georgia, Senator Chambliss, came to the \nfloor to speak against the AgJOBS bill. He said that as he has traveled \nthe country this year holding farm bill hearings, every farmer he met \ntold him to oppose AgJOBS.\n  Yet, if the Senator from Georgia had come to California, our Nation's \nlargest agricultural State, he would have heard from farmers who \ndesperately need and want the AgJobs bill passed now. And they are not \nalone. Farmers in States experiencing labor shortages in Idaho, \nWashington, New York and Florida, among others, want this bill, as do a \nbroad coalition of pro-agriculture groups.\n  The H-2A program is badly in need of reform, and the AgJOBS bill, \nwhich the Senate has already passed with more than 60 votes, enacts \nthose meaningful reforms. These AgJobs will save users money, simplify \nthe program, streamline the litigation process, and bring stability to \nour nation's agricultural work force.\n  And third, we also failed to stand up for fair and smooth elections. \nOn Tuesday, Senators Dodd, Feingold and I introduced the Confidence in \nVoting Act of 2006, S. 3943, a simple bill that would reimburse \nelectoral jurisdictions for the cost of contingency paper ballots for \nthe General Election. Under the bill, the jurisdictions would be \nreimbursed for their documented costs up to $0.75 per contingency paper \nballot printed.\n  This bill is timely in light of the recent problems with voting \nmachines in Maryland, Illinois, Ohio and other states. It is clear that \nmany jurisdictions that use electronic voting machines and other voting \nsystems will need to have a backup plan for the upcoming November 7, \n2006, general election.\n  The Confidence in Voting Act of 2006 would work within the existing \nstructure of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to provide reimbursement \nfunding for jurisdictions that provide a contingency paper ballot in \naddition to their existing voting system. The estimated maximum cost of \nthis measure is approximately $15 million a small price to pay to \nensure that every American's vote is counted.\n  The American people deserve better. We face great challenges that \nwill determine our safety and prosperity for years to come. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting long overdue legislation for the \nsecurity of our infrastructure, to aid our farmers, and to ensure our \nright to fair and accountable elections.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10662-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10662-S10663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SURVIVOR BENEFITS PLAN\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, although we have accomplished \nmuch to be proud of in this Defense authorization bill, I am profoundly \ndisappointed that once again we have failed to eliminate the SBP-DIC \noffset.\n  For the last 5 years I have been talking about the unfair and painful \noffset of the Defense Department's survivors benefits plan against \nVeterans Affairs' dependency and indemnity compensation, or DIC. This \noffset mistreats the survivors of our servicemembers who die on active \nduty now and our 100 percent disabled military retirees who purchased \nthis benefit at the end of their careers. It is wrong, we know it, and \nthe Senate has tried to fix it--but we have fallen short again.\n  I have reminded the Senate of the Good Book's words, that in God's \neyes the true measure of our faith is how we look after orphans and \nwidows in their distress. And they are in distress. We are in a violent \nstruggle around the world with brutal and vicious enemies. Sadly, \nAmericans are lost every day.\n  We must never forget that the families left behind by our courageous \nmen and women in uniform bear the greatest pain. Their survivors' lives \nare forever altered; their futures left unclear. They suffer the \nenduring cost of the ultimate sacrifice, and the Nation that asked for \nthat sacrifice must honor it. We are the ones who must recognize that \nthe Nation has an obligation to those who give their lives for our \ncountry.\n  This conference report does not include the Senate's provision to \neliminate this offset. In the Senate, we included the funds necessary \nto support\n\n[[Page S10663]]\n\nthis change in our version of the budget resolution. Accordingly, the \nArmed Services Committee included a provision to eliminate the offset, \nthanks to our chairman, Senator John Warner. However, the conference \ncould not find a way to bring this to closure. Our eligible survivors \nare again let down.\n  Mr. President, I have felt honored over the years to champion this \nimportant change in our survivor benefits system. And, although \ndisappointed, I am no less honored or resolved to continue this fight. \nI thank my many Senate colleagues who have felt as strongly as I about \ntaking care of our military widows and orphans. I look forward to \nworking with them again when we bring this to the Senate again in our \nnext session. Our military men and women, and their survivors would \nnever give up; neither will we.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10663-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10663-S10664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  GLOBAL WARMING REDUCTION ACT OF 2006\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today as the lead cosponsor for the \nKerry-Snowe Global Warming Reduction Act of 2006. Six years into the \n21st century, global warming should be on a trajectory toward solutions \n. . . international and domestic policies confronting climate change \nshould already be in place. We believe that our bill will ultimately \nlead to decisive action to minimize the many dangers posed by global \nwarming by calling for an 85 percent reduction of greenhouse gas \nemissions no later than 2050. Thankfully, Senator Kerry and I are not \nworking in a policy vacuum as the United States is a party to the 1992 \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which has the \nobjective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the \natmosphere at a level that would prevent ``dangerous anthropogenic \ninterference'' with the climate system.\n  The risks associated with a temperature increase above two degrees \ncentigrade are grave, including the disintegration of the Greenland ice \nsheet, which, if it were to melt completely, would raise global average \nsea level by approximately 23 feet, devastating many of the world's \ncoastal areas and population centers. The Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change projects that temperatures will rise between 1.4 to 5.8 \ndegrees centigrade, or 2.5 to 10.4 degrees fahrenheit, by the end of \nthe century, under a range of expected emissions trends.\n  The Kerry-Snowe bill will map out the way to stabilization through a \ncap and trade system for major sectors of our society and establish the \nclimate reinvestment fund consisting of amounts collected from carbon \nauctions of allowances and civil penalties. The fund will be used for \ninvestment in clean energy research and technology. The bill also \nprovides for a research and development program on global climate \nchange and abrupt climate change research. We also call for a renewable \nportfolio standard requiring 20 percent of electricity from renewable \nelectricity by 2020, and an updated Renewable Fuel Standard and E85 \ninfrastructure requirements of 10 percent by 2020.\n  The act also contains vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards for \ncars and light-duty vehicles as well as medium and heavy-duty vehicles. \nImportantly, our bill includes a resolution expressing the urgent need \nfor the administration to reengage in international climate \nnegotiations.\n  I do not come lightly nor lately to the climate change issue. That is \nwhy, this past year, when asked by three major independent think \ntanks--the Center for American Progress in the United States, the \nInstitute for Public Policy Research in the U.K. and the Australia \nInstitute--I accepted the co-chairmanship of the high level \nInternational Climate Change Taskforce--the ICCT--to chart a way \nforward on climate change on a parallel track with the Kyoto Protocol \nprocess. This led me to meetings both in Washington and London with my \nCochair, the Rt. Honorable Stephen Byers of the U.K. for the \ninternational, cross-party, cross-sector collaboration of leaders from \npublic service, science, business, and civil society from both \ndeveloped and developing countries.\n  We set out a pathway to solve climate change issues in tandem \ncollaboratively finding common ground through recommendations that are \nboth ambitious and realistic to engage all countries, and, critically, \nincluding those not bound by the Kyoto Protocol and major developing \ncountries. Our ICCT report, ``Meeting the Climate Challenge,'' \nrecommends ways to involve the world's largest economies in the effort, \nincluding the U.S. and major developing nations, focusing on creating \nnew agreements to achieve the deployment of clean energy technologies \nand a new global policy framework that is both inclusive and fair. Like \nthe Kerry-Snowe legislation, the ICCT Report calls for the \nestablishment of a long-term objective of preventing global average \ntemperature from rising more than 2 degrees centigrade.\n  The taskforce arrived at the 2 degrees centigrade temperature \nincrease goal on the basis of an extensive review of the relevant \nscientific literature that shows that, as the ICCT Report states:\n       Beyond the 2 degrees centigrade level, the risks to human \n     societies and ecosystems grow significantly. It is likely, \n     for example, that average temperature increases larger than \n     this will entail substantial agricultural losses, will \n     greatly increase the numbers of people at risk of water \n     shortages, and widespread adverse health impacts.\n\n  Our ICCT Report goes on to say that:\n\n       Climate science is not yet able to specify the trajectory \n     of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases that \n     corresponds precisely to any particular global temperature \n     rise. Based on current knowledge, however, it appears that \n     achieving a high probability of limiting global average \n     temperature rise to 2 degrees centigrade will require that \n     the increase in greenhouse-gas concentrations as well as all \n     the other warming and cooling influences on global climate in \n     the year 2100, as compared with 1750, should add up to a net \n     warming no greater than what would be associated with a \n     CO2 concentration of about 400 parts per million \n     (ppm).\n\n  The Kerry-Snowe bill reverses the growth of greenhouse gas emissions \nstarting in 2010 and then progresses to more rapid reductions over \ntime, out to 2050, meant to protect against a temperature rise above 2 \ndegrees centigrade, which is predicted to mean that global atmospheric \nconcentrations of carbon dioxide will not exceed 450 parts per million. \nThe bill gets the US on the right track, but at the same time avoiding \nany negative impact on our economy.\n  Achieving success for our policy imperatives means disabusing \nskeptics and opponents alike of cherished mythologies that \nenvironmental protection and economic growth are mutually exclusive. \nThe irony is both are actually increasingly interdependent and will \nonly become more so as the 21st century progresses. Robust companies \ndedicated to reducing emissions are proof-positive ``going-green'' \nrepresents a burgeoning sector of our economy, not the drain and \nhindrance we've been led to believe for so many years.\n  And to their credit the most progressive U.S. companies have reduced \nemissions even further than required in climate bills offered in the \nCongress to date. In an act of economic acumen, they are hedging their \nbets by adopting internal targets--and, these companies are saving \nmoney by reducing their energy consumption and positioning themselves \nto compete in the growing global market for climate-friendly \ntechnologies. Any cost-conscious CFO or forward-thinking CEO for that \nmatter should admit that to prevent pollution now will most certainly \ncost less than cleaning it up later.\n  And the economics of prevention and stewardship resonate more when \nyou consider property that erodes because of rising sea levels, farm \nland that fails to yield crops and becomes barren and arid, and revenue \nopportunities squandered because of dwindling fishing stocks caused by \nhotter temperatures. These represent real costs to the bottom line not \nto mention irreparable damage to our health and quality of life.\n  Mr. President, temperatures are rising to levels the earth has not \nexperienced for more than a thousand years. The snows of Kilimanjaro \nare melting so fast that they may completely vanish in 15 years. \nAlaska's average temperature has increased nearly five and a half \ndegrees over the past 30 years and explains melting permafrost, sagging \nroads, and dying forests. A Peruvian glacier in the Andes Mountain, as \nreported by The Washington Post, is receding at a rate of 360 yards per \nyear, up from a recession rate of just four\n\n[[Page S10664]]\n\nyards per year for most of the 1960s and 70s. There is the massive \ndecline in coral reefs critical to sea life worldwide. And in my state \nof Maine, softwood trees--the heart of our papermaking industry--and \nsugar maple trees that spur a large tourist industry are in danger of \nmoving northward over the next 50 years, along with our annual potato \ncrop worth approximately $110 million.\n  We obviously do not have time in this Congress to debate the Kerry-\nSnowe bill, but we plan to use our bill as a marker to start the debate \nin the 110th Congress. The United States Congress is fully capable of \nenacting policies that change our climate for the better and guarantee \na better quality of life for the generations to follow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10664-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EXTENSION OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

Mr. President, like many in Congress, I am disappointed \nthat we are adjourning Congress for the October recess without enacting \ncomprehensive U.S. Small Business Administration disaster assistance \nreforms. As our small businesses impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita last year can attest, this is an agency that is in woeful need of \nsubstantive reforms to its Disaster Assistance Program. Our businesses \nhad to wait 4 to 6 months for SBA disaster loans to be approved, and \nsome are still waiting to this day, for loan amounts to be disbursed.\n  For my part, I have worked for the past year to enact substantive SBA \ndisaster reforms to ensure that `lessons learned' from Katrina and Rita \nwere incorporated and that businesses nationwide could count on a \nbetter prepared and more efficient SBA should a disaster strike their \ncommunity. Under the leadership of the chair and ranking member of the \nSenate Small Business Committee, Senators Olympia Snowe and John Kerry, \nwe sent to the Senate floor bipartisan legislation, S. 3778, which \nalong with reauthorizing SBA programs, also enacts comprehensive SBA \ndisaster reforms. Instead of working with us to take up and pass this \nimportant bill, the administration has frustrated this bill's passage \nat every turn and will not allow it to the Senate floor for \nconsideration--almost 9 weeks after it was introduced. I am concerned \nabout this lack of urgency from the SBA and the administration so just \nthis week, I sent a letter to the new SBA Administrator Steve Preston. \nIn this letter, I requested his cooperation with our committee to pass \nthis important legislation before Congress adjourns at the end of the \nyear.\n  I will ask that a copy of this September 27, 2006, letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  As we adjourn tonight, I note that we are set to pass legislation \nwhich temporarily extends programs under the Small Business Act until \nFebruary 2, 2007. Although I do believe it is essential to extend these \nSBA programs, I worked with my colleague Senator Kerry to revise this \ndate to November 17, 2006. This November date would have ensured that \nthe Congress would have to return in November and at least attempt to \npass SBA Disaster reforms. Instead, with these programs authorized \nthrough February 2, 2007, the Congress will adjourn in September 2006 \nand not take up SBA reauthorization until at least February 2007. I am \ndisappointed by this development because, as elected officials, I \nbelieve it sends the wrong signal to our small business community.\n  If the Congress, in partnership with the SBA, does not address these \nsystemic problems now, I am afraid that it will continue to plague the \nSBA's disaster response for future disasters. I believe there is a \ngeneral consensus that these reforms need to get done. Therefore, I \nwill continue my work with my colleagues from sides of the aisle to \nmake these essential improvements this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter to which I \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 27, 2006.\n     Hon. Steven C. Preston,\n     Administrator, U.S. Small Business Administration, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Administrator Preston: Let me take this opportunity to \n     again congratulate you on your confirmation as Administrator \n     of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). Your \n     management experience and passion to serve will prove \n     extremely helpful to you in this challenging position.\n       I write you today because, as a member of the Senate \n     Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, as well as \n     senator from a state hit hard by both Hurricanes Katrina and \n     Rita, I believe it is my duty to ensure that we implement \n     substantive changes to SBA's Disaster Assistance Program \n     during this session of Congress.\n       The SBA's response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita was too \n     slow and lacking in urgency-threatening the very survival of \n     our affected businesses. A year has passed since Hurricanes \n     Katrina and Rita, yet while Congress is currently acting on \n     extensive reforms for the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n     (FEMA), there has been only incremental changes to SBA's \n     Disaster Assistance Program. That is why I am pleased to \n     learn that you have recently created the Accelerated Disaster \n     Response Initiative to identify and help implement process \n     improvements to enable the SBA to respond more quickly in \n     assisting businesses and homeowners in need of assistance \n     after a disaster. I applaud these efforts and your leadership \n     on this issue. But much more must be done to address the \n     systemic problems that led to delays and inaction post-\n     Katrina and Rita.\n       For our part, the Senate is also attempting to address the \n     multiple problems that hampered SBA's ability to assist \n     impacted Gulf Coast small businesses and homeowners. Under \n     the leadership of the Chair and Ranking Member of the Senate \n     Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Senators \n     Snowe and Kerry, the committee voted unanimously to approve \n     S. 3778, the ``Small Business Reauthorization and \n     Improvements Act of 2006'' and sent it to the full Senate for \n     consideration. A copy of the bill is attached for your \n     convenience. This bipartisan legislation re-authorizes SBA \n     programs, and also of great importance to me and my \n     constituents, makes essential reforms to SBA's Disaster \n     Assistance Program. However, Since S. 3778 was introduced on \n     August 2, 2006, almost nine weeks ago, it has been blocked \n     from consideration and the Committee is still waiting for \n     budget information so that it may file its report on the \n     bill. It is my understanding that the administration and SBA \n     has several concerns about this bill in its current form.\n       I am very concerned at this apparent deadlock, a deadlock \n     which threatens our bipartisan efforts to implement \n     comprehensive SBA Disaster Assistance reforms before the end \n     of the year. In particular, I believe that there must be SBA \n     reforms in the following areas:\n       Short-Term Assistance: Following Katrina and Rita small \n     businesses waited, on average, four to six months for \n     approvals and disbursements on SBA Disaster Loans. In order \n     to ensure the long-term survival of small businesses impacted \n     by a catastrophic disaster, SBA needs to be in the business \n     of short-term recovery-by providing either emergency bridge \n     loans or grants.\n       Disaster Loan Process for Homeowners: While SBA's mission \n     is to ``aid, counsel, assist and protect, insofar as is \n     possible, the interests of small business concerns'' it also \n     has the added responsibility of helping affected homeowners \n     rebuild their housing post-disaster. Katrina and Rita \n     resulted in record numbers of SBA Disaster Loan applications \n     from homeowners, which strained SBA's existing resources and \n     personnel. If the SBA must bear this responsibility, the \n     agency should improve the process as well as possibly seek \n     greater coordination and cooperation with the U.S. Department \n     of Housing and Urban Development on disaster housing \n     assistance.\n       Expedited Disaster Loans to Businesses: The SBA currently \n     has no mechanism in place to expedite Disaster Loans to \n     impacted businesses that are either a major source of \n     employment or that can demonstrate a vital contribution to \n     recovery efforts in the area, such as businesses who \n     construct housing, provide building materials, or conduct \n     debris removal. The SBA need the ability to fast-track loans \n     to these businesses, in order to jumpstart local economies \n     and recovery efforts.\n\n[[Page S10665]]\n\n       Economic Injury Disaster Loans: Although Katrina and Rita \n     directly affected businesses along the Gulf Coast, additional \n     businesses in the region, as well as the rest of the country, \n     were economically impacted by the storms. The SBA must have \n     the ability to provide nationwide, or perhaps regional, \n     economic injury disaster loans to businesses which can \n     demonstrate economic distress or disruption from a future \n     major disaster.\n       Loss Verification and Loan Processing: Following the Gulf \n     Coast hurricanes, the SBA struggled for months to hire enough \n     staff to inspect losses and process loan applications. \n     Although SBA now has trained reserves to handle such surges \n     in demand, the SBA also needs the permanent authority to \n     enter into agreements with qualified private lenders and \n     credit unions to process Disaster Loans and provide loss \n     verification services.\n       Administrator Preston, I was impressed by your expressed \n     willingness to be a bridge between Congress and the White \n     House. For the SBA to truly bring its disaster capabilities \n     to the next level, I believe that it must work in concert \n     with the Congress. Together, we must remove layers of \n     bureaucracy and red tape, which, following Katrina and Rita, \n     both overwhelmed and frustrated dedicated SBA employees and \n     those affected by the hurricane must also give the SBA new \n     tools to ensure that problems that occurred post-Katrina and \n     Rita never happen again.\n       Last month we marked the one-year anniversary of Hurricane \n     Katrina, and now mark the one-year anniversary of Hurricane \n     Rita. It is essential that we take action now to make \n     substantive reforms to the SBA Disaster Assistance Program. \n     We owe nothing less to our small businesses. I ask that you \n     continue working with my office on this important issue and \n     respond to our approach in writing no later than October 31, \n     2006. This will help us develop a proposal which can address \n     the concerns of the SBA as well as provide a better and more \n     responsive SBA Disaster Assistance Program for our small \n     businesses.\n       Thank you in advance for your assistance with this request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Mary L.

Mr. President, I have filed an amendment to S. 2078, the \nproposed Indian Gaming Regulatory Act Amendments of 2006. The amendment \nwould require the National Indian Gaming Commission, the NIGC, to \nutilize the well-accepted negotiated rulemaking process in promulgating \nany regulations required to implement the provisions contained in S. \n2078. Let me take a moment to explain the amendment.\n  Congress adopted the Negotiated Rulemaking Act in 1990. It appears at \n5 USC, sections 561 and following. Congress permanently reauthorized \nthe act in 1996. It provides an alternative to adversarial rulemaking. \nIt saves time and reduces litigation.\n  The Negotiated Rulemaking Act allows interested stakeholders and the \nFederal agency to be a part of the process. Negotiated rulemaking is a \nprocess by which tribes and Government agencies enter into negotiations \nin good faith and reach consensus on proposed rufts. All the legal \nrequirements of notice, such as publication in the Federal Register, \nare employed. A negotiated rulemaking committee is employed. Thus there \nis transparency and accountability. If the negotiated rulemaking \nsucceeds, it culminates in proposed rules that the Federal agency \nformally proposes. The Federal agency retains the ultimate authority, \nhowever, on any such proposed rule, as the agency retains \nresponsibility in making final decisions and publishing the rule in the \nFederal Register.\n  A variety of Federal agencies have successfully used the Negotiated \nRulemaking Act in developing regulations. Among them are the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the Federal Aviation Administration, \nthe National Park Service, the Department of Transportation, the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration, and the United States \nForest Service.\n  As well, Federal agencies that have worked directly with Indian \ncountry have successfully used the negotiated rulemaking process. Among \nthose are the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development when HUD developed the \nregulations under the Native American Housing and Self Determination \nAct.\n  Some argue that it is not appropriate to require the NIGC to bring in \ntribes as a part of the negotiated rulemaking process because they are \nthe entity being regulated. But we are dealing with sovereign Indian \nNations that already have significant regulatory regimes in effect. The \noriginal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act already was a major intrusion \ninto the status of tribes as units of government fully capable of \nmanaging their own affairs. To suggest that it is somehow problematic \nfor tribal governments to have an institutionalized role in developing \nregulations is totally contrary to the very concept of our government-\nto-government relationship with tribes. That is a philosophy subscribed \nto by the chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee on many occasions.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10665-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10665-S10666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO THE LATE SENATOR PAUL WELLSTONE\n\n  Mr. DAYTON.

After \npooling together $10,000 in capital, the Bank of Clarke County was \nformed. As the oldest continuously operating bank in the area, Bank of \nClarke County has remained committed to serving the local communities \nand its citizens. Its success today can be attributed to its long-term \nvision and dedicated staff.\n  Over the years, Bank of Clarke has undergone numerous expansions and \nrenovations, permanently moving to the greater Winchester area in 1992 \nand opening 10 full-service branch locations, one express branch, and a \nnetwork of 23 local ATMs. Despite their continual expansion and growth \nas a business, Bank of Clarke County remains dedicated to serving the \ncommunity through volunteer work with over 150 local organizations.\n  The Bank of Clarke County continues to perform outstanding work in \nserving its local citizens and the entire Commonwealth of Virginia.

Their early adoption of \nimproved concrete methods and materials was instrumental in the company \nefforts to save time and reduce costs.\n  Their continual commitment to provide Virginians with the highest \nlevel of expertise and technology speaks to the company integrity and \nconsistent standard of excellence.

Since then, it has evolved into one of the \npremier regional medical centers in the United States, now boasting 405 \nbeds, 2,483 full-time employees, a team of devoted volunteers who \nworked 76,000 hours last year alone, and numerous renovations. The \ncenter specializes in heart care and open heart surgery, cancer care, \northopedic surgery, 24-hour emergency services, including a helipad and \nneonatal intensive care transport, neurosciences, rehabilitation \nservices, behavioral health, and women and children services. With such \na highly qualified staff, it is no surprise that patients\n\n[[Page S10667]]\n\nare referred from a 17-county area in Virginia, Maryland, and West \nVirginia to the center for medical treatment.\n  Any institution committed to giving back to the local community from \nwhich it was founded and grew is commendable.

Hill High Farm has been \nrecognized by the Commonwealth of Virginia as a ``Century Farm''.\n  While the farm continues to grow apples, raise cattle, and maintain a \ndairy herd as it did a century ago, today they offer other exciting \nattractions such as a straw maze, corn maze, hay rides, and farm \nanimals. Their expansion from a fourth of an acre of pumpkins to 20 \nacres and continual promotion of new special events has captured the \npublic interest. In the fall during harvest time Hill High Farm opens \ntheir farm to over 1,000 visitors, including school groups. This April, \nthe farm will be featured on the Discovery Channel by Pilot \nProductions, an independent television production company based in \nEngland.\n  To express their appreciation for the continual support of local \npatrons, the Wright family gives back to their community through annual \ncharity events such as the Youth Development Center's Annual Punkin' \nChunkin' Contest. I would like to recognize Hill High Farm as an \nhistorical trademark of Shenandoah Valley, loved and cherished by so \nmany in the Virginian community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10667-4", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING GLAIZE COMPONENTS\n\n Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to acknowledge Glaize \nComponents, an internationally recognized lumber company founded in \nWinchester, VA, more than 150 years ago. The company first started in \nNorthern Shanendoah Valley as a charcoal production business, but \nquickly evolved into a lumber company.\n  When Glaize Components was founded in 1854, they made a commitment to \nproviding the highest level of quality to their customers, employees, \nand industry. To meet increasing market demand and expand their \ngeographic reach, Glaize Components has opened two new plant locations \nin Shelby, NC, and LaCrosse, VA.\n  Throughout its history, Glaize Components products have included a \ncomplete line of building components for residential and commercial \nuses, such as roof trusses, wall panels, and floor trusses. Their use \nof software systems specifically designed for truss systems and their \nincorporation of laser-guided truss building processes has gained them \ninternational recognition by manufacturers from Africa, Russia, China, \nand Japan.\n  The immense respect Glaize Components receives for its superior \nmanufacturing processes--both at home and abroad--is a testament to \ntheir success and leadership in the industry. I am honored to \nacknowledge Glaize Components accomplishments over the past century, \nand I am confident that they will continue to serve their customers \nwith the expertise, quality, and dependability for which they are \nknown.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10667-5", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING THE INSURANCE CENTER OF WINCHESTER\n\n Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to acknowledge the \nInsurance Center of Winchester, the oldest and largest independently \nowned insurance agency in the Northern Shenandoah Valley in Virginia. \nOver the past century, and particularly in the last decade, the \ninsurance industry has undergone radical transformations from \ntechnological advancements to expanding competition. I would like to \nrecognize the Insurance Center of Winchester for their exceptional \nability to adapt to these changes while maintaining their original \ncommitment to excellent service and expertise.\n  The Insurance Center of Winchester provides service to thousands of \nhomeowners, renters, autos, RVs and motorcycles, and provides \ncomprehensive group benefit plans to many of the region's top \nbusinesses and industries. In addition to those services, the Insurance \nCenter of Winchester also provides health, disability, and life \ninsurance to individuals. Over the years, the Insurance Center of \nWinchester has expanded to three departments, Personal Lines Insurance, \nCommercial Lines Insurance, and Financial Services. But what \ndistinguishes them as the leading insurance company of Northern \nShenandoah Valley is their employees' ability to solve complex issues \nand their commitment to personal customer service.\n  Since 1902, the Insurance Center of Winchester has put an emphasis on \nmaintaining a relationship-based business, helping them gain the \nrespect and trust from the Virginia community which they have worked so \nhard to develop. I would like to acknowledge the Insurance Center of \nWinchester's accomplishments over the last century, and I am confident \nthat they will continue to flourish in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10667-6", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10667-S10668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING THE ENDERS AND SHIRLEY FUNERAL HOME\n\n Mr. ALLEN.

Enders on East \nMain Street in Berryville, VA, the funeral home was originally known \nfor its warm, home-like atmosphere, and convenient location.\n  Over the past century, the Enders and Shirley Funeral Home has \nserviced its community with compassion and honesty. The Enders family \nhas earned respect and admiration from the Winchester community not \nonly for their success as a business, but for their integrity and \nincessant devotion to the Winchester community.\n  I commend the Enders family for their unwavering support and passion \nfor helping families get through the hardships involved with planning \ntheir loved one's funerals.

Mr. President, I am pleased to acknowledge \nWinchester Printers, Inc., which has proudly served the commercial \nprinting needs of businesses, universities, and organizations of the \nWinchester-Frederick County, VA, area for over a century. The family-\nowned and operated company can be traced back 114 years through three \ngenerations to 1892, and has remained firmly committed to its standard \nof superior expertise and craftsmanship ever since.\n  I was recently excited to hear that the Printing Industries of \nVirginia awarded Winchester Printers, Inc. with the Dietz Memorial \nAward for the fourth year in a row. Competing against nearly 5,000 \nentries from printing and graphic arts firms around the world, \nWinchester was honored with the Best in Show Award for the 2003 Henkel \nHarris Portfolio designed by Erkel and Associates. The company also \nreceived a Certificate of Merit in the Worldwide Print Competition \nhosted by the Printing Industries of America.\n  Over the past century, Winchester Printers, Inc. has developed a \nstrong relationship and loyal following with the local Virginian \ncommunity.

Mr. President, earlier this year, Dr. David \nRoselle, a personal friend and longtime president of my alma mater, the \nUniversity of Delaware, announced that he will retire in May. I have \nthe greatest respect for Dr. Roselle and the tremendous job he has done \nat the institution I love.\n  The average tenure of a university president, I am told, is a little \nover 6 years, about the term of a U.S. Senator. When Dr. Roselle \nleaves, he will have served 17 years, equivalent to almost a three-term \nSenator. That is staying power that has let him turn the University of \nDelaware from a very good regional school into a university, known \nnationally for its academic excellence.\n  When constituents ask me: ``My child has gotten into this university \nor that university. Where should she go?'' I say go to that university \nthey can get into now and are quite certain 10 years from now they \nwould never be admitted. That certainly would have been my story at the \nUniversity of Delaware.\n  Back when I was a student in the early 1960s, we had 4,000 \nundergraduates, maybe 400 graduate students. Today, there are 15,000 \nundergraduates and 3,000 graduate students. They come from all over the \ncountry and world.\n  But what is really different between then, and now, is not the \nquantity, but that even the highest caliber students must now worry \nabout their ability to get in. During Dr. Roselle's tenure, the SAT \nscores of entering freshman has risen significantly.\n  All of us in public service have the goal to leave the place better \nthan how we found it, and Dr. Roselle has clearly done that, on many \nfronts.\n  Physically, under his leadership, he oversaw the building and \nrebuilding of about two dozen structures, including a new sports/\nconvocation center, a new center for the arts that opened recently, new \nlaboratories, new residences, and new academic buildings. He brought \ntechnology into the infrastructure, so all campus buildings are 21st \ncentury ready.\n  Financially, he has nearly quadrupled the university's endowment, to \n$1.2 billion, far exceeding anyone's expectations. The number of \nendowed faculty positions has increased from 20 some 10 years ago to \nmore than 100 today, allowing the university to attract excellent \nfaculty members.\n  Since he arrived, he increased student aid from $19 million to $56 \nmillion and started scholarship support so more students can study \nabroad. The University of Delaware started the first Study Abroad \nProgram in the world 80 years ago, and today, 40 percent of \nundergraduates spend some time learning abroad, increasingly important \npreparation for a job in today's global economy.\n  All of us in this Chamber should feel good about helping expand the \nuniversity's scientific programs. During Dr. Roselle's tenure, Congress \nappropriated almost $90 million for defense work, primarily at the \nUniversity's Center for Advanced Composite Materials. It has been put \nto good use. They have developed critical basic composite materials and \nproduction techniques to produce the lighter, more capable vehicles, \nguns, armor, and ships our military needs.\n  We also should feel good about the millions of dollars Congress has \ndirected to the university to help fight avian influenza, develop clean \nenergy technologies, and for biotechnology research, among other \nactivities.\n  I also note that Dr. Roselle presided over Blue Hen football teams \nthat combined had a 135-54-1 record and brought to Newark a national \nchampionship, a proud day for all of our alumni.\n  The list of his accomplishments is long, and I could go on. But it is \nnot so much what he has built, as what the 70,000 students who \ngraduated during his tenure will accomplish with the quality education \nhe had such a strong hand in giving them.\n  Our alma mater has a wonderful line, ``We give thee thanks for \nglorious days beneath thy guiding hand,'' and it is certainly his hand \nas well as his head and heart that has guided the university into the \nwonderful institution it is today.\n  I know I speak for all of my colleagues in extending Dr. Roselle our \nheartfelt congratulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10668-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10668-S10669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING MAJOR RICHARD ``RICKIE'' N. HAGAN\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \noutstanding military service and contributions to our country by MAJ \nRichard ``Rickie'' N. Hagan of Tompkinsville, KY.\n  Major Hagan has served his country in the Army for 27 years. He is a \ngraduate of the Kentucky Military Academy at Fort Knox, KY and the \nCommand and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, KS. He was \ndeployed to Iraq in July of 2004 and again in 2005 with the 377th \nTheater Support Command, TSC, of New Orleans, LA.\n  His overseas assignment included the 1st Corp Support Command, 82nd \nAirborne Division in Balad, Iraq. He worked as a Theater LNO--liaison \nofficer--in Balad and in Baghdad to Multi National Forces-Iraq. As an \nOIC--officer in charge--of an LNO team, he\n\n[[Page S10669]]\n\nserved with distinction by gathering and analyzing key intelligence \ninformation. For this service, he has been awarded the Bronze Star, The \nCombat Action Badge, the Meritorious Service Medal, The Iraq Campaign, \nthe Global War on Terrorism Medal and the Global War Expeditionary \nMedal.\n  Outside of his military service, Major Hagan has continuously been an \nactive member of his local church and community. He taught military \nhistory and the art of war to ROTC Cadets at Middle Tennessee State \nUniversity in Murfreesboro, TN. For 6 years he served as a city \ncouncilman in Tompkinsville, KY, was President of the Monroe County \nWellness Board, and served on the YMCA and Chamber of Commerce Boards. \nAfter returning from Iraq, Major Hagan lent his services to the people \nof the Gulf Coast following Hurricane Katrina.\n  Currently Major Hagan owns a small business and serves as an S2 \nintelligence officer for the 5/515 Cavalry Squadron in Fort Knox, KY.\n  The citizens of the State of Kentucky are proud of MAJ Rickie N. \nHagan's service. They join me in thanking him for his contributions to \nthe Army and the United States, and in wishing him all the best both \nnow and in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10669-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              BILL ZADICK\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I wish to honor a man that has \nworked his way to and excelled in the highest level of athletic \ncompetition, Mr. Bill Zadick. Bill competed in the wrestling world \nchampionship in Gaungzhu, China, where he won the gold medal in the 66 \nkilogram weight class. The wrestling world championship brings together \nthe top wrestlers from around the world, and to win a gold medal is \nevidence of determination, dedication, and elite talent. The semifinal \nmatch that Bill won exemplified these characteristics as he fought for \nevery point in a weight class deemed to be the most difficult of all. \nNot to be overlooked was the silver medal victory achieved by Mr. Mike \nZadick, brother to Bill, in the 60 kilogram weight class. As did Bill, \nMike represented the fine qualities of a champion and the honor in his \nachievement will be long celebrated.\n  Growing up in Great Falls, Bill excelled in wrestling during high \nschool and later at the University of Iowa. His hard work ethic, \nadopted from his father, helped shape Bill into a world-class wrestler. \nAfter the 2001 world championships where Bill placed seventh, his \ndesire for perfection landed him in Colorado Springs where he developed \na training program that would eventually earn him a gold medal. Not \nonly has Bill set an example for athletic excellence, but he has acted \nas a role model for fellow Montanans. Montana has enjoyed recognition \non the world platform before, and it is because of men like Bill that \nwe have the opportunity to continue this great honor.\n  Considered to be a part of the greatest wrestling family in Montana, \nBill and Mike Zadick deserve the praise and recognition given to them. \nWe are proud as well as fortunate to have men such as Bill and Mike \nZadick from Montana, demonstrating their amiable work ethic and acting \nas role models to younger generations of athletes and students \nalike.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10669-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 INAUGURATION OF DR. WILLIAM CLARK, III\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I congratulate Dr. Spurgeon \nWilliam Clark, III on the occasion of his inauguration as The Medical \nAssociation of Georgia's 152nd President this weekend. I have had the \nprivilege of knowing Dr. Clark for many years. He is an esteemed \nphysician, community leader, devoted father and son, and dear friend.\n  Dr. Clark graduated from Waycross High School in 1971 and earned a \nbachelor's degree cum laude in 1975 from Davidson College in North \nCarolina. He received his medical degree from the Medical College of \nGeorgia and interned at Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk. He \nperformed his residency at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute at the \nUniversity of Miami.\n  Dr. Clark operates the Clark Eye Clinic in Waycross, GA, and attends \npatients of all ages. There is no question that he is a leader in his \nfield. He has been included in ``The Best Doctors in the South'' in \n1996, 1998, 2002, 2004 and 2006. He has performed groundbreaking \nsurgeries involving the perfecting of new refractive surgeries, \ncataract surgeries and the refining of implanting lenses. His \nophthalmology career includes time and work spent as an active member \nof Satilla Regional Medical Center, Emory Eye Care Center, the Atlanta \nVA Medical Center, where he has been a clinical assistant professor \nsince 1997, and the Medical College of Georgia, where he has been a \nclinical assistant professor since 1998. He has previously served the \nMedical Association of Georgia as a member, delegate and as a member of \nthe Board of Directors. He has also served the Georgia AMA delegation \nas Vice Chair and as President-elect, the Okefenokee Medical \nAssociation as President, as the Secretary as well as Director of the \nEighth District Medical Society, and as President and Chairman of the \nBoard of the Okefenkee Physicians Network, Inc., and as Vice President \nof the Satilla Regional Medical Center Staff Executive Committee.\n  Dr. Clark's accomplishments are indeed endless. Not only is he a \nleader in the medical field, he is an active citizen and parent in the \nWaycross community. He has received awards on numerous occasions for \nhis service. He is the recipient of the 1987 Jack Williams Community \nService Award, the 1988 Waycross Jaycees Outstanding Young American \nAward, the 1989 Waycross Pogo Good Citizenship Award, the Ware 2000 \nExcellence in Education Award, and the 1990 Rotarian of the Year Award.\n  He has served as Vice President and President of the Williams Heights \nElementary School PTA, as President of the Waycross Middle School PTA, \nand as a board member of the Okefenokee Heritage Center. Additionally, \nhe has served in leadership positions with the United Way, the \nWaycross-Ware County Chamber of Commerce, the Downtown Waycross \nDevelopment Authority, the First United Methodist Curch, the Waycross \nBank & Trust, and the Okefenokee Swamp Park Association.\n  Dr. Clark and his wife, Jill, have three daughters Victoria, Evelyn, \nand Alora. I know that this is a special time in particular for Dr. \nClark and his family, because this inauguration continues a tradition \nof family service within the medical community. Dr. Clark's father \npreviously served as the Medical Association of Georgia's 130th \nPresident in 1984.\n  I offer my congratulations to Dr. Clark on his inauguration this \nweekend and commend him for all his accomplishments.

Mr. President, today I honor a dedicated and \npassionate teacher in my home State of Idaho. In the late summer of \n1963 J. Kent Marlor first stepped onto the campus of Ricks College in \nRexburg, ID, as a brand new 26-year-old teacher. During that first \nyear, he taught economic history and political science and took the \nrole of debate coach. When asked of his years at Ricks, he said, ``I \ndon't know how I did it the first year I came here . . . I've had \nchances to go to a number of different places over the years, but have \nalways wanted to stay here [because] I love Idaho. I love the wildlife \nand the smallness of the school . . . You know all the students [and] \nthe faculty [and] the spirit that has always been here is a great thing \nfor me.'' On August 24, 2006, he retired after 43 years teaching \nthousands of students in the political science department. He retired \nas the longest serving instructor in the 118-year history of the \ninstitution.\n  Kent is a man well loved by those with whom he has come in contact. \nHe has touched the lives of many of his students and has been able to \nhelp them gain confidence and direction in their fields of study. He is \na mentor to many and will be missed by faculty and students alike at \nRicks College, which became Brigham Young University-Idaho in 2000.\n  During an interview with the Rexburg Standard Journal, Marlor said, \n``Success of a teacher is really measured in the success of his \nstudents.'' The newspaper reported that Marlor's students are now \njudges, doctors, attorneys, legislators and editors.\n\n[[Page S10670]]\n\n  I have had firsthand experience with the fruits of Kent Marlor's \neducational efforts. Over the years, at least 10 of my Senate interns \nhave been his students as well as several current and former members of \nmy staff. When talking about his former students, Marlor said, ``My \nreward for being a teacher comes when I see what my students have \naccomplished.''\n  Before his long and distinguished teaching career, Marlor served his \ncount in Naval Intelligence and at the National Security Agency. He has \nalso served as president of the Idaho Wildlife Federation and the \nchairman of the Idaho Fish and Game Advisory Committee. At his side in \nmany of these meetings was his wife of over 50 years, Sharon. Together \nthey raised six children who have also been very active in education \nand in their communities.\n  Even though he has served in our Nation's Armed Forces, intelligence \nservice, and in various community organizations, his most gratifying \nservice has come with the Teton Peaks Council of the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica. Over the years, Kent and Sharon earned their spot in the Boy \nScout Hall of Fame by organizing countless campouts, merit badge camps, \nEagle Scout projects and Courts of Honor. In recognition of his \nefforts, Kent was honored with the Silver Beaver Award in 1982. Sharon \nwas honored with the same award in 1989.\n  Kent loves the outdoors. His love of fishing is legendary in the \nUpper Snake River Valley. There isn't a lake, reservoir, river, stream, \ncreek, ditch, or puddle that hasn't been explored with his beloved rod \nand reel at least once in the last 40 years. It is my understanding \nthat Scout troops who go on extended camping trips with Kent don't take \nmuch food with them. Wherever they go, Kent is sure to provide plenty \nof fresh trout for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Kent taught his Scouts \nto appreciate the beauty around them as well as how to conserve it for \nfuture generations.\n  I wish Kent and Sharon Marlor many happy years in retirement and \nthank them both for the contribution to education and the youth of \nIdaho.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10670-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MARY BOURDETTE\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Mary \nBourdette, who passed away earlier this month after a 15-month struggle \nwith ALS. My condolences go to Mary's family and the many friends and \ncolleagues with whom she shared her spirit and commitment to social \njustice and making our country stronger through our families.\n  Mary is missed by me and so many others who had the honor to work \nwith her as she championed the needs of those who have no voice in the \npolitical process. Our nation is truly better for Mary's 30 years of \nwork on behalf of children and families.\n  Mary, who keenly understood the legislative process, combined her \npassion for good policy with a political pragmatism that yielded real \nresults. She never lost sight of the important issues and built \neffective coalitions to guide important legislation to passage. Most \nnotably, her focus on the children never wavered.\n  Her commitment, talent, and leadership improved the lives of \ncountless Americans. I had the honor to have worked with her over the \npast 20 years on behalf of those among us with the greatest needs. Mary \nhad an ability to get to the heart of the matter and move it forward. \nShe was a driving force during the 3\\1/2\\ years we worked to win \nenactment of the child care and development block grant. She played a \ncritical role in expanding the earned-income tax credit to help even \nmore low-income families. She also helped to move forward important \nbills related to foster care and adoption. Her keen understanding of \nthe technical Federal budget process benefited innumerable children and \ntheir families.\n  I am especially grateful for Mary's tireless work related to Head \nStart. During reauthorization of this important legislation in 1993, \nshe was instrumental in the creation of Early Head Start that provided \nmore comprehensive assistance to parents and their infants and \ntoddlers. When the law was again reauthorized in 1998, Mary was there \nto ensure that it was further strengthened.\n  I applaud Mary's many accomplishments throughout her distinguished \ncareer. From the Legal Services Corporation to the Children's Defense \nFund to the Child Welfare League of America to the U.S. Department of \nHealth and Human Services, her dedication to helping the most \nvulnerable among us never wavered.\n  Mary Bourdette made enormous contributions and left all of us with \nmuch to protect and to build on in the future.

Mr. President, over the August recess, I had the \nopportunity to visit the newly opened community health centers of \nSouthern Iowa, located in Leon, IA. I had been fortunate to secure \n$300,000 for renovations and equipment at the facility, and I was eager \nto see how these resources are being put to use.\n  As I toured the facility and talked with staff, I was freshly \nreminded of the extraordinary public service rendered by community \nhealth centers all across the United States. But the center in Leon is \ntruly exceptional. The facility itself is welcoming, modern, and well \nequipped. And the staff members--from physicians to nurses to \ncustodians--are truly an inspiration. They clearly have a special \npassion for their work, and they take pride in the fact that they are \nproviding first-rate health care in one of the most underserved areas \nof my State.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., used to say that ``Life's most \npersistent and urgent question is: What are you doing for others?'' Let \nme tell you, the dedicated professionals at the community health \ncenters of Southern Iowa have answered that question in powerful ways. \nThey have committed themselves to providing high-quality health care to \nall comers, regardless of ability to pay. All are welcomed equally. All \nare served with excellence.\n  This is why, as ranking member on the education and health \nappropriations subcommittee, I am 100 percent committed to securing \nappropriate funding for community health centers. One thing I know for \ncertain: Every dollar Congress appropriates for centers like the one in \nLeon is a dollar spent wisely and frugally. It never ceases to amaze me \nhow their staffs are able to do so much--and to serve so many people--\nwith such modest resources.\n  I daresay that nobody in the health care profession faces greater \nchallenges than those who choose to work in community health centers--\nchallenges including chronic illness, cultural and linguistic \ndifferences, geographical barriers, homelessness, and on and on. \nNothing stops these superb professionals.\n  And one more thing: community health centers have a well-deserved \nreputation for caring and kindness. In some ways, their physicians and \nnurses are a throwback to another era. They offer a direct and personal \nstyle of health care. They follow up. They care about prevention and \nwellness.\n  So I am deeply grateful to executive director Gary Rees, to medical \ndirector, Dr. Patricia Magle, and to all the wonderful staff and board \nmembers at the community health centers of Southern Iowa. They work \ntheir hearts out to provide the very best health care in a part of my \nState that has been neglected for too long. I deeply appreciate their \npassion, their compassion, and their dedication to public service.\n  Mr. President, in late August, I had the pleasure of attending a \nceremonial ribbon-cutting ceremony at the new United Community Health \nCenter in Storm Lake, IA. Having secured funding for the center, which \nactually opened its doors last March, I was eager to meet with the \nstaff and assess their progress.\n  I was incredibly impressed by all that this facility has been able to \naccomplish with relatively modest resources. I call it ``the little \ncommunity health center that could.'' The facility is welcoming, \nmodern, and well equipped. And the staff members are truly an \ninspiration. They have a special passion for their work, and they take \npride in the fact that they are providing first-rate health care to \nunderserved communities.\n\n[[Page S10671]]\n\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., used to say that ``Life's most \npersistent and urgent question is: What are you doing for others?''

In some ways, their physicians and \nnurses are a throwback to another era. They offer a direct and personal \nstyle of health care. They follow up.

And also to founding board member \nLarry Rohret, whose dedication to improving the lives of those in \ngreatest need was instrumental in establishing the health center. I was \nsaddened that Larry did not live to see the health center open its \ndoors.\n  These devoted people work their hearts out to provide the very best \nhealth care to some of our most needy citizens. I deeply appreciate \ntheir passion, their compassion, and their dedication to public \nservice.\n  Mr. President, earlier this year, I had the opportunity to visit the \nnewly opened Community Health Center of Fort Dodge in north-central \nIowa. I had been fortunate to secure $280,000 for planning and \nequipment at the facility, and I was eager to see how these resources \nare being put to use.\n  As I toured the facility and talked with staff, I was freshly \nreminded of the extraordinary public service rendered by community \nhealth centers all across the United States. But the center in Fort \nDodge is truly exceptional. Thanks to their new community health center \ndesignation, the folks, there, were able to transition from two free \nclinics operating very much part time, to a full-time, comprehensive \nprimary care center serving all of Webster County.\n  And the staff members--from physicians to nurses to custodians--are \ntruly an inspiration. They clearly have a special passion for their \nwork, and they take pride in the fact that they are providing first-\nrate health care to some of the most underserved people in my state.\n  Mr. President, several years ago, I encouraged leaders in the Fort \nDodge community to apply to for community health center designation. I \nremember visiting a free clinic being operated by St. Mark's Episcopal \nChurch back in 2003 and meeting a woman who was in such pain from a \ntoothache that she had removed her own tooth with a hammer and \nscrewdriver. No human being should have to resort to such a crude \nremedy--certainly not in the United States of America. And thanks to \nthe new center in Fort Dodge, those kinds of desperate measures are a \nthing of the past.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., used to say that ``Life's most \npersistent and urgent question is: What are you doing for others?'' Let \nme tell you, the dedicated professionals at the Community Health Center \nof Fort Dodge have answered that question in powerful ways.

Mr. President, today I congratulate Ms. Conchy \nBretos of Miami, FL, recipient of the 2006 Purpose Prize. This new \nnational award was initiated this year by Civic Ventures, a nonprofit \norganization dedicated to generating ideas and programs to help society \nachieve the greatest return on the experience of older Americans.\n  After a varied career in housing, marketing, health, women's issues \nand government, Conchy Bretos became committed to doing something about \nthe thousands of low-income elders and disabled adults who were not \ngetting the service they needed to stay in their homes.\n  She became the driving force behind the Helen Sawyer building in \nMiami, the Nation's first public housing project to offer assisted-\nliving service. Her efforts have resulted in the creation of similar \nservices in 40 public housing projects in a dozen States, allowing many \nolder adults to maintain their independence while they receive the \nmedical care they need.\n  I want to recognize the role of the Purpose Prize itself in changing \nour society's view of aging. America's growing older population is one \nof our greatest untapped resources, and we need to do everything \npossible as a society to recognize the great contributions they can \nmake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10671-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10671-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and treaties which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10671-4", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10671-S10672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA'S 2007 BUDGET REQUEST ACT--PM 57\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to my constitutional authority and consistent with section \n446\n\n[[Page S10672]]\n\nof The District of Columbia Self-Governmental Reorganization Act as \namended in 1989, I am transmitting the District of Columbia's 2007 \nBudget Request Act.\n  The proposed 2007 Budget Request Act reflects the major programmatic \nobjectives of the Mayor and the Council of the District of Columbia. \nFor 2007, the District estimates total revenues and expenditures of \n$7.61 billion.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to provide education opportunity grants to low-income \nsecondary school students; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise to speak about legislation that I \nam introducing today along with the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Obama. \nAt this time of year, with much bitter partisanship, I really am \npleased to work with Senator Obama for something that we think is \nimportant to the country.\n  The Education Opportunity Act is a bill that would significantly \nexpand college-level opportunities for low-income high school students \nand teach these students that success in school can mean success in \nlife.\n  In the fast-paced, technologically advanced global economy of the \n21st century, old distinctions between high school and college are \nbecoming obsolete. For our students to succeed in tomorrow's workplace, \nwe must be innovative and allow more choices of study today.\n  As we look toward reauthorizing No Child Left Behind, I believe it is \nimportant to examine what has worked and where students are still \nfalling between the cracks. While we have expanded advanced placement \nclasses, what we call AP classes, through the President's Advanced \nPlacement Incentives Program, I believe we are missing another vital \navenue to increase college-level opportunities for low-income students. \nThat is why I am proud to work together with Senator Obama to establish \neducation opportunity grants for high school students.\n  Our bill is similar to the Federal Pell grant program, which funds \nneed-based aid that does not have to be repaid by the students. These \ngrants could be made available for classes at community colleges or \nuniversities that would admit a high school student to enroll in \nclasses. These grant scholarships will help keep our high school \nstudents in school by raising their expectations and showing them that \nthey can do college-level work. They could also accumulate college-\nlevel credits while still in high school.\n  Our national dropout rate is at record highs, and it is on the rise. \nIn my own home State of South Carolina, high school students are \ndropping out at an alarming rate, with half of all students failing to \ncomplete high school in 4 years. It is no secret that most of these at-\nrisk students are from low-income families.\n  Currently, there are only two ways high school students can gain \ncollege credit. They either take the AP classes at high school or \nparticipate in dual enrollment programs. Some high schools, \nparticularly those with a high percentage of low-income students, are \nnot able to offer advanced placement classes, and students are required \nto forgo college classes that they might want to take because their \nfamilies can't afford to foot the bill. The result is that students \nwith great promise who happen to come from disadvantaged families lose \ninterest in a school that does not offer classes tailored to their \ntalents and interests.\n  Senator Obama and I believe if we expose students to the hundreds of \nclasses available at their local colleges, some of which are listed on \nthe chart behind me, many students who are not excited about high \nschool world history classes will, instead, discover that they are \ninterested in computer science or marketing and can learn a skill that \nthey can see will directly apply to a future job.\n  Make no mistake, traditional classes in biology, English, and history \nare important. But if a student drops out because they don't have the \nflexibility to also pursue more nontraditional avenues, those classes \ndo not do them any good.\n  Education opportunity grants are a cost-effective way to educate \nstudents by utilizing the preexisting infrastructure already available \nat local colleges. I believe this will show many students that a \ncollege degree is attainable and that they will be better prepared to \nstart college or enter the workforce with marketable skills as a high \nschool graduate.\n  As I mentioned before, I believe it is critical that we do a better \njob accommodating the needs of all our students and continue to create \nopportunities for each young person to learn in ways that make sense to \nthem and have direct application to their goals in life.\n  This legislation is one more valuable option for our educational \nsystem to empower students and parents with choices and the ability to \nfollow an educational path that meets their individual needs.\n\n[[Page S10683]]\n\n  It is time we stopped forcing our kids to fit our educational system \nand, instead, force our educational system to fit our kids. That is the \nonly way that success in school will mean success in life.\n  I thank Senator Obama and his great staff for working with my office \non this important legislation, and I look forward to working with the \nSenator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, and the Senator from Massachusetts, \nRanking Member Kennedy, to make this legislation a reality.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nSouth Carolina, Senator Jim DeMint, in introducing the Education \nOpportunity Act.\n  We often hear that many students who graduate from high school are \nnot ready for the academic rigors of college. This is especially \nproblematic for students from low-income families. For these students \nto succeed in the transition to college, they must have opportunity, \nand a continuity of classroom experiences that prepare them for \nsuccess. Academic rigor in a high school curriculum is essential in \nestablishing the momentum necessary for a student to progress toward a \nbachelor's degree.\n  The unfortunate fact is that not all students have access to a \nchallenging high school curriculum. Low-income students are often \ndisadvantaged by a lack of rigorous courses in their high school, \nespecially in subjects such as the advanced mathematics courses that \nare so important for college success. Universities and community \ncolleges have increasingly provided such courses to high school \nstudents. But the cost of such classes can be a barrier to low-income \nstudents, who are the very students most likely to be enrolled in high \nschools that provide the most limited access to challenging college \npreparatory curricula.\n  This legislation will provide a program for grant support to allow \nthousands of students with limited exposure to college-level programs \nin their high schools to earn college credit at their local university \nor community college. I urge my colleagues to join us in extending \nopportunities for college success to deserving low-income high school \nstudents.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 3998. A bill to amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to \nprovide relief for servicemembers with respect to contracts for \ncellular phone service, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that seeks to \nmake life a little easier for our servicemembers and their families \nwhen they are called up to duty or transferred. We all recognize the \nheroic service the men and women in our armed services provide the \nNation each day. So when I heard stories about servicemembers and their \nfamilies in Wisconsin having trouble canceling their cell phone \ncontracts after being called up, I looked for a way to help. With the \nprospect of a combat assignment, the last thing our men and women in \nuniform should have to worry about are early termination fees or being \nforced to pay for a service they cannot use. I tried to have this \nprovision adopted as an amendment to the Defense authorization bill in \nJune and, while I was unsuccessful, I will continue to push for the \nadoption of this commonsense measure.\n  These problems with canceling cellular phone service have not been \njust isolated incidents. In fact, the issue has been raised by the \nWisconsin National Guard. I ask unanimous consent that the full \ntestimony of First Lieutenant Melissa Inlow of the Wisconsin Army \nNational Guard made at a hearing on a Wisconsin State assembly bill in \nApril be printed in the Record.\n  I just want to highlight one part of that testimony that makes the \npoint that this is a real issue facing our servicemembers: ``It's \nbecoming increasingly difficult to get cell phone service providers to \nsuspend the contract. Even with suspension the soldiers are still \npaying up to $25 a month for a service they cannot reap the benefits \nof. These fees can accumulate to more than the termination fee which on \naverage is $200.'' First Lieutenant Inlow went on to specifically \nrecommend that the Servicemembers' Civil Relief Act be amended to \ninclude a section on cellular phones.\n  First Lieutenant Inlow and the Wisconsin National Guard are not alone \nin this opinion either. The National Guard Association of the United \nStates, the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United \nStates, and the Military Officers Association of America have all \nexpressed support for my amendment--which is virtually identical to the \nlegislation I introduce today.\n  It is common now for cellular phone contracts to require a contract \nterm of up to two years. Along with these long contracts, there are \noften early termination fees of several hundred dollars. When a \nNational Guard member is called up to active duty or a soldier is \ntransferred overseas or to a base that isn't covered by their current \nprovider, they often face the prospect of either paying these \nsignificant fees or paying monthly fees for the remainder of the \ncontract for a service they cannot use. While many servicemembers and \ntheir families have been able to work with telecommunications companies \nto eventually get the early termination fee canceled, the account \nsuspended, or the fees reduced, they have enough to deal with after \nbeing called up that they should not have this added burden as well.\n  My legislation proposes that we bring these cellular phone contracts \nin line with what we have already done for residential and automotive \nleases in the Servicemembers' Civil Relief Act--let the servicemembers \ncancel the contract. Under my proposal, if servicemembers are called up \nfor more than 90 days, transferred overseas, or transferred to a U.S. \nduty station where they could not continue their service at the same \nrate, they could cancel their contract without a termination fee.\n  While my legislation helps to prevent servicemembers from being \nfinancially punished for volunteering to protect this country, I have \nalso tried to make sure that the telecommunications providers are \ntreated fairly as well. That is why I have included a provision that \nwould allow the providers to request the return of cell phones provided \nas part of the contract. If the company requests the return under this \nprovision, it would also have to give the servicemember the option of \npaying a pro-rated amount for the cell phone should he or she wish to \nkeep it. Moreover, if the provider and servicemember mutually agree to \nsuspend instead of terminate the contract, the bill makes sure that the \nreactivation fee is waived.\n  While this is a modest addition to the rights of servicemembers, it \nis important that we remove as many unfair burdens facing this \ncountry's men and women in uniform as we can. I hope my colleagues will \nshare this view and quickly adopt this nonpartisan proposal.\n\nTestimony for the Record of First Lieutenant Melissa Inlow at a Hearing \n           on Wisconsin Assembly Bill 1174 on April 17, 2006\n\n       Thank you, chairman and members of the committee, for the \n     opportunity to speak. The Department of Military Affairs and \n     the Wisconsin National Guard is in support of senate bill \n     1174. I am First Lieutenant Melissa Inlow, a Judge Advocate \n     General Officer with the Wisconsin Army National Guard. By \n     granting servicemembers the right to terminate their cell \n     phone contracts upon mobilization, you are ensuring further \n     protections and peace of mind for our servicemembers. In \n     August of 2005, I was brought on to provide legal assistance \n     to our deployed servicemembers and their families. Since that \n     time, about 3-5 percent of my time has been dedicated to \n     assisting servicemembers in resolving issues with their cell \n     phone service contracts. It's becoming increasingly difficult \n     to get cell phone service providers to suspend the contract. \n     Even with suspension the soldiers are still paying up to $25 \n     a month for service they cannot reap the benefits of. These \n     fees can accumulate to more than the termination fee which on \n     average is $200. I've found it very difficult and sometimes \n     impossible to reach a live person and very difficult to reach \n     a person with decision making authority. Each time I have had \n     to call a cellular phone service provider, I have talked to\n\n[[Page S10684]]\n\n     a different customer service representative, and each has \n     given me a different resolution to the cell phone issue. The \n     companies are lacking significantly in internal consistency \n     when it comes to resolving cell phone contract issues. It has \n     been my experience that the customer service representatives \n     of cell phone companies experience high turn over rate and \n     are not aware of the wireless provider's policy on military \n     suspension. It is extremely frustrating for me; I can only \n     imagine the undue stress and strain it causes our deploying \n     servicemembers and their families that are left behind to \n     deal with these issues. This change will likely help ease the \n     stress deployment phaces on our servicemembers allowing them \n     to focus on their mission. I hope that the Federal Government \n     will follow suit and amend the Servicemember's Civil Relief \n     Act to incorporate a section on cell phone contracts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 4000. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe alcohol credit and the alternative fuel credit, to amend the Clean \nAir Act to promote the installation of fuel pumps for E-85 fuel, to \namend title 49 of the United States Code to require the manufacture of \ndual fueled automobiles, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the National Fuels \nInitiative of 2006. This act presents to this Congress a plan to bring \nmeaningful reductions in the amount of oil we consume in the United \nStates and reduce our dependency on oil imports. Dependence on imported \noil has put the United States in a position that no great power should \ntolerate. Our economic health is subject to forces far beyond our \ncontrol, including the decisions of hostile countries. We maintain a \nmassive military presence overseas, partly to preserve our oil \nlifeline. We have lost leverage on the international stage and are \ndaily exacerbating the problem by participating in an enormous wealth \ntransfer to authoritarian nations that happen to possess the commodity \nthat our economy can least do without. The hundreds of billions of \ndollars we spend on oil imports each year weakens our economy, enriches \nhostile regimes, and is used by some to support terrorism.\n  In the absence of revolutionary changes in energy policy, we are \nrisking multiple disasters for our country that will constrain living \nstandards, undermine our foreign policy goals, and leave us highly \nvulnerable to the machinations of rogue states. There are at least six \nthreats posed by oil dependence. First oil is vulnerable to supply \ndisruption as a result of natural disasters, wars, and terrorist \nattacks. Price shocks resulting from a major supply loss can put the \nU.S. economy into recession. Second, global oil reserves are becoming \nmore limited as easy supply is depleted, global demand rapidly \nincreases, and governments exert more control over reserves. This makes \noil more expensive in the short term, and creates the prospect that \nsupplies may not be accessible in the future. Third, some oil-rich \nnations are using energy as an overt weapon. Adversarial regimes from \nVenezuela, to Iran, to Russia are using energy supplies as leverage \nagainst their neighbors. Fourth, hundreds of billions of dollars in oil \nexport revenues flowing to authoritarian regimes increase corruption \nand hurt democratic reform. Some oil-rich nations are using this money \nto invest in terrorism, instability, or demagogic appeals to populism. \nFifth, the threat of global climate change has been made worse by \ninefficient and unclean use of non-renewable energy like oil. This \ncould bring about drought, famine, disease, and mass migration. And \nfinally, dependence on oil increases instability and undermines \ndevelopment in much of the developing world. Rising energy costs can \nundermine our foreign assistance and hurt stability, development, \ndisease eradication, and efforts to combat the root causes of \nterrorism.\n  The new geo-political reality emerging from the global energy \nsituation and United States dependence on oil imports demand that we \ndramatically decrease the amount of oil we consume. In March 2006, I \ndelivered an address at the Brookings Institution in which I described \n``a shifting balance of realism'' from those who believe in the \nimmutability of oil's domination of our economy and a laissez faire \napproach to energy policy to those who recognize that our Nation has no \nchoice but to seek a major reorientation in the way we get our energy. \nMarginally reducing our reliance on imported oil over the course of the \nnext few decades via the slow progress of market forces will be \nwelcome, but by the time a sustained energy crisis fully motivates \nmarket forces, we are likely to be well past the point where we can \nsave ourselves from extensive suffering. We must respond to our energy \nvulnerability as a crisis. This is the very essence of a problem \nrequiring Congressional action.\n  The heart of America's geostrategic problem is reliance on imported \noil in a market that is dominated by volatile and hostile governments. \nWe can start to break petroleum's grip right now. The key is to replace \noil used in transportation with renewable fuels and to improve the fuel \nefficiency of our cars and trucks.\n  I outlined the 5 central components of this energy plan at the \nRichard G. Lugar--Purdue University Summit on Energy Security on August \n29th, 2006. First, this bill sets a goal for the United States to \nexpand production of renewable fuels to at least 100 billion gallons a \nyear by 2025. Some of this added production will come from current \ncorn-based ethanol and biodiesel, but a great majority will be from \nemerging cellulosic technology allowing ethanol from diverse sources of \nrenewable biomass. Second, virtually all new cars sold in America \nshould be flex-fuel capable. These vehicles give Americans the choice \nto use E-85, a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline, or \nregular gasoline. This bill would require that virtually all vehicles \nwould be manufactured as flexible fuel vehicles within ten years. This \nprovision was also part of the Biomass Security Act of 2006 which I \njoined Senator Harkin in introducing earlier this year. Third, roughly \n25 percent of our nation's fueling stations should offer E-85 within \nthe next ten years. This provision was also part of the Biomass \nSecurity Act of 2006. This will give consumers choice and help spur \ninvestment in renewable fuel production. Fourth, the bill would enact \nincreased mileage standards that set a target of steadily improving \nfuel economy every year, as well as encourage research into new \nadvanced technology vehicles such as hybrids and coal-based \ntransportation fuels. I joined Senator Obama in introducing this \nprovision earlier this year as the Fuel Economy Reform Act of 2006. \nFinally, the bill would establish a revolutionary variable alternative \nfuel tax credit to support growth of alternative fuel production. While \nthis novel portion of the bill should be further debated and improved, \nits aim is to increase investment in cellulosic ethanol, coals to \nliquid, and other non-petroleum based fuels by reducing risks posed by \noil price manipulation of foreign regimes.\n  We must move now to address our energy vulnerability because \nsufficient investment cannot happen overnight, and it will take years \nto build supporting infrastructure and to change behavior. Americans \nneed to know exactly what the plan is and how we will achieve it. We \nnot only must understand how to bring alternatives to the market, we \nmust establish what degree of change would improve our national \nsecurity situation, then tailor national policy to achieve that goal. \nThe energy plan presented in this bill is a package of proposals that \nwould dramatically improve America's security posture. The plan would \nachieve the replacement of 6.5 million barrels of oil per day by \nvolume--the rough equivalent of one third of the oil used in America \nand one half of our oil imports. It would provide more jobs for \nAmericans instead of sending a deluge of money to hostile countries, \nsupport our farmers instead of foreign terrorists, and promote green \nfuels over fossil fuels.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4000\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The national security and economic prosperity of the \n     United States is threatened by our oil dependence, and the \n     reliance of the United States on oil imports impinges on our \n     foreign policy. Adversarial regimes rich in oil and natural \n     gas are using their energy supplies as leverage against \n     import-dependent countries and are using increased revenues \n     from oil and gas exports to gain international influence, \n     fund anti-American appeals, entrench authoritarianism, and \n     support terrorism.\n       (2) Global competition for oil reserves is increasing as \n     supply is depleted, demand increases, and foreign governments \n     attempt to exert more control over reserves. Supplies of oil \n     are vulnerable to disruption resulting from war, political \n     manipulation, natural disasters, and terrorist attacks. A \n     major loss in oil supply could result in a price shock \n     extremely damaging to the economy of the United States and \n     our way of life, and competition over scarce resources could \n     create conflict.\n       (3) Inefficient and unclean use of oil damages the \n     environment and worsens the threat of global climate change.\n\n     SEC. 3. DECLARATION OF UNITED STATES POLICY ON THE \n                   DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF RENEWABLE ALTERNATIVE \n                   FUELS.\n\n       Congress declares that:\n       (1) It is the policy of the United States to reduce \n     dependence on imported oil through increased efficiency and \n     diversification of fuel sources through dramatically expanded \n     use of clean alternative fuels. Such a reduction will \n     increase the foreign policy flexibility of the United States, \n     make the United States less vulnerable to oil supply \n     disruption, and promote economic growth. The United States \n     will continue to promote research and development of a range \n     of alternatives fuels, and it will implement policies to \n     accelerate the deployment and commercialization of existing \n     efficiency and alternative fuels technologies.\n       (2) It is the policy goal of the United States to produce \n     and utilize the equivalent of at least 100,000,000,000 \n     gallons of renewable fuel per year by 2025. This amount of \n     renewable fuel, along with innovation in fuel efficiency, \n     will substantially reduce the need for oil imports in the \n     United States.\n       (3) It is the policy of the United States to promote the \n     development of a global biofuels market through partnerships \n     with other nations and to reduce trade barriers for renewable \n     fuels.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to require the Secretary of Energy to award funds to \nstudy the feasibility of constructing 1 or more dedicated ethanol \npipelines to increase the energy, economic, and environmental security \nof the United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Ethanol \nInfrastructure Expansion Act of 2006. This bill directs the Department \nof Energy, DOE, to study and evaluate the feasibility of transporting \nethanol by pipeline. I am pleased that my colleague, Senator Lugar of \nIndiana, is joining me as a cosponsor of this bill.\n  There is broad recognition that we need to reduce our almost-complete \ndependence on oil for energy in our transportation sector. We also \nunderstand that there is not a single, simple solution to this \ndependence. I believe that we need to use energy more efficiently and \npromote alternatives to oil-based fuels in transportation.\n  The most promising liquid fuel alternative to conventional gasoline \ntoday is ethanol. Use of ethanol as an additive in gasoline and in the \nform of E85 is expanding rapidly, and for good reasons. First of all, \nas a domestically-\n\n[[Page S10689]]\n\nproduced fuel, ethanol contributes to our national energy security. As \na gasoline additive, ethanol provides air quality benefits by reducing \nauto tailpipe emissions of air pollutants. Because ethanol is \nbiodegradable, its use poses no threat to surface water or groundwater. \nFinally, the production of ethanol provides national and regional \neconomic and job-growth benefits by using local resources and labor to \ncontribute to critical national transportation energy needs,\n  My Congressional colleagues and I have recognized the benefits and \npotential of ethanol and have promoted its expanded production and use \nin numerous bills, including most recently in the 2005 energy bill. A \nkey provision in that legislation is the renewable fuels standard under \nwhich motor vehicle fuel sold in the United States is required to \ncontain increasing levels of renewable fuels. Several other provisions \npromote the production and use of ethanol from cellulose, which is an \nespecially attractive approach because it enables the use of a broad \nvariety of plentiful and low-cost feedstocks including corn stover, \nwheat straw, forest industry wastes and woody municipal wastes.\n  The benefits of ethanol are reflected in the rapid expansion of its \nproduction and use, which has increased by more than 20 percent \nannually for the past several years. Moreover, ethanol's longer-term \npotential to become a very significant energy source for transportation \nalso is gaining attention. A number of studies have concluded that \nethanol can contribute 20 to 30 percent or more of our transportation \nfuel in the future. Several of my Senate colleagues joined me to \nintroduce S. 2817, the Biofuels Security Act of 2006 which calls for \ndomestic production and use of renewable fuels to reach 60 billion \ngallons a year by 2030. I am especially proud of the leadership role \nthat my State of Iowa and the neighboring states of the Midwest are \ngoing to play in this expansion.\n  Given this outlook, it is time for us to consider the full \nimplications of such a transition. One issue that deserves prompt \nattention is that of ethanol transport. The volumes of ethanol to be \nshipped in the future strongly suggest that pipeline transport should \nbe evaluated because of the potential economic and environmental \nadvantages that alternative might offer as compared to shipment by \nhighway, rail tanker or barge. As production volumes increase, \nespecially in the Midwest, it is likely to be more economical to pump \nethanol through pipelines than to ship it in containers across the \ncountry. Pipeline shipping also would reduce the vehicle emissions \nassociated with rail or tanker shipment, as well as being more energy \nefficient.\n  For all of these reasons, we should begin to consider development of \nan ethanol pipeline network. Given the pace of ethanol's growth, it is \nlikely that our Nation could begin to benefit from pipeline transport \nof ethanol as early as the 2015 to 2020 timeframe. The current state of \nknowledge regarding transport of ethanol by pipeline is limited. \nHowever, it is being done in Brazil, a world leader in the production \nand use of ethanol. Still, it is also known that the water solubility \nof ethanol introduces technical and operational issues bearing on \nshipment of ethanol in multi-product pipelines. Thus, the planning, \nsiting, design, financing, permitting and construction of the first \nethanol pipelines may well take as long as a decade, perhaps longer. \nFor that reason, we need to begin now to develop a better understanding \nof this ethanol transport option.\n  This bill initiates that process by directing the Department of \nEnergy to conduct ethanol pipeline feasibility studies. It calls for \nanalyses of the technological, economic, regulatory, financial and \nsiting issues related to transporting ethanol via pipelines. A \nsystematic analysis of these ethanol pipeline issues will provide the \nsubstantive information necessary for assessing the costs and benefits \nof this transport alternative. DOE would either fund private sector \nstudies or conduct the studies on its own. The results of these studies \nwill provide a clearer picture of the benefits and challenges of \npipeline transport of ethanol. They will provide critical information, \nboth for the ethanol industry as it contemplates ethanol transport \nalternatives, and for policy-makers seeking to understand what federal \npolicies or programs might be appropriate to promote the most cost-\neffective and environmentally sound ethanol transportation in the \nfuture.\n  We have broad agreement on the need to do all that we can to reduce \nour dependence on oil. We are promoting expanding production and use of \nrenewable fuels in many ways, but we need to consider the full range of \ninfrastructure issues that broader ethanol use entails. Because of the \nrapid growth of ethanol production and use, these studies of pipeline \ntransport of ethanol should be undertaken in the very near future. I \nurge my Senate colleagues to join me in passing this important and \ntimely legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 4004.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \nfeasibility studies to identify opportunities to increase the surface \nflows of the Rio Grande, Canadian, and Pecos Rivers in the State of New \nMexico, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, monsoons this summer provided New Mexico \nwith a brief reprieve from drought conditions that have persisted in \nsome areas of New Mexico since 2000. We would be remiss to let our \nrecent good fortune influence our long-term water planning. July and \nAugust this year were the wettest July and August in the past 112 \nyears. Clearly, we cannot assume these events will become commonplace. \nFor this reason, we must take steps to ensure we are prepared for \nfuture droughts and increasing competition for limited water supplies.\n  Despite summer rains, many reservoirs are still far below historical \naverages. According to recent reservoir data, Heron and El Vado \nReservoirs on the Chama River are 71 percent and 56 percent of average, \nrespectively; Conchas Reservoir on the Canadian River is 50 percent of \naverage; and Elephant Butte Reservoir on the Rio Grande is 27 percent \nof average. Moreover, because storage in Elephant Butte Reservoir has \nnot reached 400,000 acre feet, the Rio Grande Compact imposes \nrestrictions on New Mexico's ability to store water in reservoirs on \nthe Rio Grande and Chama Rivers. As such, recent rains have not \ncontributed significantly to storage on those rivers.\n\n[[Page S10690]]\n\n  The water crisis we were facing prior to the summer rains led many to \nquestion how we will allocate this finite resource among numerous and \ncompeting needs. As witnessed on the Klamath River and the Rio Grande \nin New Mexico, water shortages often result in litigation that pits \nmunicipalities, agricultural producers, industry, Indians, and the \nenvironmental community against one another. In order to avoid such \ncrises in New Mexico, the United States Congress has appropriated \nenormous sums in order to ensure that existing uses are not curtailed. \nHowever, unless new sources of water are found, future conflict over \nwater is inevitable.\n  Recent conditions illustrate the need for us to look for ways to \nsupplement flows of the most severely impacted regions in order to \nstave off the hardships and conflict that result from lean water years. \nIt is my sincere hope that record-breaking rains this summer will not \nbreed complacency. The bill I introduce today would authorize the \nUnited States Bureau of Reclamation to investigate ways to increase the \nflows of the Rio Grande, Pecos and Canadian Rivers, the three rivers \nthat have been most devastated by long-term drought. While little can \nbe done to increase rainfall, it is my belief that this bill will help \nus begin to better understand ways to increase the flows of these \nrivers to help mitigate the damaging effects that drought imposes on \nthe municipalities, agricultural producers, industries and endangered \nspecies that depend on the water these rivers provide.\n  I thank Representative Heather Wilson for introducing a companion \nmeasure in the House of Representatives.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4007\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide \nfinancial assistance to the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water Authority \nfor the planning, design, and construction of the Eastern New Mexico \nRural Water System, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President. I would like to bring to the attention \nof the Senate a problem faced by communities in eastern New Mexico \nillustrative of a greater problem that will ultimately be encountered \nby all who depend on the Ogallala Aquifer for their water. This \nincludes communities in New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, \nNebraska, Wyoming and South Dakota. At one time, the Aquifer contained \nroughly the same amount of water as Lake Huron. After 65 years of \nmining, we are now faced with the reality that the water contained in \nthe Ogallala Aquifer has been significantly depleted and continues to \nbe drawn down at an alarming rate.\n  Many on the periphery of the Aquifer, including much of eastern New \nMexico, parts of Kansas and Oklahoma have been forced to drill new \nwells in order to supplement existing wells that are producing water at \na fraction of the volume of several decades ago. This problem is not \nlimited to those communities overlying the Ogallala. Many other regions \nentirely reliant on groundwater face a similar problem. As is the case \nwith the communities in eastern New Mexico, when the wells run dry, the \nonly alternative for many is to ship water from long distances. In many \ninstances, this is a very expensive proposition that exceeds the \ncapacity of rural communities' ability to pay.\n  In order to address the want of a sustainable water supply in eastern \nNew Mexico, I introduce today the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System \nAct of 2006. The bill would authorize the United States Bureau of \nReclamation to provide financial assistance to the Eastern New Mexico \nRural Water Authority, at a 75 percent Federal cost-share, to construct \na pipeline from Ute Reservoir to communities in eastern New Mexico. \nThis project would provide them with a renewable source of water for \nyears to come. Presently, it is unclear how many years the groundwater \nresources on which they rely will be available.\n  The communities which make up the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water \nAuthority are due a great deal of credit for initiating engineering \nstudies, project financing studies, and seeking support for the project \nfrom local, Federal and State governments. However, it would be \nmisleading to suggest that securing appropriations for this or similar \npipelines would be easy or that the funds will be available any time \nsoon. The current budget of the United States Bureau of Reclamation \nsimply cannot accommodate the large sums of money that this or other \nwater supply projects would require. As Chairman of the Energy and \nWater Development Appropriations Subcommittee, I am acutely aware of \nthis fact and I have made this clear to the communities that would \nbenefit from the pipeline authorized by the bill that I introduce \ntoday. However, I remain committed to advocate for the need to dedicate \nsubstantially more of the national budget to this and other western \nwater issues with Congress and the Administration. In the interim, it \nis my hope that we can begin the long and difficult process of moving \nthis bill through the Federal legislature. The members of the Eastern \nNew Mexico Rural Water Authority fully appreciate the difficulties that \nlie ahead.\n  The problem faced by eastern New Mexico communities will become \ncommonplace as groundwater supplies are exhausted. Approximately half \nof the population of the United States depends on aquifers for their \ndomestic water needs. In the coming years, the United States Congress \nwill have to provide succor to similar communities who have no \nalternative than to seek assistance from the Federal Government. \nCommensurate with this need for assistance, Congress will also have to \nmake budgetary decisions that take into account this widespread \nproblem. We would be remiss in our duties to let these communities \nsimply dryup.\n  I thank Senator Bingaman, my friend and colleague for the past 23 \nyears and ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nfor co-sponsoring this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4008\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be co-sponsoring a bill \nwhich Senator Domenici and I are introducing today, that would \nauthorize the Bureau of Reclamation to help communities in eastern New \nMexico develop the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System (ENMRWS). The \nwater supply and long-term security to be made available by this \nproject is absolutely critical to the region's future. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues here in the Senate to help make this \nproject a reality.\n  This bill is very similar to a bill I introduced in June 2004 which \nwas the subject of a hearing before the Water & Power Subcommittee of \nthe Energy & Natural Resources Committee. At that hearing, the Bureau \nof Reclamation raised a number of issues that needed to be addressed by \nthe Project sponsors prior to securing Reclamation's support. I'm happy \nto say that the sponsors have worked diligently to address those \nissues, and it is time, once again, to move this project towards \nauthorization. I realize that there is little time left in the 109th \nCongress. Nonetheless, introduction of this bill now is important to \nensure an ongoing dialogue with the Bureau of Reclamation and maintain \nprogress as we head towards the 110th Congress.\n  The source of water for the ENMRWS is Ute Reservoir, a facility \nconstructed by the State of New Mexico in the early 1960s. In 1966, \nCongress authorized Reclamation to study the feasibility of a project \nthat would utilize Ute Reservoir to supply water to communities in \neastern New Mexico (P.L. 89-561). Numerous studies were subsequently \ncompleted, but it was not until the late 1990s that several \ncommunities, concerned about their reliance on declining and degraded \ngroundwater supplies in the area, began to plan seriously for the \ndevelopment of a regional water system that would make use of the \nrenewable supply available from Ute Reservoir.\n  As part of that process, the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water Authority \nwas formed to carry out the development of the ENMRWS. The Authority \nconsists of 6 communities and 2 counties in eastern New Mexico, and has \nbeen very effective in securing local funds and State funding to \nsupport the studies and planning necessary to move the project forward. \nTo date, the State of New Mexico has provided over $4 million to help \ndevelop the ENMRWS.\n  This is a very important bill to the citizens of New Mexico. It has \nthe broad support of the communities in the region as well as financial \nsupport from the State of New Mexico. There is no question that \ncompletion of the ENMRWS will provide communities in Curry and \nRoosevelt counties with a long-term renewable source of water that is \nneeded to sustain current economic activity and support future growth \nand development in the region. I hope my colleagues will support this \nlegislation, thereby helping to address pressing water needs in the \nrural West.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MENENDEZ:\n  S. 4009. A bill to restore, reaffirm, and reconcile legal rights and \nremedies under civil rights statutes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to protect the most vulnerable members of our society, our \nchildren, from environmental pollution. We are well aware that children \nare especially susceptible to toxins in the environment--they spend a \ngood deal of time playing outside, and frequently put foreign objects \ninto their mouths. In proportion to their body weight, they eat, drink, \nand breathe more than adults, meaning concentrations of pollutants that \nmight not affect adults could have serious consequences for children. \nFurthermore, many of their physiological\n\n[[Page S10692]]\n\nsystems are still developing, making them particularly sensitive to \npollutants.\n  I believe that our environmental laws need to first and foremost \nprotect the most vulnerable members of our society. Unfortunately, many \nof our statutes are designed with adults in mind, and may not \nadequately protect children. In addition, there have been a number of \nrecent reports in New Jersey about schools and day care centers being \nbuilt on contaminated sites. One site in particular, the Kiddie Kollege \nday care center in Franklin Township, NJ, was operating at the site of \na former thermometer factory, exposing the children and employees to \ndangerous levels of mercury. Sadly, there was no requirement for the \nproperty to be tested for environmental contamination prior to opening \nas a day care center. Subsequently, we have learned about a number of \nday care centers either built on or adjacent to sites contaminated with \nvolatile organic chemicals and other toxins.\n  That is why I am introducing this legislation today. The \nEnvironmental Protection for Children Act would create a grant program \nthat encourages States to enact laws ensuring that properties are \ntested for pollution before a new day care center or school is allowed \nto open. The grants could be used for the testing and cleanup of \nexisting schools and day care centers as well. Furthermore, this bill \ntightens the Federal programs that regulate hazardous chemicals and \nenvironmental pollutants--the Toxic Substances Control Act, Superfund \nlaw, Toxic Release Inventory, and Federal Hazardous Substances Act--so \nthat the vulnerability of children to toxins and pollutants is taken \ninto account when public health standards are being developed. It also \nprovides for more research into the specific vulnerabilities of \nchildren to environmental pollutants, since in many cases we don't know \nhow much additional risk children are under.\n  We as a Nation have assiduously acted to protect our children from \nmany of the dangers that they face every day, but we have dropped the \nball when it comes to making sure that the places where they spend \ntheir days are free from contamination. The Environmental Protection \nfor Children Act will help fix that, and I urge my colleagues to join \nme in support of this important piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 4013.

This bill, which is cosponsored by my colleague \nfrom Oregon Senator Wyden, will make facilities that generate \nelectricity using kinetic hydropower eligible for a production tax \ncredit.\n  Under this bill, kinetic hydropower is defined as: ocean free flowing \nwater derived from flows from tidal currents, ocean currents, waves, or \nestuary currents; ocean thermal energy; or free flowing water in \nrivers, lakes, man-made channels, or streams.\n  These innovative technologies are renewable, non-emitting resources \nthat can help meet our Nation's growing demand for electricity. In \nOregon, it would be possible to produce and transmit over two hundred \nmegawatts of wave energy without any upgrades to the existing \ntransmission system on the coast. Already a number of preliminary \npermits have been filed at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for \nwave energy facilities off the Oregon coast.\n  These facilities would be virtually invisible from shore, and could \nprovide predictable generation that could be easily integrated with \nother electricity resources. In addition, according to a January 2005 \nreport issued by the Electric Power Research Institute, ``with proper \nsiting, converting ocean wave energy to electricity is believed to be \none of the most environmentally benign ways to generate electricity.''\n  As with many emerging renewable technologies, wave and tidal energy \nare more costly than traditional generation using fossil fuels. Yet, \nfor our environment and our energy security, we must provide incentives \nthat will encourage the development and commercialization of these \nresources.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and to \nprovide this production tax credit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Frist, Mr. Biden, Mr. Smith, and \n        Mr. McCain):\n  S. 4014. A bill to endorse further enlargement of the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization (NATO) and to facilitate the timely admission of \nAlbania, Croatia, Georgia, and Macedonia to NATO, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``NATO \nFreedom Consolidation Act of 2006. I am pleased that the Majority \nLeader, Senator Frist, Senator Biden, and Senator Smith have joined me \nin proposing this important legislation.\n  The goal of this bill is to reaffirm United States support for \ncontinued enlargement of NATO to democracies that are able and willing \nto meet the responsibilities of membership. In particular, the \nlegislation calls for the timely admission of Albania, Croatia, \nGeorgia, and Macedonia to NATO and authorizes security assistance for \nthese countries in Fiscal Year 2007. Each of these countries has \nclearly stated its desire to join NATO and is working hard to meet the \nspecified requirements for membership. The bill also affirms that the \nUnited States stands ready to consider, and if all applicable criteria \nare satisfied, to support efforts by Ukraine to join NATO, should \nUkraine decide that it wishes to meet the responsibilities of \nmembership in the Alliance.\n  I believe that eventual NATO membership for these four countries \nwould be a success for Europe, NATO, and the United States by \ncontinuing to extend the zone of peace and security. Albania, Croatia, \nand Macedonia have been making progress on reforms through their \nparticipation in the NATO Membership Action Plan since 2002. \nUnfortunately, Georgia has not yet been granted a Membership Action \nPlan but nevertheless has made remarkable progress. This legislation \nwill provide important incentives and assistance to the countries to \ncontinue the implementation of democratic, defense, and economic \nreforms.\n  Since the end of the Cold War, NATO has been evolving to meet the new \nsecurity needs of the 21st century. In this era, the threats to NATO \nmembers are transnational and far from its geographic borders. There is \nstrong support among members for NATO's operation in Afghanistan, and \nfor its training mission in Iraq. NATO's viability as an effective \ndefense and security alliance depends on flexible, creative leadership, \nas well as the willingness of members to improve capabilities and \naddress common threats.\n  If NATO is to continue to be the preeminent security Alliance and \nserve the defense interests of its membership, it must continue to \nevolve and that evolution must include enlargement. Potential NATO \nmembership motivates emerging democracies to make important advances in \nareas such as the rule of law and civil society. A closer relationship \nwith NATO will promote these values and contribute to our mutual \nsecurity. Georgia is a young democracy that has made tremendous \nprogress since the ``Rose Revolution.'' It is situated in a critical \ngeostrategic location and his host to a large portion of the Baku-\nTbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline that carries important energy resources to the \nWest from Azerbaijan and, in the future, Kazakhstan. Georgia is \nresisting pressure from breakaway republics backed by Moscow. In the \npast, border disputes have been identified as reasons a country may not \nbe invited to join NATO. But in this case, Russia's action, not \nGeorgia's, is frustrating Tbilisi's NATO aspirations.\n  Three years ago, the United States Senate unanimously voted to invite \nseven countries to join NATO. Today, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, \nLithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia are making significant \ncontributions to NATO and are among our closest allies in the global \nwar on terrorism. It is time again for the United States to take the \nlead in urging its allies to bring in new members, and to offer\n\n[[Page S10693]]\n\ntimely admission of Albania, Croatia, Georgia, and Macedonia to NATO.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Santorum):\n  S. 4017. A bill to provide for an appeals process for hospital wage \nindex classification under the Medicare program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce with Senator Santorum the Hospital Payment Improvement and \nEquity Act, which will provide an increased reimbursement for acute \ncare hospitals and inpatient rehabilitation facilities that are \ndisadvantaged by Medicare payments under the Medicare area wage index \nreclassification system.\n  For a considerable period of time, there have been a number of \ncounties in Pennsylvania that have been suffering from low Medicare \nreimbursements, which has caused them great disadvantage because their \nnurses, and other medical personnel are moving to surrounding areas. I \nrefer specifically to Luzerne County, Lackawanna County, Wyoming \nCounty, Lycoming County, and Columbia County in northeastern \nPennsylvania. Those counties are surrounded by MSAs, metropolitan \nstatistical areas, in Newport, NY, to the north; in Allentown to the \nsoutheast; and the Harrisburg MSA to the southwest. As these counties \nare surrounded by MSAs with higher Medicare reimbursements, a flight of \nvery necessary medical personnel has occurred. More recently, western \nPennsylvania has been faced with Medicare reimbursement that has not \nkept pace with the rising cost of healthcare placing a tremendous \nburden on these facilities to provide good jobs at competitive wages.\n  It has also come to my attention that inpatient rehabilitation \nfacilities are not provided an opportunity to obtain equitable Medicare \nreimbursement. Inpatient rehabilitation facilities receive adjustments \nin their Medicare reimbursement due to geographic disadvantages within \nthe Medicare inpatient prospective payment system. This is based on \ninformation gathered from other acute care facilities in the MSA, not \nfrom their own wage information. Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities, \nfurther, cannot apply for reclassification to another MSA that reflects \ntheir labor costs. This has prevented those facilities from being \neligible for increased funding to assist with wages like acute care \nfacilities, while being forced to compete for employees with those \nfacilities that have had access to increased funding.\n  I have worked to find a solution to this problem for a number of \nyears. During the conference for the fiscal year 2002 Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Education Appropriations bill, the conferees agreed \nthat there should be relief for these areas in Pennsylvania that were \nsurrounded by areas that had higher MSA ratings. However, at the last \nminute, there was an objection to including language in the conference \nreport.\n  To correct this problem I, with Representatives Sherwood and English, \nbrought the matter forward in the Fiscal Year 2002 Supplemental \nAppropriations bill. They worked to include language in the House \nversion of the bill and I filed an amendment to the Senate bill. During \nconference negotiations my amendment was defeated and the provisions \nwere not included.\n  As part the Fiscal Year 2004 Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation Appropriations, I provided $7 million for hospitals in \nNortheast Pennsylvania that continued to be disadvantaged by the \nMedicare area wage index reclassification. This was provided as \ntemporary assistance for those facilities.\n  During the consideration of the Medicare Prescription Drug, \nImprovement, and Modernization Act of 2003, I met with Finance Chairman \nGrassley and Ranking Member Baucus about the bill provisions, including \nthe need for a solution to the Medicare area wage index \nreclassification problem in Pennsylvania. As a result, Section 508 was \nincluded in the bill, which provides increased funding for hospitals \nnationally to be reclassified to locations with higher Medicare \nreimbursement rates for three years at $300 million per year. The \ntemporary program, which began in April 2004 and will expire April \n2007, has and will provide Pennsylvania hospitals $69 million over that \ntime, $23 million per year.\n  Most recently, as part of the Senate Fiscal Year 2007 Labor, Health \nand Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill, I provided $4.3 \nmillion for hospitals in the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre and Williamsport \nareas that have been harmed by the ongoing wage index problem. Further, \non June 14, 2006, 20 other Senators joined me in sending a letter to \nFinance Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus in support of \nSenate action to extend Section 508.\n  As the Section 508 program is scheduled to expire on March 31, 2007, \nand the low Medicare area wage index reimbursement is still being \nunfairly placed on many Pennsylvania hospitals, the legislation I am \nintroducing would extend the current Section 508 benefit to those who \nare currently receiving funding and to those who deserved funds under \nthe previous competition for this funding.\n\n  The legislation builds on the Section 508 Medicare Prescription Drug, \nImprovement, and Modernization Act of 2003, by providing hospitals who \ncontinue to be disadvantaged by low Medicare reimbursement an increase \nin funding. The bill would allow both acute care hospitals and not-for-\nprofit inpatient rehabilitation facilities apply for funding in a \nsimilar manner as set up under Section 508. Facilities that meet \nspecific wage and geographic criteria will receive a three year \nreclassification.\n  Under the Section 508, program a number of hospitals meet the \nnecessary criteria to receive reclassification, however, inadequate \nfunding of $300 million per year for the program was provided. As a \nresult, 154 additional hospitals did not receive this vital funding. \nUnder this legislation, sufficient funds would be provided to allow all \nfacilities that meet wage and geographic criteria to receive \nreclassification funding.\n  To remedy the under-funding of impatient rehabilitation facilities, \nnot for profit facilities will be eligible for funding through this \nprogram. If all acute care hospitals in an MSA apply for and receive \nfunding through this program, or have sole community hospital status, \nor have reclassified to another MSA through another mechanism, then \nnon-profit inpatient rehabilitation facilities in that MSA are \neligible. Those rehabilitation facilities will be reclassified to the \nMSA where a majority of other hospitals from the same MSA have been \nreclassified.\n  For those hospitals who received funding under the current Section \n508; they will have received the benefit of a higher wage index for \nthree years, April 1 , 2004-March 1, 2007. These higher wages will be \nincluded in the hospitals' cost reports and be reflected in the data \nused to calculate a future wage index. It has always been the hope that \nthis increased funding would enable these hospitals to pay higher wages \nand subsequently see an increase in the area wage index.\n  The problem with the wage index system is the use of three year-old \naudited cost report data for the calculation of the wage index. \nTherefore, a full year of Section 508 money from fiscal year 2004 will \nfirst be seen in the fiscal year 2008 wage index calculation. For \nhospitals that end their fiscal year on June 30, that wage data will \nnot be included in their wage index calculation until fiscal year 2009. \nTo reclassify, three years of data is needed to show the proper \nevidence for eligibility. Thus, the full effect of the Section 508 \nfunding will flow through the wage index system by fiscal year 2011. \nFor this reason, additional funding is needed for the next three years \nin order for these disadvantaged hospitals to continue paying \ncompetitive salaries to their employees.\n  Under Section 508, 121 hospitals have and will receive $900 million \nin assistance, while this is a significant amount of funding, it did \nnot fix the problem of low Medicare wage reimbursement. A long term \nsolution to this problem is needed, however the current Section 508 \nfunding will expire on March 31, 2007 and additional funding is needed \nfor these facilities while we work to find that solution. The loss of \nhospitals and jobs due to unfair CMS reimbursement is unacceptable.\n  The hospitals which face this low Medicare reimbursement are in great \nfinancial distress. These are hospitals which are serving an aging \npopulation\n\n[[Page S10694]]\n\nin northeastern Pennsylvania and across the nation. This legislation \nprovides Medicare reimbursement assistance for those facilities and \nensures Medicare beneficiaries' access to care. I encourage my \ncolleagues to work with Senator Santorum and me to move this \nlegislation forward promptly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Obama):\n   S. 4018. A bill to establish a Vote by Mail grant program; to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, when many Americans think of voting, they \nthink of long lines, malfunctioning equipment, closed polls, or even \nworse, fraud. That's why so many Americans don't bother to vote. But in \nmy home State of Oregon, folks vote by mail and these sorts of problems \nare a thing of the past.\n  So today I come to the floor to talk about the sorry state of the \nNation's election system and discuss my bill, the Vote by Mail Act of \n2006.\n  There is nothing more fundamental than the right to vote. It is the \nfoundation on which our democracy rests. Weaken the right to vote and \nyou weaken America.\n  It's been almost 6 years since the 2000 Florida hanging chad debacle. \nAnd yet, problems with America's election system--and waning confidence \nin that system--persist.\n  This year's primary elections were no exception to the rule:\n  In Montgomery County, MD, polling places opened late because election \nofficials forgot to distribute the access cards necessary to run the \nvoting machines. Voters resorted to filling out provisional ballots and \nwhen those ran out, they used photocopied ballots and even scraps of \npaper.\n  Next door, in Prince George's County, MD, a handful of errors--\ncomputers incorrectly identifying voters' party affiliation, electronic \nvoter registration lists freezing up, and voting machines failing to \ntransmit data--delayed results of a hotly contested election and may \nresult in a lawsuit.\n  Long lines, a lack of machines at certain polling places, and other \nirregularities cast a black mark on Ohio's 2004 Presidential election \nresults. Unfortunately, this year's primary elections were also plagued \nby problems. In Cuyahoga County, Ohio's largest county, thousands of \nabsentee ballots were incorrectly formatted for electronic scanners and \nhad to be counted by hand. And problems with about 10 percent of the \npaper ballots cast meant that they couldn't be counted at all.\n  In Cook County, IL, new voting technology created headaches at \nhundreds of voting sites around the county, which delayed results in a \ndecisive county board race.\n  And in Tarrant County, TX, voting machines counted ballots as many as \nsix times, which meant that 100,000 more votes were recorded than were \nactually cast.\n  These are just a few recent examples of election system snafus that \nhave raised concerns about voting system accuracy and reliability, \nconcerns that have led some states to reconsider their election plans.\n  Last week, Maryland Governor Robert Ehrlich suggested that the state \nscrap its new electronic voting system and return to paper ballots. \nEarlier this year, Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico got rid of \nhis touch-screen voting machines. Connecticut's Secretary of State did \nthe same. Both states have decided to use paper ballots and optical \nscanners instead of electronic machines.\n  But as Florida reminds us, paper isn't perfect either and right now--\nelectronic or paper--you can expect there to be lot of problems come \nNovember 7th.\n  Hopefully, these problems won't affect the outcome of any election. I \nsure hope they don't. But whether they do or not, the Election Day \nproblems that I expect will plague states and counties around the \nnation will push voter confidence in our election system further into \nthe basement.\n  It's too late for Congress to do much of anything to fix the problem \nbefore the 2006 elections. But we can do something to make sure these \nproblems don't arise ever again.\n  So today, along with my esteemed colleagues, Senator John Kerry of \nMassachusetts and Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, I am introducing \nthe Vote by Mail Act of 2006, a bill that will make Election Day \nproblems a thing of the past and quickly and effectively reinvigorate \nAmericans' confidence in their election system and in their democracy.\n  The bill creates a three year, $110 million grant program to help \ninterested states adopt vote by mail election systems like the one that \nOregon voters have been successfully using for some time now.\n  It's a pretty simple system. Voters get their ballots in the mail. \nWherever and whenever they would like, right up to Election Day, voters \ncomplete their ballots and return them.\n  With vote by mail, polls don't open late.\n  With vote by mail, there aren't any long lines at the polls.\n  With vote by mail, there's no more confusion about where you are \nsupposed to vote.\n  There's no more debate about whether you are on the voting rolls--\neither you get the ballot in the mail, or you don't. If you don't, you \nhave time to contact your election officials to sort it out.\n  Vote by mail means almost no chance of voter fraud because trained \nelection officials match the signature on each ballot against the \nsignature on each voter's registration card.\n  No ballot is processed or counted until everyone is satisfied that \nthe two signatures match.\n  With vote by mail, you've got a paper trail. Each voter marks up his \nballot and sends it in. That ballot is counted and then becomes the \npaper record used in the event of a recount.\n  With vote by mail, there's much less risk of voter intimidation. \nThat's why a 2003 study of Oregon voters showed that those groups that \nwould likely be most vulnerable to coercion actually prefer vote by \nmail.\n  Vote by mail results in more informed voters. Because folks get their \nballots weeks before the election, they have the time they need to get \neducated about the candidates and the issues, and deliberate in a way \nnot possible at a polling place.\n  Vote by mail leads to huge election costs savings because it gets rid \nof the need to transport equipment to polling stations and to hire and \ntrain poll workers. Oregon has reduced its election-related costs by 30 \npercent since implementing vote by mail. I expect that other states \nthat adopt vote by mail will see the same results.\n  Vote by mail can help make the problems of recent elections a thing \nof the past. In doing so, it will make our elections fairer and help \nreinstill faith in our democracy.\n  Vote by mail works. And that's why Senator Kerry and Senator Obama \nand I are introducing the Vote by Mail Act of 2006 today.\n  It gives States funds that they can use to make the transition away \nfrom the traditional voting methods that have led to so many problems, \nso many concerns, and so little confidence in the American election \nsystem.\n  It gives States funds that they can use to adopt Oregon-style vote by \nmail with the technical assistance and the guidance of the Election \nAssistance Commission.\n  I believe that the Vote by Mail Act of 2006 can fix our election \nsystem once and for all.\n  One final point: the Help Americans Vote Act, also know as HAVA, \ntakes important steps to ensure equal access to voting for all \nAmericans. HAVA's protections are particularly important to voters with \ndisabilities, and it is our responsibility to keep building on that \nfoundation. Nothing in this bill undermines or changes those aspects of \nHAVA that require vote by mail systems to be just as accessible as any \nother voting method.\n  While I think Oregon has proven that people with disabilities can \nbenefit from vote by mail, it is important to keep working with the \npeople who know these issues best to make sure the right to vote is \nprotected. And Senator Kerry, Senator Obama, and I look forward to \nworking with disabled and other civil rights organizations, election \nreform groups, community organizations and the voters themselves to \nensure that the Vote by Mail Act of 2006 further promotes access to the \npolls for individuals with disabilities.\n  So I urge my colleagues to seriously consider this bill and urge them \nto support it. Vote by mail has been an enormous success in Oregon. I \nam sure that\n\n[[Page S10695]]\n\nother States that adopt it will see the same benefits. This bill helps \nensure that States have that opportunity.\n  I asked for unanimous consent that my statement be printed into the \nRecord and I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the Vote by \nMail Act of 2006 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4018\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Vote by Mail Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Supreme Court declared in Reynolds v. Sims that \n     ``[i]t has been repeatedly recognized that all qualified \n     voters have a constitutionally protected right to vote . . . \n     and to have their votes counted.''.\n       (2) In the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections, voting \n     technology failures and procedural irregularities deprived \n     some Americans of their fundamental right to vote.\n       (3) In 2000, faulty punch card ballots and other equipment \n     failures prevented accurate vote counts nationwide. A report \n     by the Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project estimates that \n     approximately 1,500,000 votes for president were intended to \n     be cast but not counted in the 2000 election because of \n     equipment failures.\n       (4) In 2004, software errors, malfunctioning electronic \n     voting systems, and long lines at the polls prevented \n     accurate vote counts and prevented some people from voting. \n     For instance, voters at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio \n     waited in line for up to 12 hours because there were only 2 \n     machines available for 1,300 voters.\n       (5) Under the Oregon Vote by Mail system, election \n     officials mail ballots to all registered voters at least 2 \n     weeks before election day. Voters mark their ballots, seal \n     the ballots in both unmarked secrecy envelopes and signed \n     return envelopes, and return the ballots by mail or to secure \n     drop boxes. Once a ballot is received, election officials \n     scan the bar code on the ballot envelope, which brings up the \n     voter's signature on a computer screen. The election official \n     compares the signature on the screen and the signature on the \n     ballot envelope. Only if the signature on the ballot envelope \n     is determined to be authentic is the ballot forwarded on to \n     be counted.\n       (6) Oregon's Vote by Mail system has resulted in an \n     extremely low rate of voter fraud because the system includes \n     numerous security measures such as the signature \n     authentication system. Potential misconduct is also deterred \n     by the power of the State to punish those who engage in voter \n     fraud with up to five years in prison, $100,000 in fines, and \n     the loss of their vote.\n       (7) Vote by Mail is one factor making voter turnout in \n     Oregon consistently higher than the average national voter \n     turnout. For example, Oregon experienced a record voting-age-\n     eligible population turnout of 70.6 percent in the 2004 \n     presidential election, compared to 58.4 percent nationally. \n     Oregon's turnout of registered voters for that election was \n     86.48 percent.\n       (8) Women, younger voters, and homemakers also report that \n     they vote more often using Vote by Mail.\n       (9) Vote by Mail reduces election costs by eliminating the \n     need to transport equipment to polling stations and to hire \n     and train poll workers. Oregon has reduced its election-\n     related costs by 30 percent since implementing Vote by Mail.\n       (10) Vote by Mail allows voters to educate themselves \n     because they receive ballots well before election day, which \n     provides them with ample time to research issues, study \n     ballots, and deliberate in a way that is not possible at a \n     polling place.\n       (11) Vote by Mail is accurate--at least 2 studies comparing \n     voting technologies show that absentee voting methods, \n     including Vote by Mail systems, result in a more accurate \n     vote count.\n       (12) Vote by Mail results in more up-to-date voter rolls, \n     since election officials use forwarding information from the \n     post office to update voter registration.\n       (13) Vote by Mail allows voters to visually verify that \n     their votes were cast correctly and produces a paper trail \n     for recounts.\n       (14) In a survey taken 5 years after Oregon implemented the \n     Vote by Mail system, more than 8 in 10 Oregon voters said \n     they preferred voting by mail to traditional voting.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to convey \nto the McGee Creek Authority certain facilities of the McGee Creek \nProject, Oklahoma, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to authorize \nthe title transfer of the McGee Creek Reservoir dam and its associated \nfacilities, which are located approximately 20 miles southeast of \nAtoka, OK.\n  My bill transfers title from the Bureau of Reclamation to the McGee \nCreek Authority.\n  The McGee Creek Authority is a trust of the State of Oklahoma. This \nOklahoma entity was established to develop, finance, operate, and \nmaintain the water supply in the McGee Creek Reservoir. Thus, the \nprimary purpose is to provide a dependable ``municipal and industrial'' \nwater supply for Oklahoma City, the City of Atoka, Atoka County, and \nthe area represented by the Southern Oklahoma Development Trust. The \nMcGee Creek Authority currently operates the dam and associated \nfacilities.\n  This title transfer under this bill will allow Oklahoma City to make \nthe necessary capital improvements and upgrades needed to assure the \ncontinued efficient operation of the Reservoir.\n  This bill is responsible legislation that will end requests for \nfederal funds and will protect the federal government from legal \nliabilities that could be incurred in their operation.\n  This legislation is the result of cooperation and coordination \nbetween Oklahoma City, the McGee Creek Authority, and the Bureau of \nReclamation. I thank the Bureau of Reclamation for their drafting \nservice in preparing the legislation, as well as of course the Senate \nLegislative Counsel. This legislation was requested by Mayor Mick \nCornett of Oklahoma City, and I am happy to assist in this worthy \ncause.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the letter of request \nfrom Mayor Cornett.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                                February 13, 2006.\n     Hon. James Inhofe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Inhofe: The purpose of this letter is to \n     request your assistance in obtaining a federal legislative \n     authorization for the title transfer of the McGee Creek \n     Reservoir dam and associated facilities from the Bureau of \n     Reclamation to the McGee Creek Authority. The McGee Creek \n     Authority is a trust of the State of Oklahoma and also \n     currently operates the dam and associated facilities.\n       This title and transfer is supported by the Bureau of \n     Reclamation and will allow Oklahoma City to make capital \n     improvements and upgrades needed to assure the continued \n     efficient operation of the Reservoir.\n       Attached is a copy of the background of the Authority's \n     responsibility and the description of the property to be \n     transferred.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Mick Cornett,\n                                                            Mayor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Obama, and Mr. \n        Bingaman):\n  S. 4024. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to improve the \nhealth and healthcare of racial and ethnic minority and other health \ndisparity populations; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a bill that has \nbeen very close to my heart for some time. And that is a bill that will \nhelp us better understand, and one day eliminate, the health \ndisparities that plague this country.\n  Many Americans don't realize that a problem exists. But traveling \nthrough rural Tennessee and spending 20 years in medicine, I know that \nit does.\n  The fact of the matter is African-Americans have higher overall rates \nof death and are more likely to report poor health than white or other \nminorities. The death rate for all kinds of cancers is a third higher \nfor African-Americans than it is for whites. And there are 8 times as \nmany blacks as whites in the United States with HIV-AIDS.\n  In Tennessee, African-Americans are 32 percent more likely to die \nfrom heart disease. The stroke rate for black Tennesseans is 43 percent \nhigher than for whites. The infant mortality rate among African-\nAmericans in Tennessee is almost 3 times as high as it is for whites. \nIn a State that ranks 3rd in the Nation for infant mortality--it's a \nhard statistic to swallow.\n  Which is why we must change it.\n  And that is the goal of the bill before us.\n  The intent of this bi-partisan bill is two-fold: to understand the \nroot causes of health disparities, and through better understanding \nthem, wipe them away.\n  To help foster that fuller comprehension of the challenge we face, \nthis legislation will direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto collect and report healthcare data by race and ethnicity, as well as \ngeographic location, socioeconomic status and health literacy to \nidentify and address health care disparities.\n  The legislation outlines mechanisms to research the problem, to \nconduct educational outreach to minorities, to increase diversity among \nhealthcare professionals, to enhance communication between patients and \ndoctors, and to improve the delivery of health care to minorities.\n  Through educational outreach we can work to change patient behavior.\n  The top 3 causes of death among African-Americans are heart disease, \ncancer, and stroke. Thirteen percent of the adult African-American \npopulation has diabetes. And the risks of each of these can be \nminimized through healthier diet and tobacco cessation.\n  The bill before us establishes grants for programs that will reach \nout to health disparity populations, and teach healthier habits. \nEmphasizing the importance of preventative care is a fundamental step \nin the road to reducing disparities.\n  Fostering better communication between healthcare providers and \nhealth disparity populations can be achieved in part by encouraging \nmore minorities to enter the healthcare profession. To that end, the \nbill before us reauthorizes several programs to support educational \nopportunities for minorities in healthcare.\n  We have a long history in this country of working to eliminate the \ninequities driven by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. I \nbelieve that the bill before us today will go a long way in helping us \nrealize a day when we are truly a Nation of equals.\n\n[[Page S10697]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4024\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, unfortunately, serious and unjustified \nhealth disparities continue to exist in our Nation today. Over 45 \nmillion Americans have no health insurance and often don't get the \nhealth care they need, or else they receive it too late. We know that \npersons who are uninsured are more likely to delay doctor visits and \nneeded screenings like mammograms and other early detection tests, \nwhich can help prevent serious illness and death. The Institute of \nMedicine estimates that at least 18,000 Americans die prematurely each \nyear solely because they lack health coverage.\n  Some of the most shameful health disparities involve racial and \nethnic minorities, and typically they are more likely to be uninsured. \nAfrican Americans have a lower life expectancy than whites, and are \nmuch more likely to die from stroke, and their uninsurance rates are \nmuch higher than for their white counterparts.\n  Many Americans--even physicians--want to believe such disparities \ndon't exist, but ignoring them only contributes more to the widening \ngap between the haves and have-nots. It's a scandal that people of \ncolor have greater difficulty obtaining good health care than other \nAmericans. Your health should not depend on the color of your skin, the \nsize of your bank account, or where you live. In a Nation as advanced \nas ours and with its state-of-the-art medical technology for preventing \nillness and caring for the sick, it's appalling that so many health \ndisparities continue to exist.\n  That's the reason why I am introducing the Minority Health and Health \nDisparity Elimination Act as part of our effort to eliminate these \nunacceptable disparities.\n  The bill provides grants to communities to increase public awareness \nabout access to health care and disease prevention. It writes the \nCenters for Disease Control's Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community \nHealth program into law, so that this successful program can involve \nall communities in closing the health care gap.\n  Greater diversity in the health care workforce is also a key part of \nending these disparities. African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and \nother minorities account for only 6 percent of the nation's doctors and \n7 percent of nurses and dentists, even though they are almost one-third \nof the U.S. population. The disparity in the health workforce must be \nclosed, not just to fulfill our commitment to equality of opportunity, \nbut because of the impact it has on health care. Studies demonstrate \nthat minority health professionals are more likely to care for minority \npatients, including those who are low-income and uninsured.\n  The Minority Health and Health Disparity Elimination Act reauthorizes \nthe Title VII healthcare workforce diversity programs, and supports the \nCenters of Excellence at Historically Black Colleges and Universities \nand institutions that educate Hispanic and Native American students.\n  A diverse health care workforce is essential for a healthy country. \nEmphasizing workforce diversity does not mean that health care workers \nof all races should not be prepared to work with diverse patients. We \nmust also make a more serious effort to train culturally competent \nhealth care professionals and work towards creating a health care \nsystem that is accessible for the more than 46 million Americans who \nspeak a language other than English at home. The bill creates an \nInternet clearinghouse to help increase cultural competency and improve \ncommunication between health care providers and patients. It also \nsupports the development of curricula on cultural competence in health \nprofessions schools.\n  Language barriers in health care obviously contribute to reduced \naccess and poorer care for those who have limited English proficiency \nor low health literacy. The legislation recognizes the importance of \nthis issue for the quality of our health care system and provides funds \nfor activities to improve and encourage services for such patients.\n  The Minority Health and Health Disparities Research and Education Act \nenacted into law in 2000 created the National Center for Minority \nHealth and Health Disparities. The legislation I am introducing today \nreauthorizes this important Center and strengthens its role in \ncoordinating and planning research that focuses on minority health and \nhealth disparities. It further strengthens research in health care \nquality by establishing a grant program for healthcare delivery sites \nand public-private partnerships to evaluate and identify best practices \nin disease management strategies and interventions.\n  In addition, the bill promotes the participation of racial and ethnic \nminorities and other health disparity populations in clinical trials \nand intensifies efforts throughout the Department of Health and Human \nServices to increase and apply knowledge about the interaction of \nracial, genetic, and environmental factors that affect people's health.\n  Finally, the bill reinforces and clarifies the duties of the Office \nof Minority Health and Health Disparity Elimination and encourages \ngreater cooperation among federal agencies and departments in meeting \nthese serious challenges.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this needed \nlegislation when we return to session after the election recess.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, for forty years the civil rights activist \nFannie Lou Hamer rallied the Nation with her statement ``I am sick and \ntired, of being sick and tired.'' She would be disheartened to know the \nextent to which her words are still resonating with millions of \nAmericans today. Whether we are talking about African Americans, \nLatinos, Asians or American Indians, the fact is that minorities \ncontinue to suffer a greater burden of disease and die prematurely. \nAfrican Americans are one-third more likely than all other Americans to \ndie from cancer, and have the highest rate of new HIV infection. One in \n3 Latinos has no insurance coverage. Fifty percent of Americans \nsuffering from chronic hepatitis B are Asian. And among many American \nIndian tribes, the rate of diabetes has hit epidemic proportions, with \nrates near 50 percent in certain tribes. The state of minority health \nin this Nation is deplorable, and by many measures, is getting worse.\n  Researchers have contributed a substantial body of work that has \nincreased our understanding of the factors contributing to poor health. \nHigher rates of uninsurance are one such factor. Racial and ethnic \nminorities, particularly African Americans and Latinos, are \nsignificantly more likely to be uninsured. This lack of access to care \nleads to delayed or foregone care, and according to the Institute of \nMedicine, is the 6th leading cause of death in this Nation for adults \naged 25-64. But equally disturbing, an overwhelming number of studies \nhave shown that regardless of insurance status, minorities are more \nlikely to receive low quality health care, and as a consequence, suffer \nworse health outcomes.\n\n[[Page S10711]]\n\n  The Institute of Medicine's 2002 historic report, Unequal Treatment: \nConfronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Healthcare, documented \npersistent and pervasive disparities in health care for minority \ngroups, even after adjusting for differences in insurance status and \nsocioeconomic factors. The American Journal of Public Health has \nreported that more than 886,000 deaths could have been prevented from \n1991 to 2000 if African Americans had received the same level of health \ncare as whites. In contrast, the same study estimates that \ntechnological improvements in medicine--including better drugs, devices \nand procedures--prevented only 176,633 deaths during the same period.\n  African Americans are not the only minorities getting worse care. \nData has shown, for example, that compared to white Americans, Mexican \nAmericans receive 38 percent fewer heart medications, and American \nIndians get recommended care for only 40 percent of quality measures. \nThe bottom line is that although the level of health care quality is \nmediocre at best for all Americans, it is much worse for minority \ngroups. And this is unacceptable.\n  For these reasons, I am joining my colleagues Senator Frist and \nSenator Kennedy in introducing the Minority Health Improvement and \nHealth Disparity Elimination Act. This critical legislation has a \nnumber of important provisions to help address the dismal health status \nof minority and other underserved populations. First, this bill \nstrengthens education and training in cultural competence and \ncommunication, which is the cornerstone of quality health care for all \npatients. It also reauthorizes the pipeline programs in Title VII of \nthe Public Health Service Act, which seek to increase diversity in the \nhealth professions. We all know that the door to opportunity is only \nhalf open for minority students in the health professions. The \npercentage of minority health professionals is shockingly low--African \nAmericans, Hispanics and American Indians account for one-third of the \nNation's population but less than 10 percent of the Nation's doctors, \nless than 5 percent of dentists and only 12 percent of nurses. We can \ndo better, and we must.\n  Lack of workforce diversity has serious implications for both access \nand quality of health care. Minority physicians are significantly more \nlikely to treat low-income patients, and their patients are \ndisproportionately minority. Studies have also shown that minority \nphysicians provide higher quality of care to minority patients, who are \nmore satisfied with their care and more likely to follow their doctor's \nrecommendations.\n  Second, this bill expands and supports a number of initiatives to \nincrease access to quality care. Specifically, the legislation \nauthorizes demonstration projects to help address health disparities in \nthe U.S.-Mexico border region, increase health coverage and continuity \nof coverage, identify and implement effective disease management \nstrategies, train community health workers, and increase enrollment of \nminorities in clinical trials. The REACH program at the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, and the Health Disparity Collaboratives \nat the Bureau of Primary Health Care are authorized in statute. And I \nam pleased that the Community Health Initiative has also been \nauthorized. This new environmental public health program is modeled \nafter the Health Action Zones in the Healthy Communities Act, S. 2047, \nthat I introduced a year ago, and guides and strengthens community \nefforts to improve health in comprehensive and sustained fashion.\n  A third area of focus is expansion and acceleration of data \ncollection and research across the agencies, including the Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes of Health, \nwith special emphasis on translational research. The tremendous \nadvances in medical science and health technology, which have benefited \nmillions of Americans, have remained out of reach for too many \nminorities, and translational research will help to remedy this \nproblem. The National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities, \nwhich has a leadership role in establishing the disparities research \nstrategic plan at the National Institutes of Health, is reauthorized, \nand a new advisory committee has been established at the Food and Drug \nAdministration, to focus on pharmacogenomics and its safe and \nappropriate application in minority populations.\n  Last but not least, I want to highlight that the bill reauthorizes \nthe Office of Minority Health and Health Disparity Elimination. This \nOffice has been critical in providing the leadership, expertise and \nguidance for health improvement activities within the agencies of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, and has helped to ensure \ncoordination, collaboration and integration of such efforts as well.\n  In conclusion, I want to note that this is the first bipartisan \neffort on minority health and health disparities since 2000, when the \nCongress passed the last minority health bill. That bill accelerated \nthe research that documented the full scope and magnitude of \ndisparities in health and health care in this Nation, and more \nimportantly, helped us understand why these disparities occur. But it \nis time for the next step. We've got to translate the knowledge we have \ngained into practical and effective interventions that will improve \nminority health and eliminate disparities, and this bill will help us \ndo just that.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring and passing this \ncritical legislation. Regardless of how you measure it--whether by \nneedless suffering, lost productivity, financial costs, or lives lost--\ndisparities in health and health care are a tremendous problem and \nmoral imperative for our Nation, and one that is within our power to \naddress right now. On behalf of the millions of Americans who continue \nto be sick and tired of being sick and tired, I ask you to join me in \nvoting yes to pass this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Leahy, and Ms. \n        Landrieu):\n  S. 4025. A bill to strengthen antitrust enforcement in the insurance \nindustry; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to introduce the \nInsurance Industry Antitrust Enforcement Act of 2006. This legislation \nwould subject the insurance industry to the antitrust laws, which apply \nto almost every other industry in America.\n  Congress enacted the McCarran-Ferguson Act in 1945. It did so in \nresponse to a controversial Supreme Court case in which the Court held \nthat the business of insurance constituted interstate commerce. The \nruling opened the door to federal regulation of insurance, a business \nthat had historically been regulated by the States. Reacting to concern \nfrom the states that they would no longer have authority to collect \ntaxes on insurance premiums, Congress passed McCarran-Ferguson, which \nreaffirmed the power of the States to regulate insurance and collect \ntaxes.\n  In doing so, Congress exempted insurance industry practices from the \nantitrust laws to the extent that such practices are ``regulated by \nstate law.'' Since then, the courts have liberally interpreted the \nphrase ``regulated by state law.'' They have held that insurance \nindustry practices are exempt from the antitrust laws so long as \nregulators have been given jurisdiction over the challenged practices--\nregardless of whether the regulators ever exercise that jurisdiction.\n  Over the years, State regulators have either chosen not to regulate, \nor failed to regulate, practices that would have violated the antitrust \nlaws absent McCarran-Ferguson. With McCarran-Ferguson, such practices \nescape both regulatory and federal antitrust oversight. The most \nnotorious practices to come to light involved bid-rigging and customer \nallocation by insurance broker, Marsh & McClennan, and several of the \nnation's largest insurers, including AIG and Zurich American Insurance \nCompany. Under the scheme, Marsh steered unsuspecting clients to \ninsurers with which it had lucrative payoff agreements. To make the \nscheme work, Marsh solicited fictitious bids from other complicit \ninsurers to make the bid submitted by the selected insurer--the one \nthat offered Marsh the highest payoff--seem competitive.\n  Even though the scheme eliminated competition among the insurance \ncompanies that were involved, those companies could not be prosecuted \nunder Federal antitrust law. Several States prosecuted the insurance \ncompanies\n\n[[Page S10712]]\n\nunder a variety of State laws, including antitrust laws, but federal \nprosecutors could not bring their significant resources to bear. There \nsimply is no justification for that. Federal law enforcement should \nhave the power to prosecute such blatant violations of the antitrust \nlaws.\n  This is not the first attempt to subject the insurance industry to \nFederal antitrust law. In the wake of numerous insolvencies, \nmismanagement and other misconduct by insurers in the late 1980s, \nlegislation was introduced repealing the exemption. That legislation, \nintroduced by Congressman Brooks, faced opposition from insurers who \nclaimed that many industry practices engaged in jointly by insurance \ncompanies were pro-competitive and necessary for smaller insurers. The \nlegislation provided a safe harbor, specifically listing the practices \nof insurance companies that would be exempt from the antitrust laws. \nHowever, it proved impossible to craft a list of safe harbors for all \nthe information that competing insurers claimed they needed to share \nwith one another. This bill has avoided that problem.\n  More recently, some have argued that the answer to insurance industry \nills is full federal regulation. I do not necessarily believe that \nstripping the States of their authority to regulate the insurance \nindustry is the answer. This bill does not do that. It allows states to \ncontinue to regulate their insurance industries. However, the existence \nof state regulation is no reason to prevent the Federal Government from \nprosecuting violators of antitrust laws. And, there is no reason to \nprevent Federal prosecutors from going after those violators just \nbecause they happen to work for insurance companies.\n  As I've said, allowing Federal prosecutors to go after those who \nviolate the antitrust laws will not prevent states from regulating the \ninsurance industry. If a state is actively supervising practices by its \ninsurance industry that might otherwise violate the antitrust laws, \nthis legislation would exempt that practice from the antitrust laws. \nAntitrust law does not generally apply where a state is actively \nregulating an industry. This is as it should be and the legislation I \nintroduce today, the Insurance Industry Antitrust Act of 2006, \nincorporates that standard.\n  The Judiciary Committee held a hearing on this issue in May.\n  During the hearing, Marc Racicot, the President of the American \nInsurance Association, a trade association composed of the nation's \nlargest insurers, acknowledged that ``every State provides some form of \nantitrust regulation of insurers.'' In other words, many States already \nenforce their State antitrust laws with respect to insurers. So, I have \nto ask, why have we tied the hands of federal antitrust enforcers?\n  The insurers will argue that repealing the antitrust exemption for \ninsurers will create uncertainty by throwing into question the legality \nof every joint practice engaged in by insurers. They will argue that \nthe legality of each joint practice will have to be litigated in court. \nHowever, this bill has been drafted to avoid such litigation. Rather \nthan incorporating a laundry list of safe harbors, an approach that was \ntaken in the past, the bill would allow the Federal Trade Commission to \nissue guidelines identifying joint practices that do not raise \nantitrust concerns and would therefore not face scrutiny from antitrust \nenforcers.\n  This is a job for which the Commission is well equipped. In the past, \nthe Commission along with the Justice Department issued ``Statements of \nAntitrust Enforcement Policy in Health Care.'' The Health Care \nStatements identified joint conduct by health care providers that did \nnot raise antitrust concerns and therefore would likely escape scrutiny \nby antitrust enforcers. The Health Care Statements were designed to \ngive health care providers certainty about the legality of their joint \nconduct under the antitrust laws. Similar guidelines for the insurance \nindustry would provide insurers with certainty, but at the same time, \nwould ensure that joint practices that are anticompetitive receive \nscrutiny from the antitrust enforcement agencies.\n  Although insurers oppose repeal of their antitrust exemption, others \nsupport a repeal. In particular, the Antitrust Section of the American \nBar Association has long supported repeal. During the Judiciary \nCommittee's hearing, the current head of the Antitrust Section, Donald \nKlawiter noted the Section's nearly 20-year history of supporting \nrepeal. Klawiter testified that ``the benefits of antitrust exemptions \nalmost never outweigh the potential harm imposed on society by the loss \nof competition.'' At the same hearing, Robert Hunter, testifying on \nbehalf of the Consumer Federation of America, concluded that \n``application of the antitrust laws to the insurance industry could \nresult in double-digit savings for America's insurance consumers.''\n  It is my hope that this legislation will bring the benefits of \ncompetition to the insurance industry and to consumers. Too many \nconsumers are paying too much for insurance due to the collusive \natmosphere that exists in the insurance industry. This has become a \nparticular problem along the Gulf Coast, where insurers have shared \nhurricane loss projections, which may result in double-digit premium \nincreases for Gulf Coast homeowners.\n  I strongly urge members who are concerned about industry exemption \nfrom the antitrust laws and collusive insurance industry practices to \nsupport this important piece of legislation. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4025\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Specter, along \nwith Senators Landrieu and Lott, in introducing the ``Insurance \nIndustry Antitrust Enforcement Act of 2006.''\n  In 1945, Congress passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act, giving the \ninsurance industry almost complete immunity from Federal antitrust \nlaws. The Act acknowledges the significant role States have in the \nregulation of the business of insurance, and implements this policy by \npreempting Federal antitrust laws which would intrude upon State \nauthority in the area.\n  Industry specific statutory exemptions from antitrust laws are rare, \nand when they are enacted, it is important that we periodically revisit \nthem to ensure that the benefits of the exemption are not outweighed by \nthe potential harms that could be imposed on consumers from the loss of \ncompetition. The McCarran-Ferguson Act is no exception and, for good \nreason, has recently been revisited by the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  At a recent hearing before the Committee, it became abundantly clear \nthat the McCarran-Ferguson Act is no\n\n[[Page S10713]]\n\nlonger a justified or practical law; it is overly complex and stifles \ncompetition. Recognizing that the insurance industry has unique \ncharacteristics, including the dependence on collective claim and loss \ndata, Senator Specter and I drafted a bill to accommodate those \nlegitimate needs while still providing Federal regulators with the \ntools to investigate and prevent collusion and other anticompetitive \nbehaviors. More specifically, our bill authorizes Federal enforcement \nagencies to police violations of antitrust laws, without weakening the \nStates' comprehensive regulatory power.\n  American consumers, from sophisticated multi-national businesses to \nVermonters shopping for personal insurance, have the right to be \nconfident that the cost of their insurance reflects competitive market \nconditions and not collusive behavior. Yet, when consumers are \ncontinually faced with higher prices, fewer options, and declining \nquality of service from their insurance providers, there are no such \nassurances.\n  There is little disagreement that consumers are increasingly \nfrustrated with the cost and quality of their insurance policies. This \nbill is an important step towards restoring integrity in our insurance \nmarkets. I hope it will act as a catalyst for action to ensure market \nforces are at work in the insurance industry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 4026. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \ntechnical corrections, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today Senator Baucus and I are pleased \nto introduce the Tax Technical Corrections Act of 2006.\n  Technical Corrections measures are routine for major tax acts, and \nare necessary to ensure that the provisions of the acts are working \nconsistently with Congressional intent, or to provide clerical \ncorrections. Because these measures carry out Congressional intent, no \nrevenue gain or loss is scored from them.\n  Technical corrections are derived from a deliberative and \nconsultative process among the Congressional and Administration tax \nstaffs. That means the Republican and Democratic staffs of the House \nWays and Means and Senate Finance Committees are involved, as is the \nstaff of the Treasury Department. All of this work is performed with \nthe participation and guidance of the non-partisan staff of the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation. A technical enters the list only if all staffs \nagree it is appropriate.\n  By filing this bill, we hope interested parties and practitioners \nwill comment and provide direction on further edits, additions, or \ndeletions. These comments should be submitted in a timely manner, by \nthe end of October. It is our hope that we may move this package of \ntechnicals in November if possible.\n  We ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill print in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4026\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. HATCH.\n  S. 4027. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nan above-the-line deduction for certain professional development and \nother expenses of elementary and secondary school teachers and for \ncertain certification expenses of individuals becoming science, \ntechnology engineering, or math teachers; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to make the tax laws more fair for America's primary and \nsecondary school teachers.\n  Our public school teachers are some of the unheralded heroes of our \nsociety.\n  These women and men dedicate their careers to educating the young \npeople of America.\n  School teachers labor in often difficult and even dangerous \ncircumstances. In most places, including in my home State of Utah, the \nsalary of the average public school teacher is significantly below the \nnational average.\n  A historic turnover is taking place in the teaching profession. While \nstudent enrollments are rising rapidly, more than a million veteran \nteachers are nearing retirement.\n  Experts predict that overall we will need more than two million new \nteachers in the next decade.\n  This teacher recruitment problem has reached crisis proportions in \nsome urban and rural areas. The shortage is most acute in high-need \nsubject areas such as math, science, and technology.\n  Retaining qualified teachers in the schools is only part of the \npuzzle. Attracting new teachers in math, science, and technology is \nanother. It is clear that our teacher recruitment problem represents \none the biggest challenges America faces as we contemplate how we are \ngoing to prepare the next generation to take their places in our \nsociety and in our economy.\n  Unfortunately, these problems of retention and recruitment of public \nschool teachers are exacerbated by the unfair tax treatment these \nprofessionals currently receive under our tax law. Specifically, \nteachers find themselves greatly disadvantaged by the lack of \ndeductibility of professional development expenses and of the out-of-\npocket costs of classroom materials that practically all teachers find \nthemselves supplying. Let me explain.\n  As many other professionals, most elementary and secondary school \nteachers regularly incur expenses to keep themselves current in their \nfield of knowledge. These include subscriptions to journals and other \nperiodicals as well as the cost of courses and seminars designed to \nimprove their knowledge or teaching skills. These expenditures are \nnecessary to keep our teachers up to date on the latest ideas, \ntechniques, and trends so that they can provide our children with the \nbest education possible.\n  Furthermore, almost all teachers find themselves providing basic \nclassroom materials for their students. Because of tight education \nbudgets, most schools do not provide 100 percent of the material \nteachers need to adequately present their lessons. As a result, \ndedicated teachers incur personal expenses for copies, art supplies, \nbooks, puzzles and games, paper, pencils, and countless other needs. If \nnot for the willingness of teachers to purchase these supplies \nthemselves, many students would simply go without needed materials.\n  I realize that employees in many fields of endeavor incur expenses \nfor professional development and out-of-pocket expenses. In many cases, \nhowever, these costs are fully reimbursed by the employer. This is \nseldom the case with school teachers. Other professionals who are self-\nemployed are able to fully deduct these types of expenses.\n  Under the current tax law, unreimbursed employee expenses are \ndeductible generally, but only as miscellaneous itemized deductions. \nHowever,\n\n[[Page S10717]]\n\nthere are two practical hurdles that effectively make these expenses \nnon-deductible for most teachers.\n  The first hurdle is that the total amount of a taxpayer's deductible \nmiscellaneous deductions must exceed two percent of adjusted gross \nincome before they begin to be deductible.\n  The second hurdle is that the amount in excess of the two percent \nfloor, if any, combined with all other deductions of the taxpayer, must \nexceed the standard deduction before the teacher can itemize. Only \nabout a third of taxpayers have enough deductions to itemize.\n  The unfortunate effect of these two limitations is that, as a \npractical matter, only a small proportion of teachers are able to \ndeduct their professional development and out-of-pocket supplies \nexpenses.\n  Let me illustrate this unfair situation with an example.\n  Let us consider the case of a fifth-year high school English teacher \nin Utah whom I will call Alice White Head. Alice is single and earns \n$48,000 per year. Last year she incurred $1,050 for a course she took \nover the summer to increase her knowledge of English literature. She \nalso spent $450 for classroom supplies out of her own pocket. She was \nnot reimbursed for either of these expenses, which totaled $1,500, by \nher school district. Under current law, Alice's expenditures are \ndeductible, subject to the limitations I mentioned. The first \nlimitation is that her expenses must exceed two percent of her income \nbefore they begin to be deductible. Two percent of $48,000 is $960. \nThus, only $540 of her $1,500 total expenses is deductible, that \nportion that exceeds $960.\n  As a single taxpayer, Alice's standard deduction for 2006 is $5,150. \nHer total itemized deductions, including the $540 in miscellaneous \ndeductions for her professional expenses and out-of-pocket classroom \nsupplies, fall short of the standard deduction threshold. Therefore, \nnot even the $540 of the original $1,500 in professional development \nexpenses and out-of-pocket costs are deductible for Alice. What the \nfirst limitation did not block, the second one did, and Alice gets no \ndeduction at all under the current law.\n  The way I see it, this situation is just not fair. Also, the tax \ntreatment of teacher's expenses certainly does not help solve our \nteacher retention and recruitment problems.\n  To help alleviate this long-standing problem, five years ago I \nintroduced the Teacher Equity for School Teachers Act of 2001. This \nlegislation would have provided an unlimited tax deduction for the out-\nof-pocket expenses of school teachers for classroom supplies and other \nneeded materials to help a teacher do his or her job. The bill would \nhave also allowed teachers to take a deduction for their professional \ndevelopment expenses.\n  Rather than being available only for those who are able to itemize \ntheir deductions, this bill would have made these expenses ``above-the-\nline'' deductions, meaning they would be deductible whether or not the \nteacher itemized on their tax return.\n  Unfortunately, only a part of this bill was enacted. The 2001 tax \nbill included an above-the-line deduction for $250 for the costs of \nclassroom expenses. While this was a great step in the right direction, \nit did not go nearly far enough. Moreover, the provision has now \nexpired, and it is not clear when Congress is going to extend it.\n  The bill I am introducing today would do three things. First, it \nwould reinstate the above-the-line deduction for teachers' out-of-\npocket expenses for classroom supplies, make it permanent, and remove \nthe $250 cap. Second, it would provide an unlimited deduction for the \nprofessional development expenses for school teachers. Finally, to \nassist in the recruitment of teachers in the most needed fields, it \nwould provide an unlimited deduction for the cost of professionals in \nthe fields of math, science, and technology to certify to become public \nschool teachers.\n  Under my bill, the Alice of my example would be allowed to deduct all \n$1,500 of her professional development and classroom supplies expenses, \nwhether she itemized or not. This would help provide tax equity, and a \nmeasure of much-needed tax relief for an underpaid professional. It \nwould also help retain current public school teachers and attract new \nones to this vital field.\n  Some might argue that such a generous deduction would be giving \nteachers preferential treatment. I disagree.\n  Most organizations provide training for their employees that is fully \ndeductible to the organization and non-taxable to the employee. Yet \npublic teachers, who are some of the most important professionals in \nour society, are left to foot the bill for these needed costs on their \nown. Also, office supplies and instructional materials are fully \ndeductible to businesses. Should not teachers who provide these similar \nmaterials for their classrooms be afforded the same tax treatment?\n  Others may question the wisdom of my bill granting an unlimited tax \ndeduction. ``Why not place a limit or a cap on the amount that may be \ndeducted?'' some might ask. Again, I respectfully disagree with such \ncritics. It is important to keep in mind the differences between a tax \ndeduction and a tax credit. My bill calls for tax deductions, which \nreduce the amount of income that is subject to tax, and not for a \ncredit, which is a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the amount of tax \nthat is due.\n  With a tax deduction, a public school teacher is not receiving a cash \nsubsidy or reimbursement for his or her expenses. Rather, he or she is \nmerely obtaining a reduction in the amount of income that is taxed. \nThus, the most benefit the teacher would receive under my bill would be \na 35 percent reduction in the cost of the professional development, \nsupplies, or certification expenses. This means that the teacher is \nstill responsible for paying for the biggest portion of these costs. I \ndo not believe that our public school teachers will abuse such an \nunlimited deduction. They will use their common sense and they will \nspend the appropriate amounts for their expenses.\n  Support for mathematics and science education at all levels is \nnecessary to improve the global competitiveness of the United States in \nscience and energy technology.\n  I endorse the efforts of my some of my colleagues to encourage more \nof our best and brightest students choose these fields of study. \nSupport for qualified STEM teachers (Science, Technology, Engineering, \nand Mathematics) is equally important. If we are successful in \nincreasing the supply for STEM students, we will need to increase the \nsupply of STEM teachers.\n  This bill will provide incentives for these professionals to enter \nthe teaching profession by allowing expenses in connection with teacher \ncertification to be fully deductible, above-the-line, the same as the \nprofessional development and supplies expenses of teaching \nprofessionals.\n  Mr. President, this bill would provide modest tax equity for teachers \nwho, for too long, have been footing the bill for improving the quality \nof teaching by themselves. It is time that Congress recognized this \nunfairness and corrected it.\n  I thank the Senate for the opportunity to address this issue today, \nand I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4027\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MENENDEZ:\n  S. 4028. A bill to fight criminal gangs; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today, all across America, organized \ncriminal gangs plague our communities, destroying the lives of \nthousands of young children each and every year. Unfortunately, this \nplague is currently not being treated effectively, and as a result has \ngrown in size and power in almost every State in the Nation. Indeed, \ngang violence is no longer a State and local issue that predominantly \noccurs in highly urbanized areas, but has escalated into a national \nissue that affects our country as a whole.\n  In light of this, it is clear that we must recalibrate our efforts--\nand in addition to our local initiatives--to comprehensively confront \ngang violence at the national level. That is why I rise today to \nintroduce the Fighting Gangs and Empowering Youth Act of 2006. \nAddressing the efforts of Federal, State, and local agencies, this \nlegislation would comprehensively deal with all aspects of gang \nviolence, from rigorously enforcing and appropriately sentencing \ncriminal acts, to preventing future gang members from being recruited \nand such crimes from occurring.\n  To reduce the number of young potential recruits gangs prey upon, \nthis bill would authorize funds for after-school and community-based \nprograms designed to economically empower young people. Disadvantaged \nstudents will be given the opportunity to realize their potential, \nthrough tutoring, mentoring, and job training programs as well as \ncollege preparation classes and tuition assistance. Additionally, \nmillions of dollars would be authorized to enhance and expand anti-gang \nand anti-violence programs in elementary and secondary schools, \nensuring that students can focus solely on learning, without having to \nbe concerned for their personal safety. By providing ``at-risk'' youth \nwith such resources and opportunities necessary to succeed in life, \nthey will be far less susceptible to join a criminal gang.\n  The legislation would also expand adult and juvenile offender reentry \ndemonstration projects to help with post-release and transitional \nhousing, while promoting programs that hire former prisoners, and \nestablish reentry planning procedures within communities. Prisoners \nwith drug addictions would be forced to participate in treatment \nprograms to be eligible for early release, which would be continued in \ntheir transition period back into society. All offenders would be \nencouraged to participate in educational initiatives such as, job \ntraining, GED preparation, along with a myriad of other programs. These \ninitiatives are designed to provide offenders with the skills necessary \nto become legally employed when they are released from prison, which \nwill reduce, hopefully significantly, their recidivism rates.\n  In addition to programs focused on gang violence prevention, my \nproposal would provide law enforcement officials on every level of \ngovernment with the resources and information they need to accurately \ntrack and effectively neutralize criminal gangs. Specifically, this \nlegislation would establish a program similar to the current Community \nOriented Policing Services (COPS) program, to augment the number of \npolice officers patrolling the streets of our local communities, and \nwould authorize $700 million annually for it. Additional funds would be \nused not only to increase the number of officers combating gangs, but \nalso to provide additional forensic examiners to investigate, and more \nattorneys to prosecute, gang crimes.\n  As is true with almost all problems, a better understanding of how \ngangs operate translates into a better understanding of how best to \ncounter them. That is why this legislation would authorize increased \nfunding for the National Youth Gang Survey to increase the number of \nlaw enforcement agencies whose data is collected and included in the \nannual survey and provide up to $8 million per year to upgrade \ntechnology to better identify gang members and include them in the \nNational Gang Database. Additionally, this legislation would expand the \nUniform Crime Reports (UCRs) to include local gang and other crime \nstatistics from the municipal level, while also requiring the Attorney \nGeneral to distinguish those crimes committed by juveniles. The bill \nalso requires consolidation and standardization of all criminal \ndatabases, enabling law enforcement all across this country to better \nshare information.\n  For those who still choose a life a crime, this proposal would \nincrease the penalties proscribed for crimes committed in the \nfurtherance of a gang. Gangs are dependent on committing\n\n[[Page S10719]]\n\ncrimes such as witness intimidation, illegal firearm possession, and \ndrug trafficking, implementing these instruments to augment their \npower. Subsequently, when these crimes are committed in the furtherance \nof gang activity, they can be more detrimental to society than if they \nwere committed in isolation. Thus, these tougher sentencing \nrequirements for crimes committed in the furtherance of a gang are not \nonly appropriate, but necessary to deter gang violence and shield \nsociety from its most dangerous and unremorseful criminals.\n  This legislation would also attack one of the roots of gang \nviolence--gang recruiters, who seek out young, economically \ndisadvantaged, at-risk youth and pressure them to join. Currently, \nthere is no law specifically forbidding gang recruitment. This \nlegislation would change that--making it illegal to do so--and would \nincarcerate an offender for up to 5 years if the person being recruited \nwas over the age of 18, or up to 10 years if the individual was under \nthe age of 18.\n  Taken together, the provisions of this bill develop a comprehensive \napproach to gang violence by focusing on prevention, deterrence, and \nenforcement. To not address all of these gang violence catalysts in \ntheir entirety would leave us with an incomprehensive approach that \nwould do little to quell the scourge of gang violence. Therefore, I \nurge my colleagues to cosponsor the Fighting Gangs and Empowering Youth \nAct, and by doing so, give law enforcement and our communities the \nmeans to thoroughly and comprehensively counter the growing specter of \ngang violence that afflicts our great Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4028\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to increase the number of well-educated nurses, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Nursing \nEducation and Quality of Health Care Act of 2006. This legislation is \nessential for addressing our current and future nursing shortages.\n  I have been hearing from nurses and health care providers from every \npart of New York that we are facing an impending nursing crisis and \ntheir stories echo what is heard from nurses across the Nation.\n  By 2014, the Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts that there will be \nover 1 million job openings for registered nurses. In New York alone, \nwe will need to produce over 80,000 new RNs to meet these projections. \nOne of our greatest needs will be in rural areas where the pool of \nnurses is small and the loss of just one nurse from the workforce can \nhave a profound impact on the health of the community.\n  I can proudly say we have made good progress in New York on one \nfront. In 2006, 30 percent more registered nurses graduated than in \n2004. I believe that we can credit this increase to the Nurse \nReinvestment Act that was signed into law in 2002. Through this \nbipartisan legislation, we were able to make great strides in \nstrengthening our nation's nursing workforce.\n  The Nurse Reinvestment Act includes a number of critical initiatives \nincluding one from the bipartisan bill I introduced with Senator Gordon \nSmith to retain nurses who are already in the profession. The Clinton-\nSmith provision provides grants to health care organizations that \ndevelop and implement models based on magnet hospitals. Hospitals that \nhave achieved magnet status report lower mortality rates, higher \npatient satisfaction, greater cost-efficiency, and patients \nexperiencing shorter stays in hospitals and intensive care units.\n  But I am here today because nurses are still facing an urgent \nsituation that requires action. Even though we are making strides to \ngraduate more nurses, in 2005 over 37,000 qualified applicants were \nturned away from nursing schools in United States. In New York, it is \nestimated that nearly 3,000 nursing school applicants were denied \nentry. Put simply, we don't have the capacity in our nursing schools to \ntrain qualified potential students.\n  Not only are we facing a nursing shortage, we are setting ourselves \nup for a potential nursing crisis if we don't address the impending \nfaculty shortage. This situation will become dire if we lose potential \nnurses due to the retirement of nurse faculty as that the aging \npopulation increases.\n  We need to pave the way and recruit more people into the nursing \nprofession. This shortage crisis impacts not only the nurses, but also \npatients since we know that the quality of care increases when nurses \nare not working too many hours, are not treating too many patients, and \nare satisfied with their jobs.\n  Today I am here to support recruitment, education, and training to \nhelp alleviate this crisis in New York and in the rest of the nation \nthrough introduction of the Nursing Education and Quality of Health \nCare Act of 2006. This act will establish distance learning \nopportunities for people in rural communities who wish to pursue the \nnursing profession without leaving their home town. This legislation \nwill also provide tuition assistance and loan forgiveness for those who \nchoose to practice in rural communities.\n  To increase the number of nurses in the workforce we need to expand \nthe nursing faculty so that thousands of qualified people are not \nturned away from the profession. This legislation will fund programs \nthat will enhance recruitment, scholarships, and educational \npreparation and encourage more nurses to become faculty members by \nestablishing online courses and accelerated degree programs.\n  We need for nurses to participate and collaborate in patient-safety \ninitiatives for the well-being of patients. The Nursing Education and \nQuality of Health Care Act will take the lead on this issue by \nsupporting projects that integrate patient safety practices into \nnursing education programs and enhance the leadership of nurses in \nimproving patients' outcomes within their health care settings.\n  We will all rely on nurses sometime in our life, and we need to make \nsure that this essential member of the health care team will always be \npresent at our bedsides.\n  I am pleased to be here encouraging Nurses, who are so critical to \nthe successful operation of our hospitals and the quality of care \npatients receive. We should be doing everything we can to address the \nnursing shortage and to make nursing an attractive and rewarding \nprofession.\n  The Nursing Education and Quality of Health Care Act of 2006 is \nsupported by: American Association of Colleges of Nursing; American \nNursing Association; American Organization of Nurse Executives; \nBrooklyn Nursing Partnership; New York State Area Health Education \nCenter System\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 4030. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nsimplify certain provisions applicable to real estate investment \ntrusts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the REIT \nInvestment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2006 (RIDEA). This \nlegislation would make a handful of relatively minor, but nonetheless \nimportant, changes to the tax rules governing Real Estate Investment \nTrusts to permit REITs to better meet the challenges of evolving market \nconditions and opportunities.\n  As most of my colleagues know, Real Estate Investment Trusts are \ncompanies that own, and in most cases, operate income-producing real \nestate. Congress created REITs in 1960 to give everyone the ability to \ninvest in large-scale commercial properties in a very liquid way. The \nREIT industry has grown dramatically in size and importance to the U.S. \neconomy since then, and in the last ten years in particular.\n  While the tax laws governing REITs are very good, from time to time \nthey need to be modified to keep pace with the changes in the \nmarketplace and in our economy. I am pleased to have supported, along \nwith many of my colleagues, several tax bills that have been enacted in \nthe past decade or so to modernize the tax treatment of Real Estate \nInvestment Trusts.\n  Federal tax law requires that REITs meet specific tests regarding the \ncomposition of their gross income and assets. For example, 95 percent \nof their annual gross income must be from specified sources such as \ndividends, interests and rents, and 75 percent of their gross income \nmust be from real estate-related sources. Similarly, at the end of each \ncalendar quarter, 75 percent of a REIT's assets must consist of \nspecified ``real estate'' assets. Consequently, REITs must derive a \nmajority of their gross income from commercial real estate.\n  Failure to meet these tests can result in loss of REIT status, \nalthough with the enactment of the REIT Improvement Act in 2004, it may \nbe possible for a REIT to pay a monetary penalty and bring itself into \ncompliance in order to avoid such a result if the REIT can demonstrate \nreasonable cause for such failure.\n  Commercial real estate represents more than six percent of this \ncountry's gross domestic product and is a key generator of jobs and \nother economic activities. For example, REITs have invested over $1.2 \nbillion in my home State of Utah and have thus been a major contributor \nto our robust economy. Over the past 46 years, Real Estate Investment \nTrusts have fulfilled\n\n[[Page S10733]]\n\nCongress' vision by making investments in large scale, capital \nintensive commercial real estate available to all investors.\n  Changes to the REIT rules that Congress has made in the past decade \nhave allowed REITs to serve better their tenants while maximizing \nreturns to REIT shareholders.\n  The bill I introduce today would further modify the REIT tax rules to \nconform to constantly evolving business realities, such as the growing \nimportance of cross-border trade and the increased velocity of the \ncompetitive marketplace, while still focusing REITs on commercial real \nestate activities.\n  Specifically, the bill includes five titles.\n  The first would clarify the tax treatment of foreign currency gains \nattributable to overseas real estate investment. This is important as \nU.S. REITs continue to expand their investments overseas.\n  The second title would increase the permissible ownership of a REIT \nin a taxable REIT subsidiary to 25 percent from the current-law 20 \npercent. This change would bring the REIT rules into conformity with \nsimilar rules governing mutual funds.\n  Title III of the bill would update the safe harbor test for purposes \nof the 100 percent excise tax in relation to dealer sales. This would \nhelp REITs more prudently manage the timing and extent of their asset \ndispositions.\n  The bill's fourth title would conform the tax treatment of health \ncare facilities to that of lodging facilities by treating as qualifying \nincome rental payments attributable to a health care facility made to a \nREIT from a taxable REIT subsidiary. This change would allow health \ncare REITs more flexibility.\n  Finally, the bill's fifth title would amend the REIT rules to provide \nthat income from, and interests in, foreign-qualified REITs would be \ntreated as qualifying REIT income and assets under the U.S. REIT rules \nunder certain circumstances. This change is important because about 20 \ncountries have now enacted legislation that closely resembles our REIT \nrules, and many U.S. REITs may wish to invest in a non-U.S. REIT. This \nwould allow them to do so with a minimum of complexity.\n  I urge my colleagues to review this bill and lend their support to \nit. I realize that it is very late in the second session of the 109th \nCongress, and there is little time for us to consider newly-introduced \ntax bills. However, I hope to reintroduce this legislation in the next \nCongress if we do not get a chance to consider it this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section analysis of the \nREIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act and the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2006\n\n\n                     Section-by-Section Description\n\n       The REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of \n     2006 (RIDEA) includes the following provisions to help \n     modernize the tax rules governing Real Estate Investment \n     Trusts to permit REITs to better meet the challenges of \n     evolving market conditions and opportunities:\n     Title I: Foreign Currency and Other Qualified Activities\n       The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has long recognized that \n     U.S. REITs can, and do, invest outside the U.S., essentially \n     recognizing that any income generated from REIT-permissible \n     sources outside of the U.S. should not jeopardize the REIT's \n     tax status. However, the treatment of foreign currency gains \n     directly attributable to overseas real estate investment is \n     not wholly clear, and its correct characterization is \n     becoming increasingly important as U.S. REITs strengthen \n     their positions in foreign markets.\n       To ensure that foreign currency gains do not harm a REIT's \n     tax status, the IRS has provided a short-term solution by \n     allowing certain REITs to establish a subsidiary REIT in each \n     currency zone in which a REIT invests. However, the use of \n     subsidiary REITs, each of which must satisfy the complex \n     myriad of REIT rules or risk disqualification of the parent \n     REIT, is a cumbersome and unmanageable solution in the long \n     term. Accordingly, RIDEA would clarify existing law by \n     characterizing foreign currency gains generated by a REIT \n     outside the U.S. as ``good'' REIT income so long as the REIT \n     focuses on commercial real estate, as measured by specific \n     objective rules. Despite the IRS' authority to prescribe \n     similar rules, the absence of such guidance necessitates \n     legislative clarification to provide certainty to REIT \n     management and their shareholders within a more administrable \n     framework.\n       RIDEA also would delegate to the IRS the express authority \n     to issue guidance with respect to whether any other item of \n     income should satisfy the REIT gross income tests or should \n     not be taken into account in calculating these tests. While \n     the IRS often has been willing to grant such rulings to \n     specific taxpayers, these rulings cannot be relied on by \n     other taxpayers and in any event do not cover all \n     circumstances.\n       Thus, RIDEA would: (1) characterize foreign currency gains \n     attributable to a REIT's ownership and operation of overseas \n     real estate assets as qualifying income under REIT gross \n     income tests; (2) conform the current REIT hedging rule to \n     also apply to foreign currency gains and to apply those rules \n     for purposes of the REIT gross income tests under current \n     law; (3) specifically provide the Department of the \n     Treasury the authority to issue guidance on other items of \n     income to either qualify under the REIT gross income tests \n     or to provide that items of income are not taken into \n     account in computing those tests; (4) treat foreign \n     currency as a qualifying real estate asset; and (5) make \n     conforming changes to other REIT provisions reflecting \n     foreign currency gains.\n     Title II: Taxable REIT Subsidiaries\n       As originally introduced in 1999, the REIT Modernization \n     Act (RMA) limited a REIT's ownership in taxable REIT \n     subsidiaries (TRS) to 25 percent of a REIT's gross assets. \n     However, the limit was reduced to 20 percent when Congress \n     ultimately enacted the RMA as part of the Ticket to Work \n     Incentives Improvement Act of 1999.\n       RIDEA would increase the limit on TRS securities from 20 \n     percent to 25 percent of a REIT's gross assets. The rationale \n     for a 25 percent limit on TRSs that was contained in the RMA \n     remains the same today. The dividing line for testing a \n     concentration on commercial real estate in the REIT rules has \n     long been set at 25 percent, and even the mutual fund rule \n     uses a 25 percent test. An IRS study shows increasing amounts \n     of taxes paid by new TRSs, and common sense tells IUS that \n     permitting increased activities in a double tax regime should \n     increase revenues to the fisc compared to a single tax \n     regime.\n     Title III: Dealer Sales\n       The Internal Revenue Code imposes a 100 percent excise tax \n     on profits generated on sales of property in which a REIT is \n     acting as a dealer rather than an investor. Because of the \n     confiscatory nature of this 100 percent excise tax, the Code \n     provides a ``safe harbor'' under which a REIT can be assured \n     that the excise tax does not apply if it satisfies a number \n     of requirements. RIDEA would make two changes to the dealer \n     safe harbor.\n       One requirement under current law is that the REIT not \n     either make seven sales in a taxable year or sell more than \n     10 percent of its portfolio each year. However, the test as \n     currently constructed penalizes many REITs that have owned \n     their properties for a long period of time. This is because \n     the test is geared to the property's ``tax basis,'' an amount \n     that diminishes over time due to tax depreciation, rather \n     than ``fair market value'', an amount that generally \n     increases over time. Second, the current test requires that a \n     REIT hold a property for at least four years, three years \n     longer than the general holding period required to \n     distinguish between an ``investor'' and a ``dealer'' in \n     property.\n       RIDEA would update this safe harbor to test ``fair market'' \n     value instead of ``tax basis'' to allow REITs that have owned \n     their properties for longer periods not be penalized and \n     thereby prevented from prudently managing the timing and \n     extent of asset dispositions. As part of the REIT \n     Modernization Act of 1999, Congress adopted a provision that \n     utilizes fair market value rules for purposes of \n     calculating personal property rents associated with the \n     rental of real property. Thus, there is an analogous \n     precedent for a fair value approach.\n       The safe harbor also would be amended to replace the 4-year \n     holding period with a 2-year holding period. The 4-year \n     requirement is not consistent with other Code provisions that \n     define whether property is held for long term investments, \n     such as the 1-year holding period to determine long-term \n     capital gains treatment, and the 2-year holding period to \n     distinguish whether the sale of a home is taxable because it \n     is held for investment purposes.\n     Title IV: Health Care REITs\n       Generally, rental payments made from a subsidiary owned by \n     a REIT to that REIT are not considered qualified rental \n     income for REIT purposes under the ``related party rules''. \n     However, as part of the REIT Modernization Act of 1999 (RMA), \n     a lodging REIT is allowed to establish a taxable REIT \n     subsidiary (TRS) that can lease lodging facilities from a \n     REIT holding a controlling interest, with the payments to the \n     REIT considered qualified income under the REIT rules. The \n     RMA also created a rule under which a TRS is not allowed to \n     operate or manage lodging or health care facilities.\n       At the time the RMA was considered, it was not clear that \n     health care REITs would be interested in such treatment, so \n     health care facilities do not qualify for the RMA exception \n     to the related party rules. Today, many operators of health \n     care assets such as assisted living facilities do not want to \n     bear the financial risks of being a lessee of such facilities \n     and would rather act purely as an\n\n[[Page S10734]]\n\n     independent operator of the facilities. Health care REITs now \n     believe that the TRS restriction is interfering with their \n     ability to manage their operations in the most efficient \n     manner.\n       RIDEA would conform the treatment of health care facilities \n     to that of lodging facilities by treating as qualifying \n     income rental payments attributable to a health care facility \n     made to a REIT from a taxable REIT subsidiary. Under this \n     proposal, a TRS would still be required to use an independent \n     contractor to manage or operate health care facilities, but \n     payments collected by a REIT from its TRS renting health care \n     facilities would be qualified income under the REIT tests.\n     Title V: Foreign REITs\n       Since imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Congress \n     should be proud that about 20 countries have enacted \n     legislation paralleling the U.S. REIT rules after observing \n     the benefits brought to the United States as a result of a \n     vibrant REIT market. The number of countries that have \n     adopted REIT-like legislation this past decade has greatly \n     accelerated, with Israel being the latest country to do so \n     and legislation in the United Kingdom going into effect on \n     January 1, 2007. Although the tax code treats stock in a U.S. \n     REIT as a real estate asset, so that it is a qualified \n     asset that generates qualifying income, current law does \n     not afford the same treatment to the stock of non-U.S. \n     REITs.\n       A U.S. REIT might want to invest in another country through \n     a REIT organized in that country. A company could lose its \n     status as a U.S. REIT if it owns more than 10 percent of the \n     foreign REIT's securities, even though the foreign company \n     looks and acts like a U.S. REIT. A REIT should not be \n     discouraged from investing in an entity that engages in the \n     same activities that a U.S. REIT is allowed to undertake if \n     it invests directly in another country.\n       RIDEA would amend the REIT rules to provide that income \n     from, and interests in, foreign-qualified REITs would be \n     treated as qualifying REIT income and assets under the U.S. \n     REIT rules provided that under the laws of another country: \n     (1) at least 75 percent of the foreign company's assets must \n     be invested in real estate assets; (2) the foreign REIT \n     either receives a dividends paid deduction or is exempt from \n     corporate level tax; and (3) the foreign REIT is required to \n     distribute at least 85 percent of its taxable income to \n     shareholders on an annual basis.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 4030\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for Kindergarden Plus programs; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \njump-start the chance for success in school for this Nation's low-\nincome children. Today I am introducing the Sandy Feldman Kindergarten \nPlus Act of 2006.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will provide children below \n185 percent of the poverty line with additional time in kindergarten \nduring the summer before and the summer after the traditional \nkindergarten school year, and help to ensure that more children enter \nschool ready to succeed. The kindergarten year is an important time of \ntransition for young children. It represents the first year of \nschooling for 98 percent of the children in the United States, and it \nmarks the bridge between early childhood education and the primary \ngrades of school.\n  Many may ask why an initiative that will give an extra four months of \nkindergarten to low-income children? The answer is simple. Because too \nmany low-income children today enter kindergarten unprepared for the \nyear ahead and many children from low-income families are constantly \noutperformed by their wealthier peers.\n  We can, however, do a better job of preparing less fortunate children \nfor school. We can expose them to classroom practices and routines and \nthe expectations for kindergarten behavior and protocol. We can \nintroduce them to educational concepts and help them understand that \nclassrooms have rules. We can expose them to literature, story time or \ncircle time. We can help them understand that books are made up of \nprinted words and that words are made up of individual letters. We can \nask them questions to help develop their critical thinking skills, like \nwhat do you think will happen next in the story? We can offer them \n``show and tell'' to develop their oral language skills and ability to \nspeak out loud in sequential sentences. Simply put, we need to provide \nthem with a solid foundation that allows them to enter school with the \nskills necessary to become strong students.\n  How does this translate into school readiness? About 85 percent of \nhigh-income children, compared to 39 percent of low-income children, \ncan recognize letters of the alphabet upon arrival in kindergarten. \nAbout half the children of college graduates can identify the beginning \nsounds of words, but only 9 percent of the children whose parents \ndidn't complete high school can recognize the beginning sounds of \nwords. Low-income children often have a more limited vocabulary. By the \ntime they are in first grade, children in low-income families have \n5,000 word vocabularies. In contrast, children from more affluent \nfamilies enter school with vocabularies of 20,000 words. These are \nsignificant discrepancies.\n  In the John Hopkins University report, ``Schools, Achievement, and \nInequality: A Seasonal Perceptive,'' recommendations are made to \nimprove the socioeconomic differences in the seasonality of children's \nlearning over the school and summer months. The report that states \nduring the summer, upper socioeconomic status (SES) children's skills \ncontinue to advance, but lower SES children's gains, on average, are \nflat. Pre-school and kindergarten can reduce the achievement gap \nassociated with SES when children start first grade, but to help them \nkeep up it requires extra resources and enrichment experiences. Summer \neducation programs can build potential for economically disadvantaged \nchildren and their parents in support of academic development.\n  What we know from the research is that children can enter \nkindergarten better prepared to learn. We may not be able to close the \ngap between low-income children and their wealthier peers, but we can \ncertainly narrow it considerably. This is what this legislation strives \nto do.\n  This legislation was named after Sandy Feldman who was a tireless \nadvocate for children and public education who died last year after a \nlong battle with cancer. Her commitment to social justice and her \nauthority on urban education dates to her involvement with the civil \nrights movement.\n  Sandy rose from her position as second grade elementary school \nteacher to\n\n[[Page S10736]]\n\nbecome president of the 1.3 million-member American Federation of \nTeachers. She also knew that all too often, we don't give our schools \nthe resources they need to make all students' dreams come to fruition. \nHer focus on early childhood education led her to develop the concept \nfor this legislation and it was Sandy who spent countless hours \ndeveloping the details to ensure this would be a high quality \ninitiative.\n  I am joined in introducing this legislation by my colleagues Senators \nKennedy, Kerry, Lieberman, Durbin, Schumer, and Clinton. This bill is \nalso supported by the American Federation of Teachers, the Parent \nTeacher Association, National Education Association, Council of Great \nCity Schools, the Society for Research in Child Development, American \nFederation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Service Employees \nof International Union, National Head Start Association, the Children's \nDefense Fund and Easter Seals. I urge my colleagues to join this effort \nand cosponsor the legislation. I encourage them to help give low-income \nchildren a jump-start on school success.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4033\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Kindergarten Plus Act of \n     2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Kindergarten has proven to be a beneficial experience \n     for children, putting children on a path that positively \n     influences their learning and development in later school \n     years.\n       (2) Kindergarten and the years leading up to kindergarten \n     are critical in preparing children to succeed in elementary \n     school, especially if the children are from low-income \n     families or have other risks of difficulty in school.\n       (3) Disadvantaged children, on average, lag behind other \n     children in literacy, numeracy, and social skills, even \n     before formal schooling begins.\n       (4) For many children entering kindergarten, the \n     achievement gap between children from low-income households \n     compared to children from high-income households is already \n     evident.\n       (5) Eighty-five percent of beginning kindergartners in the \n     highest socioeconomic group, compared to 39 percent in the \n     lowest socioeconomic group, can recognize letters of the \n     alphabet. Similarly, 98 percent of beginning kindergartners \n     in the highest socioeconomic group, compared to 84 percent of \n     their peers in the lowest socioeconomic group, can recognize \n     numbers and shapes.\n       (6) Once disadvantaged children are in school, they learn \n     at the same rate as other children. Therefore, providing \n     disadvantaged children with additional time in kindergarten, \n     in the summer before such children ordinarily enter \n     kindergarten and in the summer before first grade, will help \n     schools close achievement gaps and accelerate the academic \n     progress of their disadvantaged students.\n       (7) High quality, extended-year kindergarten that provides \n     children with enriched learning experiences is an important \n     factor in helping to close achievement gaps, rather than \n     having the gaps continue to widen.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish the bipartisan and independent \nCommission on Global Resources, Environment, and Security, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nestablish a Commission on Global Resources, Environment and Security. \nThe goal of the Commission is to address one of the most serious, long-\n\n[[Page S10739]]\n\nterm threats facing our Nation--the degradation of the earth's natural \nlife support systems--and to make recommendations for a coordinated, \ncomprehensive, long-range national policy and new strategies to promote \nglobal environmental security.\n  In March 2005, more than 1,300 scientists from 95 countries around \nthe world completed the largest and most comprehensive study of the \nhealth of the earth's ecosystems ever undertaken. Known as the \nMillennium Ecosystem Assessment, the four-year study found that the \nnatural systems that support life on earth--our waters, wildlife and \nfisheries, air and lands--have been degraded more rapidly and \nextensively over the past five decades than in any comparable period of \ntime in history. The result has been a substantial loss of \nbiodiversity, a significant increase in atmospheric concentration of \ncarbon dioxide, depletion of world fisheries and water supplies, \nexcessive nutrient pollution of rivers and coastal waters, and \nincreased risk of emergence of new diseases. The report also found \nthat, unless substantial actions are taken in policies, institutions \nand practices in the near future to reverse the degradation, the \npressure on the planet's ecosystems will continue to increase. In the \nnext 50 years, the world population is expected to grow from \napproximately 6 billion to more than 9 billion people. Global demand \nfor food is projected to increase by 70-80 percent. Energy consumption \nis projected to double by 2035 at current growth rates. Globally, as \nmuch as 25 percent of freshwater use and 35 percent of irrigation \nwithdrawal is supplied from unsustainable sources. An estimated 7 \nbillion people could face water shortages.\n  Experts agree that these environmental threats also have profound \nimplications for our national security. According to former Secretary \nof State Colin Powell . . . ``poverty, destruction of the environment \nand despair are destroyers of people, of societies, of nations, a cause \nof instability as an unholy trinity that can destabilize countries and \ndestabilize entire regions.''\n  As the world's wealthiest nation, the U.S. has the responsibility and \nthe unique capacity to lead the world toward a more sustainable future. \nThe legislation which I am introducing today represents the important \nstep in that direction. It provides for the establishment of an \nindependent commission to examine the state of scientific understanding \nand current efforts to protect the global environment, to assess the \nimpact of continued global environmental deterioration on U.S. \ninterests, and to make recommendations to address these threats. The \nlast time the Federal Government took a broad in-depth review of \ninternational environment and development issues was in the 1970s.\n  At the launch of Millenium Ecosystem Assessment, Secretary General of \nthe United Nations, Kofi Annan, stated that, ``only by understanding \nthe environment and how it works, can we make the necessary decisions \nto protect it.'' The concept of such a Commission is strongly supported \nby a broad range of leading scientific and foreign policy leaders who \nhave signed the ``Earth Legacy Declaration.'' They assert that: ``We \nneed a national discussion on the fundamental questions of what legacy \nwe will leave our children and grandchildren, and what actions we must \ntake as a nation to ensure that the world we hand down to them is as \nsafe, healthy, and bountiful as the one we inherited.''\n  We need a new consensus and a foundation upon which to build a \nrenewed U.S. commitment to protect the global environment. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in this measure to establish this Commission on \nGlobal Resources, Environment, and Security.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4038\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Global Resources, \n     Environment, and Security Commission Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) humans are placing increasing and potentially \n     unsustainable pressures on--\n       (A) the Earth;\n       (B) ecosystems; and\n       (C) natural resources;\n       (2) economic prosperity, human health, and peaceful \n     international relations depend on the continued existence \n     of--\n       (A) a clean environment; and\n       (B) the sustainability of natural resources and ecosystem \n     services;\n       (3) increasing scarcities of natural resources and \n     environmental degradation can cause economic losses and \n     contribute to--\n       (A) disease;\n       (B) famine;\n       (C) increased vulnerability to natural disasters;\n       (D) mass migration;\n       (E) disruption of trade; and\n       (F) violent conflict;\n       (4) those potential disasters can--\n       (A) weaken all members of the international community; and\n       (B) create serious threats to the national security of the \n     United States;\n       (5) many scientific studies reveal that the rapid increases \n     in global population and the new global security problems \n     have, and will likely continue to have, serious impacts on \n     the United States, including--\n       (A) inadequate access to sources of healthy freshwater;\n       (B) loss of biodiversity;\n       (C) climate change;\n       (D) marine overfishing and pollution;\n       (E) transboundary air pollution;\n       (F) nuclear and chemical contamination;\n       (G) deforestation;\n       (H) invasive species migration; and\n       (I) soil degradation and desertification;\n       (6) the complex and interconnected nature of those problems \n     requires new forms of cooperation between--\n       (A) the stakeholders of the United States; and\n       (B) the United States and other countries;\n       (7) according to the National Environmental Policy Act of \n     1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), it is the national policy of \n     the United States--\n       (A) to recognize the worldwide and long-range character of \n     environmental problems; and\n       (B) to lend appropriate support to initiatives, \n     resolutions, and programs designed to maximize international \n     cooperation in anticipating and preventing a decline in the \n     quality of the world environment;\n       (8) the United States is in a unique position to be able to \n     share scientific and technical expertise on the world stage \n     in ways that--\n       (A) benefit all persons; and\n       (B) provide opportunities in the United States for--\n       (i) economic growth;\n       (ii) investment; and\n       (iii) innovation; and\n       (9) the leadership of the United States on the advancement \n     of global environmental security serves the domestic \n     interests of the United States while strengthening \n     relationships between the United States and other countries.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a \n     bipartisan and independent commission to make recommendations \n     for a coordinated, comprehensive, and long-range national \n     policy for new and existing strategies initiated by the \n     United States to promote global environmental security.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to ensure that innovations developed at federally-\nfunded institutions are available in certain developing countries at \nthe lowest possible cost; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Public \nResearch in the Public Interest Act of 2006. If enacted, this bill will \nsave lives and improve the quality of health for millions of families \nliving in impoverished nations. Recently, I have introduced and \ncosponsored six bills to address the increasingly important issues that \nrelate to global health and the need for earlier access to generic \nmedicines in the United States.\n  Each year, millions of people needlessly suffer from disease in \nimpoverished countries worldwide because they lack access to lifesaving \nmedicines. And each year, America's world-renowned research \nuniversities develop innovative treatments to combat these diseases. \nHowever, under our current system, these treatments do not get to the \nfamilies in impoverished nations who so desperately need them.\n  Today, 15 percent of the world's people consume about 91 percent of \nthe world's pharmaceuticals. The high price of lifesaving medicines--\nmedicines we take for granted--puts them far beyond the reach of \nmillions of the most vulnerable populations.\n  While the concept of my bill is simple, the implications are \nprofound. If passed, my bill would greatly lessen the cost burden of \ngeneric drugs in the developing world. It would achieve this by \nrequiring federally funded research institutions to permit their \ninventions, such as, drugs, vaccines, and innovative medical devices, \nto be provided inexpensively by generic companies distributing medical \nsupplies to the developing world.\n  Federally funded labs and research institutions have a vital role to \nplay in meeting this goal. For example, Yale University has an \nagreement with Doctors Without Borders to permit their generic version \nof its lifesaving AIDS drug to be used for a pilot treatment program in \nSouth Africa. To date, Yale's humanitarian endeavor, which in no way \nreduced their licensing revenues, continues to save thousands of lives.\n  It is time to ensure that public funds truly serve public purposes--\nin this instance, delivering essential health care needs at minimal \ncosts to American taxpayers, universities, and pharmaceutical \ncompanies. Unfortunately, this Congress has been tied up in knots \nrecently and has been unable to pass even critical appropriations \nbills. The measures before us are crucial. This comprehensive approach \ntoward providing better global health aid and better access to generic \ndrugs should become law, and I am committed to trying to make it so. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \nin this Congress or the next, to enact this important legislation.\n  I have recently introduced or sponsored six bills to address the need \nfor better access to low-cost generic medicines. Two of these bills \nrelate to global health, and four of them address the need for earlier \naccess to generic medicines in the United States.\n\n[[Page S10742]]\n\n  Federally funded laboratories and other research institutions have a \ncritical role to play in delivering affordable medicines to those sick \nand suffering worldwide. In 2000, a Senate Joint Economic Committee \nReport found that public research was instrumental in developing 15 of \nthe 21 drugs considered by experts to have had the highest therapeutic \nimpact on society.\n  Between 1970 and 2001, there was a ten-fold increase in the number of \nU.S. patents issued annually to U.S. academic institutions. American \nuniversities, hospitals, and other nonprofit research centers concluded \nthat more than 4,500 license and option agreements were executed in \n2003, more than double the license and option agreements executed in \n1993. A major share of these patents is in the biomedical field.\n  The World Health Organization's 2006 Commission on Intellectual \nProperty Rights, Innovation, and Public Health has also recently \nrecognized the crucial role of universities. The WHO recommended that \nuniversities adopt licensing practices designed to increase access to \nmedicines in developing countries.\n  The report also tells the story of one way in which the crucial role \nof university innovations and other publicly funded research in \npromoting global public health first came into the public eye. It is an \ninteresting story.\n  In 2001, the international organization Medecins Sans Frontieres, or \nMSF, requested Yale University's permission to use its generic life-\nsaving AIDS drug, stavudine, for a pilot treatment project outside Cape \nTown.\n  This was at a time when HIV drugs were first being introduced in the \ndeveloping world. The costs were prohibitive. Scientists at Yale \nUniversity had discovered stavudine's value in the fight against AIDS, \nand Yale University was the key patent holder.\n  In response to MSF's request, Yale and Bristol-Myers Squibb jointly \nannounced that they would permit the sale of generics in South Africa \nand that Bristol-Myers Squibb would lower the price of its brand-name \nstavudine by 96 percent throughout sub-Saharan Africa.\n  The Yale/Bristol-Myers Squibb announcement was highly significant in \nthe campaign for access to affordable first-line AIDS treatments. Yale \nand Bristol-Myers Squibb's humanitarian action did not reduce licensing \nrevenues with respect to Yale. Meanwhile, Yale's invention to this day \ncontinues to save thousands of lives. According to a recent report by \nthe WHO's AIDS Medicines and Diagnostics Service, stavudine is one of \nthe three first-line HIV medicines that together constituted almost 90 \npercent of total procurement in 2005.\n  Unfortunately, this has been an isolated success story rather than \nthe road to greater access for the many important inventions that come \nout of publicly funded research institutions.\n  With respect to HIV/AIDS treatment alone, at least two major drugs \nbased on university inventions have come to market since the 2001 \nstavudine announcement: emtricitabine, developed in large part at Emory \nUniversity and sold by Gilead Sciences as Emtriva; and T-20 developed \nin large part at Duke University and marketed as Fuzeon by Hoffmann-La \nRoche and Trimeris. Just this summer, Yale University announced the \nlicense of a new candidate for an AIDS drug based on stavudine. Called \n``4'-ethynyl-stavudine'', (or abbreviated more simply as Ed4T). Early \ntesting suggests that it may be both more effective and less toxic than \nits famous predecessor.\n  But the question is: Will these lifesaving drugs ultimately be \navailable in places like sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV infection rates \nrange as high as a third of the adult population?\n  This bill, the Public Research in the Public Interest Act of 2006, \nwould focus on this problem. By allowing licensing by generic companies \nof inventions coming out of publicly funded research institutions--and \nother associated inventions required to produce marketable medicines--\nit would drive down the price of new, innovative drugs in areas where \nthey would otherwise be effectively unavailable.\n  Because the licensing regime this bill proposes is self-enforcing, it \nminimizes both administrative overhead and eliminates the need for \ncase-by-case decisions, while preserving important intellectual \nproperty protections. Because the Act allows the introduction of \ngeneric or reduced-price drugs only into markets too poor to otherwise \nafford them, its terms do not threaten corporate investments or profits \nin wealthy nations. All generic drugs manufactured under the bill must \nbe clearly differentiated from the versions sold in developed nations, \nwhere the brand-name companies make their profits.\n  Moreover, publicly funded research institutions would receive \nroyalties from the sale of inventions covered by this bill in \ndeveloping markets. While the initial payment of the royalties will \ntypically go to the research institution itself, the bill leaves \ncomplete freedom to these institutions and their licensee to decide how \nsuch royalties will ultimately be shared. This freedom is especially \nimportant because the inventions from universities and other research \ninstitutions often form only one part of the collection of intellectual \nproperty necessary to manufacture a finished, marketable drug. The \nappropriate division of the royalties paid by generics for this package \nof rights in the developing world will be different for different drugs \nand medical devices, depending on whether the university's contribution \nis more or less central to the finished product. This Act would allow \nall the various parties the flexibility to divide these royalties \nappropriately.\n  I should be clear, however, that the bill I introduce today is an \ninitial proposal. I look forward to working with research universities \nin the United States on this important matter. I also intend to work \nwith the companies involved in creating, licensing, and bringing to \nmarket the fruits of America's unparalleled research institutions as we \ncontinue to shape this solution.\n  Indeed, the best answer may not be legislative at all, if the groups \ninvolved can come together around a different approach. But however it \nis achieved, I believe that increasing the availability of the many \nmedical inventions that come from publicly funded research centers is a \ngood solution to pressing global health concerns.\n  Universities, in particular, are unique institutions with unique \npublic commitments. They are, before anything else, institutions \ndedicated to the creation and dissemination of knowledge in the public \ninterest. The Public Research in the Public Interest Act of 2006 is \ndesigned in the spirit of that commitment.\n  This bill completes a package of six bills that I have recently \nintroduced to increase access to medicines in the United States and to \naddress the global public health crisis. While it is the magnitude of \nthis problem that demands that we, as a Nation, take action, it is the \nsmall things, the individual stories that often speak to us most \nclearly at a personal level.\n  In my office hangs a photograph I took of three young boys on the \nside of a mountain in Turkey. I found them flying a kite off the edge \nof a cliff that overlooks a vast slum. They had made the toy out of \nscraps of paper, patched together with tape and string, and were flying \nit on the currents rushing up the face of the rock.\n  I recalled fearing for their safety as they played so precariously \nclose to the edge. But these children faced much greater risks. When my \ngrandchildren get sick, we can always be sure they will get the \nmedicines they need. For these boys, there is no such guarantee.\n  These boys, and the millions of children and others like them around \nthe world are the reason behind each of the six bills I have \nintroduced.\n  Earlier this summer, I introduced a bill which can be the catalyst \nfor empowering U.S. generic companies to save the lives or improve the \nhealth of millions of families in impoverished nations. Under the \n``Life-Saving Medicines Export Act,'' U.S. companies can make low-cost \ngeneric versions of any medicine for export to impoverished nations \nthat face public health crises when those impoverished nations cannot \nproduce those life-saving medicines for themselves.\n  This bill is based on World Trade Organization agreements permitting \nnations with pharmaceutical industries to help nations in need. The \nWorld Health Assembly and the World Health Organization have adopted \nresolutions urging all WTO member nations with a generic capability to \nadopt laws that\n\n[[Page S10743]]\n\nimplement that agreement. On December 6, 2005, the Office of the U.S. \nTrade Representative announced that it ``welcomes'' efforts to ``allow \ncountries to override patent rights when necessary to export lifesaving \ndrugs to developing countries that face public health crises but cannot \nproduce drugs for themselves.''\n\n  This bill addresses the urgent needs of millions of low-income \nfamilies in impoverished nations while protecting the interests of the \npatent owners of these life-saving medicines. As in the Public Research \nin the Public Interest Act, introduced today, generic companies are \nonly permitted to use the compulsory license in the bill in developing \nnations, where low-income families are simply too poor to purchase the \n``brand-name'' versions, and the generic versions must be clearly \nmarked as not for resale in developed nations. Thus, both bills pose \nthe risk of minimal losses for patent holders while generating new \nrevenue for the brand-name companies from the royalties on generic \nsales.\n  The four additional bills that complete this ``Access to Medicines'' \npackage seek to preserve incentives for U.S. generic companies to enter \nand compete in the market. Increased competition leads to lower prices \nand saved lives.\n  First, in the wake of the Supreme Court refusal to hear the drug \npatent case called Federal Trade Commission (FTC) v. Schering-Plough, I \njoined fellow Judiciary Committee members--Senators Kohl, Grassley and \nSchumer--in introducing legislation to explicitly prohibit brand-name \ndrug manufacturers from using pay-off agreements to keep cheaper \ngeneric equivalents off the market. Such payments are a distortion in \nthe market that harms patients. I was stunned that the U.S. Supreme \nCourt refused to hear a case so important to our senior citizens. The \nFederal Trade Commission asked the Supreme Court to hear the arguments \nbut the Court refused at the request of the Justice Department. It \nseems there may be no justice--until that bill is passed--for our \nseniors needing costly patented medicines but live where the brand-name \ncompany has paid generic companies not to compete.\n  Then, in July, I joined Senators Rockefeller and Schumer in \nintroducing legislation to ban ``authorized generics'' that can stifle \ntrue generic competition. I said at the time that ``the giant drug \ncompanies keep coming up with ways to avoid real competition and \nconsumers need to be able to count on Congress to close each new \nanticompetitive loophole they come up with.'' If enacted, that bill \nwill close this anti-competitive loophole in the Hatch-Waxman Act and \nwill preserve the incentives Congress created for generic companies to \nenter the market to supply American citizens and seniors with lower-\ncost drugs.\n  The fifth bill introduced was with Senator Kohl. That bill is \nintended to stop frivolous Citizen Petitions designed to delay \nintroduction of generic drugs into the market place. Recently, large \npharmaceutical companies have exploited that petition process to keep \ntheir profits high. In addition, I joined with Senators Schumer, \nClinton and Stabenow on the Access to LifeSavings Medicine Act which \nrelated to developing a fast-track process for approving generic \nversions of biologic medicines.\n  I want to thank Stacy Kern-Scheerer with Senate Legislative Counsel \nwho provided very helpful guidance under extreme pressure in drafting \nthis short, but complex bill. She and Bill Baird, also with Senate \nLegislative Counsel, did a great job with a rapid turnaround.\n  I believe that these six bills, together, can save millions of lives. \nRecognizing the great need, there have been significant voluntary \nefforts made by brand-name pharmaceutical companies, foundations, and \nnonprofits who have already donated life-saving medicines, time, \npersonnel and money to help in the fight against deadly diseases both \nin America and abroad. I commend and greatly appreciate those efforts. \nNonetheless, much remains to be done. My bills will both add to and \ncomplement existing efforts, by making sure even cutting edge \ntreatments are available in developing countries, and by ensuring that \nAmerica's aid dollars and the contributions of private philanthropists \nare used as efficiently as they can possibly be used.\n  The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief Report to Congress \nreported that ``[i]n every case generics prices present an opportunity \nfor cost savings; in some cases, the branded price per pack of a drug \nis up to 11 times the cost of the approved generic version.''\n  The current global public health crisis is one of the great callings \nof our time. As a nation, we cannot afford to ignore this threat. Our \nown health and aspects of our national security depend on it.\n  We have become far more aware today of how much our own health \ndepends on what takes place half a world away. Whether it is AIDS, \nSARS, West Nile Virus, the Avian Flu, or the encroaching menace of \nmulti-drug resistant bacteria, we are all at risk. We are only an \nairplane flight away from wherever an outbreak may occur--a place where \nthe medical innovations developed in this country to combat these \ndevastating diseases may not be available to keep the outbreak under \ncontrol.\n  In a post-9/11 world, our well-being is intimately connected with \nthat of other nations. Health is an essential building block for a \nstrong economy, and vital to maintain a thriving democracy. Through \nincreasing access to essential medicines throughout the world, the \nUnited States can help to give developing nations a chance to flourish, \nwhile improving U.S. relations with large segments of the world's \npopulation.\n  President Franklin Roosevelt once said: ``The test of our progress is \nnot whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is \nwhether we provide enough, for those who have little.''\n  We are fortunate, at some times and on some issues, to be able to do \nboth. Now is one of those times, and this is one of those issues. I \nhope my colleagues will join me in supporting my efforts this year on \nthe global public health crisis, including today's addition, the Public \nResearch in the Public Interest Act of 2006.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4040\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Research in the \n     Public Interest Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to promote global \n     public health and America's national security by ensuring \n     that innovations developed at federally-funded institutions \n     are available in eligible developing countries at the lowest \n     possible cost.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is in the national interest of the United States \n     that people around the world live healthier lives, and that \n     they perceive the United States in a more favorable light.\n       (2) The United States Government funds a major portion of \n     all academic research.\n       (3) Congress funds universities and Federal research \n     laboratories as institutions dedicated to the creation and \n     dissemination of knowledge in the public interest.\n       (4) The Federal Government's investment in science and \n     technology fuels a thriving pharmaceutical industry and \n     rising longevity and quality of life in the United States. In \n     2000, a Senate Joint Economic Committee Report found that \n     public research was instrumental in developing 15 of the 21 \n     drugs considered by experts to have had the highest \n     therapeutic impact on society.\n       (5) Millions of people with HIV/AIDS in developing \n     countries need antiretroviral drugs. More than 40,000,000 \n     people worldwide have HIV and 95 percent of them live in \n     developing countries. Malaria, tuberculosis, and other \n     infectious diseases kill millions of people a year in \n     developing nations.\n       (6) The World Health Organization (``WHO'') has estimated \n     that \\1/3\\ of the world's population lacks regular access to \n     essential medicines, including antiretroviral drugs. The WHO \n     reported that just by improving access to existing medicines \n     roughly 10,000,000 lives could be saved around the world \n     every year.\n       (7) To help address the access to medicines crisis, the \n     World Health Organization's 2006 Commission on Intellectual \n     Property Rights, Innovation, and Public Health recommended \n     that universities adopt licensing practices designed to \n     increase access to medicines in developing countries.\n       (8) The Department of State has reported to Congress under \n     the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief that, ``[I]n \n     every case generics prices present an opportunity for cost \n     savings; in some cases, the branded price per pack of a drug \n     is up to 11 times the cost of the approved generic \n     version.''.\n\n[[Page S10744]]\n\n       (9) Since sales of the patented, brand-name versions of \n     such medicines are minimal or non-existent in many \n     impoverished regions of the world, allowing generic versions \n     of those medicines will have minimal impact on the sales of \n     brand-name, patented versions in such regions, or the \n     licensing revenues of publicly funded research institutions, \n     while saving an untold number of lives.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Associated medical product.--The term ``associated \n     medical product'', when used in relation to a subject \n     invention, means any medical product of which the \n     manufacture, use, sale, offering for sale, import, or export \n     relies upon or is covered by the rights guaranteed by title \n     in that invention.\n       (2) Associated rights.--The term ``associated rights,'' \n     when used in relation to a subject invention, means--\n       (A) all patent and marketing rights, possessed by a current \n     or former holder of title in that invention, or licensee of \n     rights guaranteed by such title, that are reasonably \n     necessary to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import, export, \n     or test any associated medical product ever made, used, sold, \n     offered for sale, imported, or exported by that party; and\n       (B) the right to rely on biological, chemical, biochemical, \n     toxicological, pharmacological, metabolic, formulation, \n     clinical, analytical, stability, and other information and \n     data for purposes of regulatory approval of any associated \n     medical product.\n       (3) Drug.--The term ``drug'' has the meaning given such \n     term in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic \n     Act (21 U.S.C. 321).\n       (4) Eligible country.--The term ``eligible country'' means \n     any country of which the economy is classified by the World \n     Bank as ``low-income'', or ``lower-middle-income''.\n       (5) Fair royalty.--The term ``fair royalty'', when used in \n     relation to a subject invention, means--\n       (A) for a country classified by the World Bank as ``low-\n     income'' at the time of the sales on which royalties are due, \n     2 percent of a licensee's net sales of associated medical \n     products in such country; and\n       (B) for a country classified by the World Bank as ``lower-\n     middle-income'' at the time of sales on which royalties are \n     due, 5 percent of a licensee's net sales of associated \n     medical products in such country.\n       (6) Invention.--The term ``invention'' means any invention \n     or discovery which is or may be patentable or otherwise \n     protectable under title 35, United States Code, or any novel \n     variety of plant which is or may be protectable under the \n     Plant Variety Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2321 et seq.).\n       (7) Medical device.--The term ``medical device'' means a \n     device, as defined in section 201(h) of the Federal Food, \n     Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(h)), and includes any \n     device component of any combination product, as that term is \n     used in section 503(g) of such Act (21 U.S.C. 353(g)).\n       (8) Medical product.--The term ``medical product'' means \n     any drug, treatment, prophylaxis, vaccine, or medical device.\n       (9) Neglected research.--The term ``neglected research'' \n     means any use of a subjected invention or the associated \n     rights in an effort to develop medical products for a rare \n     disease or condition, as defined in section 526(a)(2) of the \n     Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360bb(a)(2)).\n       (10) Subject institution.--The term ``subject institution'' \n     means any institution of higher education (as such term is \n     defined in section 101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 \n     (20 U.S.C. 1001(a)) or research that receives federal \n     financial assistance, including Federal laboratories as \n     defined in section 12(d) of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology \n     Innovation Act of 1980 (15 U.S.C. 3710a(d)).\n       (11) Subject invention.--The term ``subject invention'' \n     means any invention--\n       (A) conceived or first actually reduced to practice by a \n     subject institution, or its employees in the course of their \n     employment, on or after the effective date of this Act; or\n       (B) in which a subject institution holds title, provided \n     the invention was first conceived or reduced to practice on \n     or after the effective date of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 4. ACCESS TO LIFESAVING MEDICINES DEVELOPED AT \n                   GOVERNMENT FUNDED INSTITUTIONS.\n\n       (a) Grant of License.--\n       (1) In general.--As a condition of receiving Federal \n     assistance, any subject institution that conceives, reduced \n     to practice, or holds title in a subject invention shall be \n     required to grant irrevocable, perpetual, nonexclusive \n     licenses to the invention and any associated rights the \n     institution may own or ever acquire, to any party requesting \n     such a license pursuant to subsection (g).\n       (2) Purpose of license.--The licenses described under \n     paragraph (1) shall be for the sole purpose of--\n       (A) supplying medical products in accordance with \n     subsection (e); or\n       (B) conducting neglected research anywhere in the world, \n     royalty-free.\n       (b) Incorporation Into Title.--The open-licensing \n     requirement created by subsection (a) and all licenses \n     granted thereunder shall be part of the subject institution's \n     title in a subject invention. No transfer or license may be \n     interpreted in any manner inconsistent with making any grant \n     under subsection (a) effective, or in any manner that \n     prevents or frees the holder of title in the invention from \n     granting licenses.\n       (c) Subsequent Licenses.--\n       (1) In general.--If a subject institution licenses or \n     grants rights in a subject invention to any other party, as a \n     condition of such grant the licensee or grantee, and any \n     future sublicensees or subsequent grantees, ad infinitum, \n     shall also be required in perpetuity, to grant irrevocable, \n     perpetual, nonexclusive licenses on any associated rights \n     which the licensee or grantee may own or later acquire, to \n     any party requesting such a license pursuant to subsection \n     (g).\n       (2) Purpose of license.--The licenses shall be for the sole \n     purposes described in subsection (a)(2).\n       (3) Application of this subsection.--This subsection \n     applies to licenses for a subject invention acquired under \n     subsection (a).\n       (d) Construction.--No grant or licensee of any subject \n     invention may be interpreted in any manner that prevents or \n     frees the grantee or licensee from granting licenses for \n     associated rights under subsection (c).\n       (e) License for Supply of Medical Products.--\n       (1) In general.--A license under subsection (a)(2)(A) shall \n     be a license for the sole purpose of permitting the making, \n     using, selling, offering to sell, importing, exporting, and \n     testing of medical products in eligible countries and the \n     making and exporting of medical products worldwide for the \n     sole purpose of supplying medical products to eligible \n     countries.\n       (2) Labeling.--If the recipient of a license under \n     subsection (a) exercises its right to make and export a \n     medical product in any country other than an eligible country \n     for the sole purpose of export to an eligible country, then \n     the licensee shall use reasonable efforts to visibly \n     distinguish the medical product it manufactures from any \n     similar medical product sold by others in the country of \n     manufacture, provided that such reasonable efforts do not \n     require the licensee to expend significant expense.\n       (3) Royalties.--\n       (A) License of subject invention.--A license of a subject \n     invention under subsection (a)(2)(A) shall be irrevocable and \n     perpetual so long as the licensee submits to the licensor \n     payment of a fair royalty on sales of any associated medical \n     product within 90 days of such sales. Failure or refusal of \n     the licensor to accept the fair royalty shall not terminate \n     or affect in any way the license.\n       (B) License of associated rights.--A license of associated \n     rights to a subject invention under subsection (a)(2)(A) \n     shall be royalty free.\n       (f) Transfer.--In accordance with subsections (a) through \n     (d), any license or other transfer of a subject invention by \n     a subject institution or the licensee or grantee of such \n     institution for a subject invention, shall be invalid \n     unless--\n       (1) the license or grant includes a clause, ``This grant or \n     license is subject to the provisions of the Public Research \n     in the Public Interest Act of 2006.'';\n       (2) the licensor or grantor complies with the notification \n     requirements of subsection (h); and\n       (3) the license or grant does not include any terms that \n     contradict any requirement of this Act.\n       (g) Procedures for Acquisition of Licenses.--\n       (1) In general.--Any party, upon providing to the Food and \n     Drug Administration--\n       (A) notification of its intent to supply medical products \n     or conduct neglected research as provided in subsection (a);\n       (B) a specific list of the rights it wishes to license for \n     those purposes; and\n       (C) the names of the party or parties it believes are \n     obligated to grant such licenses under subsections (a) \n     through (d),\n     shall automatically be deemed to receive the license so \n     requested without the need for any further action on the part \n     of the licensing party if the party or parties specified in \n     the request do not object and notify the requesting party of \n     such objection, within 30 days of the publication of such \n     request by the Administration.\n       (2) Enforcement action.--\n       (A) In general.--If the party or parties specified under \n     paragraph (1) object to the grant of a requested license, the \n     requesting party may bring an action to enforce its right to \n     a license of a subject invention or associated rights under \n     subsections (a) through (d).\n       (B) Process.--In any suit under this subsection, the \n     requesting party shall be entitled to separate, expedited \n     review of the legal issues required to adjudicate whether it \n     is entitled to the requested license, without prejudice to \n     any other issues in the lawsuit. If the party objecting to \n     the license is found to have objected without reasonable \n     cause or without a good faith belief that there was a \n     justifiable controversy under the facts and the law, the \n     party requesting the license shall be entitled to attorney's \n     fees, other reasonably necessary costs of the lawsuit, and \n     treble damages from the objecting party.\n       (3) Publication.--The Food and Drug Administration shall \n     publish any request made under paragraph (1) within 15 days \n     of receipt of such request. The Food and Drug Administration \n     shall also make reasonable efforts to directly notify the \n     parties named in any such request.\n       (h) Notification of Transfer or License of Subject \n     Inventions.--The holder of title or any license in a subject \n     invention shall notify the Food and Drug Administration of \n     any grant or license of rights in that invention.

A bill to protect children and their parents from being \ncoerced into administering a controlled substance in order to attend \nschool, and for other purposes; read the first time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. President, I rise today, along with my colleague, Tom \nCoburn, to proudly introduce the Child Medication Safety Act, a bill to \nprotect children and their parents from being coerced into \nadministering a controlled substance or psychotropic drug in order to \nattend a school. The text of my bill exactly matches the text of H.R. \n1790, which passed the House on November 16, 2006 by a vote of 407 to \n12.\n  Parents today face many challenges when raising their children, one \nof which is ensuring that their children receive the best education \npossible. My views on education come from a somewhat unique perspective \nin that my wife, Kay, was a teacher at Edison High School in Tulsa for \nmany years and now both of our daughters are teachers. I can assure you \nthat I am one of the strongest supporters of quality education. \nHowever, it has come to my attention that schools have been acting as \nphysicians or psychologists by strongly suggesting that children with \nbehavioral problems be put immediately on some form of psychotropic \ndrugs. Schools and teachers are not equipped to make this diagnosis and \nshould not make it mandatory for the student to continue attending the \nschool. This is clearly beyond their area of expertise. Therefore, I am \nintroducing this legislation to ensure that parents are not required by \nschool personnel to medicate their children.\n  The Child Medication Safety Act requires, as a condition of receiving \nfunds from the Department of Education, that States develop and \nimplement polices and procedures prohibiting school personnel from \nrequiring a child to obtain a prescription as a condition of attending \nthe school. It should be noted that this bill does not prevent teachers \nor other school personnel from sharing with parents or guardians \nclassroom-based observations regarding a student's academic performance \nor regarding the need for evaluation for special education. \nAdditionally, this bill calls for a study by the Comptroller General of \nthe United States reviewing: No. 1, the variation among States in the \ndefinition of psychotropic medication as used in public education, No. \n2, the prescription rates of medication used in public schools to treat \nchildren with attention deficit disorder and other such disorders, No. \n3, which medications listed under the Controlled Substances Act are \nbeing prescribed to such children, and No. 4, which medications not \nlisted under the Controlled Substances Act are being used to treat \nthese children. This GAO report is due no later than 1 year after the \nenactment of this Act.\n  I believe this is an extremely important bill that protects the \nrights of our children against improper intrusion regarding health \nissues by those not qualified. If a parent or guardian believes their \nchild is in need of medication, then they have the right to make that \ndecision and consult with a licensed medical practitioner who is \nqualified to prescribe an appropriate drug. Please join us in support \nof this legislation that protects the freedoms of our children. We also \nask that you work with us to secure passage of the Child Medication \nSafety Act before the end of the 109th Congress as it has already \npassed the House by a huge margin.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Conrad, and Mr. \n        Bayh):\n  S. 4042. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \ndisruptions of the funerals of members or former members of the Armed \nForces; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleagues \nSenators Chambliss, Conrad, and Bayh in introducing the Respect for the \nFunerals of Fallen Heroes Act.\n  Our bill would make it unlawful to intentionally disrupt the funeral \nof a U.S. military servicemember or veteran. Sadly, we have seen at \nleast 129 such disruptions over the past 16 months by a group nominally \ncalling itself a Christian church. These disruptions have taken place \nin almost every State in the country. In Illinois alone, there have \nbeen at least 16 disruptions of military funerals during that time--\nmore than any other State.\n  Most of us know the heartbreak of laying a loved one to rest--a \nfather, a mother, a husband or wife, a grandparent, a brother or \nsister, a child, a good friend. Funerals are a sad moment of parting, a \nlast opportunity to say farewell.\n  A loved one is laid to rest only once. And the families and friends \nof the departed have a clear interest in conducting the funeral \nceremony in peace, in tranquility, and in a way they feel best honors \nthe life of the departed and comforts those who are left behind.\n  It can be devastating to have that funeral disrupted--to have the \npeace and good order of the ceremony intentionally disturbed by someone \nyou don't even know--during the one chance the mourners have to lay \ntheir loved one to rest.\n  Intentional disruptions of funerals are particularly troubling \nbecause mourners at a funeral are a captive audience. They can't just \nleave. If someone tries to disturb a funeral ceremony by making loud \nnoises or trying to divert the mourners' attention, the mourners can't \njust move somewhere else. A funeral ceremony is bound to the location \nof the body of the deceased.\n  While an intentional disruption of the peace and good order of a \nfuneral ceremony would be inappropriate under any circumstances, it is \nparticularly vile when the intentional disruption occurs during the \nfuneral of a fallen member of the Armed Services.\n  The United States government owes an obligation to the men and women \nwho have served their country in uniform. These men and women have \nrisked their lives for their country. When they lose their lives, the \ngovernment has a significant interest in allowing their families and \nfriends to lay them to rest in peace.\n  In May, Congress enacted legislation called the Respect for America's \nFallen Heroes Act, which would safeguard the funerals of U.S. veterans \nand servicemembers that take place at Federal cemeteries. This law \nprohibits demonstrations during the military funerals that are held at \nour 121 national cemeteries and Arlington National Cemetery. It \nprovides protection for the funerals of approximately 90,000 veterans \nwho are buried each year Federal cemeteries.\n  Our bill would expand the current law to cover the funerals of all \nservicemembers and veterans, whether they are buried in a national \ncemetery, in their own local cemetery, or somewhere else. It would \nprovide protection for the funerals of all of the 650,000-700,000 \nservicemembers and veterans who die each year in the United States.\n  Admirably, my home State of Illinois and 25 other States have passed \nlaws to try to protect military funerals with their borders. A wide \nrange of State laws have been enacted, providing varying degrees of \nprotection. But many of these laws were not narrowly tailored and are \nlikely to be struck down as unconstitutional. Legal challenges are \nalready underway in several States. What's needed now is a Federal \nsolution.\n  Under our bill, it would be a criminal misdemeanor--punishable by a \nfine or up to one year in jail--for any person to 1. make any noise or \ndiversion within the boundary of or within 150 feet of a military \nfuneral location that intentionally disturbs the peace and good order \nof the funeral, or 2. intentionally impede access to or from the \nfuneral within 300 feet of the funeral location. Such activities would \nbe prohibited during the period from 60 minutes before until 60 minutes \nafter a military funeral.\n  I understand the critical importance of the right to free speech. It \nis a foundational right under the U.S. Constitution. However, the \nSupreme Court has repeatedly found it is consistent with the First \nAmendment for the time, place, and manner of speech to be reasonably \nlimited in a way that is content neutral and narrowly tailored to serve \na significant government interest.\n  Our bill meets that test. The government has a significant interest \nin preserving the tranquility and privacy of the funerals of men and \nwomen who defend our country as members of the\n\n[[Page S10746]]\n\nArmed Forces. Congress has the constitutional power to raise and \nsupport armies, and we can and should support our troops by providing \nthem with peaceful funerals.\n  Our bill creates a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction \nsimilar to restrictions that the Supreme Court has previously upheld. \nFor example, in a case that took place in my home state of Illinois, \nGrayned v. City of Rockford, the Supreme Court upheld an ordinance that \nstated the following: ``(N)o person, while on public or private grounds \nadjacent to any building in which a school or any class thereof is in \nsession, shall willfully make or assist in the making of any noise or \ndiversion which disturbs or tends to disturb the peace or good order of \nsuch school session or class thereof.''\n  Like the ordinance in Rockford, IL, my legislation is a reasonable \nrestriction on disruptive activities within a limited geographic \nlocation for a limited period of time. Just as the local government has \na significant interest in protecting the peace and good order of school \nsessions, the Federal Government has a significant interest in \nprotecting the peace and good order of the funeral ceremonies of our \nmilitary personnel.\n  The fact that funeral attendees are a captive audience also figures \ninto the analysis. In many locations, the Supreme Court expects \nindividuals simply to avoid speech they do not want to hear. But in the \ncase Frisby v. Schultz, the Supreme Court upheld an ordinance that made \nit unlawful to picket outside an individual's residence, stating: \n``That we are often `captives' outside the sanctuary of the home and \nsubject to objectionable speech. . . does not mean we must be captives \neverywhere.'' Like individuals in their homes and students in \nclassrooms, mourners at funeral ceremonies are bound to one location \nand cannot avoid those who intend to cause disruptions. And they should \nnot be forced to suffer those disruptions, especially during the one \nchance they have to lay a loved one rest.\n  The Respect for the Funerals of Fallen Heroes Act is content neutral. \nIts prohibitions apply to all offenders regardless of the nature of the \nmessage or the manner in which the message is conveyed. The legislation \nsimply aims to allow funerals to be conducted in peace.\n  Our bill is also narrowly tailored. Not every form of speech or \nactivity would be prohibited during the time period, only activities \nthat are intended to and have the effect of disturbing the funeral \nceremony. A person could carry on a conversation on a sidewalk nearby \nor hand out leaflets, but the peace and solemnity of the funeral must \nnot be disturbed.\n  This bill has been carefully drafted to withstand constitutional \nscrutiny. We sought the advice of distinguished First Amendment scholar \nGeoffrey Stone at the University of Chicago law school, and he believes \nthe bill is consistent with the First Amendment.\n  In addition, it is within the power of Congress to provide protection \nfor the funerals of fallen servicemembers and veterans that are held at \nnon-Federal cemeteries. The Congressional Research Service has \nresearched this issue and concluded that a court would likely deem our \nlegislation to be within Congress's lawmaking power, in light of \nCongress's constitutional authority to raise and support armies, and in \nlight of cases in which the Supreme Court has upheld Congress's power \nto regulate private property for the benefit of the military.\n  Our legislation is supported by veterans groups in Illinois and \nacross America. I received a letter from Retired U.S. Army Colonel \nAaron J. Wolff, President of the Illinois Council of Chapters of the \nMilitary Officers Association of America, who said: ``The Respect for \nAmerica's Fallen Heroes Act passed by Congress in May 2006, and signed \ninto law, was an initial step in stopping demonstrations at funerals of \nour fallen heroes.... On behalf of all veterans and their families, I \nstrongly support your bill to expand coverage of the demonstration ban \nto include all the funerals of our veterans, wherever they are held.''\n  Tanna K. Schmidli, chairman of the Board of Governors of the National \nMilitary Family Association, wrote to me and said: ``The National \nMilitary Family Association supports this legislation to ban \ndemonstrations at all military funerals. Grieving military families, \nwho had made the ultimate sacrifice, should not be subjected to these \nintrusions. This should be a time for military families to reflect and \nsay goodbye to their loved one and a time for the nation to honor its \nheroes.''\n  The men and women who served our country in uniform, and their \nfamilies and friends, are entitled to funeral ceremonies that can be \nconducted in peace and without disruption. It's time to protect the \nfunerals of all our fallen heroes. I hope that my colleagues from both \nparties will cosponsor this bill and join me in seeking to provide the \nprotection they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4042\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the United States courthouse located at \nthe intersections of Broad Street, Seventh Street, Grace Street, and \nEighth Street in Richmond, Virginia, as the ``Spottswood W. Robinson \nIII and Robert Merhige Jr. Courthouse''; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. WARNER. I rise today to join my colleague from Virginia, Senator \nAllen, in offering a bill to name the new Richmond Courthouse for two \ndistinguished jurists and sons of Virginia.\n\n[[Page S10747]]\n\nWe are privileged in the Commonwealth to have a long history, beginning \nwith Jamestown as the first permanent English settlement on the \nAmerican Continent. As a young republic, the College of William and \nMary was selected as a site for the Nation's first law school.\n  The two men to be honored in the naming of the new U.S. Courthouse in \nRichmond were lawyers who throughout their careers adhered to the \nprinciple of ``equal justice under law.''\n  Spottswood William Robinson, III was born in Richmond, VA on July 26, \n1916. He attended Virginia Union University and then attended Howard \nUniversity School of Law, graduating first in his class in 1939 and \nserving as a member of the faculty unti1 1947.\n  Judge Robinson was one of the core attorneys of the NAACP Legal \nDefense and Educational Fund from 1948 to 1960, achieving national \nprominence in the legal community with his representation of the \nVirginia plaintiffs in the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court case Brown v. Board \nof Education. Brown outlawed public school segregation declaring \n``separate but equal'' schools unconstitutional.\n  In 1964, Judge Robinson became the first African-American to be \nappointed to the United States District Court for the District of \nColumbia. In 1966, President Johnson appointed Judge Robinson the first \nAfrican-American to the United States Court of Appeals for the District \nof Columbia Circuit. On May 7, 1981, Judge Robinson became the first \nAfrican American to serve as Chief Judge of the District of Columbia \nCircuit.\n  Judge Merhige was born in New York in 1919 and he attended college at \nHigh Point College in North Carolina. He earned his law degree from the \nT.C. Williams School of Law at the University of Richmond, from which \nhe graduated at the top of his class in 1942.\n  From 1942 to 1945, Judge Merhige served in the United States Air \nForce and practiced law in Richmond from 1945 to 1967, establishing \nhimself as a formidable trial lawyer representing criminal defendants \nas well as dozens of insurance companies.\n  On August 30, 1967, Judge Merhige was appointed U.S. District Court \nJudge for the Eastern District of Virginia, Richmond Division by \nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson serving as a Federal judge unti1 1998. In \n1972, Judge Merhige ordered the desegregation of dozens of Virginia \nschool districts. He considered himself to be a ``strict \nconstructionist'' who went by the law as spelled out in precedents by \nthe higher courts. In 1970, he ordered the University of Virginia to \nadmit women. As evidence of Judge Merhige's ground breaking decisions, \nhe was given 24-hour protection by Federal marshals due to repeated \nthreats of violence against him and his family. His courage in the face \nof significant opposition of the times is a testimony to his dedication \nto the rule of law.\n  Senator Allen and I carefully took this responsibility in naming the \nU.S. Federal. Courthouse in Richmond. We worked on it for several years \nand consulted the Virginia Bar Association and sought the views of the \nbench and bar. The Virginia Congressional delegation, the Virginia Bar \nAssociation, the Mayor of Richmond, and many others decided that the \nbest way to honor both men was to have them equally share the honor of \nhaving the courthouse so named. I attach a letter from the former \nVirginia Governor, the current Mayor of Richmond, L. Douglas Wilder. I \nvalue greatly the views of a friend and fellow public servant and one \nwho has joined me on many issues to benefit the people of Virginia.\n  I thank the Senate for the consideration of this bill and look \nforward to working with my colleagues seeking its passage.\n\n                                             City of Richmond,\n\n                                 Richmond, VA, September 29, 2006.\n     Senator John Warner\n     225 Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Senator George Allen,\n     204 Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Warner and Allen: On behalf of the City of \n     Richmond, please accept this brief note in support of your \n     collective decision to name the new U.S. District Court in \n     Richmond for ``Spotswood W. Robinson III and Robert Merhige, \n     Jr.'' Both men played a significant role in Virginia's \n     history and are remembered as ``giants'' within Richmond's \n     legal community.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                L. Douglas Wilder,\n                                                            Mayor.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague the \nSenior Senator from Virginia John Warner in introducing legislation to \nname the new Federal courthouse in Richmond, VA for two great men and \nleaders of the civil rights movement, Spottswood W. Robinson III and \nRobert Merhige, Jr.\n  Judge Spottswood Robinson was a brilliant champion of civil rights \nfor all Americans. As a student at Howard Law School, Judge Spottswood \nW. Robinson III earned the highest GPA ever achieved at the law school. \nFollowing law school, he returned to Richmond, VA to establish a law \nfirm with another pioneer of civil rights, Oliver W. Hill. Through the \nyears he was involved in many important civil rights cases in State and \nFederal courts, but it was his vital role in the seminal case of Brown \nv. Board of Education that placed Judge Robinson into legal history. \nJudge Robinson is widely recognized as the architect of the legal \nstrategies that led to success in intergrading the nations public \nschools.\n  Judge Robinson left the private practice of law in 1960 to become \nDean of the Howard Law School. In October 1963, President Kennedy \nnominated him to become a District Court Judge for the District of \nColumbia. Subsequently, Judge Robinson became the first African-\nAmerican to serve as a Judge on the Court of Appeals for the District \nof Columbia and in 1981 became the Chief Judge for the Court. Upon \nretiring from the Court in 1992, Judge Robinson returned to his home in \nRichmond and continued to be an active member of the community until \nhis passing in 1998.\n  The other fine jurist who the new courthouse in Richmond will be \nnamed is another hero of the civil rights movement, Judge Robert R. \nMerhige, Jr. Judge Merhige served this country for 31 years on the \nbench and as a member of the United States Army Air Force as a B-17 \nbombardier. Born in 1919, Judge Merhige attended the T.C. Williams \nSchool of Law at the University of Richmond, from which he graduated at \nthe top of his class in 1942. Over the next 21 years, Judge Merhige \ntried hundreds of both criminal and civil cases in both State and \nFederal court. He served as President of the Richmond Bar Association \nfrom 1963 to 1964.\n  In 1967, President Lyndon Johnson appointed Judge Merhige to be a \nUnited States District Judge. Respected and admired by lawyers from \ncoast to coast, Judge Merhige became known for his integrity and \nintellect. Despite the personal hardship placed on both himself and his \nfamily from those who disagreed with his rulings to enforce civil \nrights law, Judge Merhige continued to uphold the law and follow the \nconstitution in the face of grave threats.\n  In deciding whom to name this courthouse after, I have taken great \ncare to listen to all Virginians after securing funds for this \nimpressive courthouse for downtown Richmond and its revitalization. I \nhave worked with the Virginia Congressional delegation, the \ndistinguished Mayor of Richmond, L. Douglas Wilder, State Senator \nBenjamin Lambert, the Virginia Bar Association, the Richmond Bar \nAssociation, and many others.\n  I am honored to join with my colleague Senator Warner in ensuring \nthat when people walk by the new Federal courthouse, they are reminded \nof these two distinguished jurists who helped change the face of \nsociety for the better with equal justice for all.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. DOLE:\n  S.J.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe joint resolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 41\n\n       Whereas Christmas trees have been sold commercially in the \n     United States since the 1850s;\n\n[[Page S10748]]\n\n       Whereas, by 1900, one in five American families decorated a \n     tree during the Christmas season, while, by 1930, a decorated \n     Christmas tree had become a nearly universal part of the \n     American Christmas celebration;\n       Whereas 32.8 million households in the United States \n     purchased a live-cut Christmas tree in 2005;\n       Whereas the placement and decoration of live-cut Christmas \n     trees in town squares across the country have become an \n     American tradition;\n       Whereas, for generations, American families have traveled \n     hundreds and even thousands of miles to celebrate the \n     Christmas season together around a live-cut Christmas tree;\n       Whereas 36 million live-cut Christmas trees are produced \n     each year, and 98 percent of these trees are shipped or sold \n     directly from Christmas tree farms;\n       Whereas North Carolina, Oregon, Michigan, Washington, \n     Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, New York, Minnesota, Virginia, \n     California, and Ohio are the top producers of live-cut \n     Christmas tree, but Christmas trees are grown in all 50 \n     States;\n       Whereas there are more than 21,000 growers of Christmas \n     trees in the United States, and approximately 100,000 people \n     are employed in the live-cut Christmas tree industry;\n       Whereas many Christmas tree growers grow trees on a part-\n     time basis to supplement their other farm and non-farm \n     income;\n       Whereas growing Christmas trees provides wildlife habitat;\n       Whereas more than a half million acres of land were planted \n     in Christmas trees in 2005;\n       Whereas 73 million new Christmas trees will be planted in \n     2006, and, on average, over 1,500 Christmas trees can be \n     planted per acre; and\n       Whereas the retail value of all Christmas trees harvested \n     in 2005 was $1.4 billion: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the important contributions of the live-cut \n     Christmas tree industry, Christmas tree growers, and persons \n     employed in the live-cut Christmas tree industry to the \n     United States economy; and\n       (2) urges the Secretary of Agriculture to establish \n     programs to raise awareness of the importance of the live-cut \n     Christmas tree industry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10748-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10748-S10749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 591--CALLING FOR THE STRENGTHENING OF THE EFFORTS OF \n   THE UNITED STATES TO DEFEAT THE TALIBAN AND TERRORIST NETWORKS IN \n    AFGHANISTAN AND TO HELP AFGHANISTAN DEVELOP LONG-TERM POLITICAL \n                   STABILITY AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Kerry) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 591\n\n       Whereas global terrorist networks, including those that \n     attacked the United States on September 11, 2001, continue to \n     threaten the security of the United States and are recruiting \n     new members and developing the capability and plans to attack \n     the United States and its allies throughout the world;\n       Whereas winning the fight against terrorist networks \n     requires a comprehensive and global effort;\n       Whereas, according to the Final Report of the National \n     Commission on the Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     ``The U.S. government must identify and prioritize actual or \n     potential terrorist sanctuaries. For each, it should have a \n     realistic strategy to keep possible terrorists insecure and \n     on the run, using all elements of national power.'';\n       Whereas a democratic, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan is \n     a vital security interest of the United States;\n       Whereas a strong and enduring strategic partnership between \n     the United States and Afghanistan must continue to be a \n     primary objective of both countries to advance a shared \n     vision of peace, freedom, security, and broad-based economic \n     development in Afghanistan and throughout the world;\n       Whereas the long-term political stability of Afghanistan \n     requires sustained economic development, and the United \n     States has an interest in helping Afghanistan achieve this \n     goal;\n       Whereas section 101(1) of the Afghanistan Freedom Support \n     Act of 2002 (22 U.S.C. 7511(1)) declares, ``The United States \n     and the international community should support efforts that \n     advance the development of democratic civil authorities and \n     institutions in Afghanistan and the establishment of a new \n     broad-based, multi-ethnic, gender-sensitive, and fully \n     representative government in Afghanistan.'';\n       Whereas the Government of Afghanistan continues to make \n     progress in developing the capacity to deliver services to \n     the people of Afghanistan, yet 40 percent of the population \n     is unemployed and 90 percent of the population lacks regular \n     electricity;\n       Whereas stability in Afghanistan is being threatened by \n     antigovernment and Taliban forces that seek to disrupt \n     political and economic developments throughout the country;\n       Whereas the Afghan National Army and the Afghan National \n     Police have made some progress but still lack the ability to \n     establish security throughout Afghanistan;\n       Whereas, despite the efforts of the international \n     community, the United Nations, and the Government of \n     Afghanistan, on September 2, 2006, the United Nations Office \n     on Drugs and Crime reported that in 2006 opium poppy \n     cultivation in Afghanistan increased 59 percent over 2005 \n     levels and reached a record high;\n       Whereas the number of attacks waged by the Taliban on \n     central, provincial, and local-level government officials and \n     establishments, the Afghan National Army, the Afghan National \n     Police, and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and \n     United States military personnel increased significantly \n     during 2006 over the number of such attacks that occurred \n     during 2005;\n       Whereas the number of suicide bombings in Afghanistan \n     doubled and the number of suicide attacks more than tripled \n     from 2005 to 2006;\n       Whereas the number of United States troops in Afghanistan \n     is approximately 23,000, approximately \\1/7\\ of the number of \n     troops currently in Iraq;\n       Whereas Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri are still at \n     large and have been reported to be somewhere in the \n     Afghanistan-Pakistan border region;\n       Whereas Afghan President Hamid Karzai said, ``The same \n     enemies that blew up themselves in . . . the twin towers in \n     America are still around.'';\n       Whereas, on September 12, 2006, the United States Secretary \n     of State said, ``[A]n Afghanistan that does not complete its \n     democratic evolution and become a stable terrorist-fighting \n     state is going to come back to haunt us. . . .

If we want \n     to succeed in Afghanistan, the answer is clear: Afghanistan \n     needs more sustained support from the international \n     community.'';\n       Whereas United States assistance to Afghanistan was cut by \n     approximately 30 percent in fiscal year 2006 and the \n     President's request for fiscal year 2007 cut that amount by \n     an additional 67 percent;\n       Whereas only 50 percent of the money pledged by the \n     international community for Afghanistan between 2002 and 2005 \n     has actually been delivered;\n       Whereas, on September 20, 2006, NATO's Supreme Allied \n     Commander for Europe said, ``Narcotics [are] at the core of \n     everything that can go wrong in Afghanistan if it's not \n     properly tackled.'' and ``We're not making progress--we're \n     losing ground.'';\n       Whereas, if the United States does not strengthen efforts \n     to defeat the Taliban and to create long-term stability in \n     Afghanistan and the region, Afghanistan will become what it \n     was before the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, a haven \n     for those who seek to harm the United States, and a source of \n     instability that threatens the security of the United States: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States must strengthen its commitment to \n     establishing long-term stability and peace in Afghanistan;\n       (2) the United States, in partnership with the \n     International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and the \n     Government of Afghanistan, must immediately increase its \n     efforts to eradicate the Taliban, terrorist organizations, \n     and criminal networks currently operating in Afghanistan, \n     including by increasing United States military and other \n     personnel and equipment in Afghanistan as necessary;\n       (3) the United States, in consultation with ISAF and the \n     Government of Afghanistan, should consider all options \n     necessary to implement a comprehensive new program to \n     eliminate opium production in Afghanistan, including sending \n     additional resources to Afghanistan and an increased role for \n     the United States military and North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organisation (NATO) forces in counternarcotics efforts;\n       (4) the United States should work aggressively to hold \n     members of the international community accountable for \n     delivering on the financial pledges they have made to support \n     development and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan;\n       (5) the United States and the international community, in \n     concert with the Government of Afghanistan, should increase \n     efforts to strengthen the legitimacy of the Government of \n     Afghanistan and its ability to provide services to the people \n     of Afghanistan;\n       (6) the United States, in support of the Government of \n     Afghanistan, should significantly increase the amount of \n     economic assistance available for reconstruction, social and \n     economic development, counternarcotics efforts, and democracy \n     promotion activities in Afghanistan;\n\n[[Page S10749]]\n\n       (7) the President, through the Secretary of State, should \n     develop a comprehensive interagency stabilization and \n     reconstruction strategy in coordination with the \n     international community and the Government of Afghanistan \n     that--\n       (A) aligns humanitarian, development, economic, political, \n     counterterrorism, and regional strategies to achieve the \n     objectives of the United States and Afghanistan in \n     Afghanistan;

which was:\n\n                               S. Res 596\n\n       Whereas there are more than 1,100,000 firefighters in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas approximately 75 percent of all firefighters in the \n     United States are volunteers who receive little or no \n     compensation for their heroic work;\n       Whereas there are more than 30,000 fire departments in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas thousands of firefighters have died in the line of \n     duty since the date that Benjamin Franklin founded the first \n     volunteer fire department in 1735;\n       Whereas 346 firefighters and emergency personnel died while \n     responding to the terrorist attacks that occurred on \n     September 11, 2001;\n       Whereas firefighters respond to more than 20,000,000 calls \n     during a typical year;\n       Whereas firefighters also provide emergency medical \n     services, hazardous materials response, special rescue \n     response, terrorism response, and life safety education;\n       Whereas, in 1922, President Harding declared the week of \n     October 9 to be ``Fire Prevention Week''; and\n       Whereas the second Tuesday in October is an appropriate day \n     for the establishment of a ``National Firefighter \n     Appreciation Day'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates Tuesday, October 10, \n     2006, as ``National Firefighter Appreciation Day'' to honor \n     and celebrate the firefighters of the United States.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, every year in the United States, over one \nmillion firefighters working with approximately thirty thousand fire \ndepartments risk their lives to protect our Nation. Nearly seventy-five \npercent of those firefighters are volunteers; they put their lives on \nthe line and get almost nothing in return. Volunteer and paid \nfirefighters alike are often forgotten until tragedy strikes and they \nvaliantly come to the rescue. I think that it is regrettable that many \nof us fail to recognize the sacrifice these brave men and women make \nevery day.\n  Therefore, today I submit a resolution to establish the first annual \nNational Firefighter Appreciation Day on October 10, 2006.\n  National Firefighter Appreciation Day will be a day for all Americans \nto take time to appreciate the firefighters in their communities. \nNational Firefighter Appreciation Day will fall on the second Tuesday \nin October, during Fire Prevention Week, which has been held over the \nweek of October ninth since 1922. I seek to have this day annually \ncelebrated on the second Tuesday in October for many years to come.\n  Firefighters are often the first responders at the scene of a \ndisaster. Their rigorous training and determination equip them to put \nout fires, provide first aid, and stabilize volatile situations. In \ntheir long shifts at the fire station, these strong men and women are \nprepared for disaster, large or small.\n  Firefighters also provide life safety education, installing fire \nalarms and distributing information on fire prevention, working to \nprevent disasters before they occur. One notable time that firefighters \nand fire marshals engage with the community is when they educate \nchildren about ways to prevent fires during Fire Prevention Week. Now, \nthese children will have a reminder on National Firefighter \nAppreciation Day to stop and thank the firefighters who protect them \nwhen the blazes get out of control.\n  In my State of Oklahoma we know the pain of dealing with loss from a \nterrorist attack and the importance of firefighters in the aftermath. \nIn 1995, when Timothy McVeigh bombed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal \nBuilding in Oklahoma City, 168 people lost their lives. Firefighters \nand everyday citizens bravely responded to this horrendous act. They \naccomplished the task of bringing out all victims from the building \nwithout loss of life or significant injury to the firefighters and \nrescue personnel. According to Oklahoma City National Memorial Museum, \nseventy-five fire departments across Oklahoma participated in the \nrescue recovery for fifteen days and fifteen hours. In addition, seven \nstates were represented with the FEMA emergency personnel that aided in \nrecovery. Sadly, ten of the firefighters that came to help were from \nNew York City and later died honorably in the September 11th attacks. \nThe entire world watched while every available resource of the city, \nstate, and federal government was mobilized to respond to the attack at \nthe Murrah building.\n  Most of us are aware of firefighters' efforts in such major \ndisasters. However, we often do not hear about their seemingly smaller \nacts of heroism. For example, two years ago firefighters in Oklahoma \nCity dove into an ice covered lake to save an eight-year-old boy who \nhad fallen through the ice. The boy had been treading water and holding \nonto the ice on the edge of the pond for 15 minutes before he was saved \nby the firefighters. Had he not been rescued by those men, this young \nboy would have probably died.\n  In a similar incident a few years before, firefighters responded to a \nsighting of two young brothers swept downstream in the waterway in \nOklahoma City. The rescuers had to take into account a number of \nfactors, including a very rapid current and the physical condition of \nthe boys, to rescue them from the water. Everyday, firefighters protect \nthe public and save lives.\n  Probably the most notable firefighter response of our time occurred \nin New York City after the September 11th terrorist attacks. In the \nmidst of a tragic situation, New York City firefighters rushed into the \nWorld Trade Center buildings to rescue those left inside. When the \nbuildings collapsed,\n\n[[Page S10751]]\n\nthey worked day and night to search for people in the rubble. In the \nend, 346 firefighters and emergency personnel lost their lives.\n  The heroism and bravery shown by the firefighters and rescue workers \nin the immediate aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks led \nConnor Gehraty, the son of a New York City firefighter who perished in \nthe rescue efforts after September 11th, to circulate via e-mail the \nidea of establishing a day to honor firefighters.\n  Connor has noted that there is substantial remembrance of events such \nas the Oklahoma City bombing and 9-11. Connor emphasizes that \nfirefighters deserve their own distinct day to be honored for the full \npanoply of their service. I agree.\n  Connor has worked diligently for five years to try to accomplish his \ngoal. My office was able to get in touch with him using Facebook, a \nnetworking website, and inform him of the plans to make his idea a \nreality with this resolution. He is very supportive of this \nlegislation.\n  The Oklahoma State Firefighters Association was also helpful with \nsuggestions in the drafting of this legislation. The Oklahoma State \nFirefighters Association (OSFA) has 14,000 members consisting of paid \n(union and non-union), volunteer, and retired firefighters. In addition \nto providing support, services, and events for firefighters in \nOklahoma, the OSFA oversees the Oklahoma Firefighters Museum and the \nOklahoma Fallen and Living Firefighters Memorial. I am pleased with the \ndedication of this organization and the positive role it plays in the \nlives of Oklahoma's firefighters. I appreciate their suggestions and \nsupport of this resolution.\n  The OSFA is one of many organizations of firefighters in Oklahoma and \naround the country that impress me.

Res. 597\n\n       Whereas, for almost 470 years, the United States has \n     benefitted from the work of Hispanic writers and publishers;\n       Whereas more than 600 Hispanic publishers circulate more \n     than 20,000,000 copies of publications every week in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas 1 out of every 8 citizens of the United States is \n     served by a Hispanic publisher;\n       Whereas the Hispanic press informs many citizens of the \n     United States about the great political, economic, and social \n     issues of the day;\n       Whereas the Hispanic press of the United States \n     particularly focuses on informing and promoting the well-\n     being of the Hispanic community of the United States; and\n       Whereas, by commemorating the achievements of the Hispanic \n     press, the Senate acknowledges the important role that the \n     Hispanic press has played in the history of the United \n     States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the period beginning on October 8, 2006, and \n     ending on October 14, 2006, as ``National Hispanic Media \n     Week'', in honor of the Hispanic Media of the United States; \n     and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the week with appropriate programs and activities.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to submit an important \nresolution designating October 8 through the 14 as National Hispanic \nMedia Week. I am joined by Senators Bingaman, Salazar, Martinez, and \nNelson of Florida in the introduction of this resolution.\n  This is the second year in which the Senate has designated a week to \nhonor the Hispanic media of America. An institution that can trace its \norigins to almost four hundred years ago, America's Hispanic \njournalists and publishers have worked tirelessly to promote the free \nand deliberative exchange of ideas. The Hispanic media has played an \nimportant role in protecting cherished freedoms and rights. They have \nalso worked to preserve our freedom of speech and have encouraged the \ngrowth of civic engagement in our nation's Hispanic community.\n  Since its early days, the Hispanic media has grown to serve a \npopulation exceeding 20 million people. In my home State of New Mexico, \napproximately 42 percent of the population is Hispanic. I know that \nmany of these individuals turn to Hispanic media for news and other \nimportant information. As such, I am honored to be able to support a \ngroup that is important to so many people in my home State and in our \ngreat nation.\n  This resolution calls on the American people to join with all \nchildren, families, organizations, communities, churches, cities, and \nstates across the Nation to observe the week with appropriate \nceremonies and activities.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join us in promptly passing this \nResolution designating October 8 through October 14 as National \nHispanic Media Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10751-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10751-S10753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 598--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING OCTOBER 15, 2006, \n                 AS ``NATIONAL CHARACTER COUNTS WEEK''\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \nAkaka, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Talent, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Criag, \nMr. Kerry, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Alexander, Mr. \nRockefeller, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Levin, Mr. Allen, Mr. Durbin, \nMr. Biden, Mr. Voinovich, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Dole, and Mr. Enzi) \nsubmitted the following resolution, which was:\n\n                              S. Res. 598\n\n       Whereas the well-being of the United States requires that \n     the young people of the United States become an involved, \n     caring citizenry with good character;\n       Whereas the character education of children has become more \n     urgent as violence by and against youth increasingly \n     threatens the physical and psychological well-being of the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families and their \n     communities, including schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions, and civic groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of its individual citizens;\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character and the positive \n     effects that good character can have in personal \n     relationships, in school, and in the workplace;\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and that, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by institutions and \n     individuals that influence youth to help young people develop \n     the essential traits and characteristics that comprise good \n     character;\n       Whereas, although character development is, first and \n     foremost, an obligation of families, the efforts of faith \n     communities, schools, and youth, civic, and human service \n     organizations also play an important role in fostering and \n     promoting good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth, and community leaders to recognize the importance of \n     character education in preparing young people to play a role \n     in determining the future of the United States;\n       Whereas effective character education is based on core \n     ethical values, which form the foundation of democratic \n     society;\n       Whereas examples of character are trustworthiness, respect, \n     responsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship, and honesty;\n       Whereas elements of character transcend cultural, \n     religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the character and conduct of our youth reflect the \n     character and conduct of society, and, therefore, every adult \n     has the responsibility to teach and model ethical values and \n     every social institution has the responsibility to promote \n     the development of good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages individuals and organizations, \n     especially those who have an interest in the education and \n     training of the young people of the United States, to adopt \n     the elements of character as intrinsic to the well-being of \n     individuals, communities, and society;\n       Whereas many schools in the United States recognize the \n     need, and have taken steps, to integrate the values of their \n     communities into their teaching activities; and\n\n[[Page S10752]]\n\n       Whereas the establishment of National Character Counts \n     Week, during which individuals, families, schools, youth \n     organizations, religious institutions, civic groups, and \n     other organizations would focus on character education, would \n     be of great benefit to the United States: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning October 15, 2006, as \n     ``National Character Counts Week''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States and \n     interested groups--\n       (A) to embrace the elements of character identified by \n     local schools and communities, such as trustworthiness, \n     respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship; \n     and\n       (B) to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, \n     programs, and activities.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend Senator \nDodd to submit a resolution designating the week of October 15 through \nthe 21 as the 2006 National Character Counts Week.\n  Our character is the foundation of who we are as people and how we \nare perceived by the world. Everyday our character and ethics are \ntested through the decisions we make and the behavior we exhibit. The \nNational Character Counts program focuses on ``Six Pillars of \nCharacter'' which are promoted through school and community based \ncharacter education programs across the country. The six pillars are: \ntrustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and \ncitizenship.\n  I have supported Character Counts throughout the years because I \nbelieve this program reaches out to all youth and adults, as the \nCharacter Counts Coalition states, no matter the individual's race, \ncreed, politics, gender, and wealth. In my home state of New Mexico, we \nhave run many successful Character Counts programs throughout the \nyears. While many schools initiate Character Counts programs there are \nalso many other organizations that develop character based programming. \nI would like to take the time to recognize some of the successful \nprogramming we have had in New Mexico for 2006.\n  Mesa Elementary School in Clovis, NM is the definition of a school \nthat embraces character education programming. Everyday school begins \nwith a Character Song and Pledge and every month they organize a \nCharacter Counts assembly to recognize and reflect upon the ``Six \nPillars of Character.'' In Gallup, the Gallup High School National \nHonor Society is distributing Character Counts posters to all faculty \nand staff and volunteering for a Youth Leadership Weekend. In Las \nCruces, the City of Las Cruces Recreation Section organized the K-8th \nbasketball leagues to participate in sportsmanship games and the \nhalftime show will spotlight Pursuing Victory with Honor. Lastly, the \nNew Mexico Women's Correctional Facility is gearing up to commence a \nCharacter Counts based series in their new character education \nprogramming. All of these organizations and schools as well as the many \nothers not mentioned here, are to be commended for their hard work in \ndeveloping these programs and spreading the message that character \ntruly does count.\n  During the week of October 15, I hope everyone takes the time to \nparticipate in a Character Counts event in their local area. I know in \nNew Mexico we will be having some special celebrations. On October 16 \nin Carlsbad, New Mexico there will be the 10th Anniversary Character \nCounts Celebration including a student-designed Character Counts \nbillboard unveiling at a celebratory dinner; October 17, the Las Cruces \nPublic Schools will have ``Go for the Gold'' Character Counts awards; \nOctober 19, the Albuquerque Public Schools will have a Character Counts \nannual awards breakfast, and Chavez County will have a Character Counts \nCelebration Night; and on October 20, the YMCA of Central New Mexico \nwill have a Youth Achiever Awards ceremony.\n  I believe this program is making a difference in my home state and \nacross the country. I want to encourage more people to become involved \nwith the Character Counts program, but most of all I hope individuals \nwill take the time to reflect on what the ``Six Pillars of Character'' \nmean to them.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will support this effort.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today Senator Domenici and I are submitting \na resolution designating the third week of October as ``National \nCharacter Counts Week.'' I have worked for many years on the issue of \ncharacter education and hope that by designating a special week to this \ncause, students and teachers will come together to participate in \ncharacter building activities in their schools not only this week but \nall year long.\n  In 1994, Senator Domenici and I first established the Partnerships in \nCharacter Education Pilot Project and have worked regularly since then \nto commemorate National Character Counts Week. Character education is \nabout celebrating what's right with young people while enabling them to \ndevelop the knowledge and life skills necessary in order to embrace \nethical and responsible behavior. I am pleased that we are continuing \nour efforts today to help expand States' and schools' abilities to make \ncharacter education a central part of every child's education.\n  Our schools may figuratively be built with the bricks of English, \nmath and science, but character education certainly provides the \nmortar. Trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and \ncitizenship are the six pillars of character. The standards of conduct \nthat arise out of those values constitute the foundation of ethics, and \ntherefore of ethical decision-making.\n  Character education looks like young people learning, growing, and \nbecoming. It feels like strength, courage, possibility, and hope. \nCharacter education provides students a context within which to learn. \nIf we view education simply as the imparting of knowledge to our \nchildren, then we will not only miss an opportunity, but will \njeopardize our future.\n  Currently, there are character education programs across all 50 \nstates in rural, urban and suburban areas at every grade level. I'd \nlike to take a moment to tell you about two programs in my home state \nof Connecticut.\n  At Jared Eliot Middle School in Clinton, CT, creating safe, welcoming \nschools where character matters is a high priority. Pillars showcasing \nthe principles of high character greet everyone who enters the building \nand are a vivid reminder of the values embraced by the school \ncommunity. This schoolwide effort is felt and lived by all who work and \nlearn there.\n  Also, Old Saybrook Middle School, a recognized middle school of the \nyear, is stellar in large part because of the ongoing schoolwide \ninitiative to focus on efforts to create a school climate that \ncelebrates individuals who exhibit high moral character and are engaged \nand connected to school. Parents are closely involved and support these \nefforts in uniquely high numbers. This dedicated school and its \ncommunity work hard to build a positive community through its character \neducation program, and has experienced great success socially and \nacademically because of it.\n\n  Character education programs work. Schools across the country that \nhave adopted strong character education programs report better student \nperformance, fewer discipline problems, and increased student \ninvolvement within the community. Children want direction--they want to \nbe taught right from wrong. Young people yearn for consistent adult \ninvolvement, and when they get it, according to surveys, they are less \ninclined to use illegal drugs, vandalize or commit suicide. The \nAmerican public wants character education in our schools, too. Studies \nshow that approximately 90 percent of Americans support schools \nteaching character education.\n  As all education policy should be, support of character education is \nbipartisan. This year we have cosponsors from both sides of the aisle. \nMany of our country's leading educational and youth-serving \norganizations also actively support character education, including \nYMCA, 4-H, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, Little League, the National \nEducation Association and the National Association of Secondary School \nPrincipals.\n  Character education can and is being incorporated into children's \nlives in and outside of the classroom. It provides a helping hand to \nour schools and communities to ensure our children's futures are bright \nand filled with opportunities and success. Character education not only \ncultivates minds, it nurtures hearts. While our children may be one-\nquarter of our population, they are 100 percent of our future.\n  I would submit that character transcends religious, cultural, \npolitical,\n\n[[Page S10753]]\n\nand socioeconomic barriers. I believe our country is having a renewed \nfocus on character and this sends a wonderful message to Americans, and \nwill help those of us involved in character education reinvigorate our \nefforts to get communities and schools involved.\n  So today, Senator Domenici and I introduce a resolution to accomplish \njust that and hopefully our renewed effort will bring together even \nmore communities to ensure that character education is a part of every \nchild's life. I hope that my colleagues will support this important \neffort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10753-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 599--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF OCTOBER 23, 2006, \n   THROUGH OCTOBER 27, 2006, AS ``NATIONAL CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING \n                           PREVENTION WEEK''\n\n  Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Lieberman, \nMr. Sarbanes, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Biden, Mr. Nelson of \nNebraska, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Wyden, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \nFeingold, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Carper, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Obama, \nMr. Chafee, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Levin, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. \nLincoln, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Bond, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Pryor, Ms. Snowe, Ms. \nLandrieu, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Specter, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Menendez, \nMrs. Boxer, and Mrs. Feinstein) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I would like to take this moment to \nhonor a dear friend and great legend who passed away on September 26, \n2006. Byron Nelson leaves behind a legacy as the ``lord'' of golf and a \ntrue gentleman, and he will be dearly missed.\n  Byron Nelson was born to a cotton farmer on February 4, 1912, in Long \nBranch, TX. At the age of 10, his golf career began as a caddy at the \nGlen Garden Country Club in Fort Worth. While at Glen Garden, Byron \nsharpened his skills and put them to the test in a number of \ncompetitions, even beating out another future golf legend, Ben Hogan, \nin a caddy tournament in 1927.\n  Facing the labor shortages of the Great Depression, Byron decided to \nturn professional in 1932 at the young age of 22. By 1937, he had won \nhis first Masters. In his 14 years as a professional, Byron won 54 \nsanctioned tournaments, including the Masters in 1937 and 1942, the \nU.S. Open in 1939, and the PGA Championship in 1940 and 1945.\n  As a hemophiliac, Byron was excused from military service during \nWorld War II, which allowed him time to perfect his game. In 1944, he \nwon 13 of the 23 tournaments he played, and in the following year won a \nrecord 18 times in 31 starts. During his record season of 1945, Byron \nreached what is widely considered the least attainable record in golf: \nan astounding 11 victories in a row with a season scoring average of \n68.33.\n  In 1946, Byron retired from the game of golf to his 673-acre ranch in \nRoanoke, TX. A true Texan, Byron had said throughout his career that \nhis incentive for playing well was that he ``could see the prize money \ngoing into the ranch, buying a tractor, or a cow.''\n  In 1974, he was rewarded by the golfing community for his efforts on \nthe course by being elected as an inaugural inductee into the World \nGolf Hall of Fame.\n  Always humble about his talent for the game of golf, Byron once said, \n``I know a little about golf. I know how to make stew. And I know how \nto be a decent man.'' Byron Nelson will not only be remembered for his \ngolf game, but also for his graciousness and humility. Through his \ninvolvement, the EDS Byron Nelson Championship has raised over $94 \nmillion for the Salesmanship Club Youth and Family Centers, which has \ncontributed more money for charity than any other event on the PGA \nTour. Additionally, since 1983, the Byron and Louise Nelson Golf \nEndowment Fund has provided over $1.5 million in endowment funds to \nAbilene Christian University in Abilene, Texas.\n  Today we honor Byron Nelson and his outstanding achievements both on \nand off the golf course. My prayers go out to his wife, Peggy, and the \nNelson family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10754-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10754]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 603--DESIGNATING THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 2006, AS \n                          ``FEED AMERICA DAY''\n\n  Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Bennett) submitted the following \nresolution; which was:\n\n                              S. Res. 603\n\n       Whereas Thanksgiving Day celebrates the spirit of selfless \n     giving and an appreciation for family and friends;\n       Whereas the spirit of Thanksgiving Day is a virtue upon \n     which the United States was founded;\n       Whereas, in 2006, great numbers of citizens of the United \n     States continue to suffer hunger and other privations; and\n       Whereas selfless sacrifice breeds a genuine spirit of \n     Thanksgiving, both affirming and restoring the fundamental \n     principles of the society of the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates Thursday, November 16, 2006, as ``Feed \n     America Day''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States--\n       (A) to sacrifice 2 meals on Thursday, November 16, 2006; \n     and\n       (B) to donate to a religious or charitable organization of \n     their choice the money that they would have spent on food for \n     that day for the purpose of feeding the hungry.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution that would \ndesignate Thursday, November 16, 2006, as ``Feed America Day.''\n  The United States today is marked by an economic prosperity \nunparalleled in the world. Every year we gather together as family and \nfriends in a great Thanksgiving feast to celebrate the goodness of God \nand the bounty that He has provided us. Unfortunately, not all in this \nworld participate in this bounty. There are thousands among us who \nsuffer from hunger and want, including far too many children.\n  Hunger was something our forefathers who instituted the first \nThanksgiving feast understood all too well. Nearly half of the small \nband of Pilgrims who first arrived upon the bleak shores of Plymouth on \nDecember 11, 1620, perished from hunger and sickness that first winter. \nIt was only through the generosity and goodwill of friendly native \ninhabitants that the Pilgrims were able to become self-sufficient and \nenjoy a bountiful harvest the following year.\n  It is with a sincere desire that others may partake of our plenty, \nthat I offer this resolution designating Thursday, November 15, 2006, \nas ``Feed America Day''. That day, before we sit down to our own feasts \nof thanksgiving, I ask that all Americans share their food with their \nneighbors just as the Pilgrims and the Indians shared with one another, \nand all were able to sit down and rejoice together.\n  The concept of Feed America Day is very simple. On the Thursday \nbefore Thanksgiving, I urge every American who is able to fast for two \nmeals and give the money saved to a church or charitable organization \nengaged in feeding the hungry. Fasting means to go without food for a \nhigher purpose. What higher purpose could there be than to share our \nblessings with those in need? As we feel the hunger for a brief time \nthat so many in the world experience every day, we become more \nsensitive to the needs of others. And this strengthened generosity of \nspirit will reverberate throughout our Nation and the world.\n  Sarah Josepha Hale, recognized as the Mother of the American \nThanksgiving, engaged in a nearly 40-year campaign to have Thanksgiving \naccepted as a national holiday. She summed up her vision for this \nholiday in one of her many editorials on the subject published in the \nwomen's magazine she headed for many years. She wrote, ``Let us \nconsecrate the day to benevolence of action, by sending good gifts to \nthe poor, and doing those deeds of charity that will, for one day, make \nevery American home the place of plenty and of rejoicing. . . . Let the \npeople of all the States and Territories sit down together to the \n`feast of fat things,' and drink in the sweet draught of joy and \ngratitude to the Divine giver of all our blessings, . . .''\n   This is the purpose of Feed America Day.\n  Through this program of fasting and charity, we as a nation can truly \nembody the spirit of Thanksgiving that was amply demonstrated for us \nbetween the first European settlers to this land and its native \ninhabitants in 1621, and later urged by Mrs. Hale.\n  I urge my colleagues to support ``Feed America Day''. It is my belief \nthat participating in such selfless sacrifice will breed a genuine \nspirit of Thanksgiving, affirming and restoring the fundamental \nprinciples that form the foundation of the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10754-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10754-S10755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 604--RECOGNIZING THE WORK AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF MR. \n  BRITT ``MAX'' MAYFIELD, DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER'S \n             TROPICAL PREDICTION CENTER UPON HIS RETIREMENT\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Inouye, Ms. \nLandrieu, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Shelby, Mr. DeMint, \nMr. Cochran,\n\n[[Page S10755]]\n\nand Mr. Martinez) submitted the following resolution; which was:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a bipartisan \nresolution recognizing the contributions of Hispanic Serving \nInstitutions, and the 20 years of educational endeavors provided by The \nHispanic Association of Colleges and Universities.\n  Today, there are currently 202 Hispanic Serving Institutions in the \nUnited States enrolling nearly half of all Hispanic students in \ncollege. I take pride in noting that The Hispanic Association of \nColleges and Universities was founded in my home state of Texas. From \nits beginning in the City of San Antonio, the Association has grown \nfrom 18 colleges and universities to now recognizing more than 400 \nUnited States colleges and universities as Hispanic Serving \nInstitutions, associate members, and partners.\n  The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities strives to \npromote academic success for Hispanic students in higher education. \nThis aspiration is continually met in the United States as the \nAssociation is the only national education entity that represents \nHispanic Serving Institutions. Though focused on the U.S., the \nAssociation is also pursuing this goal of high standards in education \nby expanding even beyond our borders to 45 colleges and universities in \nLatin America, Spain and Portugal.\n  Education offers greater opportunity for every individual, and I \ncommend the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities for their \nwork in developing and enhancing Hispanic Serving Institutions in order \nto provide a quality higher education experience for Hispanics and \nother students who attend these institutions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10757-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 609--HONORING THE CHILDREN'S CHARITIES, YOUTH-SERVING \n  ORGANIZATIONS, AND OTHER NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS COMMITTED TO \nENRICHING AND BETTERING THE LIVES OF CHILDREN AND DESIGNATING THE WEEK \n           OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2006, AS ``CHILD AWARENESS WEEK''\n\n  Mr. BURR (for himself, Mr. Alexander, and Mr. Isakson) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, as many of my colleagues are aware, we \nhave been engaged in a long fight to bring international fishing up to \nthe standards we have here in the United States under the Magnuson \nStevens Act. The Senate passed this important measure by unanimous \nconsent this past June. One of the most important sections of the bill \ndeals with destructive fishing practices conducted by foreign vessels \non the high seas that are not subject to any kind of international \nregulation and control.\n  The high seas comprise more than half of the planet's surface, yet \nonly 25 percent of this area is regulated by any regional fishery \nmanagement organization. Management of fishing on the high seas is \npatchy at best. Some areas like the donut hole in the Bering Sea off my \nState of Alaska have adopted strict and effective management measures. \nHowever, too many areas have not, and without an effective management \nregime, destructive fishing practices will continue to be conducted by \nforeign fleets.\n  In the United States our fishermen must adhere to an extensive set of \nmanagement and conservation requirements which are laid out in the \nMagnuson Stevens Act. The eight regional councils located around the \nUnited States and the Caribbean Islands are a model of innovative and \neffective management approaches.\n  In contrast, management internationally and especially with respect \nto high seas bottom trawling is sadly lacking. Illegal, unreported and \nunregulated fishing as well as expanding industrial foreign fleets and \nhigh bycatch levels are monumental threats to sustainable fisheries \nworldwide. These unsustainable and destructive fishing practices on the \nhigh seas threaten the good management that takes place in U.S. waters.\n  One of the proudest moments of my Senate career was going to the \nUnited Nations to fight and end the use of large scale driftnets on the \nhigh seas. We now have the opportunity to influence the effects of \nunregulated high seas bottom trawling. The outlines of an agreement on \nunregulated bottom trawling on the high seas will be discussed at the \nUN beginning on October 4th. There is clear political consensus that \naction is needed and the United States should take the lead in \nprotecting our oceans.\n  The bipartisan resolution I am introducing today with our co-chairman \nSenator Inouye and 16 other Senators calls on the United Nations to put \nan end to unregulated fishing practices on the high seas. It is my hope \nthat the United States will work to secure adoption of a United Nations \nGeneral Assembly Resolution calling on nations to stop their vessels \nfrom conducting illegal, unreported, and unregulated destructive high \nseas bottom trawling until conservation and management measures to \nregulate it are adopted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10758-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 611--SUPPORTING THE EFFORTS OF THE INDEPENDENT \n NATIONAL ELECTORAL COMMISSION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIA, POLITICAL \n  PARTIES, CIVIL SOCIETY, RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS, AND THE PEOPLE OF \n   NIGERIA FROM ONE CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT TO ANOTHER INTO THE GENERAL \n                   ELECTIONS TO BE HELD IN APRIL 2007\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Hagel, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. DeWine) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was:\n\n                              S.

Res. 121\n\n       Whereas, in the Fatherhood Program provided for in section \n     119 of H.R. 240, as introduced in the House of \n     Representatives on January 4, 2005, it states that--\n       (1) in approximately 84 percent of the cases where a parent \n     is absent, that parent is the father;\n       (2) if current trends continue, half of all children born \n     today will live apart from one of their parents, usually \n     their father, at some point before they turn 18 years old;\n       (3) where families (whether intact or with a parent absent) \n     are living in poverty, a significant factor is the father's \n     lack of job skills;\n       (4) committed and responsible fathering during infancy and \n     early childhood contributes to the development of emotional \n     security, curiosity, and math and verbal skills;\n       (5) an estimated 19,400,000 children (27 percent) live \n     apart from their biological fathers; and\n       (6) 40 percent of the children under age 18 not living with \n     their biological fathers had\n\n[[Page S10759]]\n\n     not seen their fathers even once in the past 12 months, \n     according to national survey data;\n       Whereas single parents are to be commended for the \n     tremendous job that they do with their children;\n       Whereas the United States needs to encourage responsible \n     parenting by both fathers and mothers, whenever possible;\n       Whereas the United States needs to encourage both parents, \n     as well as extended families, to be actively involved in \n     children's lives;\n       Whereas a way to encourage active involvement is to \n     encourage joint custody and shared parenting;\n       Whereas the American Bar Association found in 1997 that 19 \n     States plus the District of Columbia had some form of \n     presumption for joint custody, either legal, physical, or \n     both, and by 2006, 13 additional States had added some form \n     of presumption, bringing the current total to 32 States plus \n     the District of Columbia;\n       Whereas data from the Census Bureau shows a correlation \n     between joint custody and shared parenting and a higher rate \n     of payment of child support;\n       Whereas social science literature shows that a higher \n     proportion of children from intact families with two parents \n     in the home are well adjusted, and research also shows that \n     for children of divorced, separated, and never married \n     parents, joint custody is strongly associated with positive \n     outcomes for children on important measures of adjustment and \n     well being; and\n       Whereas research by the Department of Health and Human \n     Services shows that the States with the highest amount of \n     joint custody subsequently had the lowest divorce rate: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that joint \n     custody laws for fit parents should be passed by each State, \n     so that more children are raised with the benefits of having \n     a father and a mother in their lives.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to submit legislation \nexpressing the sense of the Congress that States should enact joint \ncustody laws for fit parents, so that more children are raised with the \nbenefit of having both parents in their lives.\n  One of the most significant problems facing our Nation today is the \nnumber of children being raised without the love and support of both \nparents. Even if it is not possible for the parents to remain in a \ncommitted partnership, it is important that, when possible, each parent \nas well as their extended families have every opportunity to play an \nactive role in their children's life. A number of recent studies have \nsuggested that children greatly benefit from joint custody or shared \nparenting arrangements. In my own home State of Hawaii, it is a way of \nlife to have our keiki, or children, raised and nurtured by the \nextended family and we have seen how our children flourish when the \nresponsibility of child rearing is shared.\n  This Nation's children are our most vital resource and every effort \nshould be made to ensure that they receive the guidance and \nencouragement they need to thrive. I urge States to pass joint custody \nlaws for fit parents so all children can be raised within the extended \nembrace of both parents and their families.\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 5107.

The treaties will be considered to have passed through \ntheir various parliamentary stages up to and including the presentation \nof the resolution of ratification, which the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Protocal additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August \n     1949, and relating to the adoption of an additional \n     Distinctive Emblem (Treaty Document 109-10(A))\n       Extradition Treaty with United Kingdom (Treaty Document \n     108-23)\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask for a division on the resolutions of \nratification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A division has been requested.\n  Senators in favor of the ratification of these treaties, please rise.\n  Those opposed will rise and stand until counted.\n  With two-thirds of the Senators present having voted in the \naffirmative, the resolutions of ratification are agreed to.\n  The resolutions of ratification are as follows:\n\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and \n Relating to the Adoption of an Additional Distinctive Emblem (Treaty \n                            Doc. 109-10(A))\n\n       Resolved, (two-thirds of the Senators present concurring \n     therein), That the Senate advises\n\n[[Page S10767]]\n\n     and consents to the ratification of the Protocol Additional \n     to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to \n     the Adoption of an Additional Distinctive Emblem, adopted at \n     Geneva on December 8, 2005, and signed by the United States \n     on that date (Treaty Doc. 109-10A).\n\n      Extradition Treaty With United Kingdom (Treaty Doc. 108-23)\n\n       Resolved (two-thirds of the Senators present concurring \n     therein), \n       Section 1. Senate Advice and Consent Subject to \n     Understanding, Declarations, and Provisos\n       The Senate advises and consents to the ratification of the \n     Extradition Treaty between the United States of America and \n     the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and \n     related exchanges of letters, signed at Washington on March \n     31, 2003 (hereinafter in this resolution referred to as the \n     ``Treaty'') (Treaty Doc. 108-23), subject to the \n     understanding in section 2, the declarations in section 3, \n     and the provisos in section 4.\n       Section 2. Understanding\n       The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is \n     subject to the following understanding:\n       Under United States law, a United States judge makes a \n     certification of extraditability of a fugitive to the \n     Secretary of State. In the process of making such \n     certification, a United States judge also makes \n     determinations regarding the application of the political \n     offense exception. Accordingly, the United States of America \n     understands that the statement in paragraphs 3 and 4 of \n     Article 4 that ``in the United States, the executive branch \n     is the competent authority for the purposes of this Article'' \n     applies only to those specific paragraphs of Article 4, and \n     does not alter or affect the role of the United States \n     judiciary in making certifications of extraditability or \n     determinations of the application of the political offense \n     exception.\n       Section 3. Declarations\n       The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is \n     subject to the following declarations:\n       (1) Nothing in the Treaty requires or authorizes \n     legislation or other action by the United States of America \n     that is prohibited by the Constitution of the United States.\n       (2) The Treaty shall be implemented by the United States in \n     accordance with the Constitution of the United States and \n     relevant federal law, including the requirement of a judicial \n     determination of extraditability that is set forth in Title \n     18 of the United States Code.\n       Section 4. Provisos\n       The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is \n     subject to the following provisos:\n       (1)(A) The Senate is aware that concerns have been \n     expressed that the purpose of the Treaty is to seek the \n     extradition of individuals involved in offenses relating to \n     the conflict in Northern Ireland prior to the Belfast \n     Agreement of April 10, 1998. The Senate understands that the \n     purpose of the Treaty is to strengthen law enforcement \n     cooperation between the United States and the United Kingdom \n     by modernizing the extradition process for all serious \n     offenses and that the Treaty is not intended to reopen issues \n     addressed in the Belfast Agreement, or to impede any further \n     efforts to resolve the conflict in Northern Ireland.\n       (B) Accordingly, the Senate notes with approval--\n       (i) the statement of the United Kingdom Secretary of State \n     for Northern Ireland, made on September 29, 2000, that the \n     United Kingdom does not intend to seek the extradition of \n     individuals who appear to qualify for early release under the \n     Belfast Agreement;\n       (ii) the letter from the United Kingdom Home Secretary to \n     the United States Attorney General in March 2006, emphasizing \n     that the ``new treaty does not change this position in any \n     way,'' and making clear that the United Kingdom ``want[s] to \n     address the anomalous position of those suspected but not yet \n     convicted of terrorism-related offences committed before the \n     Belfast Agreement''; and\n       (iii) that these policies were reconfirmed in an exchange \n     of letters between the United Kingdom Secretary of State for \n     Northern Ireland and the United States Attorney General in \n     September 2006.\n       (2) The Senate notes that, as in other recent United States \n     extradition treaties, the Treaty does not address the \n     situation where the fugitive is sought for trial on an \n     offense for which he had previously been acquitted in the \n     Requesting State. The Senate further notes that a United \n     Kingdom domestic law may allow for the retrial in the United \n     Kingdom, in certain limited circumstances, of an individual \n     who has previously been tried and acquitted in that country. \n     In this regard, the Senate understands that under U.S. law \n     and practice a person sought for extradition can present a \n     claim to the Secretary of State that an aspect of foreign law \n     that may permit retrial may result in an unfairness that the \n     Secretary could conclude warrants denial of the extradition \n     request. The Senate urges the Secretary of State to review \n     carefully any such claims made involving a request for \n     extradition that implicates this provision of United Kingdom \n     domestic law.\n       (3) Not later than one year after entry into force of the \n     Treaty, and annually thereafter for a period of four \n     additional years, the Secretary of State shall submit to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate a report setting \n     forth the following information with respect to the \n     implementation of the Treaty in the previous twelve months:\n       (A) the number of persons arrested in the United States \n     pursuant to requests from the United Kingdom under the \n     Treaty, including the number of persons subject to \n     provisional arrest; and a summary description of the alleged \n     conduct for which the United Kingdom is seeking extradition;\n       (B) the number of extradition requests granted; and the \n     number of extradition requests denied, including whether the \n     request was denied as a result of a judicial decision or a \n     decision of the Secretary of State;\n       (C) the number of instances the person sought for \n     extradition made a claim to the Secretary of State of \n     political motivation, unjustifiable delay, or retrial after \n     acquittal and whether such extradition requests were denied \n     or granted; and\n       (D) the number of instances the Secretary granted a request \n     under Article 18(1)(c).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10767-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The messages of the President are as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty between the \nUnited States of America and the Government of the Republic of Latvia, \nsigned on December 7, 2005, at Riga. I also transmit, for the \ninformation of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with \nrespect to the treaty.\n  The new extradition treaty with Latvia would replace the outdated \nextradition treaty between the United States and Latvia, signed on \nOctober 16, 1923, at Riga, and the Supplementary Extradition Treaty, \nsigned on October 10, 1934, at Washington. The treaty also fulfills the \nrequirement for a bilateral instrument between the United States and \neach European Union (EU) Member State in order to implement the \nExtradition Agreement between the United States and the EU. Two other \ncomprehensive new extradition treaties with EU Member States--Estonia \nand Malta--likewise also serve as the requisite bilateral instruments \npursuant to the U.S.-EU Agreement, and therefore also are being \nsubmitted separately and individually.\n  The treaty follows generally the form and content of other \nextradition treaties recently concluded by the United States. It would \nreplace an outmoded list of extraditable offenses with a modern ``dual \ncriminality'' approach, which would enable extradition for such \noffenses as money laundering and other newer offenses not appearing on \nthe list. The treaty also contains a modernized ``political offense'' \nclause. It further provides that extradition shall not be refused based \non the nationality of the person sought; in the past, Latvia has \ndeclined to extradite its nationals to the United States. A national \nwho has been convicted in the courts of the other Party may request to \nbe allowed to serve the resulting sentence in his state of nationality. \nFinally, the new treaty incorporates a series of procedural \nimprovements to streamline and speed the extradition process.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe treaty.\n                                                      George W.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 6197 which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6197) to amend the Older Americans Act of 1965 \n     to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2007 through \n     2011, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to the consideration \nof the bill.\n\n\n                           Funds Distribution\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today I would like to talk about a very \nimportant piece of legislation sent over by the House of \nRepresentatives to the Senate last night. The Older Americans Act \nAmendments of 2006 will reauthorize the vital programs to assist the \nquickly growing elder population. During the reauthorization it became \napparent that the elderly population is growing more quickly in certain \nareas than others. This was highlighted in newspaper articles this week \nand has been a key issue for my colleague from North Carolina.\n  In light of this, I propose that the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions hold hearings during the coming Congress to review \nformulas for federal programs and how those formulas are developed to \ndetermine the fair and equitable distribution of funds. The committee \nwill focus its attention on how funds must follow the people and the \nneed. In other words, how do we make sure that federal monies are going \nto the areas of greatest need which are in many instances the fast \ngrowing areas of our country and how do we eliminate inequities in \nfunding that exist under current formulas and which in many instances \ndisadvantage high-growth states. Finally, I propose that the committee \nbegin its reauthorization of the Older Americans Act no later than 3 \nyears after the passage of this bill.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the HELP Committee \nand strongly support his proposals to focus the attention of the \ncommittee on how formulas for federal programs, like the Older \nAmericans Act, are developed. The money should follow the people and \ntheir need. With respect to the Older Americans Act, I represent the \nseventh fastest growing state in the Nation and among that growing \npopulation is a quickly growing elderly population. The funds from this \nact are vital to supporting the services and infrastructure to assist \nNorth Carolina to serve our elderly population today and in the future. \nI also thank the chairman for addressing the next reauthorization \nwithin the 3 years after we pass this bill before us.\n  Mr. ENZI. I would like to thank my colleague from North Carolina for \nhis support of our bill. He was very important in the drafting of this \nlegislation. I urge my colleagues to support us in this important \nlegislation for our growing elderly population and to work with Senator \nBurr and me, in the coming Congress, to ensure that federal funds \nfollow the need and their intended recipients.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the passage of the Older \nAmericans Act Amendments of 2006. I am pleased at the support that this \nbill has received in the Senate and in the House. I especially want to \nthank Senator Kennedy, the ranking member of the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions. In particular, I thank Senator DeWine, \nthe chairman of the Subcommittee on Retirement Security and Aging. \nSenator DeWine provided immeasurable leadership in the passage of these \namendments, as did Senator Mikulski, the subcommittee ranking member. \nIn addition, I thank the members of the House Committee on Education \nand the Workforce for their diligence in moving forward with this \nlegislation: Representative Buck McKeon, Chairman; Representative \nGeorge Miller, ranking member; Representative Patrick J. Tiberi, \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Select Education; and Representative \nRuben Hinojosa, subcommittee ranking member.\n  The Older Americans Act Amendments of 2006 is the primary source for \nthe delivery of social and nutrition services for older individuals. \nEnacted in 1965, the act's programs include supportive services, \ncongregate and home-delivered nutrition services, community service \nemployment, the long-term care ombudsman program, and services to \nprevent the abuse, neglect and exploitation of older individuals. The \nact also provides grants to Native Americans and research, training, \nand demonstration activities.\n  Title I of the Older Americans Act sets broad social policy \nobjectives to improve the lives of all older Americans. It recognizes \nthe need for an adequate income in retirement, and the importance of \nphysical and mental health, employment in community services for older \nindividuals and long-term care services.\n  Title II establishes the Administration on Aging, AOA, within the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to be fhe primary Federal \nadvocate for older individuals and to administer the provision of the \nOlder Americans Act. It also establishes the National Eldercare Locator \nService to provide nationwide information with regard to resources for \nolder individuals; the National Long-term Care Ombudsman Resource \nCenter; the National Center on Elder Abuse; the National Aging \nInformation Center; and the Pension Counseling and Information Program. \nThe\n\n[[Page S10771]]\n\n2006 amendments authorize the designation of a person to have \nresponsibility for elder abuse prevention to develop a long-term plan \nand national response to elder abuse prevention, detection, treatment, \nand intervention. It also authorizes the Assistant Secretary to \ndesignate an individual to be responsible for administration of mental \nhealth services and authorizes Aging and Disability Resource Centers. \nFurther, the 2006 Amendments strengthen the leadership of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services through an interagency \ncoordinating committee to guide policy and program development across \nthe Federal Government with respect to aging and demographic changes.\n  Title III authorizes grants to fund 655 area agencies on aging and \nmore than 29,000 service providers nationwide. Title III services are \ntargeted to those with the greatest economic and social need, \nparticularly low-income minority persons and older individuals residing \nin rural communities. The 2006 amendments will authorize organizations \nwith experience in providing volunteer opportunities for older \nindividuals to be eligible to enter cooperative arrangements; require \nstate agencies to promote the development and implementation of state \nsystems that enable older individuals to receive long-term care and \ncommunity-based settings in accordance with needs and preferences; \nencourage both States and area agencies on aging to plan for population \nchanges; improve access to supportive services that help foster \nindependence; require nutrition projects to prepare meals that comply \nwith the most recent Dietary Guidelines; and reauthorize the National \nFamily Caregiver Support Program.\n  Title IV supports a wide range of ongoing research and demonstration \nactivities that will enhance innovation, identify best practices and \nprovide technical assistance for older individuals. The 2006 Amendments \nwill permit competitive grants for planning activities that will \nbenefit the aging population; assessment of technology-based models to \naid in remote health monitoring systems, communication devices and \nassistive technologies. Further, it includes Hispanic serving \ninstitutions among those eligible to compete for grants to provide \neducation and training in the field of aging; reauthorizes grants to \nimprove transportation services for older individuals; ensures \nincreased awareness of mental health disorders among older individuals; \nand authorizes development of innovative models of service delivery to \nensure older individuals may age in place, as they are able and as they \nchoose.\n\n  Title V authorizes the community service employment program for older \nAmericans--known as the Senior Community Service Employment, or SCSEP--\nto promote part-time opportunities in community service for unemployed, \nlow-income persons who are 55 years or older and who have poor \nemployment prospects. It is administered by the Department of Labor. \nThis program represents approximately one-quarter of Older Americans \nAct funds--$432 million out of $1.78 billion in fiscal year 2006. This \nprogram is operated by States and national grantees awarded competitive \ngrants and supported 61,050 jobs and served approximately 91,500 \nindividuals in fiscal year 2005. The 2006 amendments establish 4-year \ngrant cycles for the competitive program and prohibit poor performing \ngrantees from competing during the next grant cycle. It expends \nparticipation for eligible individuals who are underemployed and \nestablishes a 48-month time limit for participation in the program with \na waiver for particularly hard-to-serve individuals. It establishes an \noverall grantee average participation cap of up to 27 months and \nauthorizes a waiver of up to 36 months.\n  Title VI provides funds for supportive and nutrition services for \nolder Native Americans. The 2006 amendments will provide increase the \nNative American caregiver support program through 2011. Also, Title VII \nauthorizes programs for the long-term care ombudsman, elder abuse, \nneglect and exploitation prevention, legal service developers and \nvulnerable Native American elder rights. The 2006 amendments will \nenhance the elder abuse prevention activities by awarding grants to \nStates and Indian tribes to enable them to strengthen long-term care \nand provide assistance for elder justice and elder abuse prevention \nprograms. It will create grants for prevention, detection, assessment, \ntreatment of, intervention in, investigation of, and response to elder \nabuse; safe havens demonstrations for older individuals; volunteer \nprograms; multidisciplinary activities; elder fatality and serious \ninjury review teams; programs for underserved populations; incentives \nfor longterm care facilities to train and retain employees; and other \ncollaborative and innovative approaches.\n\n  Finally, the National Resource Center for Women and Retirement is a \nhighly successful program run by the Women's Institute for a Secure \nRetirement''--WISER--a nonprofit organization dedicated to ensuring the \nsecurity of women's retirement income through outreach, partnerships, \nand policy development. We know that many older Americans lack \nfinancial knowledge, and that financial education is needed. This \nprogram provides a helpful service and should continue to be funded so \nas to expand its various programs for older Americans, including \nfinancial literacy.\n  The proportion of the population aged 60 and over will increase \ndramatically over the next 30 years as more than 78 million baby \nboomers approach, or have already reached, retirement. It is essential \nthat in the coming years Congress and the Federal Government take a \nleadership role in assisting the States in addressing the needs of \nolder Americans. The bill we offer today will ensure that our Nation's \nolder Americans are healthy, fed, housed, able to get where they need \nto go and safe from abuse and scams. The number one resolution of the \n2005 White House Conference on Aging called upon Congress to \nreauthorize the Older Americans Act during the 109th Congress. I am \npleased that the Senate and the House are accomplishing this goal on \nbehalf of one of our Nation's greatest resources--our older Americans.\n  Before closing, I want to thank certain staff of the committee for \ntheir hard work and long hours in making this reauthorization a \nreality. I would especially like to thank the following staff members: \nKatherine McGuire, Ilyse Schuman, Greg Dean, Lindsay Morris, Karla \nCarpenter, Kori Forster, Lauren Fuller, Michelle Dirst, Brittany Moore \nand Will Green. Also, I would like to thank the many others who have \nsupported this effort, including Carol O'Shaughnessy and Richard \nRimkunas of the Congressional Research Service, and most notably the \nwork of Liz King in the Senate's Office of Legislative Counsel in \nsupporting the drafting of this legislation. Also, I thank the work of \nthe many staff on the other side of the aisle for their contributions \ntoward passage of the bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation in light of the \ngrowing needs of our population to ensure that the services they need \nin the coming years are available to them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10771-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10771-S10778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 OLDER AMERICANS ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2006\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Chairman Enzi, Senator DeWine, \nSenator Mikulski, Chairman McKeon, Representative Tiberi, \nRepresentative Miller, and Representative Hinojosa for their bipartisan \nleadership in reauthorization the Older Americans Act. It's been a \nlifeline for senior citizens across the country for 40 years, and all \nof us want it to continue to fullfill its important mission in the \nyears ahead.\n  Like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the Older Americans Act \nis part of our commitment to care for the Nation's seniors in their \ngolden years.\n  Last year, 1,200 bi-partisan delegates were chosen by the Governors \nof all 50 states, the District of Columbia and the Territories to \nattend the first White House Conference on Aging since 1985. Over the \nyears these conferences have served as catalysts for change, and this \nconference was no different. The delegates called for reauthorization \nof the Older Americans Act as their No. 1 priority and I'm pleased that \nCongress has answered their call.\n  As we all know, the baby boomer generation is retiring. One in nine \nAmericans are over age 65 today, but by the year 2030, the number will \nbe one in five.\n  Our authorization bill is designed to take some of the necessary \nsteps to put the infrastructure in place to provide\n\n[[Page S10772]]\n\nservices that will be needed by those retirees. It requires State and \nlocal agencies to acknowledge the dramatically changing demographics \nand to plan ahead. I hope Congress will continue to build on these \nefforts in coming years and provide increased funds for the important \nprograms in this Act.\n  The Conference on Aging also focused on another important theme--the \nimportance of civic engagement and community service by senior \ncitizens.\n  Members of the new generation of older Americans obviously want to \ncontinue to be engaged in their communities after they retire, and it \nwould make no sense for our society not to draw on their experience and \nknowledge in constructive ways.\n  The Older Americans Act already provides opportunities for employment \nof older Americans through the Senior Community Service Employment \nProgram. According to a study by the Center for Labor Market Studies at \nNortheastern University, the number of older persons aged 55 to 74 with \nincome below 125 percent of poverty will increase from 6 million in \n2005 to over 8 million in 2015. Our bill strengthens job training for \nseniors to involve them in the communities they love, and which also \nlove them. Last year, the program supported 61,000 jobs and served \n92,000 people.\n  Older Americans today provide 45 million hours of valuable service to \ntheir communities, particularly in senior centers, public libraries, \nand nutrition programs.\n  The bill is also intended to encourage good nutrition, healthy \nliving, and disease prevention among seniors. The Meals on Wheels \nprogram, enacted in the 1970's, is one of its greatest successes, and \nMassachusetts has been in the forefront of efforts to provide \ncommunity-based nutrition services to the elderly. The Massachusetts \nprogram coordinates twenty-eight nutrition projects throughout the \nState to deal with poor nutrition and social isolation of seniors. Our \nbill will expand the ability of programs such as Meals on Wheels to \nreach all older individuals who need better nutrition.\n  Today it's estimated that 47 percent of the elderly eligible for \nSupplemental Security Income, 70 percent of seniors eligible for food \nstamps, 67 percent of people eligible for Qualified Medicare \nBeneficiary protections, and 87 percent of those eligible for Specified \nLow-Income Medicare Beneficiary protections are not participating in \nthese programs. Surely, we can do a better job of outreach to bring \nthese programs to the attention of those who need them. Our bill \naddresses the need for better outreach to seniors about the healthcare, \nmental health services, and long-term care benefits available to them.\n  I also commend all of the staff members who have worked so hard to \nbring this bill to final passage today, especially Ellen-Marie Whelan \nand Keysha Brooks-Coley in Senator Mikulski's office, Lauren Fuller and \nKori Forster in Senator Enzi's office, and Lindsay Morris and Karla \nCarpenter in Senator DeWine's office.\n  This bill will mean better health and more fulfilling lives for both \nseniors and their communities in the years ahead, and I strongly \nsupport its passage.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of legislation to \nreauthorize the Older Americans Act.\n  I strongly support this bill and want to acknowledge the hard work of \nthe chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension, HELP, \nCommittee, Senator Mike Enzi, and the committee's ranking minority \nmember, Senator Ted Kennedy.\n  In addition, I want to thank Senator Mike DeWine, the chairman of the \nRetirement Security and Aging Subcommittee and its ranking minority \nmember, Senator Barbara Mikulski. All four of my colleagues and their \nwonderful staffs, Lauren Fuller, Kori Forster, Lindsay Morris, Kara \nMarchione, Ellen-Marie Whelan, and Keysha Brooks-Coley did a tremendous \njob in producing a good bill that will make a difference in the lives \nof older Americans across the nation.\n  Yesterday, this legislation passed the House of Representatives \nunanimously and it is my hope that the Senate will follow suit.\n  This legislation improves the functions of the Administration on \nAging, provides grants for State and community programs on aging, and \ncreates training and research programs to assist seniors in maintaining \ntheir independence. In addition, the conference report includes job \ntraining for seniors through the community service employment program \nand grants for supportive and nutrition programs for older Native \nAmericans.\n  There are two provisions of this measure that I would like to \nhighlight.\n  First, the conference report includes provisions from legislation \nthat I introduced earlier this Congress with my colleague, Senator \nBlanche Lincoln of Arkansas, S. 2010, the Elder Justice Act.\n  More specifically, this legislation includes a provision which \nauthorizes the Assistant Secretary on Aging to designate an individual \nto be responsible for elder abuse and prevention services, and to \ncoordinate Federal elder justice activities. This includes developing a \nlong-term plan for the creation and implementation of a coordinated, \nmultidisciplinary elder justice system.\n  I am so proud to have provisions from the Elder Justice Act included \nin this legislation. With over 77 million baby boomers retiring in the \nnext three decades, we have no choice but to acknowledge something must \nbe done to combat elder abuse. Passage of this bill is an important \nstep in the right direction.\n  I also am pleased that this legislation includes a sense of the \nCongress recognizing the contribution of nutrition to the health of \nolder Americans. This sense of the Congress states that while diet is \nthe preferred source of nutrition, evidence suggests that the use of a \nsingle daily multivitamin-mineral supplement may be an effective way to \naddress nutritional gaps that exist among the elderly population, \nespecially the poor. I strongly believe that by encouraging seniors to \ntake daily multivitamin-mineral supplements, we are only helping them \nto live longer, healthier lives and I am hopeful that senior meals \nprograms will decide to provide supplements to those who participate.\n  There is a long history of evidence indicating that multivitamins and \nminerals can maintain and improve health and are safe. While I wish \nthis provision had been more than a sense of the Congress, I appreciate \nthe work of the conferees to highlight the necessity of good nutrition \nand supplementation.\n  Once again, I want to congratulate my colleagues on a job well done. \nOlder Americans across the country appreciate your efforts.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nreauthorization of the Older Americans Act. I commend Chairman Enzi and \nRanking Member Kennedy of the Committee on Health, Labor, and Pensions \nfor their hard work in putting this bill together and working through \nthe differences with the House prior to today's floor action so that \nthis important legislation can go straight to the President's desk and \nbe signed into law.\n  There are many important provisions aimed at improving the lives of \nour senior citizens contained in the Older Americans Act. Today, \nhowever, there is one part of the bill to which I want to draw \nparticular attention: Section 203 of the act establishes an Interagency \nCoordinating Committee that will help the Federal Government work with \nits partners to meet the growing housing, health care, transportation, \nand related needs of senior citizens around the country. The \nInteragency Coordinating Committee will work to better coordinate \nFederal agencies so that seniors and their families can access the \nprograms and services necessary to allow them to age in place or find \nsuitable housing alternatives. This section draws heavily from S. 705, \nthe Meeting the Housing and Service Needs of Seniors Act, which I \nintroduced in Apri1 2005. S.705 was passed by the Senate unanimously on \nNovember 15, 2005.\n  As I said when the legislation first passed, the challenges that \nconfront us as our population ages are growing more urgent. Data from \nthe 2000 census show that the U.S. population over 65 years of age was \n34.7 million. This number is expected to grow to over 50 million by \n2020. It is projected that by 2030 nearly 20 percent of our population \nwill be over 65; that is, almost one American in every five will be \nelderly.\n\n[[Page S10773]]\n\n  As our senior population continues to increase, so will the demand \nfor affordable housing and service options. This is a matter of concern \nnot only for those who will need the services but for families--\nchildren along with spouses. It concerns communities all around the \ncountry, as productive and responsible citizens grow older and need \nhelp. It is a matter of deep concern for us all because it will affect \nthe well-being of our entire society.\n  Many of us know, both from academic studies and our own experience \nwith elderly parents or friends, that helping a senior citizen to \nremain in her home or in her community for as long as possible promotes \na better quality of life. In order to help seniors age in place or find \nsuitable alternative housing arrangements, services must be linked with \nthat housing. Seniors must be able to access needed health supports, \ntransportation, meal and chore services, and assistance with daily \ntasks in or close to their homes. Without needed supports, seniors and \ntheir families face difficult and even daunting decisions.\n  The Commission on Affordable Housing and Health Facility Needs for \nSeniors, known as the Seniors Commission, established by Congress in \n1999, found that too often, seniors face premature institutionalization \nbecause housing and services are not linked. This results in more \nexpensive care for the person, increased social isolation, and a lower \nquality of life. According to the Commission's report, ``the very \nheart'' of its work ``is the recognition that the housing and service \nneeds of seniors traditionally have been addressed in different \n`worlds' that often fail to recognize or communicate with each other.'' \nThe Commission concluded that: ``the most striking characteristic of \nseniors' housing and health care in this country is the disconnection \nof one field from another.'' The creation of the Interagency \nCoordinating Committee will ensure that this important conversation \ngets started.\n  If left unattended, the problem of lack of coordination will \nincreasingly undermine all of our efforts to assure that Americans have \naccess to the services they need as they age. The Interagency \nCoordinating Committee established by this legislation will increase \ncommunication and coordination among Federal agencies while reducing \nduplication. The committee will also serve as a permanent national \nplatform to address the needs and issues of our aging population.\n  The Interagency Coordinating Committee will further help to improve \ncollaboration and coordination among the Federal agencies and our State \nand local partners to ensure that seniors are better able to access \nhousing and services. This committee will work to find new ways to link \nhousing programs and needed supportive services to increase their \nefficiency, to make them more accessible, and to strengthen their \ncapacity.\n  The decisions that our seniors and their families must make are \ndifficult enough. They should not be made more painful and burdensome \nby having to negotiate a confusing maze of programs and services and a \nmultiplicity of administrative procedures. I am hopeful that the \nCoordinating Committee will be able to focus attention on this problem \nand cut through the barriers that Americans face to utilizing the \nprograms we have provided for them.\n  The two members of the Interagency Coordinating Committee \nspecifically named in the legislation are the Secretaries of Health and \nHuman Services, HHS, and Housing and Urban Development, HUD. These two \nCabinet members are crucial to achieving the ultimate goal of the \ncommittee--to make affordable housing and needed supportive services, \nwhich are often health-related services, easier for seniors to access \ntogether. The legislation also names many other high-ranking officers \nfrom agencies that oversee programs of significant importance to the \nlives of older Americans as potential members of Coordinating \nCommittee. I urge the President, after signing this legislation, to \nquickly name the rest of the committee so that it can begin to create \nthe kind of seamless web of housing, health, transportation, and other \nservices for our seniors that this legislation envisions.\n  In closing, I want to thank Chairman Enzi and Ranking Member Kennedy \nfor their strong support for including the idea of the Interagency \nCoordinating Committee. Katherine McGuire, Greg Dean, and Lauren Fuller \nfrom the HELP Committee were absolutely vital in working with Jonathan \nMiller of my office and the House committee to make sure this important \nprovision was included in the final legislation.\n  Likewise, my longtime colleague and friend, Senator Mikulski, who is \nthe ranking member of the Subcommittee on Retirement Security and \nAging, and Keysha Brooks-Coley from her subcommittee staff, have been \nstrongly supportive of this provision and have been tireless in their \nadvocacy on its behalf. I greatly appreciate their efforts. As I did \nwhen S. 705 first passed, I want to express my thanks to Chairman \nShelby for moving S. 705 through the Committee and the Senate floor \nexpeditiously and the Banking Committee staff who helped in achieving \nthis goal, especially Kathy Casey, the former staff director, Mark \nCalabria, and Tewana Wilkerson.\n  Finally, I want to thank two former members of my staff, Jennifer \nFogel-Bublick and Sarah Garrett, who, at the staff level, were \nprincipally responsible for crafting the original legislation and who \nhelped to guide it through this body last year. This accomplishment is \nvery much due to their hard work over the last several years.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to highlight an agreement \nreached by my colleagues, Senator Mike Enzi and Senator Richard Burr, \nin regard to Federal funding formulas.\n  Over the past year and a half the Senate Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee, of which I am a member, has been working on the \nreauthorization of the Older Americans Act. Part of this work included \nchanges to the funding formula for the programs contained within the \nact. I was actively involved in this work with Chairman Enzi and \nSenator Burr, as I believe that the formula is unfair and inequitable \nto states with a growing elderly population.\n  While we were able to make some changes to the funding formula for \nthe Older Americans Act, it is far from adequate. The formula continues \nto provide high-growth states with less than their fair share of \nfunding.\n  Chairman Enzi has agreed to hold hearings during the 110th Congress \nto review federal funding formulas.\n  Senator Burr and I agree that Federal money should follow people. \nCurrent Federal funding formulas often ignore this and penalize those \nliving in fast-growing States.\n  According to USA Today, the state of Nevada is projected to see a one \nhundred and fourteen percent increase in our population--the highest \nrate of growth in the country. Nevada welcomes our new-comers with open \narms, as they have recognized the quality of life the state of Nevada \nhas to offer. I am proud that so many Americans have chosen to call \nNevada home.\n  I was sent to Washington, DC, promising that I would do more to bring \nNevadans hard earned dollars back to the State. Nevadans are happy to \npay their fair share of taxes to the Federal Government, but also \nexpect a fair share to return to the State. Despite my success in \nchanging several funding formulas, Nevada continues to rank at the \nbottom of the list in terms of Federal dollars returning to the State.\n  Much of this is because current Federal funding formulas contain \nprovisions that require outdated population data, and others mandate \nthe use of hold harmless provisions. Both of these provisions work \nagainst those who need the assistance these funds provide. These \nprovisions punish those who have chosen to move to a different State \nparticularly fast-growing States.\n  I have worked to bring some equity and fairness to the title I \neducation funding formula, which has brought an additional $43 million \nto the State of Nevada. I have also worked to bring some fairness to \nthe Perkins Career and Technical Education program and other important \nprograms, but much work remains to be done.\n  I am anxious for these hearings to begin so we can truly shed some \nlight on these formulas and the unfair provisions used to allocate \nFederal dollars. Federal money ought to follow those individuals it is \ndesigned to assist. It should not be held hostage to politics.\n  It is my hope that these hearings will lay the groundwork for work on \nother\n\n[[Page S10774]]\n\nfederal funding formulas, particularly those used to allocate funding \nfor education and health care programs. I am looking forward to working \nwith my colleagues on this extraordinarily important issue in the very \nnear future.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of Senate \npassage of the bipartisan, bicameral Older Americans Act Amendments of \n2006, H.R. 6197. This bill passed the House unanimously yesterday and \nis a bipartisan, bicameral agreement to reauthorize this important act \nuntil 2011.\n  H.R. 6197 retains and strengthens current programs, as well as \nestablishes new innovative programs. This bipartisan bill also honors \nthe agreement that I made with Senators Enzi, DeWine, and Kennedy to \nmembers of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee to \naddress the current funding formula for title III OAA dollars before \nmoving the bill to the senate floor. The bill includes a compromise \nthat addresses States that have both increasing and decreasing \npopulations. Updating the ``hold harmless'' to the fiscal year 2006 \nfunding level helps States with steady populations, while phasing out \nthe guaranteed growth provision over 5 years helps States with \nincreasing aging populations.\n  This past December, the congressionally mandated White House \nConference on Aging convened 1,200 bipartisan delegates from all 50 \nStates to discuss issues that affect the lives of older individuals \nacross the country. The No. 1 resolution adopted at the conference was \nreauthorization of the OAA this year. We have heeded their call and are \npleased that H.R. 6197 has the strong support of the aging community.\n  There are three principles that I used to guide this reauthorization \nprocess. First, to continue to improve the core services of this act to \nmeet the vital needs of America's seniors. We need a national program \nwith national standards that ensure consistency but allow for \nsufficient flexibility and creativity. Second, to modernize the act, to \nmeet the changing needs of America's senior population, including the \ngrowing number of seniors over 85. We must be ready for the impending \nsenior boom and look for ways to help seniors live more independent and \nactive lives. And finally, to ensure these critical national, State, \nand local programs have the resources they need to get the job done.\n  This bill keeps our promise to older Americans to retain and \nstrengthen current OAA programs, as well as provide new innovative \nprograms to further improve the act. It will ensure that the OAA \ncontinues to meet the day-to-day needs of our country's older Americans \nand the long-range needs of our aging population.\n  The reauthorization bill maintains tried and true programs, including \ninformation and referral services that are the backbone of OAA \nprograms, providing seniors and their family members information about \nsupportive services, nutrition programs like Meals on Wheels that \nprovide meals to 2.75 million people every year, and transportation \nservices which are critically important to seniors in our rural areas. \nAt the same time, we recognize the need to strengthen certain programs \nin the act and establish new innovative initiatives that are fiscally \nresponsible.\n  The bill strengthens the National Family Caregiver Support Program by \nproviding respite services to older adults who care for their children \nwho are disabled and lowering the age eligibility of grandparents \ncaring for a child from 60 to 55. The bill also extends caregiver \nservices to individuals with Alzheimer's disease of any age to address \nthe increasing number of people who are being diagnosed with \nAlzheimer's at an earlier age and increases the authorization for the \nprogram to meet the growing needs of family caregivers.\n  The bill strengthens aging and disability resource centers, expanding \nthe important role resource centers across the country provide. These \ncenters are visible, trusted sources of information on long-term care \noptions and health insurance and provide seniors and their family \nmembers with important information on benefits including the Medicare \nprescription drug program.\n  The bill strengthens the title V Senior Community Service Employment \nProgram by maintaining the strong community service aspect of the \nprogram, an integral component since the beginning. This program helps \nseniors find jobs at Meals on Wheels programs, senior centers, and \npublic libraries.\n  H.R. 6197 authorizes new innovative programs including a Naturally \nOccurring Retirement Community--NORC--Aging in Place Program that will \nsupport and enhance the ability of seniors to remain in their homes and \ncommunities by providing seniors necessary supporting services \nincluding transportation, social work services, and health programs. \nThe new grant program builds on the success of Naturally Occurring \nRetirement Communities Programs that have developed at the local level \nand have a proven record of success.\n  A Civic Engagement Demonstration Program is authorized that \nencourages older adults to become actively involved in their \ncommunities. The program will capitalize on the talent and experience \nof older adults to meet critical needs in our communities. The bill \nalso creates an elder abuse program that will support State and a \ncommunity effort against elder abuse by conducting research related to \nelder abuse and neglect and creates a nationally coordinated system to \ncollect data about elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation.\n  The bill also establishes an Interagency Coordination Committee based \non S. 705, Meeting the Housing and Service Needs of Seniors Act of \n2005, introduced by the senior Senator from Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes. The \ninteragency committee will address the housing and social service needs \nof seniors and enhance working relationships and coordination among \nFederal entities including the Departments of Health and Human \nServices, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, and Transportation.\n  This bill addresses the issue of emergency preparedness for seniors \nby requiring States and Area Agencies on Aging to coordinate, develop \nplans, and establish guidelines for addressing the senior population \nduring disasters/emergencies. During Hurricane Katrina and Rita, we all \nsaw that many times the people who were left behind were the elderly. \nWe must plan accordingly for seniors and use the successful senior \nnetwork that exists in our country to make sure that they are not \nforgotten.\n  I thank Senator DeWine, chairman of the Retirement Security and Aging \nSubcommittee, for his sincere dedication to reauthorizing the OAA this \nyear and his willingness to work in a bipartisan manner to accomplish \nthis. This is our second time reauthorizing this act together, and we \nproduced a bipartisan bill once again. I also thank Senator Enzi for \nhis strong leadership in moving this bill through the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee and all the way up to this \npoint. Thank you also to Senator Kennedy for his leadership and his \ntireless advocacy for OAA programs and the people it serves.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Older Americans \nAct amendments of 2006. As the Federal Government's chief program for \nthe provision of a variety of social services for America's older \ncitizens, the Older Americans Act, OAA, has and will continue to be a \nprogram of critical importance, especially for the aging baby boomer \npopulation.\n  The bill before us includes a number of important provisions that \nseek to strengthen and improve health and nutrition programs, \neducational and volunteer services, and home and community support \nsystems for our Nation's older citizens. I commend my colleagues in \nCongress for these needed improvements and enhancements to the OAA, and \nI support final passage of this bill.\n  While I am also pleased by the modifications made to the funding \nformula included in title III of the act that will result in increased \nfunding for North Carolina and other high-growth States, I am \ndisappointed that the final funding formula included in the act does \nnot completely eradicate funding inequities. For far too long, my home \nState of North Carolina and a number of other high-growth States have \nconsistently been underfunded under the OAA. Prior to the 2000 \nreauthorization of the OAA, the General Accountability Office, GAO, \nboth in 1994 and 2000, documented that the allocation\n\n[[Page S10775]]\n\nmethod used by the Administration on Aging, AOA, to distribute title \nIII funding resulted in inequitable funding across States and adversely \naffected States with rapidly growing older populations such as North \nCarolina. Under AOA's allocation procedures, States with above-average \ngrowth were consistently underfunded, while States with below-average \ngrowth were consistently overfunded. In fiscal year 2000 alone, GAO \nfound that AOA's allotment method resulted in North Carolina being \nunderfunded by $2.1 million.\n  Although Congress attempted during the 2000 reauthorization of the \nOAA to ensure that the allocation methods used to distribute funds were \nconsistent with statute, a provision was added to the formula, referred \nto as a guaranteed growth factor, which had the unfortunate effect of \ncompounding the disparities between high- and low-growth States. Under \nthe formula included in the Act before us, this guaranteed growth \nfactor is to be phased out in 5 years. I appreciate the inclusion of \nthis phase out. However, I strongly believe that 5 years is too long a \ntime to eliminate a funding provision that serves only to underfund \nhigh-growth States and over-fund low-growth States.\n  As we all know, older Americans are a rapidly growing and ever \nimportant group of our population. My home State of North Carolina has \nand will continue to experience unprecedented growth in all segments of \nour populations in the coming years. While the Nation's total \npopulation is expected to grow 29 percent by 2030, North Carolina's \ntotal population is expected to increase 51.9 percent by 2030, making \nNorth Carolina the seventh most populous by 2030 and the seventh \nfastest growing state.\n  The State of North Carolina welcomes this growth, which we are \nexperiencing among all age segments of our population, and we are \npleased that so many are choosing to make North Carolina their home. \nNevertheless, to best meet the needs of our residents, it is imperative \nthat funds provided by Federal programs such as the OAA reach the \nindividuals they are intended to serve. As we all know, funding \nformulas are complicated. Nevertheless, it is critical that this and \nother formula issues be resolved once and for all and not once again \nput off for another day or other reauthorizations years down the road. \nIf the goal of the OAA is to provide essential Federal programs and \nservices for older Americans, then such Federal funds must be directed \nto States in which older Americans are living.\n  For this reason, I am pleased that Chairman Enzi has committed to me \nto hold hearings during the coming Congress to review all formulas for \nFederal programs under the jurisdiction of the Health, Education, Labor \nand Pensions Committee and to examine how those formulas are developed \nto determine the fair and equitable distribution of funds. I also \nappreciate Chairman Enzi's commitment to address the next \nreauthorization of the OAA within 3 years after we pass this bill \nbefore us so that we can more quickly examine and remediate the current \nfunding inequities. I look forward to working with Chairman Enzi and my \nother colleagues to ensure that Federal funds follow the people and \ntheir needs.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I have heard from many seniors, the Center for Social \nGerontology in Ann Arbor, and Michigan's Area Agencies on Aging and \nsenior centers about the need for reauthorizing the Older Americans \nAct, which was last reauthorized in 2000. While the reauthorization of \nthe OAA is a positive step for America's seniors, funding for Federal \nseniors services has failed to keep place with inflation and an aging \npopulation.\n  I am also pleased that the OAA reauthorization will contain the core \nelements of S. 409, the Federal Youth Coordination Act, which I \ncosponsored with Senator Norm Coleman. I was also pleased to work with \nCongressman Tom Osbourne on pushing this legislation forward. I thank \nChairman Enzi and Senators Kennedy and Mikulski and their staff for \nincluding this important piece of legislation in the OAA \nreauthorization.\n  In 2003, the White House Task Force for Disadvantaged Youth report \nidentified numerous programs in 12 different Federal agencies that \nserve or relate to disadvantaged youth. But the task force could not \ndetermine precisely how much funding directly impact our young people \nbecause there is no uniform, focused Federal youth policy. The task \nforce recommended the establishment of a coordinating body to \nfacilitate the evaluation, coordination, and improvement of Federal \nprograms serving youth.\n  In response, our legislation creates a 2-year coordinated council to \nevaluate, coordinate, and improve Federal youth programs. Membership on \nthe council includes 12 Federal agency officials, representatives of \nyouth-serving nonprofits and faith-based organizations, and the youth \nwho actually participate in these important programs.\n  The purpose of our bill is not to cut programs but to look at ways we \ncan better serve our young people. Our children, especially those most \nat risk, should not be lost in a Federal bureaucracy. We must ensure \nthat our taxpayers' investment produces a strong return on our Nation's \ninvestment in our children. America's youth deserve high-quality, \neffective and meaningful youth development programs that achieve the \ngreatest possible impact.\n  I urge the President to convene a council that will take its mission \nseriously and includes members with strong backgrounds in children's \nservices. Most importantly, the council ought to include young people, \nespecially those positively impacted by federally funded programs. At a \nJanuary briefing I sponsored with Senators Coleman and DeWine, one of \nthe most powerful stories we heard from Terry Harrak, a former foster \nyouth once caught in the middle of the maze of services. She called on \nthe Senate to pass the Coleman-Stabenow bill and for Congress to not \ncut the number of programs but to improve how they work together.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for their support for serving two of our \nmost vulnerable populations, our seniors and our children. \nAdditionally, I thank the many Michigan organizations who supported the \nFederal Youth Coordination Act, and I ask unanimous consent that a copy \nof the letters in support of S. 409 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             National Collaboration for Youth,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 13, 2006.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     133 Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: On behalf of the National \n     Collaboration for Youth and its member organizations, we \n     thank you for your support of the Federal Youth Coordination \n     Act (S. 409) and co-sponsoring the briefing on the \n     legislation held earlier this week.\n       More than 20 Senate staff members attended the briefing to \n     hear our distinguished panelists discuss the maze of services \n     facing disadvantaged youth and their families. The federal \n     government currently lacks a coordinating body with the \n     mandate to weave the existing tangle of services into a \n     seamless web of supports. We appreciate your leadership on \n     The Federal Youth Coordination Act (FYCA), which fills this \n     need and provides valuable leadership, support and efficiency \n     to state and local efforts across the country.\n       We look forward to continuing to work with your office on \n     FYCA. Children are simply too important, and resources are \n     too scarce, to not pass this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Irv Katz,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Voices for Michigan's Children\n\n                                      Lansing, MI, April 18, 2005.\n     Senator Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate, 702 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Hon. Senator Stabenow: On behalf of our Board of Directors \n     of Michigan's Children, I would like to thank you for your \n     sponsorship of the Federal Youth Coordination Act of 2005.\n       Transitioning to adulthood can be a complicated process for \n     young people, navigating through the supports and services \n     available should not be so complicated. For this reason, \n     Michigan's Children has as one of its legislative and \n     administrative priorities for 2005 advocacy related to at-\n     risk youth transitioning to adulthood. This priority includes \n     supporting state and federal steps to provide more \n     coordinated services to this population. As you are aware, \n     the Federal Youth Coordination Act represents a positive step \n     in this direction.\n       We are pleased that you have signed on as a Senate co-\n     sponsor to this important piece of legislation. It may \n     interest you to know that the theme of the 2005 Michigan Kids \n     Count Databook will be issues faced by at-risk youth in \n     transition. This should provide a unique opportunity this \n     fall (the databook is scheduled for release in October 2005) \n     to\n\n[[Page S10776]]\n\n     draw some attention to this critical issue. If there is \n     anything that we can provide to you about the Act itself, or \n     the status of young people in Michigan, please don't hesitate \n     to contact our office,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Sharon Peters,\n                                                    President/CEO.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I understand that tonight the Senate will \nmove to passage of the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act. I \nsupport passage of this legislation, which funds nutrition, health, \nelder abuse prevention, caregiver support, and employment programs that \nare critical to our Nation's seniors--so critical, in fact, that \ndelegates to the White House Conference on Aging ranked reauthorization \nas their No. 1 priority.\n  Today, people over the age of 65 make up over 12 percent of the \npopulation, but they will make up 20 percent in the next 45 years. That \nmeans one out of every five Americans will be a senior by the year \n2050. Just in the past 5 years, Wisconsin has experienced a 6 percent \nincrease in people over the age of 65. It is clear we need a strong \nOlder Americans Act that provides real help if we are to serve the \nseniors of today and tomorrow.\n  As ranking member of the Special Committee on Aging, I applaud the \nbipartisan efforts of Senator Enzi and Senator Kennedy in producing a \nbill that preserves the programs in the Older Americans Act. This is \nnot a perfect bill, and in future reauthorizations we must continue to \nstrengthen OAA for both today's seniors and the coming tidal wave of \nbaby boomer retirees. But I am pleased that this reauthorization \nrejects attempts to dismantle the OAA programs and instead preserves \nthem.\n  This OAA reauthorization bill includes several pieces I strongly \nsupport. First, it strengthens the Senior Community Service Employment \nProgram--now renamed the Older American Community Service Employment \nProgram. Many seniors expect to work past traditional retirement age. \nSome will do so because they enjoy the physical and mental benefits of \nwork, but others need additional income to be financially secure.\n  That is why the OACSEP program is so important. It is the only \nFederal workforce program specifically targeted to older people, \nproviding community service and job training to low-income adults age \n55 and over. Many of us were concerned that the administration proposed \na major overhaul of this program that would have disrupted both \ngrantees and participants. Instead, this bill wisely preserves OACSEP \nand builds on its success.\n  In particular, the bill maintains OACSEP's role in allowing seniors \nwho have a disability or poor employment prospects to do community \nservice jobs. Instead of turning seniors away, this bill recognizes \nthat seniors who give back to their communities help not only the \norganizations and families they serve but also help themselves become \nmore self-sufficient.\n  I thank the HELP Committee for working with me to improve OACSEP. \nSpecifically, the bill expands eligibility to ensure that people who \nhave some income but are still very poor can get OACSEP services. It \nalso requires the Department of Labor to evaluate the performance of \nOACSEP grantees by hours of community service employment, placement \ninto and retention in paid jobs, earnings, and the number of people \nserved--including the number of people from hard-to-serve populations. \nAnd it requires Labor to use performance on these measures as one of \nits criteria in awarding future grants.\n  At an Aging Committee hearing in April, the GAO testified that even \nthough thousands of seniors need training and jobs, Labor has \nrestricted OACSEP eligibility so much that grantees can't find enough \npeople to enroll. The bill returns to more realistic eligibility \ncriteria, such as ensuring that SSI benefits no longer count as income \nin determining whether you are poor enough to qualify for the program.\n  This reauthorization also recognizes the importance of engaging our \nnext generation of seniors in community service. While many boomers \nwould like to continue working, others will look to mix work and \nleisure with volunteerism. Older Americans bring a wealth of talent and \nexperience to their communities, and many are eager to make a \nmeaningful contribution. This reauthorization directs the \nadministration on Aging to develop a blueprint for engaging boomers and \nauthorizes a fund for innovation for community stakeholders to engage \nboomers. These are two important steps in giving the government and \ncommunities the tools needed to harness boomers' leadership skills and \nabilities.\n  I am also pleased to see several provisions of the Elder Justice Act \nincluded in the Older Americans Act reauthorization. I am an original \ncosponsor of Elder Justice and strongly support its goals. For far too \nlong, our Nation has turned its back on the shame of elder abuse. With \nthese provisions, we are finally saying enough is enough--elder abuse \nis unacceptable and we are going to put an end to it.\n  For the first time, the bill provides real Federal leadership in the \nfight to end elder abuse by creating an Office of Elder Abuse \nPrevention. It also includes programs to assist States and Indian \ntribes with their efforts to protect seniors. Important research and \ndata collection can now begin so we will know the scope of the problem \nand the best solutions to prevent, detect, and treat elder abuse, \nneglect and exploitation.\n  In addition, I am pleased this bill preserves the Long Term Care \nOmbudsman Program. Although it is a small program, the ombudsman plays \na key role in protecting the elderly and disabled in long-term care by \nserving as an advocate for patients and helping them resolve complaints \nof abuse, neglect, and mistreatment. A recent report by the Institute \nof Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences noted the importance of \nroutine onsite presence of ombudsman in detecting problems before they \nbecome serious.\n  My home State of Wisconsin has one of the most successful ombudsman \nprograms in the county, and we are proud to have one of the very best \nombudsmen, George Potaracke, leading that program. I have worked for \nmany years to ensure that this woefully underfunded program receives \nincreases. These increases are often small, but they improve the lives \nof people living in long-term care facilities. I hope that future OAA \nreauthorizations will take the ombudsman's growing caseload into \naccount and increase its funding authorization to match the need.\n  This legislation also maintains strong support for state and \ncommunity programs authorized under title III. These programs serve \nover 8.2 million older persons, providing transportation, access to \nsenior centers, home care, adult daycare, and congregate and home-\ndelivered meals like the Meals on Wheels program. These valuable \nservices allow older persons to live in their communities and remain \nindependent.\n  Each year, title III gives seniors almost 36 million rides to places \nlike doctors' offices, grocery stores, and senior centers. It ensures \nthat 6,000 senior centers continue to flourish in our communities. It \nprovides 20 million hours of personal care, homemaker, and chore \nservices, and almost 10 million hours of services in adult daycare. And \nit serves 248 million meals to our seniors. I am pleased that the Older \nAmericans Act reauthorization preserves these important services.\n  In addition, the Family Caregiver Support program is reauthorized and \nimproved. I was an original cosponsor of this program, which ensures \nthat family members who care for an elderly or disabled relative \nreceive the support and respite services they need. The Family \nCaregiver Support Program provides access assistance to 585,000 \ncaregivers, conducts counseling and training services for about 300,000 \ncaregivers, and supports respite care services for over 200,000 \ncaregivers.\n  Now that we are poised to pass the Older Americans Act \nreauthorization, we must make sure we fund it. All of our good \nintentions will be empty promises if we don't also provide the \nresources seniors need. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I \nhave consistently supported increased funding for OAA and will continue \nto fight for these programs.\n  Again, I applaud the HELP Committee for this sensible and much needed \nbill.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President. I am extremely proud to come to the Senate \ntoday to recognize the passage of a very important piece of legislation \nfor our Nation's seniors. Democrats and\n\n[[Page S10777]]\n\nRepublicans came together over the past 2 years to reauthorize the \nOlder Americans Act and that's simply good news for seniors across the \ncountry.\n  I thank Chairman Enzi and our Democrat colleagues Senators Mikulski \nand Kennedy for joining me in this effort. This bill is an excellent \nexample of the positive things we can accomplish when members of both \nparties work side by side towards a common goal. Over the past 2 years, \nas Chairman of the Subcommittee on Retirement Security and Aging, I \nhave worked with my colleagues--particularly Senator Mikulski--to bring \ntogether experts in the aging community at hearings, roundtables, and \nlistening sessions. We have listened to the problems facing our seniors \nand to ideas about what we can do to make their lives better. I rise \ntoday with my colleagues on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee as we join in passage of the Older Americans Act Amendments \nof 2006, a bill which we all believe will make the lives of seniors \nbetter.\n  Senator Mikulski and I worked together to draft and pass the Older \nAmericans Act Amendments of 2000. I am proud to have worked with her \nagain to improve and update these vital programs for seniors. Her hard \nwork and experience has been invaluable.\n  This bill comes about through the dedication and compromise of \nmembers in both the Senate and the House. I would like to take this \nmoment to thank everyone on both sides of the aisle who worked on this \nbill--particularly my colleague from Ohio, Representative Tiberi. They \nhave been dedicated to the passage of this important legislation, and I \nthank them for their hard work.\n  The Older Americans Act is so important for my home state of Ohio. \nMore than 2 million persons over the age of 60 in Ohio are eligible for \nservices under the Older Americans Act. Let me say that again, there \nare over 2 million Ohio seniors who will have the opportunity to take \nadvantage of the programs in this bill. The bill will bring more than \n$44 million to programs in Ohio. This vital funding will go to \nwonderful organizations such as Meals on Wheels, which provides \nimportant nutrition programs at senior centers and in senior's homes.\n\n  This funding will also help programs preventing injury and illness to \nseniors, as well as programs supporting families who are caring for \ndisabled loved ones, including the elderly and adult children with \ndisabilities, and grandparents who are caring for their grandchildren. \nSo many Ohioans need these services. In my state 87 percent of those in \nneed of care by a family member are at age 50 or older. Seventy percent \nof those persons are women. Ohioans caring for a disabled family member \nspend an average of 4.2 years in this role--time impacting their job, \ntheir emotions, and their health.\n  The Older Americans Act also provides funding and support for the 12 \nArea Agencies on Aging that serve older Americans living in Ohio. These \n12 agencies do a wonderful job of organizing the services I just \ndescribed, as well as many more. They serve all 88 counties in Ohio and \nwork with State and local providers of services to ensure that all \nseniors in their areas maintain proper health and nutrition and are \naware of the services available to them.\n  Nationwide, older Americans are a vital and rapidly growing segment \nof our population. Over 36 million people living in the United States--\nabout 12 percent of the population--are over the age of 65. The Census \nBureau projects that 45 years from now, people 65 and older will number \nnearly 90 million in the United States and will comprise 21 percent of \nthe population.\n  The Older Americans Act is an important service provider for these \nAmericans, and I strongly believe that the reauthorization bill we just \npassed updates and strengthens the Act in so many ways. Plans to \nprepare for changes to the aging demographics will be incorporated into \nthe Act. A Federal interagency council responsible for ensuring \nappropriate planning for baby boomer-related needs and population \nshifts across agencies will be created. And grants and technical \nassistance will be provided to local aging service providers to plan \nfor the baby boomer population.\n  Our bill will also increase the Federal funding levels for the \nNational Family Caregiver Support Program over the next 5 years. This \nimportant program helps families care for loved ones who are severely \nill or disabled, yet want to remain in their homes and community. Our \nbill expands this program so that all of those caring for loved ones \nwith Alzheimer's become eligible for support services. Our bill also \nclarifies that this program will serve elderly caregivers who are \ncaring for their adult children with developmental disabilities and \nexpands that provision to include all adult children with disabilities \nwho are being cared for by an elderly parent. Lastly, it clarifies that \ngrandparents caring for adopted grandchildren are covered under the \nNational Family Caregiver Support Program and lowers the age threshold \nfor grandparents to 55 years old. These important changes will improve \nthe quality of life for so many who are struggling under the pressures \nof caring for loved ones--including more than 1,700 Ohioans annually.\n\n  Other provisions of the bill encourage seniors to make voluntary \ncontributions to help defray the costs of these programs if they want \nto which will allow the program to reach out to even more seniors. This \nwill help programs such as Meals-on-Wheels to expand their activities \nand will enable them to more effectively take contributions from those \nolder Americans willing and able to pay for services. Annually, more \nthan 125,000 Ohioans are served nearly 10 million meals by these \nimportant programs. The number of seniors in our population is \nincreasing--and as it does, we need to modify our programs to ensure \nthat they are economically sustainable and equipped to grow.\n  We know that most Americans wish to live independently in their own \nhomes as they age. Our amendments will help them do so by providing \nfunding so that the Department of Health and Human Services can award \ngrants for the improvement of assistive technology that will allow \nolder Americans to monitor their health while they remain in their \nhomes. This bill also creates a new program awarding grants for the \ncreation of innovative models for the delivery of services to those who \nremain in their homes. The need for this grant program was discussed at \nlength in a hearing I held on models for aging in place--specifically, \nNaturally Occurring Retirement Communities or NORCs. NORCs are areas in \nwhich large concentrations of people live and stay as they age. \nEssentially, NORCs allow individuals to grow old while living in the \ncommunities they love. Programs like NORCs will allow Americans to \nremain in their homes and communities, the places where they believe \nthey will stay happier and healthier. As I stated before, Americans \nwant to stay in the places they love as they age. This bill will help \nthem do just that.\n  Further, this bill creates a new momentum towards the provision of \nconsumer-driven choices with respect to long-term care. As we all know, \ntoo many older Americans become disabled without the ability or the \ninsurance to pay for their care. Too often, their only choice is to \nlive in a nursing facility away from home. This ends up being more \ncostly and ultimately not what the person would prefer--which is to \nremain in their home and their community. This bill will facilitate \naccess to long-term care choices and opportunities. It will also \nenhance the ability of local providers and area agencies on aging to \nprovide advice on the range of options they have available. Older \nAmericans will then have the flexibility to decide for themselves which \nis the best place for them to age.\n\n  The Senior Community Service Employment Program is a federally funded \njobs program geared specifically for older Americans. In Ohio alone, it \nprovides more than 2,000 jobs for low-income Americans age 55 and \nolder. Our bill updates this program to ensure additional stability in \nthose who provide these services for older low-income Americans. This \nstability will limit the disruption for seniors employed in the program \nand will also help low-income older Americans get the training they \nneed to move on to better paying jobs.\n  The Senior Community Service Employment Program has a dual nature, \ncontaining provisions that address both community service and job \ntraining for low income individuals. Our bill\n\n[[Page S10778]]\n\nprovides a Sense of the Senate supporting this dual approach. \nFurthermore, our bill limits the time period of participation in the \nprogram to 4 years, with an exemption for certain hard to serve \nindividuals. This provision balances the need for a limit to the time a \nperson spends in this employment program with the recognition that \ncertain populations have special needs.\n  Of great importance to me, this bill also amends the Older Americans \nAct to focus attention on the mental health needs of older Americans. \nThe amendments establish grants for the mental health screening of \nolder Americans and for increased awareness of the effects of mental \nhealth needs on the elderly population. Too often the mental health \nneeds of older Americans are overlooked--but they can be as serious and \nlife-threatening as any other illness. The mental health needs of our \nseniors must be taken more seriously. We must deal with them more \naggressively. I believe that these provisions move us significantly \nforward in this struggle.\n  Finally, this bill will help address the terrible problem of seniors \nwho suffer abuse in their homes or while in nursing homes. Elder abuse \nis a serious problem that we know exists but is not well documented. \nThis bill increases the profile of these issues while providing \nimportant resources for improving the data collection of incidents and \noutreach to those who may be suffering abuse. I believe that these new \ngrants will move us forward tremendously in our fight against elder \nabuse. I know that this was an important provision for Chairman Enzi, \nand I am glad that we were able to include this important program for \nat-risk seniors.\n  Once again, I want to thank Senator Enzi and Senator Kennedy for \nmaking this reauthorization a priority for the HELP Committee. Over the \nmonths we have negotiated this bipartisan bill, I have greatly \nappreciated their thoughtful and steady work to get the Older Americans \nAct to this point. Together, we have worked to get it done.\n  Today's passage of the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2006 is \nincredibly important to older Americans, both in Ohio and across the \nNation. I would like to commend everyone involved.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read the third \ntime and passed, a motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements related to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 6197) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10778-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10778-S10779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TO EXTEND TEMPORARILY CERTAIN AUTHORITIES OF THE SMALL BUSINESS \n                             ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 6159 which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the title of the bill.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6159) to extend temporarily certain \n     authorities of the Small Business Administration.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to the consideration \nof the bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, tomorrow--September 30, 2006--many of the \nSBA's programs and authorities expire. Our committee worked together to \ncome up with a bipartisan package, a true give-and-take on ideas, \nincluding many reforms driven by needs identified in the response to \nthe gulf hurricanes last year. That comprehensive small business \nreauthorization bill, S. 3778, is opposed by the administration, and is \nbeing blocked from consideration in the full Senate through various \nholds.\n  We finished our work at the end of July, and the bill has been \npending on the Senate calendar for consideration since August 2. The \nadministration and other opponents have had 9 weeks to work out a \ncompromise. But they don't want to. SBA has told the small business \ncommunity that they don't want an SBA reauthorization bill this year; \nthey only want to reauthorize their ability to cosponsor events with \nthe private sector.\n  In the absence of passing that legislation, which is a replay of our \nlast reauthorization bill, S. 1375, that was obstructed, the agency is \nat the mercy of a continuing resolution, CR. Unfortunately, a \ncontinuing resolution doesn't extend all the authorities needed for the \nagency to operate. H.R. 6159 was put forward to catch some of the \nprograms that would fall through the cracks. However, according to CRS \nand the Senate Legislative Counsel, as drafted, the bill still doesn't \nclose the gaps. The gaps leave open the Advisory Committee on Veterans \nBusiness Affairs, the New Markets Venture Capital Program, and the \nProgram for Investment in Micro-entrepreneurs.\n  There are disagreements over the interpretations of what needs to be \nauthorized, and some of our colleagues have argued that even if there \nare disagreements on the interpretation of what programs are covered by \nH.R. 6159, we should move the bill anyway because we have a letter from \nSBA committing to cover those provisions considered ambiguous. \nSpecifically, SBA gave Chairman Snowe a letter on September 27, 2006, \ncommitting to run the programs we are concerned about. Our colleagues \nargue that SBA would be bound by those written interpretations. \nHowever, I am sure my colleagues can understand why we might not feel \ncomfortable relying on that letter given that on September 19, 8 days \nearlier, SBA sent a list to my staff regarding which programs are \ncovered by a CR, those with ``hard sunset dates,'' and it contradicted \nthe letter to our chairman. The contradictions raise valid concerns, \nand I am sorry that the Senate did not adopt the language that \neliminates any vagueness. Neither CRS nor Legislative Counsel has an \nagenda with regard to SBA's reauthorization, so we prefer to go with \ntheir interpretations.\n  What are the contradictions?: *The Advisory Committee on Veterans \nBusiness Affairs, *The SBDC Drug-Free Workplace program, *The Pre-\nDisaster Mitigation program,\n  In the e-mail, SBA said:\n\n       Those marked with an * do not need authorization language \n     in the CR to operate the core mission of the SBA on a short-\n     term basis. Grants for the year have already been given out \n     and other programs have the ability to operate without \n     authorizing language or are not operating and/or do not have \n     an appropriation.\n       In the letter, SBA said these programs ``would not be \n     covered by the CR and that [they] would cease to operate if \n     H.R. 6159 were not enacted.''\n\n  Also, problematic is the date. The bill extends the programs through \nFebruary 2, 2007, instead of November 17, consistent with the CR. \nBecause the SBA has the cosponsorship authority, there is no incentive \nfor the agency to come negotiate with us on the comprehensive \nreauthorization bill.\n  We were given this bill last week, and told we had one hour to \napprove it. We tried, but our conversations, as referenced above, with \nCRS and Senate Legislative Counsel identified holes in the legislation. \nWe asked Legislative Counsel to draft the corrections and told our \ncolleagues that we were waiting for the draft. They moved forward \nwithout us. This take-it-or-leave-it approach is unnecessary.\n  Let the record reflect that we have been willing to compromise all \nalong and only asked that the language accomplish: extension of \nprograms or authorities that would fall through the cracks based on \ndiscussions with CRS and Senate Legislative Counsel and a date change \nto keep folks working to pass, this 109th Congress, S. 3778, the \nSenate's bipartisan, comprehensive SBA Reauthorization Act. We did not \ninclude provisions outside those goals.\n  It is disappointing that our goal was not shared. I am hopeful that \nthe Veterans Committee will continue and that SBA will not pull \nresources from the New Markets Program or later argue that not \naddressing PRIME was a statement from the Senate that we didn't mean \nfor it to be extended. That would be inaccurate, as reflected in S. \n3778, where PRIME is moved to the Small Business Act and reauthorized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as chair of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I rise today to ask unanimous consent to \napprove H.R. 6159, a bill passed by the\n\n[[Page S10779]]\n\n House of Representatives on Tuesday that would provide a short-term \nextension of the Small Business Administration, SBA, and all of its \nprograms. In particular, it ensures the continued authority, through \nFebruary 2, 2007, of the SBA's Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program, the \nSmall Business Development Center Drug-Free Workplace Grants, the \nAdvisory Committee on Veterans Business Affairs, and also the SBA's \nCosponsorship and Gift Acceptance Authority.\n  Currently, many of the SBA's programs, authorities, or provisions \nauthorized under the Small Business Act and the Small Business \nInvestment Act are scheduled to expire on September 30, 2006. While \nmost of the SBA's programs can operate through appropriations and the \nContinuing Resolution, this bill makes certain that the SBA will \ncontinue its vital small business lending programs such as the 7(a) \nloan guaranty program; the Certified Development Company program; and \nthe Small Business Investment Companies program.\n  On July 27, 2006, the Small Business Committee unanimously reported \nout the Small Business Improvements and Reauthorization Act of 2006 (S. \n3778), a comprehensive, bipartisan bill which reauthorizes the SBA for \nthe next 3 years. This bill is a product of the committee's work over \nthe last 2 years and includes many critical provisions to improve and \nrevitalize the SBA and its programs.\n  My SBA Reauthorization bill will enhance the SBA's role in assisting \nAmerican small businesses to thrive and grow, through the agency's \nlending programs as well as other programs and services. Most \nimportantly, it will enable the agency to help small businesses \ncontinue creating new jobs for our economy. Since 1999, the SBA's \nprograms and services have time and again proven their value, helping \nto create or retain over 5.3 million jobs in the United States.\n  I am confident that we can enact legislation to reauthorize the SBA \nbefore the 109th Congress ends and I am committed to work with my \ncolleagues to pass a bipartisan bill. However, in the interim, we must \nensure that the SBA can continue to offer the entire range of its \nprograms to our nation's small businesses, which are the backbone of \nour economic foundation, creating nearly three-quarters of all new jobs \nand generating about 50 percent of the nation's gross domestic product.\n  However, at stake today are four key SBA programs and authorities, \nincluding the Advisory Committee on Veterans Business Affairs, which is \nscheduled to transfer to the Veterans Corporation on October 1, 2006. \nIn a letter from SBA Administrator Steven C. Preston, dated September \n27, 2006, the SBA stated that . . . if H.R. 6159 is not passed, then \nthe Advisory Committee will terminate, and its duties will be assumed \nby the NVBDC [National Veterans Business Development Corporation].\n  We must act today to ensure that the SBA, the Advisory Committee on \nVeterans Business Affairs, and all of SBA's programs continue to \noperate. The bill before us achieves that goal by extending the \nauthorization for the SBA's program through February 2, 2007. That will \nprovide sufficient time and opportunity for both the Senate and the \nHouse to pass a SBA Reauthorization legislation, for Congress to \nreconcile the differences, and for the President to sign a long-term \nreauthorization bill for the SBA.\n  Too much was at stake for small businesses, and our economy as a \nwhole, to allow SBA and critical small business programs and services \nto languish. We must find essential agreement and fulfill its \nobligation to America's small businesses. Clearly, if we strive for \nanything less, we would fail to support the backbone of our economy, \nour hope for innovation and new technology, and our small firms that \nemploy millions across the nation ensure the success of tomorrow's \nentrepreneurs.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6159 and thereby \nensure that the SBA will continue to serve small businesses and enable \nsmall businesses to obtain the financing they need, as they contribute \nso greatly to the revitalization of our national economy.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read the third \ntime and passed, a motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 6159) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10779-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10779-S10791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATORY RELIEF ACT OF 2006\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

STUDY AND REPORT ON INSTITUTION DIVERSITY AND \n                   CONSOLIDATION.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Comptroller General of the United States \n     shall conduct a study regarding--\n       (1) the vast diversity in the size and complexity of \n     institutions in the banking and financial services sector, \n     including the differences in capital, market share, \n     geographical limitations, product offerings, and general \n     activities;\n       (2) the differences in powers among the depository \n     institution charters, including--\n       (A) identification of the historical trends in the \n     evolution of depository institution charters;\n       (B) an analysis of the impact of charter differences to the \n     overall safety and soundness of the banking industry, and the \n     effectiveness of the applicable depository institution \n     regulator; and\n       (C) an analysis of the impact that the availability of \n     options for depository institution charters on the \n     development of the banking industry;\n       (3) the impact that differences of size and overall \n     complexity among financial institutions makes with respect to \n     regulatory oversight, efficiency, safety and soundness, and \n     charter options for financial institutions; and\n       (4) the aggregate cost and breakdown associated with \n     regulatory compliance for banks, savings associations, credit \n     unions, or any other financial institution, including \n     potential disproportionate impact that the cost of compliance \n     may pose on smaller institutions, given the percentage of \n     personnel that the institution must dedicate solely to \n     compliance.\n       (b) Considerations.--In conducting the study under \n     subsection (a), the Comptroller General shall consider the \n     efficacy and efficiency of the consolidation of financial \n     regulators, as well as charter simplification and \n     homogenization.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United \n     States shall submit a report to the Committee on Banking, \n     Housing,\n\n[[Page S10791]]\n\n     and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on \n     Financial Services of the House of Representatives on the \n     results of the study required by this section.\n\n\n              section 702--insured depository institutions\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise to engage the distinguished \nSenators in a colloquy.\n  Section 702 of the Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006 \nclarifies that written conditions in applications and written \nagreements with institution-affiliated parties are enforceable in order \nto protect the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions. \nInstitution affiliated parties can include bank directors, officers and \nprincipal shareholders. This provision was included at the request of \nthe regulatory agencies, and we have heard some concerns that the \nregulatory agencies may use this language to require personal \nguarantees from bank directors and officers in inappropriate \ncircumstances.\n  I ask Senator Crapo if he can explain the legislative intent behind \nSection 702?\n  Mr. CRAPO. In adopting this provision, it is our intention that the \nregulatory agencies utilize Section 702 with care and precision. \nSpecifically, we do not intend that the regulatory agencies use it \nroutinely in connection with corporate applications, notices or \nrequests to impose financial or other conditions on bank directors or \nofficers that contain a personal guarantee against loss by the \ninstitution. In particular, it is not our intention that the regulatory \nagencies use it routinely to require directors or officers of insured \ndepository institutions to enter into capital maintenance agreements \nwith the agencies as a condition of granting a charter or providing \ndeposit insurance. Nor is it our intention that the regulatory agencies \nuse it routinely to require bank directors or officers to maintain the \ncapital of a troubled insured depository institution without the \ndirector's or officer's agreement.\n  In utilizing their authority under Section 702 to enforce agreements \nto protect the deposit insurance fund, banking agencies should be \nmindful of the fact that our national banking policies should encourage \nthe participation of highly qualified people on the boards of \ndepository institutions. Creation of an environment where the threat of \npersonal liability may cause bank directors to resign or keep well-\nqualified people from becoming directors in the first place would be \ncounterproductive. We intend to monitor closely how this provision is \napplied by the regulatory agencies to ensure that such an environment \ndoes not result.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the Senator for his explanation. I understand \nthat the regulatory agencies, specifically the Office of the \nComptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve System, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation agree with this interpretation as does \nthe House of Representatives.\n  Mr. CRAPO. That is correct. I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a copy of a joint letter from the regulatory agencies \nconfirming this.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Board of \n           Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Office of \n           Thrift Supervision, Federal Deposit Insurance \n           Corporation,\n                                   Washington, DC, August 7, 2006.\n     Hon. Mike Crapo,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Crapo: This responds to your letter dated July \n     28, 2006, concerning section 702 of S. 2856, ``The Financial \n     Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006.''\n       We agree completely that banking policies should welcome \n     the participation of qualified individuals on the boards of \n     directors of insured depository institutions. We believe that \n     enactment of this section would be fully consistent with that \n     goal and that the provision should be implemented in that \n     spirit, if enacted.\n       Section 702 is intended to enable the appropriate Federal \n     banking agency to enforce conditions imposed in writing in \n     connection with any action on an application, notice or other \n     request, and written agreements between a Federal banking \n     agency and a depository institution or an institution-\n     affiliated party, in accordance with the terms of the \n     condition or agreement, without the necessity of showing \n     unjust enrichment or reckless disregard for the law, \n     applicable regulations, or prior order of the appropriate \n     Federal banking agency. The language is intended to address \n     the effect of court decisions in a few cases that questioned \n     the authority of the banking agencies to enforce such \n     conditions or agreements without first establishing that the \n     institution-affiliated party was unjustly enriched or engaged \n     in reckless disregard for the law or previous agency orders.\n       It is our intention to utilize this provision with care and \n     precision. Specifically, we do not intend to use it routinely \n     in connection with corporate applications, notices or \n     requests to impose financial or other conditions on bank \n     directors or officers that contain a personal guarantee \n     against loss by the institution. In particular, it is not our \n     intention to use it routinely to require directors or \n     officers of insured depository institutions to enter into \n     capital maintenance agreements with the agencies as a \n     condition of granting a charter or providing deposit \n     insurance. Nor is it our intention to use it routinely to \n     require bank directors or officers to maintain the capital of \n     a troubled insured depository institution without the \n     director's or officer's agreement.\n       We hope this addresses your concerns.\n     Sincerely,\n     John C. Dugan,\n       Comptroller of the Currency.\n     John M. Reich,\n       Director, Office of Thrift Supervision.\n     Ben S. Bernanke,\n       Chairman, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n     Sheila C. Bair,\n       Chairman, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nconcur in the House amendment, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10791-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10791-S10793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         GREAT LAKES FISH AND WILDLIFE RESTORATION ACT OF 2006\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Great Lakes have fish and wildlife communities that \n     are structurally and functionally changing;\n       (2) successful fish and wildlife management focuses on the \n     lakes as ecosystems, and effective management requires the \n     coordination and integration of efforts of many partners;\n       (3) it is in the national interest to undertake activities \n     in the Great Lakes Basin that support sustainable fish and \n     wildlife resources of common concern provided under the \n     recommendations of the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration \n     authorized under Executive Order 13340 (69 Fed. Reg. 29043; \n     relating to the Great Lakes Interagency Task Force);\n       (4) additional actions and better coordination are needed \n     to protect and effectively manage the fish and wildlife \n     resources, and the habitats upon which the resources depend, \n     in the Great Lakes Basin;\n       (5) as of the date of enactment of this Act, actions are \n     not funded that are considered essential to meet the goals \n     and objectives in managing the fish and wildlife resources, \n     and the habitats upon which the resources depend, in the \n     Great Lakes Basin; and\n       (6) the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 941 et seq.) allows Federal agencies, States, and \n     tribes to work in an effective partnership by providing the \n     funding for restoration work.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from California \nfor addressing concerns I had with an earlier version of this bill. I \nwas particularly concerned about the apparent disconnect between the \nsubstantive offense created by the bill and the misdemeanor penalty for \nits violation. The offense requires proof that a defendant, for the \npurpose of damaging or interfering with the operations of an animal \nenterprise, ``intentionally damages, or causes the loss of any property \n(including animals or records)'' used by an animal enterprise. By \ncontrast, the misdemeanor penalty provision applied to offenses \ninvolving ``exclusively non-violent physical obstruction'' of an animal \nenterprise facility, resulting in no bodily injury, no property damage, \nand no loss of profits.\n  It is difficult to imagine how a person can intentionally damage \nproperty, or intentionally cause the loss of property, while at the \nsame time be engaged exclusively in nonviolent physical obstruction \nthat causes no real harm. The only way these provisions could be \nreconciled would be by watering down the criminal prohibition to extend \nto peaceful conduct that the bill was never intended to cover.\n  The current version of the bill clears up the confusion. It strikes \nthe misdemeanor provision in its entirety and clarifies that the \nsubstantive offense created by the bill requires proof of intentional \ndamage to real or personal property, not simply a loss of profits. \nThese changes will ensure that legitimate, peaceful conduct is not \nchilled by the threat of Federal prosecution, and that prosecution is \nreserved for the worst offenders.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the amendment at the desk be \nagreed to, the bill as amended be read a third time and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S10794]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. \n     2210) (commonly known as the ``Price-Anderson Act'')--\n       (A) provides a predictable legal framework necessary for \n     nuclear projects; and\n       (B) ensures prompt and equitable compensation in the event \n     of a nuclear incident in the United States;\n       (2) section 170 of that Act, in effect, provides operators \n     of nuclear powerplants with insurance for damage arising out \n     of a nuclear incident and funds the insurance primarily \n     through the assessment of a retrospective premium from each \n     operator after the occurrence of a nuclear incident;\n       (3) the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for \n     Nuclear Damage, done at Vienna on September 12, 1997, will \n     establish a global system--\n       (A) to provide a predictable legal framework necessary for \n     nuclear energy projects; and\n       (B) to ensure prompt and equitable compensation in the \n     event of a nuclear incident;\n       (4) the Convention benefits United States nuclear suppliers \n     that face potentially unlimited liability for a nuclear \n     incidents outside the coverage of section 170 of the Atomic \n     Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210) by replacing a \n     potentially open-ended liability with a predictable liability \n     regime that, in effect, provides nuclear suppliers with \n     insurance for damage arising out of such an incident;\n       (5) the Convention also benefits United States nuclear \n     facility operators that may be publicly liable for a Price-\n     Anderson incident by providing an additional early source for \n     a Price-Anderson incident by providing an additional early \n     source of funds to compensate damage arising out of the \n     Price-Anderson incident;\n       (6) the combined operation of the Convention, section 170 \n     of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210), and this \n     Act will augment the quantity of assured funds available for \n     victims in a wider variety of nuclear incidents while \n     reducing the potential liability of United States suppliers \n     without increasing potential costs to United States \n     operators;\n       (7) the cost of those benefits is the obligation of the \n     United States to contribute to the supplementary compensation \n     fund established by the Convention;\n       (8) any such contribution should be funded in a manner that \n     neither upsets settled expectations based on the liability \n     regime established under section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act \n     of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210) nor shifts to Federal taxpayers \n     liability risks for nuclear incidents at foreign \n     installations;\n       (9) with respect to a Price-Anderson incident, funds \n     already available under section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act \n     of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210) should be used; and\n       (10) with respect to a nuclear incident outside the United \n     States not covered by section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act of \n     1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210), a retrospective premium should be \n     prorated among nuclear suppliers relieved from potential \n     liability for which insurance is not available.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to allocate the \n     contingent costs associated with participation by the United \n     States in the international nuclear liability compensation \n     system established by the Convention on Supplementary \n     Compensation for Nuclear Damage, done at Vienna on September \n     12, 1997--\n\n[[Page S10799]]\n\n       (1) with respect to a Price-Anderson incident, by using \n     funds made available under section 170 of the Atomic Energy \n     Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210) to cover the contingent costs in \n     a manner that neither increases the burdens nor decreases the \n     benefits under section 170 of that Act; and\n       (2) with respect to a covered incident outside the United \n     States that is not a Price-Anderson incident, by allocating \n     the contingent costs equitably, on the basis of risk, among \n     the class of nuclear suppliers relieved by the Convention \n     from the risk of potential liability resulting from any \n     covered incident outside the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. \n     2210) (commonly known as the ``Price-Anderson Act'')--\n       (A) provides a predictable legal framework necessary for \n     nuclear projects; and\n       (B) ensures prompt and equitable compensation in the event \n     of a nuclear incident in the United States;\n       (2) section 170 of that Act, in effect, provides operators \n     of nuclear powerplants with insurance for damage arising out \n     of a nuclear incident and funds the insurance primarily \n     through the assessment of a retrospective premium from each \n     operator after the occurrence of a nuclear incident;\n       (3) the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for \n     Nuclear Damage, done at Vienna on September 12, 1997, will \n     establish a global system--\n       (A) to provide a predictable legal framework necessary for \n     nuclear energy projects; and\n       (B) to ensure prompt and equitable compensation in the \n     event of a nuclear incident;\n       (4) the Convention benefits United States nuclear suppliers \n     that face potentially unlimited liability for a nuclear \n     incidents outside the coverage of section 170 of the Atomic \n     Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210) by replacing a \n     potentially open-ended liability with a predictable liability \n     regime that, in effect, provides nuclear suppliers with \n     insurance for damage arising out of such an incident;\n       (5) the Convention also benefits United States nuclear \n     facility operators that may be publicly liable for a Price-\n     Anderson incident by providing an additional early source for \n     a Price-Anderson incident by providing an additional early \n     source of funds to compensate damage arising out of the \n     Price-Anderson incident;\n       (6) the combined operation of the Convention, section 170 \n     of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210), and this \n     Act will augment the quantity of assured funds available for \n     victims in a wider variety of nuclear incidents while \n     reducing the potential liability of United States suppliers \n     without increasing potential costs to United States \n     operators;\n       (7) the cost of those benefits is the obligation of the \n     United States to contribute to the supplementary compensation \n     fund established by the Convention;\n       (8) any such contribution should be funded in a manner that \n     neither upsets settled expectations based on the liability \n     regime established under section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act \n     of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210) nor shifts to Federal taxpayers \n     liability risks for nuclear incidents at foreign \n     installations;\n       (9) with respect to a Price-Anderson incident, funds \n     already available under section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act \n     of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210) should be used; and\n       (10) with respect to a nuclear incident outside the United \n     States not covered by section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act of \n     1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210), a retrospective premium should be \n     prorated among nuclear suppliers relieved from potential \n     liability for which insurance is not available.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to allocate the \n     contingent costs associated with participation by the United \n     States in the international nuclear liability compensation \n     system established by the Convention on Supplementary \n     Compensation for Nuclear Damage, done at Vienna on September \n     12, 1997--\n       (1) with respect to a Price-Anderson incident, by using \n     funds made available under section 170 of the Atomic Energy \n     Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210) to cover the contingent costs in \n     a manner that neither increases the burdens nor decreases the \n     benefits under section 170 of that Act; and\n       (2) with respect to a covered incident outside the United \n     States that is not a Price-\n\n[[Page S10801]]\n\n     Anderson incident, by allocating the contingent costs \n     equitably, on the basis of risk, among the class of nuclear \n     suppliers relieved by the Convention from the risk of \n     potential liability resulting from any covered incident \n     outside the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, in the early hours of the morning, we are \ngoing to be closing down here in a few minutes. We do have some very \nimportant business to conduct, first on the Defense authorization \nconference report, and closing up with a few other matters.\n  It has been a long day, with a lot of productive work. The Democratic \nleader and I were just commenting it has been a constructive and \nproductive last 2 or 3 weeks.\n  Mr. President, before I propound a unanimous consent request on the \nDefense authorization conference report, I turn to my colleague, the \ndistinguished Senator from Oklahoma, who has been intimately involved \nin this issue over the last several days and the last several hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the leader for working with me on \ngetting the requirements of what we need to do to get control of our \nspending in this country. I also want to thank the House leadership for \ntheir commitment in attempting to do that.\n  I had threatened to object to the unanimous consent request that we \npass this bill. That is not a desire or something I want to do. But \nwhat I do want to do is make sure the money we spend actually goes for \nDefense. And we had, in both the appropriations bill and in the \nauthorization bill, by a vote of 96 to 1 in this body, that even though \nwe do not report earmarks in the Senate, we do not label them, we do \nnot say who put them, we did have an agreement--with amendments in both \nthose bills--that we will allow the Pentagon to report to the American \npublic on the status of those earmarks and back to us as a Congress \nwhether or not they met the mission of the Defense Department because \nabout 40 percent of them do not. It is all about transparency, the \nAmerican people seeing where we are spending our money.\n  I appreciate the leaders both here and in the House agreeing to bring \nthis amendment--which was offered and accepted and passed here; and \nwhat was thrown out of the conferences--up in the lame-duck session. \nAnd given that commitment from both the House leadership and the Senate \nleadership, I will not object to this bill.\n  I will tell people, other than the earmarks that are in this bill, \nthis is a needed bill, and a lot of the earmarks are appropriate and \nneeded. But the American people ought to be seeing where we are \nspending the money, and they cannot. This amendment would have allowed \nthem to see that.\n  The agreement of, hopefully, bringing this back, so the American \npeople can actually know where money is spent, I appreciate the \nleader's help in accomplishing that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it looks like we will be able to proceed \nwith our unanimous consent request and pass a very, very important bill \nto this country. We passed earlier today the appropriations for our \nDepartment of Defense. And with this, on the same day, we will be able \nto pass the authorization bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10805-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10805-S10810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n JOHN WARNER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2007--\n                           CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Is there objection?\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want the \nRecord to reflect the hard work that has gone into this bill by the \nmanagers of the bill, the chairman, Senator Warner, and the ranking \nmember, Senator Levin. There are no two finer Senators in the Senate. \nThey have worked so diligently and so hard on this legislation for \nwhich they deserve so much credit for getting us to where we are. They \nare both dedicated to the service of their country. They are just two \nof the best, and if not for them we could not be where we are.\n  I also express my appreciation to Senator Coburn for allowing us to \nmove forward on this legislation this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            insurrection act\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to applaud the Senator from \nVirginia for his amendment in the Defense authorization bill. This \namendment clarifies the President's authority to employ the Armed \nForces inside the United States to restore public order when domestic \nviolence has occurred to such an extent that the State authorities are \nnot able to enforce the laws and protect the legal rights of its \npeople.\n  Late August last year, New Orleans and gulf coast residents saw the \ndevastation nature can sow. We are now in another hurricane season. \nCommunicable diseases like SARS and avian flu are still real risks. No \none needs reminding that bin Laden and al-Qaida are still out there. We \nneed to clarify the applicability of this law to modern problems.\n  This is a task that uniquely belongs to Congress. It is Congress's \nresponsibility, according to the Constitution, to make rules ``for the \ngovernment and regulation'' of the Armed Forces. Senator Warner's \nprovision takes a real step in the right direction.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I'm glad Senator Kennedy drew attention to \nmy amendment to the Militia Acts, sometimes referred to as the \n``Insurrection Act.'' These statutes have not been amended for a half \ncentury. We urgently need a statute that clarifies when and how the \nPresident can use the Armed Forces in the homeland.\n  This is not a new problem. The Second Congress passed a law in May \n1792 giving the President power to call out the Armed Forces inside the \nUnited States. Congress carefully defined when the President could act. \nIn certain cases, he had to get a judge's approval before calling forth \nthe troops. When President Washington put down the Whiskey Rebellion, \nhe used this 1792 statute.\n  Congress made changes to this authorization in 1795, 1807, 1861 and \n1871. Clearly, Congress was responding to threats of the day. These \nincluded Aaron Burr's conspiracy, the Civil War, and Reconstruction. \nThe end result of all these amendments was a very sweeping statute with \nopen-ended authorization in some situations, but ambiguous authority to \nuse the Armed Forces in others. So we clearly needed to revisit this.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand the amendment, it defines when the \nPresident can call on the Armed Forces if there is a major public \nemergency at home. The amended statute now lists specific situations in \nwhich the troops can be used to restore public order. This includes \nnatural disasters, epidemics or other serious public health \nemergencies, and terrorist attacks or incidents that result in domestic \nviolence to such an extent that\n\n[[Page S10806]]\n\nState authorities are unable to maintain public order. These were not \nmentioned specifically before. While the amendment does not grant the \nPresident any new powers, it fills an important gap in clarifying the \nPresident's authority to respond to these new kinds of emergencies.\n  The amendment defines the kind of situations in which the President \ncan employ the Armed Forces to restore public order. In our system, \nresponsibility for law enforcement and the maintenance of public order \nnormally lies with the State and local authorities. The Armed Forces \ncan and should enter this arena only in extreme ergencies. The \namendment explains that the trigger for the employment of Armed Forces \nis a condition, which may result from a terrorist attack or a natural \ndisaster, that makes it impossible for regular law enforcement agencies \nto enforce the laws.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator from Massachusetts is correct about the \nprovision. The Armed Forces have a legitimate role to play in \nresponding to serious emergencies. That role benefits from clear \ndefinition. Bringing this statute to date and removing its ambiguities \nwill help the Nation respond better to the next crisis.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to compliment the distinguished \nchairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee for their \nwork in bringing forth the National Defense Authorization Act for \nfiscal year 2007 through conference. This Act supports our Armed Forces \nduring this critical period in our Nation's history.\n  In particular, I would like to note the House and Senate conferees \nfull support for the administration's missile defense activities. The \nconference report before us fully funds the President's request for \nmissile defense activities--reflecting strong confidence in and support \nfor the current program.\n  The recommendations of the conferees with respect to missile defense \nfollow very closely the actions taken in the national Defense \nauthorization bill for fiscal year 2007--as passed by the full Senate \nearlier this year.\n  Notably, the conference report reflects the consensus view of the \nSenate and House that the Department of Defense must accord a priority \nto those near-term missile defense capabilities that are now beginning \nto provide a measure of protection for the American people, our \ndeployed forces, and our friends and allies.\n  The need to emphasize near-term missile defense capabilities was \nbrought home to many of us by the fourth of July ballistic missile \nlaunches by North Korea, where six missiles of short-, medium-, and \nlong-range were tested.\n  Similarly, I just returned from the Ballistic Defense Annual \nConference in London where over 900 delegates from over 20 nations \ndiscussed near and long term missile requirements in Asia and Europe. \nAmong the key issues was the 3rd site requirement in Europe--a site \ndesigned to protect the United States and our NATO allies; a site which \nwill provide an additional mix of options, both military and diplomatic \nto us and our NATO partners as the specter of missile blackmail \nincreases.\n  On Independence Day, for the first time ever, Americans witnessed \ntheir country activate a missile defense system to protect our homeland \nagainst long-range ballistic missiles. This was certainly an epiphany \nfor some and a wake up call for friends and foes alike.\n  Missile defense has thus become part of the diplomatic and military \ntool set available to our President and other senior policymakers.\n  Some critics of missile defense questioned whether the ground-based \nmidcourse defense system would be able to intercept a long-range \nballistic missile fired by North Korea.\n  Lieutenant General Obering, Director of the Missile Defense Agency, \nexpressed confidence that the ground-based midcourse defense, GMD, \nsystem would be able to address a limited threat posed by North Korea.\n  He said that while the entire system had not undergone the full \ncomprehensive testing regime he has planned, General Obering flatly \nstated he believed the system would, if need be, work to knock down a \nNorth Korean missile.\n  The successful intercept test of a long-range ballistic missile on \nSeptember 1 confirms General Obering's assessment that the current GMD \nsystem has the capability, though not fully developed and tested, to \ndefend America.\n  Both of these recent tests--the North Korean launches of July and our \nGMD test earlier this month--confirm, more broadly, the wisdom of the \ndecision by President Bush in 2002 to begin deployment of an initial \nset of missile defense capabilities.\n  In less than 2 years, we have laid the infrastructure in Fort Greely, \nAlaska, and elsewhere so that this country at last is ready to defend \nitself against long-range ballistic missiles fired against our \nhomeland.\n  The successful intercept of a long-range ballistic missile target on \nSeptember 1 was the most operationally realistic test for the ground-\nbased midcourse defense system conducted to date.\n  It included an operationally configured interceptor, an operational \nradar, and operational crews.\n  Critics continue to highlight reports of earlier unsuccessful missile \ndefense testing, but the truth is that since 2001, we have had 23 \nsuccessful hit-to-kill intercepts against all ranges of ballistic \nmissiles, from the shortrange to the longrange.\n  In the past 90 days alone, we have conducted four successful \nengagements of short-, medium-, and long-range ballistic missile \ntargets--using Aegis BMD, THAAD, PAC-3, and GMD. I will submit for the \nRecord a letter from the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, \nTechnology and Logistics Kenneth J. Kreig to Congressman Ike Skelton on \nSeptember 19, 2006, which discusses ground-based midcourse defense \nsystem testing. I think the letter is illustrative of the points I made \nhere regarding our efforts to bring a robust missile defense system on \nline.\n  While more testing is necessary and planned to ensure confidence in \nthe effectiveness of the defenses we field, we should take comfort in \nthe knowledge that we have demonstrated fully that we can engage \nballistic missile targets of all ranges.\n  Some editorial writers also like to remind us that the budget request \nfor missile defense is close to $10 billion per year. While this is \nindeed a significant sum, we should bear in mind that this funding \nfigure reflects research, development and fielding not for a single \nmissile defense system, but for a number of missile defense \ncapabilities based on land, on ships, on aircraft, and in space.\n  These include Patriot PAC-3, terminal high altitude area defense \nsystem, THAAD, ship-based Aegis BMD, the ground-based midcourse defense \nsystem, the airborne laser, the kinetic energy interceptor, and a host \nof sensors and the command and control links necessary to tie all these \nelements together.\n  In conclusion, I thank the conferees for fully supporting the \nadministration's missile defense program and note the consensus within \nCongress to get on with the fielding of missile defense capabilities \nthat are now demonstrating testing success and providing a measure of \nprotection for our homeland and deployed forces.\n  This is a consensus that stretches back at least as far as the \nNational Missile Defense Act of 1999, when Congress stated that:\n\n       it is the policy of the U.S. to deploy as soon as is \n     technologically possible an effective National Missile \n     Defense system capable of defending the territory of the \n     United States against limited ballistic missile attack. . . .\n\n  Those of us who supported this legislation--indeed all of us in \nCongress--should be gratified to see how far we come in such a short \ntime.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter to which I \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               The Under Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, Sept. 19, 2006.\n     Hon. Ike Skelton,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Skelton: Thank you for your August 29 \n     letter concerning Ground-based Midcourse Defense System \n     testing. The Secretary of Defense asked that I respond.\n       Since the Secretary's comments at Fort Greely and your \n     recent letter to him, the Missile Defense Agency completed a \n     successful end-to-end flight test of the long-range missile \n     defense capability on September 1.\n\n[[Page S10807]]\n\n     This test began with the lanch of a threat representative \n     target on a realistic trajectory across an operational, \n     upgraded, early warning radar manned by warfighters in \n     California. An intercept solution was then generated using \n     the operational command and fire control system, also manned \n     by warfighters, and an operational interceptor was launched \n     from an operational site. Given necessary range and safety \n     limitations, a 5-hour target launch window was defined, but \n     the warfighters operating the system did not receive prior \n     notice of target launch.\n       The flight test was representative of an attack by a \n     single, relatively unsophisticated, but lethal, hostile \n     missile. While this test was a success, the Ballistic Missile \n     Defense System (BMDS) test program is by no means complete. \n     Later tests will involve different trajectories and \n     engagement geometries, different target characteristics and \n     countermeasures, and different raid patterns and composition. \n     Some will be successful, and some will not, but all will \n     contribute to moving the program forward.\n       Each of these tests, and those of the other components of \n     the BMDS, builds on the knowledge gained from previous tests \n     and adds new and challenging objectives to demonstrate \n     enhanced capability. The goal is to devise scenarios that \n     test each system to the maximum extent possible to increase \n     knowledge of, and confidence in, system performance, while \n     maintaining safety and keeping pace with the advancing \n     threat.\n       This last point is important. In July, we saw one \n     manifestation of that threat from North Korea in its effort \n     to test an advanced missile capability that could threaten \n     the United States. Iran's intentions also seem increasingly \n     clear as its missile programs progress. That is why the \n     Secretary of Defense has endorsed a capability-based \n     acquisition approach to developing missile defenses, allowing \n     us to deploy militarily useful capability while we continue \n     to enhance it.\n       Over the past 2 decades, you noted the United States has \n     devoted some $100 billion to missile defense. This has \n     occurred under several Administrations and with ever-\n     increasing Congressional support. A substantial portion of \n     this funding went to early research and space-based programs \n     that were cancelled in 1993. Approximately $21 billion has \n     been invested in the Ground-based Midcourse Defense program \n     over the last 10 years. '\n       The remaining funds have permitted the PATRIOT PAC-3 \n     capability to evolve, so that when it was employed in combat \n     during Operation IRAQI FREEDOM, it was a complete success \n     against Iraqi missiles. The funding supported the sea-based \n     Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense program, which has succeeded \n     in 7 of 8 intercept attempts, with its 18 ships programmed \n     for modification. Aegis ballistic missile defense-equipped \n     ships started operational long-range surveillance and \n     tracking patrols in the Sea of Japan almost 2 years ago. The \n     funding supported the restructured Terminal High-Altitude \n     Area Defense system, capable of intercepting threats in the \n     upper atmosphere as well as just outside the atmosphere, \n     which completed a successful intercept test in July. In \n     addition, the funds were used for sensors and C2 systems \n     integrating all of these components into a layered defensive \n     system that is much more capable than any of the individual \n     elements alone. And finally, the funds support the \n     development of future capabilities including the Airborne \n     Laser, more capable interceptors and space-based sensors to \n     enhance discrimination, and lethality across the entire \n     spectrum of missile defense.\n       This latest test of the long-range interceptor increases \n     our confidence in the approach to enhance the system's \n     performance. We have a limited, but increasing, capability \n     where none existed before. Four years ago, with the Anti-\n     Ballistic Missile Treaty in effect, this could not have been \n     possible. Today, the Department is on a path to provide \n     critically-needed missile defense protection for our \n     citizens, deployed forces, friends, and allies.\n       Your continued support of our efforts will ensure we can \n     reach this goal.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Kenneth J. Krieg.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to commend the chairman and \nranking member for their outstanding leadership in bringing the Defense \nauthorization bill to closure and thank them for their untiring work \nconcerning this most important legislation. By enacting this \nlegislation, Congress will take a major step forward in ensuring that \nthe defense of our Nation remains the number one priority. That is why \nI will vote for passage of the conference report on H.R. 5122, the John \nWarner National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2007.\n  I would like to take a moment to recognize our distinguished \nchairman, a man I have known for 33 years, my friend and mentor, the \nsenior Senator from Virginia. No Member of this body has done more for \nour national security than John Warner. As a sailor, Marine officer, \nUnder Secretary and Secretary of the Navy, and U.S. Senator, he has \nalways answered his country's call. The dignified and evenhanded way in \nwhich he has presided over the business of the Committee these past 6 \nyears has enabled it to continue its noble tradition of being an island \nof bipartisanship in an increasingly unpleasant political era. I am \nproud that we have named this year's defense authorization act, the \nlast which John Warner will manage as chairman of the Committee on \nArmed Services, in his honor, and I thank my friend for all he has done \nfor our Nation.\n  This legislation authorizes the funding of $462.8 billion in budget \nauthority for defense programs in fiscal year 2007, which is a 3.6 \npercent increase or $21 billion above the amount authorized by Congress \nlast year. I am pleased to see that this measure meets the President's \nrequested funding level and that the conferees focused much of their \nefforts on addressing requirements for the ongoing war on terror as \nexpressed by the service chiefs in their unfunded priority lists.\n  While I am pleased we are able to act on this legislation prior to \nadjourning for the elections, I am compelled to point out that once \nagain, the Defense Appropriations Act has been decided prior to final \naction on the Defense Authorization Act. The Defense Authorization Act \nis intended to provide a framework for the policies and funding levels \nfor the Department of Defense and its programs. The role of the \nAppropriations Committee is to allocate funding based on policies \nprovided by authorization bills. A continuing trend, however, is an \nexpansion of the role of the Appropriations Committee, which now \nengages in significant policy decision making. It is my hope that next \nyear we will succeed in passing the authorization measure prior to the \nappropriations measure.\n  An important legislative provision contained in the conference report \nis an amendment which I sponsored on the Senate bill that would require \nthe regular budgeting for ongoing military operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Over the years, the administration and the Congress have \nbecome addicted to paying for these operations through ``emergency'' \nsupplemental appropriation bills. In addition, many defense-related \nactivities that should have been financed through the normal \nappropriations process have been funded through these emergency \nsupplementals. Additionally, nondefense-related spending has also found \nits way into these bills further undermining the budget process. This \nmethod of funding has unfortunately become the rule rather than the \nexception, but with this provision it will no longer be allowed. The \nnext budget submission will be expected to include funding required to \nconduct ongoing operations through the following year.\n\n  It should now be obvious that the current rate of growth in the cost \nof defense programs is reaching unsustainable levels. Over the \nintermediate term, this will pose a threat to not only our economic \nstability but also our national security. For this reason, next year I \nwill propose an aggressive and comprehensive defense acquisition reform \nagenda. I have called for, and hope to obtain, the assistance of both \nthe Department of Defense as well as the defense industry in this \nregard.\n  The need for such an agenda is clear. Over the last few years, the \ndefense acquisition process has shown itself to be broken. This has \nbeen shown not only by the Air Force's proposed lease of Boeing 767 \ntanker aircraft, but also in the Department's procurement strategies \nfor the C-130J, Future Combat Systems, Joint Primary Aircraft Training \nSystem, Joint Cargo Aircraft, Joint Strike Fighter, and F-22A Raptor.\n  Incidentally, I remain concerned about the approach the Air Force is \ncurrently taking to recapitalize its tanker fleet. But I will address \nthis issue at another time.\n  As with past authorization bills, I have included in this year's bill \nseveral acquisition reform-related provisions. These provisions include \nmeasures that address abuses in the use of cost-type contract billing, \nfinancial conflicts of interest involving lead systems integrators, the \nimproper payments of award and incentive fees, and excessive pass-\nthrough charges. These provisions also subject the multi-year purchase \nof F-22 aircraft to greater congressional oversight. There is every \nexpectation that this legislation will be subject to\n\n[[Page S10808]]\n\nfurther legislative efforts in the future. I am hopeful that these \nmeasures will be further supplemented by even more comprehensive \nreforms next year.\n  The American taxpayer has a right to expect the government to \nproperly manage the allocation of resources, especially at a time when \nthose resources are so critical. While this legislation addresses a \ngreat many of the needs of our military, there is still money that is \nbeing diverted to unrequested projects. Unauthorized earmarks drain our \nprecious resources and adversely affect our national security.\n  One of the more egregious add-ons in the legislation currently on the \nfloor is the addition of over $2 billion for 10 C-17 cargo planes that \nwere not requested by the administration. This contradicts the \nQuadrennial Defense Review and is not in keeping with the President's \nrequest. So why are these additional aircraft now part of a bridge fund \ndesigned to provide necessary resources for our conflicts in Iraq and \nAfghanistan? Another reason I find this add-on particularly \nobjectionable is that, going into conference, the House had approved \nonly three additional C-17s and the Senate had approved only two. What \nwe are presented in this legislation is seven more C-17s added by the \nconferees. This is completely outside the scope of the matter the \nconferees were tasked to resolve. The practice of adding unrequested, \nunauthorized, and unnecessary projects onto wartime spending bills must \nend.\n\n  Each and every day the men and women of our Nation's Armed Forces put \ntheir lives on the line to protect the freedoms we cherish and it is \nimperative we provide them with the proper resources. It is our \nobligation to provide quality of life benefits for our servicemembers \nand their families. I am confident that enactment of this legislation \nwill accomplish that goal. For example, this conference report \nauthorizes a 2.2 percent across-the-board pay raise for all military \npersonnel. Also included in the report is a provision that prohibits \npredatory practices by creditors who loan to military personnel. This \nlegislation is a testament to our commitment to the brave men and women \nof our military who have answered their Nation's call.\n  The ongoing war on terror has required us to become increasingly \nreliant on the men and women of our Reserve forces and National Guard. \nApproximately 40 percent of the ground troops in Iraq and Afghanistan \nare National Guard and Reserve forces. These soldiers and sailors leave \nbehind friends, families, and careers to go willingly into harm's way \nfor their Nation's cause. We in the Congress owe it to these patriots \nto ensure we look after their needs. Included in the conference report \nis the authorization to expand the eligibility for TRICARE to all \nmembers of the Selected Reserve. This provision is critical for \nproviding our Reserve forces with the proper care they have earned.\n  Upon returning home from tours in Iraq or Afghanistan, soldiers and \nMarines are experiencing less and less downtime before their next \ndeployment. This is not good for morale nor is it good for retention \nand eventually it will become a readiness issue as recruiting is \naffected. Fortunately, this legislation authorizes significant \nincreases in recruiting and retention bonuses, as well as substantial \nincreases in educational funds for recruitment purposes. Also provided \nis authorization for maintaining the Army active-duty end strength of \n512,400, the Army National Guard end strength of 350,000, and an \nincrease in Marine Corps end strength to a total of 180,000. This \nauthorized force structure is critical to ensure proper readiness \nlevels so that our military can meet its operational requirements.\n  As in years past, I am disappointed that the annual ``Buy America'' \nbattle has once again made its way into this legislation. It seems as \nif every year we fight the same fight in conference. What it really \ncomes down to is what I have stated countless times before: we need to \nprovide American servicemen and women with the best equipment at the \nbest price to the American taxpayer. By following this simple \nphilosophy, we will protect both the men and women in uniform, as well \nas our domestic defense industry.\n  The international considerations of Buy America provisions are \nimmense. Isolationist, go-it-alone approaches have serious consequences \non our relationship with our allies. Our country is threatened when we \nignore our trade agreements. Currently, the U.S. enjoys a trade surplus \nof $31 billion in defense and aerospace equipment. We don't need \nprotectionist measures that detract from international cooperation in \norder to insulate our defense or aerospace industries. Critical \ninternational programs, such as the joint strike fighter and missile \ndefense, could be placed in jeopardy when our allies reassess our \ndefense cooperative trading relationship. If we enact laws that isolate \nour domestic defense industry, allies could potentially retaliate and \nhinder our ability to sell U.S. equipment which would in turn adversely \naffect our interoperability with NATO and other allies.\n  Although there are examples of why this bill is far from perfect, I \nam putting my reservations aside to support the final passage of this \nconference report. The John Warner National Defense Authorization Act \nfor fiscal year 2007 is legislation that further strengthens our \nNation's military and gives the Department of Defense the tools it \nneeds to defend our Nation's interests both at home and abroad.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to express my gravy \nreservations about certain provisions of the fiscal year 2007 Defense \nauthorization bill conference report. This legislation poorly handles \nkey provisions related to the National Guard, which--as the events \nsince September 11th have highlighted--is critical to our Nation's \ndefense. The final conference report drops the reforms known as the \nNational Guard Empowerment Act, a bill that would have given the \nNational Guard more bureaucratic muscle inside the Pentagon. It would \nhave cleared away some of these administrative cobwebs and given the \nGuard the seat at the decision-making table that it needs and deserves. \nIt also should concern us all that the conference agreement includes \nlanguage that subvert solid, longstanding posse comitatus statutes that \nlimit the military's involvement in law enforcement, thereby making it \neasier for the President to declare martial law. There is good reason \nfor the constructive friction in existing law when it comes to martial \nlaw declarations.\n  Combined, these moves amount to a double punch against the National \nGuard. The National Guard has done so much to protect the security and \nsafety of our country. Yet the authorization bill sends the signal that \nwe are not interested in truly supporting them. This conference report \nsays we do not want to address glaring problems that have surfaced \nduring their increasingly frequent deployments. And, incredibly enough, \nit says to the Guard that other military forces are better to carry out \ntasks here at home. In short, this bill goes in the wrong direction.\n  Let's review what the 500,000 men and women of the National Guard do \nfor the country. The National Guard is essential to the military's \nmissions at home and abroad. More than 10,000 members of the National \nGuard are currently called up for domestic options, most along the \nborder and involved in counter-drug operations.\n  Almost 60,000 citizen-soldiers are deployed overseas, almost 40,000 \ninvolved in Iraq deployments. Over 6,000 members of the Air Guard are \ndeployed. And let's remember, that at the high-water mark, the Guard \nmade up almost 40 percent of the troops on the ground in Iraq.\n  It is also clear that we are going to need the Guard even more in the \nfuture. Consider the information reported in a New York Times article \nfrom last Friday. The active U.S. Army is being deployed at such a high \nrate that it appears increasingly likely that the National Guard is \ngoing to need to be tapped once again to make the troop levels.\n  Any way you cut it, the National Guard is absolutely essential to our \nNation's defense. We cannot fight our wars abroad, we cannot secure the \ncountry at home, and we cannot response to large-scale emergencies \nwithout the Guard.\n  Given the fact that the National Guard is one of the country's most \nvaluable and needed forces, one would think that our leaders in the \nDepartment of Defense would be spending significant time developing \npolicies and\n\n[[Page S10809]]\n\nbudgets plans that truly support the Guard. For example, I would think \nit logical to make the replacement of the Guard's aging and worn \nequipment a priority. I would think it logical to give the National \nGuard a stronger voice in policymaking decisions and in setting \nbudgetary priorities that affect the National Guard. I clearly see the \nbenefits of deferring to the Adjutants General and the Nation's \ngovernors, those who control and oversee the Guard, when determining \nhow best to utilize Guard at home during domestic emergencies.\n  Instead of these good policy goals and practices, we have only a long \nlist of unfair and ill-conceived decisions from the Pentagon that do \nvery little to support the Guard in reality. And these examples are \nonly the tip of the iceberg.\n  Last December, the Army and the Air Force decided to try to make \nprecipitous cuts to the National Guard. The Army sought to cut the Army \nGuard by almost 17,000 soldiers, while the Air Force drove for \nreductions of almost 14,000 airmen. These personnel cuts were made \nwithout consultation with the National Guard Bureau, the States \nAdjutants General, and the Nation's Governors. While Congress was \nsuccessful in turning those recommendations back, the fact remains that \nthe active force still desired to balance its budgets at the expense of \nthe Guard.\n  In late Spring of last year, the Air Force forwarded a list of base \nclosure recommendations the cut deeply into the Air National Guard. The \nclosure list took away flying missions in States in which the Air \nNational Guard is the only Air Force presence in the State. No \nconsideration was made of this crucial link between local communities \nand the armed forces. Nor did the Air Force consider the Air National \nGuard's homeland security capabilities. Why were such ill-advised \nrecommendations made? The reason is that the Air National Guard was not \ninvolved in the force structure review process.\n  Similarly, in 2002, there was no consultation with the Air National \nGuard when the Air Force decided to take away the Air National Guard's \nB-1 bomber units, which, as a GAO study underscored, were cheaper to \noperate, more efficient, and more effective than their active duty \ncounterparts.\n  Further, since September 11, torturous debate has developed in the \nPentagon whenever the National Guard is needed for a large-scale \noperation at home, such as during Hurricane Katrina. We have learned \nthat the Guard works optimally at home when it serves under the \ncommand-and-control of the Nation's Governors, with Federal \nreimbursement, under title 21 of the Federal Code.\n  This title 32 status ensures that locally elected officials remain in \ncontrol of military forces operating at home. Because the National \nGuard comes directly out of these local communities, posse comitatus \nstatutes do not apply. This title 32 arrangement has been used most \nrecently to increase security at the border, but it has previously been \nused effectively to have the Guard provide added security at the \nRepublican and Democratic National Conventions, the G8 Summit, the \nNation's airports, and around the Capitol Building in Washington.\n  There seems to be some kind of reflexive reaction within the \nDepartment of Defense against having the Guard and the Governors remain \nin control of operations at home. In fact, a sizeable contingent exists \nwithin the Pentagon to have the active duty military control the \nNational Guard and other military personnel and assets. So every time \nthere is a natural disaster or other emergency, the Pentagon engages in \na lengthy debate back-and-forth about control of the Guard. To date, \nthese debates have led to sensible outcomes. But it should not be so \ndifficult and uncertain.\n  Finally, the National Guard has little influence at the senior ranks \nwithin the Army and the Air Force. The number of high-ranking officers \nis completely imbalanced between the Guard and the active forces. While \nthe National Guard constitutes a high percentage of our total number of \nground troops, it has just a sliver of the overall percentage of three- \nand four-star general officers. And, while the Air National Guard \nconstitutes a high percentage of the Air Force's mobility assets and a \nsimilarly high percent of its strike assets, the Air Guard has a \nnegligible share of the high-ranking positions, where important \ndecisions are made.\n  The National Guard Empowerment Act seemed to be a logical response to \nthese ill-advised policy positions and imbalanced bureaucratic \nstructure. The entire thrust of the legislation rests in increasing the \nbureaucratic muscle of the National Guard. The idea behind it is to \nprevent some of these ill-advised policies from moving forward. More \nimportantly, the legislation is designed to firmly identify the uses of \nthe National Guard, ensure the force is ready and equipped for its \ncritical homeland security missions by bringing its organizational ties \nin line with its real responsibilities and accomplishments.\n  Specifically; the legislation, as included in the Senate's version of \nthe Defense authorization bill contained four major provisions. First, \nit would elevate the Chief of the National Guard Bureau from the rank \nof lieutenant general to full general.\n  Second, the Deputy Commander of United States Northern Command, the \nmilitary headquarters designed to oversee military forces used in the \nUnited States operationally would be mandated to come out of the ranks \nof the National Guard. Third, the National Guard would be redefined as \na joint bureau of the Department Defense, rather than a branch of Army \nand the Air Force, enabling the Guard to maintain its role as the \nprimary military reserve, while allowing the National Guard to avoid \nbureaucracy within the Defense Department. Finally, the National Guard \nwould have formally be tasked with working with the States to identify \ngaps in their resources to respond to emergencies at home.\n  This proposal is not only targeted, but also modest. Our original \nlegislation, S. 2658, the National Defense Enhancement and National \nGuard Empowerment Act of 2006, would have additionally placed the Guard \nBureau chief on the Joint Chiefs of Staff and given the National Guard \nseparate budget authority. Though we still believe these provisions are \nimportant to empowering the National Guard fully, we listened and \nunderstood the objections of other senators. We dropped those \nprovisions in the amendment to the Defense Authorization bill to reach \na consensus where even more members would agree to the amendment, \nbeyond the already 40 senators who are cosponsoring the baseline \nlegislation.\n  We can all acknowledge that the National Guard is essential to our \nNation's defense, that there has been some questionable policymaking \naffecting the Guard in recent years, and that the empowerment bill \nrepresents a positive step towards strengthening the Guard. Yet where \ndoes the final conference report on the defense authorization bill end \nup on Guard empowerment?\n  Not only does this conference report unfortunately drop the \nEmpowerment amendment entirely, it adopts some incredible changes to \nthe Insurrection Act, which would give the President more authority to \ndeclare martial law.\n  Let me repeat: The National Guard Empowerment Act, which is designed \nto make it more likely for the National Guard to remain in State \ncontrol, is dropped from this conference report in favor of provisions \nmaking it easier to usurp the Governors control and making it more \nlikely that the President will take control of the Guard and the active \nmilitary operating in the States.\n  The changes to the Insurrection Act will allow the President to use \nthe military, including the National Guard, to carry out law \nenforcement activities without the consent of a governor. When the \nInsurrection Act is invoked posse comitatus does not apply. Using the \nmilitary for law enforcement goes against one of the founding tenets of \nour democracy, and it is for that reason that the Insurrection Act has \nonly been invoked on three--three--in recent history.\n  The implications of changing the act are enormous, but this change \nwas just slipped in the defense bill as a rider with little study. \nOther congressional committees with jurisdiction over these matters had \nno chance to comment, let alone hold hearings on, these proposals.\n\n[[Page S10810]]\n\n  While the Conference made hasty changes to the Insurrection Act, the \nGuard empowerment bill was kicked over for study to the Commission on \nthe National Guard and Reserve, which was established only a year ago \nand whose recommendations have no real force of law. I would have never \nsupported the creation of this panel--and I suspect my colleagues would \nagree with me--if I thought we would have to wait for the panel to \nfinish its work before we passed new laws on the Guard and Reserve.\n  In fact, we would get nothing done in Congress if we were to wait for \nevery commission, study group, and research panel to finish its work. I \nhave been around here over 30 years, and almost every Senator here \nknows the National Guard as well as any commission member. We don't \nneed to wait, and we don't need to study the question of enhancing the \nGuard further. This is a terrible blow against rational defense policy-\nmaking and against the fabric of our democracy.\n  Since hearing word a couple of weeks ago that this outcome was \nlikely, I have wondered how Congress could have gotten to this point. I \ncan only surmise that we arrived at this outcome because we are too \nunwilling to carry out our article I, section 8 responsibilities to \nraise and support an Army. We have it in our constitutional power to \norganize the Department of Defense. The Goldwater-Nicholas Act that \nestablished a highly effective wartime command structure and the Nunn-\nCohen legislation that established the now-critical Special Operations \nCommand came out of Congress.\n  If the then-stale leadership of the Pentagon had its way, these two \ncritical bills would never have seen the light of day. Today, however, \nthe Pentagon is just as opposed to the Empowerment legislation, and \ninstead of asserting its power, the Congress is punting--just kicking \nit down the field and out of play.\n  Also, it seems the changes to the Insurrection Act have survived the \nconference because the Pentagon and the White House want it. It is easy \nto see the attempts of the President and his advisors to avoid the \ndebacle involving the National Guard after Hurricane Katrina, when \nGovernor Blanco of Louisiana would not give control of the National \nGuard over to President and the Federal chain of command. Governor \nBlanco rightfully insisted that she be closely consulted and remain \nlargely in control of the military forces operating in the State during \nthat emergency. This infuriated the White House, and now they are \nlooking for some automatic triggers--natural disasters, terrorist \nattacks, or a disease epidemic--to avoid having to consult with the \nGovernors.\n  And there you have it--we are getting two horrible policy decisions \nout of this conference because we are not willing to use our \nconstitutional powers to overcome leadership that ranges from the poor \nto the intemperate in the Pentagon and the White House. We cannot \nrecognize the diverse ways that the Guard supports the Country, because \nthe Department of Defense does not like it--simply does not like it.\n  Because of this rubberstamp Congress, these provisions of this \nconference report add up to the worst of all worlds. We fail the \nNational Guard, which expects great things from us as much as we expect \ngreat things from them. And we fail our Constitution, neglecting the \nrights of the States, when we make it easier for the President to \ndeclare martial law and trample on local and state sovereignty.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  (The conference report is printed in the proceedings of the House in \nthe Record of September 29, 2006.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10810-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10810-S10817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SECURITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR EVERY PORT ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the majority leader will suspend, under the \nprevious order, the Senate adopts the conference report to accompany \nH.R. 4954, the port security bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the passage of this port security \nlegislation marks the first time three Senate committees and their \nHouse counterparts have merged their collective expertise and crafted a \ntruly comprehensive approach to port security. A bipartisan group of \nMembers from both Chambers of Congress dedicated several months to \ndeveloping this bill to better secure America. It is a credit to the \nSenate and the House that each committee involved agreed to pool their \nresources, put aside jurisdictional issues, and reach consensus on this \nbill.\n  This act strengthens security at our land and sea ports, improves our \nmaritime transportation security strategy, and enhances communication \nbetween the Department of Homeland Security and transportation security \nstakeholders. It includes a plan to get our trade activities up and \nrunning again in the event of a transportation security incident. And \nit creates a pilot program which will study the feasibility of scanning \neach of the containers--100 percent of the containers--entering our \nports.\n  This legislation will enhance the collection and analysis of \ninformation about cargo destined for our ports, and this bill aims to \nincrease awareness of the operations at domestic and foreign ports. \nOnce those in industry share important information about cargo in the \ninternational supply chain, we must analyze it quickly. This \nlegislation expedites that process and ensures it begins earlier in the \nsupply chain--before containers even reach our shores. This act \nrequires information about cargo be provided and analyzed before the \ncargo is loaded on a vessel in a foreign port and shipped here.\n  This bill also expands several initiatives with a proven track record \nof success. There are currently five interagency operations centers up \nand running throughout our country. These centers bring together \nFederal, State, and local security enforcement officials to ensure \ncommunication among them. This act expands this effort to each of the \nmajor seaports, and places the Coast Guard in charge of these centers.\n  This act also builds upon the Department of Homeland Security's, DHS, \npast cooperation with foreign governments. The container security \ninitiative, CSI, contained within this bill enables the Department, \nworking in partnership with host government customs services, to \nexamine high-risk containerized cargo at foreign seaports before it is \nloaded on vessels destined for the United States.\n  The Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-T PAT), a \nvoluntary public-private partnership, is also strengthened in this \nbill. The Commissioner of Customs and border protection will now be \nable to certify that a business's supply chain is secure from the point \nof manufacture to the product's final U.S. destination. Under this \nlegislation, whether cargo crosses our border at Laredo or arrives on a \nship from Hong Kong, participating companies' supply chains will \nundergo a thorough security check. This will add another layer of \nsecurity to the C-T PAT initiative. Since this is a voluntary system, \nwe have also included provisions which encourage those in industry to \ngo above and beyond the security requirements already in place. These \nnew incentives include expedited clearance of cargo.\n  Mr. President, while I was disappointed earlier this year by the \nnegative public reaction to foreign investment in our Nation's port \nterminals, we learned a great deal from hearings held by the Commerce \nCommittee on this matter. As a result of those hearings, this bill \nrequires DHS to conduct background checks on all port personnel. \nCurrent law only requires the Transportation Security Administration to \nperform checks on those workers directly tied to transportation at the \nport, or involved in its security. From the Commerce Committee \nhearings, it was evident that a more stringent requirement was needed.\n  To prevent future attacks, we must secure our ports. This bill is a \nmajor step forward in this effort. Senator Inouye is my co-chairman on \nthe Commerce Committee, and I thank him and Senators Grassley, Baucus, \nColeman, Collins and Lieberman for their leadership in drafting this \nbill, as well as the House committee leaders who were involved. I would \nalso like to thank the staff members on each of the committees--they \nhave worked tirelessly on this bill.\n  Our country's ports have become enormous operations. To fully address \nsecurity of our ports, it is important that we appreciate the impacts \nsecurity requirements might have on economic efficiencies in \ntransportation\n\n[[Page S10811]]\n\nand trade. We must strive to be a secure state without becoming a \nsecurity state.\n  Each of the Senate and House committees involved in this bill has \njurisdiction over an area vital to the safety of our ports. Working \ntogether, our committees have developed a comprehensive bill which will \nhelp shield our Nation from future terrorist attacks. It is my hope our \ncolleagues will support this act and move quickly to pass this bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the days before a long recess are always a \nhectic time as we scramble to complete our work. This conference took a \nlot longer then it needed to take, and the events leading up to the \nfiling of this report represented an abuse of the process. The Senate \npassed this bill 3 weeks ago, but the House waited until yesterday to \nappoint conferees. The conferees conducted one perfunctory public \nmeeting last night where no bill language was provided, no amendments \nallowed; and no votes taken in public. In fact, there seemed to be more \ninterest by the majority conferees in determining what additional \nunrelated bills could be jammed into this conference overnight and not \non improving our homeland security.\n  These types of shenanigans really show a lack of respect for the \nmembers of this institution and a disregard for the serious task at \nhand.\n  I was encouraged when this bill passed the Senate 3 weeks ago. \nSenators from both sides of the aisle worked together to pass a \ntransportation security bill for seaports, mass transit, freight rail, \nand commercial aviation systems and actually extended expiring Customs \nfees in an attempt to pay for some of the new port security \ninitiatives.\n  Three weeks later after negotiations with the House, all but the port \nsecurity initiatives were dropped at the insistence of the House \nRepublicans, despite overwhelming support in the Senate. The new \ninitiatives for the mass transit and freight rail system would have \nfulfilled an important recommendation of the 9/11 Commission Report, \nwhich recommended that the Federal Government address a much broader \nrange of transportation security issues in addition to those undertaken \nin commercial aviation.\n  A Democratic amendment adopted in the Senate also would have provided \na source of funding to fund some of the new port initiatives in the \nbill, given the fact that we are not adequately funding current port \nsecurity programs. This meager attempt to begin to fund these programs \nwas also dropped at the insistence of the House Republicans.\n  It has now been 5 years since the attack on the World Trade Center \nand little has been done to make our transportation systems more secure \nother then the obvious improvements in commercial aviation. There is no \nurgency by this administration. One gets the feeling that they believe \nthese transportation security issues are really not a Federal \nresponsibility and instead should be funded by State and local \ngovernments or the private sector. Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff \nscoffed at the idea of spending money to protect Americans who use mass \ntransit, noting that a bomb in a subway car would kill only 30 people. \nOther Republicans, including Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security \nHenkey, have said that they think rail and transit security should be a \nState and local or private responsibility. \n  Democrats believe Government cannot `pass the buck' on protecting \nAmericans from the threat of a deadly terrorist attack to the private \nsector or to our already-squeezed State and local governments.\n  The U.S. mass transit industry has said it needs $5.2 billion in \ncapital expenditures from the Federal Government to protect American \ncitizens from deadly terrorist attacks. But, since 2003, the Federal \nGovernment has only invested a total of roughly $400 million in transit \nand rail security for the entire country, compared to $20 billion on \naviation security during that same period. President Bush's Fiscal Year \n2007 budget completely eliminated rail and transit security grants and \nintercity bus grants, which were funded at paltry amounts in 2006.\n  This is just another example of misplaced priorities. According to \nthe RAND Corporation, there are about 30 terrorist attacks on trains \nand rail-related targets per year. Our close allies in Britian, Spain, \nand India have been the victims of deadly terrorist attacks on rail and \ntransit targets in recent years. Yet Republicans stripped rail security \nout of this bill so they could add unrelated provisions.\n  I am proud of the work of the Democratic caucus on this bill and on \nearlier homeland security measures. It was a Democratically controlled \nSenate that passed a landmark aviation security bill and a \ncomprehensive port security bill immediately after 9/11--over the \nobjections of the Republican-controlled House and the White House. \nThese bills acknowledged for the first time that securing our maritime \ntrade and our commercial air passenger system were national security \nresponsibilities of the Federal Government and should not be relegated \nto contractors or the private sector. Similarly, Democrats have led the \nway in developing and pushing security measures during this Congress \nrelated to ports, freight rail, aviation and mass transit, and I am \nproud of the work the caucus has done on this bill. \n  The port security provisions in here reflect a lot of hard work and \nbipartisan effort, so are worthy of our support. But, I don't take a \nlot of pride in giving the American people half a loaf when it comes to \nsecurity. I think all in all, this is another time that the Republican \nmajority has let the American people down. And I hope that the American \npeople are sick of half a loaf and will agree with me on the need for a \nnew direction.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, just 2 weeks ago, the Senate considered \ncomprehensive legislation to address the transportation security needs \nof this country. That bill was not written overnight. It was the \nculmination of 2 years of bipartisan work within the Commerce \nCommittee, the Banking Committee, the Finance Committee, and the \nHomeland Security Committee.\n  While we have had our jurisdictional debates during the past 2 years, \nthis week we somberly observed the fifth anniversary of the attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001. We set aside those debates, and as a body, came \ntogether and passed a comprehensive bill improving security for all \nmodes of transportation. The Senate passed that bill by a vote of 98 to \n0, and we took a huge step toward making our Nation a safer place to \nlive, work, and travel.\n  I had hoped that today I would be telling my colleagues that the \nHouse and Senate conferees had recognized they had the rare \nopportunity, for the first time in 5 years, to address transportation \nsecurity in a comprehensive manner. I believed they would act in the \nsame manner as we had here in the Senate just 2 weeks ago and would \nreach an agreement on the port security bill that truly reflects the \nbest of our institution.\n  Regrettably, that is not the case. Staff from the Senate and several \nHouse Committees sat down the past 2 weeks and went through hundreds of \npages of text in what was suppose to be, and in fact, appeared to be a \nbipartisan, bicameral process. They did a good job, and the port \nsecurity title reflects their hard work. However, several days ago, \nHouse leadership stymied our efforts to provide a real transportation \nsecurity bill for America.\n  The House leadership effectively hijacked the work of the Senate and \nrefused to include or even discuss anything but the port security \nprovisions of the Senate's bill.\n  Despite this refusal, several of my colleagues came to last night's \nmeeting of the conferees prepared to offer and debate amendments to \nrestore the nonport related security provisions that had been included \nin the Senate-passed bill. As I stated then, while the port security \nprovisions are sound and a big step in the right direction, we must \ntake a comprehensive approach to securing our transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  I was prepared to work into the evening on efforts to restore the \nother provisions. My colleagues should be aware that we did not have \nthe text of the conference report when we met for the first, and what \nhas now become apparent, the only meeting. During the round of opening \nstatements on the conference report, the Chairman of the conference was \nrepeatedly asked when we would be able to offer amendments.\n\n[[Page S10812]]\n\n  In the end, the chairman indicated that we would reconvene in the \nmorning when we had the text of the bill. Because of the chairman's \nassurances that we would meet again, and out of deference to the \nchairman's wishes, several of my colleagues agreed to not offer their \namendments to restore the Senate provisions on rail and truck security.\n  Late last night, we were told there would be no more meetings of the \nconferees, denying my colleagues the ability to have their amendments \ndebated and voted upon.\n  Last night's theater has ramifications for all of us today for three \nreasons. First, we have allowed a rare opportunity to enact \ncomprehensive legislation that would improve the security of our \ntransportation infrastructure to pass us by.\n  Our colleagues who opposed the inclusion of the other transportation \nmodes claim that this is a port security bill only. The fact is, other \nmodes of transportation are just as important and worthy of protection. \nLike the port security provisions, the rail, truck, and transit \nprovisions reflect several years of committee hearings and full Senate \naction.\n  To pretend these provisions were written overnight is a disservice to \nthe expert staff that have worked on these issues for years. It is also \na disservice to our constituents who depend upon these modes of \ntransportation for their livelihoods.\n  The American public deserves better from us. We have waited 5 years \nfor this opportunity and have been fortunate that attacks like those in \nLondon and Madrid have not occurred here in the United States. We \nshould act now to prevent an attack rather than waiting until a tragedy \noccurs.\n  Second, if we are to succeed as a democratic and open institution, \nour ability to work together and rely on the assurances of our \ncolleagues is critical. My colleagues, particularly Senator Lautenberg, \nwho has worked diligently on behalf of his constituents who rely on \nrail and transit and is an expert in the area of rail safety, deserve \nto be heard and be able to offer amendments.\n  To assure him the opportunity but deny him the reality is a \ndisservice to the institution and to the millions of people who rely \nupon the rail and transit systems each day.\n  Third, it has come to my attention that the leadership has decided to \ninclude in the conference report provisions that are outside the scope \nof transportation security issues. These are provisions that our \nfriends on the Armed Services conference refused to allow on their \nbill, and our friends on the Department of Homeland Security \nappropriations conference refused to allow on their bill.\n  It does not bode well for the American public that with the stroke of \none pen we jettison fully vetted rail, truck, and transit security \nprovisions that would have provided enhanced security for the American \npublic. Yet with the stroke of another pen, we add provisions that are \nnot related to security nor fully debated by the Senate and House as a \nwhole.\n  Ultimately, the action of the last few days reflects a lack of \nleadership and a lack of vision about our responsibilities to the \nAmerican people. As a result, what we have before this body today does \nso much less than what is possible and prudent to secure the Nation, as \nwell as ignoring the will of both bodies. More importantly, it neglects \nthe real needs of our transportation security.\n  We have missed a rare opportunity to make our transportation \ninfrastructure more secure. We have missed a rare opportunity to follow \nthrough with the promises we made on the Senate floor just 14 days ago.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport to accompany H.R. 4954, the SAFE Port Act. This legislation \nachieves some important objectives that I have been working on for some \ntime.\n  It will strengthen our port security operations and resources within \nthe United States Customs and Border Protection.\n  It authorizes and approves current programs for securing our Nation's \ntrade, and it provides direction for further strengthening of these \nprograms as technological advances permit.\n  It requires our Federal agencies to cooperate and better coordinate \ntheir contingency planning in the event there is a security breach. In \nsum, this critical legislation will empower personnel in the Department \nof Homeland Security to stay one step ahead of the terrorists who seek \nto wreak economic havoc and physical destruction on our Nation.\n  At the same time, this legislation strengthens our Nation's economic \nsecurity by realigning resources to ensure better efficiency in the \nadministration of customs laws within the United States Customs and \nBorder Protection, as well as trade facilitation functions within the \nagency and elsewhere in the Department of Homeland Security. \nUnfortunately, this legislation falls short in one critical area. The \nSenate-passed bill included robust sections on rail and mass transit \nsecurity. But objections from the House have prevented us from \nincluding those provisions in the conference report.\n  I find this extremely shortsighted. It demonstrates a troubling lack \nof leadership. I want to make clear that I strongly supported the \nSenate-passed provisions on rail and mass transit security, and I \nstrongly oppose their omission from this conference report.\n  But because this legislation contains so many provisions critical to \nthe security of our Nation, I will support the conference report. It is \ncertainly better than the alternative. I hope my colleagues on the \nHouse side realize that we have lost an opportunity here. At a minimum, \nit would take another several months for us to be in a position to \nenact rail and mass transit security legislation into law. In the \nmeantime, this important aspect of our Nation's security will not get \nthe rightful attention that it needs.\n  That being said, this legislation does significantly strengthen our \nNation's security. I want to thank my colleagues, particularly the \nchairmen and ranking members of the Commerce and Homeland Security \nCommittees in the Senate, as well as the chairman of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations of the Homeland Security Committee, \nSenator Coleman, for their constructive engagement with me and Senator \nBaucus these past few months. Together we produced a very good bill, \nmuch of which is retained in this conference report. I urge its support \nso that we can get this critical legislation to the President's desk as \nsoon as possible.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have mixed emotions about the SAFE Ports \nAct we pass today.\n  On the one hand, I am deeply disappointed that the bill that does not \ninclude the essential rail and transit security measures passed by the \nSenate last month. I strongly disagree with the decision to drop these \nprovisions from the conference report. The rail and transit tragedies \nwe have witnessed in London, Madrid, and Mumbai should be evidence \nenough that we should not have passed up this chance to shore up our \ndefenses.\n  On the other hand, I am pleased that our hard work on land and \nseaport security has come to fruition. Working together, we have \nproduced a bill that strengthens the security of our ports while \nensuring the proper flow of trade on which all of our Nation's ports \nand our Nation's economy depends.\n  The easiest way to secure our ports would have been to simply pass a \nbill that mandated fences around our ports and required opening every \ncontainer coming across our borders. But these measures would bring the \nflow of port traffic to a grinding halt and cripple our Nation's \neconomy. It is essential that we strike the right balance on port \nsecurity. I am pleased that this legislation does so.\n  This bill contains important provisions to screen workers coming \nthrough or working at the ports, establishes standards for container \nsecurity devices, authorizes $400 million in port security grants \nannually, and requires a pilot program at three foreign ports to employ \nintegrated container scanning technology on 100 percent of containers \nbound for the United States.\n  The bill also directs the Commissioner of Customs to hire 1,000 more \narmed Customs and Border Protection officers for land and sea ports \naround the country. I have heard from ports big and small that they are \nwoefully undermanned. In fact, in Montana, the port of Roosville \nfinally received state-of-the-art container scanning equipment, but we \ndidn't get the personnel\n\n[[Page S10813]]\n\nto run it, so it sits unused. This bill would ensure that every service \nport in the country, and the smaller ports in their area, won't be \noverlooked by Customs and Border Protection headquarters in Washington.\n  The SAFE Ports Act also authorizes the Commissioner of Customs to \nnearly double the number of Customs and Border Protection specialists \ndedicated to validating the supply chains of participants in the \nCustoms-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism program. The quicker this \nprogram can process participants, the safer, and more prosperous, our \nNation will be.\n  This bill also contains a provision I wrote to direct U.S. Customs \nand Border to begin targeting methamphetamine and its associated \nprecursor chemicals crossing our borders at ports or through the \ninternational mail, and share its findings with various border and drug \nenforcement agencies.\n  I also saw a need to ensure the Customs and Border Protection \nNorthern Border Airwing Branch based in Great Falls, Montana, will have \nsupport facilities needed to cover the 500-mile long border with \nCanada. Customs and Border Protection officials have proposed to expand \nthe branch by adding facilities in Kalispell, Havre and Glasgow. A \nprovision I authored in this bill gives them the ability to move \nforward with that plan. Including this provision was important to me, \nto ensure that Montana's border enforcement personnel have the backup \nthey need to get the job done.\n  All of these provisions I have mentioned are key to enhancing \nphysical security at our ports and along our borders. But it was \nimportant that we do more than that.\n  When Congress passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, we strictly \nprohibited any diminution in the trade functions or personnel committed \nto trade functions at the Department of Homeland Security. Yet for 3 \nyears, the Department has not complied with the law. Trade resources \nhave decreased by as much as 15 percent within both Customs and Border \nProtection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. I fought hard to \nensure that this bill requires the Commissioner of Customs to restore a \nproper focus on the traditional trade mission of his agency.\n  So this act further ensures the Commissioner's commitment to Customs' \ntrade mission by creating an Office of International Trade, headed by \nan Assistant Commissioner, who will be responsible for coordinating \npolicy for all personnel dedicated to the agency's trade functions. The \nCommissioner will also now be assisted in trade policy oversight and \noperations by an International Trade Committee, comprised of the \nAssistant Commissioners of International Trade, Finance, Field \nOperations, International Affairs, and the Director of Trade Relations. \nFinally, we have also included a mandate for all U.S. agencies involved \nin the clearance of imports or exports to use a single-portal data \ncollection system to streamline the clearance process. I look forward \nto seeing how all of these measures will improve the overall trade \nmission of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n  While far from being the comprehensive transportation security \nlegislation I had hoped the House would support, the bill before us is \na positive step forward. I believe we have struck a good balance \nbetween security and trade. I thank my friend Senator Grassley, the \nChairman of the Senate Finance Committee, for working with me so \nclosely on this, as in so many things. And I want to thank my \ncolleagues for working so hard with Senator Grassley and I to find the \nappropriate balance in this bill. It was a long, difficult journey, but \nwe arrived there together in the end.\n  Thanks and congratulations to Chairman Stevens and Ranking Member \nInouye of the Commerce Committee, Chairman Collins and Ranking Member \nLieberman of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, \nChairman Shelby and Ranking Member Sarbanes of the Banking Committee, \nand of course, my good friends, Senator Murray and Senator Coleman.\n  I also would like to recognize all of the hard-working staff who made \nthe port security legislation before us today possible.\n  On my Finance Committee staff, I credit the tenacity and hard work of \nAnya Landau French, International Trade Adviser. Anya dedicated long \nhours to the Customs Reauthorization and Trade Facilitation Act of \n2006, which served as the basis for many of the provisions in this Act. \nBrian Pomper, Chief International Trade Counsel; Bill Dauster, Chief \nCounsel and Deputy Democratic Staff Director; and Russ Sullivan, Staff \nDirector, were all indispensable to this effort.\n  I would be remiss if I did not also recognize the tireless efforts of \nSenator Grassley's talented, hardworking Finance Committee staff, who \nworked so closely and so well with my own staff. Tiffany McCullen \nAtwell and Stephen Schaefer put in long hours, and Kolan Davis, Staff \nDirector, provided excellent guidance.\n  I also want to thank the many other dedicated staff of the Commerce \nCommittee and the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, \nin particular, Dabney Hegg, Sam Whitehorn, Stephen Gardner, Gael \nSullivan, Channon Hanna, Lisa Sutherland, Ken Nahigian, David \nWonnenberg, Mark Delich, Jason Yanussi, Michael Alexander, Rob Strayer, \nMark Winter, and Ray Shepard. This bill is a result of teamwork and \ncommitment at its best.\n  May the work we have all done keep us safe and strong.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the conference report on H.R. 4954 takes \nimportant steps toward improving security at our Nation's seaports. It \nprovides much needed funding to upgrade security at our ports, which \nare considered to be among our most vulnerable assets. Today, less than \n6 percent of the 11 million containers that come through our seaports \nare inspected. While we have made significant investments in upgrading \nairport security, the administration's budgets continue to shortchange \nthe funding necessary to ensure that the containerized cargo that comes \ninto our country is safe. This legislation takes an important step \ntoward addressing that shortfall.\n  While the need for action in the area of port security is clearly \nevident, we must not forget the other parts of our Nation's multimodal \ntransportation network, at which the need is equally great. The \nlegislation passed by the Senate included provisions aimed at \naddressing threats to public transit, rail, and intercity buses, among \nothers. The Senate took a responsible, comprehensive approach toward \nsecuring our Nation's infrastructure. However, the conference report \nbefore us does not include those titles. While I support the effort to \nimprove security at our ports, I cannot justify ignoring the needs of \nthese other modes of transportation and continuing to leave Americans \nat risk.\n  Moreover, the process by which the decision was made to jettison \nthese critical provisions was sorely lacking in transparency and \naccountability. The conference committee held only a single public \nmeeting, and conferees were not permitted to offer any amendments to \nthe conference report. When the conference committee met, for the first \nand only time in a public venue, I observed that this conference \npresented us with a unique opportunity to address the pressing security \nneeds of our transit systems and to protect the millions of Americans \nwho ride transit every day. I expressed my view that failure to take \nadvantage of this opportunity would be tragic. Unfortunately, this \nconference report adopts the House position on transit and rail \nsecurity--which is that our Nation's transit and rail riders will have \nto wait for another day to see a meaningful Federal commitment to their \nsafety.\n  I want to focus my remaining remarks on public transportation, which \nis within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs, on which I am the ranking member. The transit provisions \nin the Senate bill were based on legislation that passed the Senate \nunanimously in the 108th Congress, and passed again this Congress in \nthe context of this legislation, again unanimously. The Senate bill \nwould have provided grants to our Nation's transit systems to help \nprotect the millions of riders who use subway trains, commuter rail, \nand buses every single day.\n  If there is any question as to whether transit is at risk, one need \nonly look at recent events. This summer, seven coordinated bomb blasts \ndevastated commuter rail trains in Mumbai, India, leaving over 200 \npeople dead and 700 injured. Last year, the London subway\n\n[[Page S10814]]\n\nsystem was the target of a tragic attack that left 52 people dead, and \nin 2004, almost 200 people were killed when bombs exploded on commuter \nrail trains in Madrid.\n  In the United States this past May, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity issued a specific warning to transit systems to remain alert \nagainst possible terrorist attacks. The warning said that four people \nhad been arrested over several months in separate incidents involving \nvideotaping of European subway stations and trains or similar activity, \nwhich, the Department went on to say, provides ``indications of \ncontinued terrorist interest in mass transit systems as targets.''\n  The threat to transit is clear. In response, both the Federal Transit \nAdministration and the Department of Homeland Security have worked with \ntransit systems to identify steps that can be taken to help prevent and \nmitigate attacks. In fact, the greatest challenge to securing our \nNation's transit systems is not a lack of knowledge of what to do, but \nrather lack of resources with which to do it. In the words of the \nGovernment Accountability Office: ``Obtaining sufficient funding is the \nmost significant challenge in making transit systems as safe and secure \nas possible.''\n  Despite the record of attacks against transit overseas and the \nidentified vulnerabilities here at home, the Federal Government's \nresponse to the needs of America's transit systems--which provide 32 \nmillion trips every weekday--has thus far been inadequate. In an \neditorial published shortly after the London subway bombings, the \nBaltimore Sun stated that, ``Since September 11, 2001, the Federal \nGovernment has spent $18 billion on aviation security. Transit systems, \nwhich carry 16 times more passengers daily, have received about $250 \nmillion. That is a ridiculous imbalance.''\n  To begin to address this issue, I worked closely with Chairman Shelby \nand with Senator Reed of Rhode Island, who have been leaders on this \nissue, on the Public Transportation Terrorism Prevention Act, which was \nincorporated into the Senate version of H.R. 4954. The Senate bill \nauthorized $3.5 billion over 3 years in security grants for our \nNation's public transportation systems. That money would have been \navailable for projects designed to resist and deter terrorist attacks, \nincluding surveillance technologies; tunnel protection; chemical, \nbiological, radiological, and explosive detection systems; perimeter \nprotection; employee training; and other security improvements.\n  Let me give one example of a critical need right here with respect to \nWashington's Metro. Their greatest security need is a backup operations \ncontrol center. This need was identified by the Federal Transit \nAdministration in its initial security assessment and then identified \nagain by the Department of Homeland Security in its subsequent security \nassessment. This critical need remains unaddressed because it has been \nunfunded. The Senate bill would have authorized the funding to make \nthis and other urgently needed security upgrades at transit systems \naround the country.\n  We know that transit systems are potential targets for terrorist \nattacks. We know the vital role these systems play in our Nation's \neconomic and security infrastructure. We can wait no longer to address \nthe critical security needs of America's transit systems. The Senate \nhas passed transit security legislation unanimously in each of the last \ntwo Congresses. By adopting the House of Representatives' do-nothing \nposition on transit in this conference report, we have lost a unique \nopportunity to help protect the millions of Americans who use transit \nevery day.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the Security and Accountability for \nEvery Port, or SAFE Port, Act marks a significant advancement for the \nsecurity of our ports, authorizing $400 million for critical port \nsecurity grant programs and enabling all ports--not merely a select \nfew--to become eligible to apply for that funding. These improvements \nare desperately needed to help close one of our most dangerous security \nvulnerabilities.\n  But when the Senate approved our version of this bill, it was a \nbroader, comprehensive transportation security bill. It was not limited \nto the security of our ports but extended to several other modes of \ntransportation--namely, rail, transit, trucking, and pipelines. It \nauthorized over $4.5 billion for the security of mass transit systems, \nfreight railroads, and passenger rail.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican leadership, acting alone and without \nparticipation from the appointed Democratic conferees, stripped those \nprovisions from the bill we are voting on tonight. I am deeply \ndisappointed that conferees were never given an opportunity to frankly \ndiscuss and amend the conference report, even when Member after Member \nasked for that opportunity.\n  This unilateral, partisan process also resulted in the eleventh hour \ninsertion of a bill that purportedly outlaws Internet gambling but \nwhich may have unintended consequences. This issue clearly deserves \nmore deliberation, and it is unfortunate that such a measure has been \nadded to a critical bill designed to protect the Nation's ports, \nlegislation which this Congress must pass. I hope that the Senate will \nreturn to this issue and give it the attention it deserves, in the \nfuture.\n  On the issue which is what this bill is about, securing our homeland, \nwe had a golden opportunity to present the President with legislation \nto enhance the security of our rail and transit systems. Fourteen \nmillion people ride the rails every day in America, and Connecticut is \nno different, where 110,000 people use the New Haven MTA line each day. \nImproving security for rail and transit is an enormous concern and it \nshould have been addressed tonight, rather than in a future Congress.\n  It is unfortunate that the bill no longer contains most of the well-\nadvised Senate provisions which would have strengthened our open and \nhighly vulnerable rail and transit systems. While the rail and transit \nprovisions authorized a large sum of money, it is but a fraction of \nwhat the experts say is needed to address rail and transit \nvulnerabilities--vulnerabilities which have been exploited time and \nagain by terrorists in London, Madrid, and Mumbai. I regret that the \nmoney was stripped out of the bill and that I was prevented from even \ntrying to reinstate it by offering an amendment in a conference that \nwas never formally completed.\n  Nevertheless, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the port \nsecurity legislation at the heart of this conference report and to have \nworked with my colleagues in the Senate and House to craft the port \nsecurity provisions we will be voting on shortly.\n  Let me thank Senators Collins, Murray, Coleman, Stevens, and Inouye \nfor their hard work not only in bringing a comprehensive, bipartisan \nport security bill before the Senate but also for expertly guiding it \ntoward a 98 to 0 vote, and now through conference. I would also like to \ntip my hat to Senators Grassley and Baucus of the Finance Committee for \ntheir hard work as well.\n  Mr. President, 95 percent of our international trade flows through \nour ports. Prior to 9/11, the main goal was to move these goods through \nour ports efficiently. Since 9/11, we have come to realize we need to \nbring security into that equation but without harming our economy which \ndepends on international trade.\n  It is a tricky--but imperative--balancing act.\n  The 9/11 Commission reported that ``major vulnerabilities still exist \nin cargo [security]'' and that, since aviation security has been \nsignificantly improved since 9/11, ``terrorists may turn their \nattention to other modes. Opportunities to do harm are as great, or \ngreater, in maritime and surface transportation.''\n  Just last month, RAND's Center for Terrorism Risk Management Policy \npublished a report titled: ``Considering the Effects of a Catastrophic \nTerrorist Attack'' that considered the effects of a nuclear weapon \nsmuggled in a shipping container sent to the Port of Long Beach and \ndetonated on a pier.\n  The potential short- and long-term effects truly are devastating. The \nreport estimated that up to 60,000 people might die instantly from the \nblast or radiation poisoning, with 150,000 more exposed to hazardous \nlevels of radiation.\n  The blast and the fires could completely destroy both the Port of \nLong Beach and the Port of Los Angeles and every ship in the port. As \nmany as 6\n\n[[Page S10815]]\n\nmillion people might have to be evacuated from the Los Angeles area and \nanother 2 to 3 million from the surrounding area might have to relocate \ndue to the fallout. Short-term costs could exceed $1 trillion.\n  Besides the damage to the United States, such an attack would cause \neconomic ripple effects across the globe.\n  The dangerous little secret of port security--and why we need this \nbill--is that we still have very little idea about the contents of \nthousands of containers that are shipped into and across the heart of \nthis Nation every day. Just 5 or 6 percent of those containers are \nphysically inspected.\n  While Senator Collins and I began working on port security \nlegislation in late 2004, the truth is port security received a major \nshot of adrenaline after the Dubai Ports World controversy earlier this \nyear.\n  Looking back on it, perhaps we should be thankful for that uproar, \nsince it raised the collective consciousness of the American people and \nMembers of Congress to the vulnerabilities that we face at our ports.\n  Following that skirmish, the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee marked up the GreenLane bill, and later, Senator \nCollins and I started working with the Senate Commerce and Finance \nCommittees, as well as our House colleagues to craft the comprehensive \nlegislation we are voting on today.\n  The SAFE Port Act builds on the GreenLane foundation by providing \nboth direction and much needed resources to port security. The bill \nmoves us closer toward the goal of inspecting all of the containers \nentering the United States through our ports. The legislation requires \nDHS to establish a pilot program to inspect 100 percent of all \ncontainers bound for the United States from three foreign ports within \n1 year and then report to Congress on how DHS can expand that system. \nWe should move toward 100 percent inspection as fast as we can, \nunderstanding that we are at cross purposes if commerce slows to a \nhalt. This legislation will provide us critical information about how \nsoon we can achieve this goal.\n  This bill authorizes port security grant, training, and exercise \nprograms, with a $400-million grant program for which all ports can \napply. And it requires DHS to deploy both radiation detection and \nimaging equipment to improve our ability to find dangerous goods and \npeople being smuggled into the United States.\n  DHS says it will deploy radiation portal monitors at all of our \nlargest seaports by the end of 2007. But this solution is only half of \nthe equation. To provide real port security, radiation detection \nequipment must be paired with imaging equipment capable of seeing \nthrough dense materials that might shield radiation. This legislation \nrequires DHS to develop a strategy for deploying both types of \nequipment, as does the three-port pilot program for screening 100 \npercent of containers.\n  Lastly, since most experts agree that the next terrorist attack is a \nmatter of when, not if, this bill requires DHS to develop a plan to \ndeal with the effects of a maritime security incident, including \nprotocols for resuming trade and identifying specific responsibilities \nfor different agencies. I cannot stress the importance of this \nprovision enough. The private sector and our global partners must have \nconfidence that we can mitigate an economic disruption with the least \namount of harm to our trading partners and foil terrorism's chief goal, \nwhich is to instill chaos.\n  Mr. President, again let me stress that the absence of funding for \nrail and transit security is a major omission that leaves wide open an \nentire transportation sector that we know from history is an appealing \ntarget for terrorists.\n  Nevertheless, when it comes to our ports, the SAFE Port Act will move \nus one giant step closer to better security by building a robust \nsecurity regime domestically and abroad and by providing the resources \nnecessary to protect the American people and our global economy.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, tonight the Senate is voting on the port \nsecurity conference report. While the conference report contains \nimportant provisions to secure our Nation's ports, I am disappointed \nthat the House of Representatives refused to accept the Senate bill's \ntransit and rail security provisions. This is particularly troubling in \nlight of the inclusion in the conference report of extraneous matter \nnot debated by the full Senate and not related to our nation's \nsecurity.\n  While our Nation acted quickly after 9/11 to secure our airports and \nairplanes, major vulnerabilities remain in maritime and surface \ntransportation. As the 9/11 Commission concluded ``opportunities to do \nharm are as great, or greater, in maritime and surface transportation'' \nas in commercial aviation. Unfortunately, this conference report will \nleave our surface transportation system vulnerable.\n  Transit agencies around the country have identified in excess of $6 \nbillion in transit security needs--$5.2 billion in security-related \ncapital investment and $800 million to support personnel and related \noperation security measures to ensure transit security and readiness.\n  The Senate-passed port security bill contained a provision I \ncoauthored with Banking Committee Chairman Shelby, Ranking Member \nSarbanes, and Senator Allard that authorized a needs-based grant \nprogram within the Department of Homeland Security to identify and \naddress the vulnerabilities of our Nation's transit systems. The Senate \nbill provided $3.5 billion over the next 3 years to transit agencies \nfor projects designed to resist and deter terrorist attacks, including \nsurveillance technologies, tunnel protection, chemical, biological, \nradiological, and explosive detection systems, perimeter protection, \ntraining, the establishment of redundant critical operations control \nsystems, and other security improvements.\n  Transit is the most common, and most vulnerable, target of terrorists \nworldwide, whether it is Madrid, London, Moscow, Tokyo, Israel, or \nMumbai. According to a Brookings Institution study, 42 percent of all \nterrorist attacks between 1991 and 2001 were directed at mass transit \nsystems.\n  Transit is vital to providing mobility for millions of Americans and \noffers tremendous economic benefits to our Nation. In the United \nStates, people use public transportation over 32 million each weekday \ncompared to two million passengers who fly daily. Paradoxically, it is \nthe very openness of the system that makes it vulnerable to terrorism. \nWhen one considers this and the fact that roughly $9 per passenger is \ninvested in aviation security, but less than one cent is invested in \nthe security of each transit passenger, the need for an authorized \ntransit security program is clear.\n  Transit agencies and the women and men who operate them have been \ndoing a tremendous job to increase security in a post 9/11 world, but \nthere is only so much they can do with the very limited resources at \ntheir disposal. Our Nation's 6,000 transit agencies face a difficult \nbalancing act as they attempt to tighten security and continue to move \npeople from home to work, school, shopping, or other locations \nefficiently and affordably. This conference report should have provided \nfor these workers and transit riders' safety and it did not.\n  With energy prices taking a larger chunk out of consumers' \npocketbooks, public transit offers a solution to our national energy \ncrisis and dependence on foreign oil. But, more Americans will not use \ntransit unless they feel safe. When it comes to protecting our homeland \nagainst a terrorist attack, we can and must do more to fortify our \nports, our transit systems, and our rail system. Our priorities must be \nto ensure that we are doing all we can to protect our most important \nasset our--citizens. Unfortunately, this conference report falls short \nby failing to include rail and transit security, and once again the \nRepublican-led Congress has missed an important opportunity.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I have serious concerns about extraneous \nprovision that was included in the port security conference report. The \ninternet gaming prohibition which was included in the conference report \nat the eleventh hour has been opposed by banks, convenience stores, \nAmerican Indian tribes, religious groups, and a Government agency--the \nNational Indian Gaming Commission.\n  There are several troublesome attributes to this legislation, but \nperhaps\n\n[[Page S10816]]\n\nnone more so than how it became included in the port security \nconference report. This legislation was never approved by the Senate \nBanking Committee nor debated by the full Senate. Many unresolved \nconcerns exist about this legislation regarding the impact it will have \non the banking and gambling industry, an effect that could be in the \nbillions of dollars.\n  I strongly support firm regulation and oversight of the gambling \nindustry, but this legislation is unequal in its treatment of gambling \nactivities creating specific carve outs for horse racing while not \nproviding similar treatment for other gambling entities. As expressed \nin the opposition letter of the National Indian Gaming Commission, the \nFederal agency charged with oversight of Indian Gaming, this \nlegislation could have unintended consequences that will have negative \nand far reaching effects on the Indian Gaming industry. Moreover, this \nlegislation charges banks with a responsibility for regulating the wire \ntransfers that could potentially place an undue burden on the small \nindependent banks that serve countless South Dakotans and others on \nmain streets across the country.\n  At the very least, the effects of this legislation needed to be \nstudied and analyzed by the full Senate before final passage. While I \nnow have no choice but to vote for Defense legislation at a time when \nour Nation is at war, I deeply resent the Republican leadership \nshopping this unrelated matter into a must pass bill. The inclusion of \nthe Internet Gambling provision in a must pass bill at the last minute \nis irresponsible legislation.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I support the SAFE Port Act. Simply put--\nthis historic legislation will make us safer.\n  The result of inaction will be disastrous. The stakes are just too \nhigh. In a recent estimate, a 10-to-20 kiloton nuclear weapon detonated \nin a major seaport would kill 50,000 to one million people and would \nresult in direct property damage of $50 to $500 billion, losses due to \ntrade disruption of $100 billion to $200 billion, and indirect costs of \n$300 billion to $1.2 trillion.\n  FBI Director Robert Mueller, ominously assessed the terrorist threat \nat the annual Global Intelligence Briefing by stating he is very \nconcerned ``with the growing body of sensitive reporting that continues \nto show al-Qa'ida's clear intention to obtain and ultimately use some \nform of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or high-energy \nexplosives in its attacks against America.''\n  Many terrorism experts believe that maritime container shipping may \nserve as an ideal platform to deliver these weapons to the United \nStates. In fact, we recently saw that containers may also serve as \nideal platforms to transport potential terrorists into the United \nStates. This was demonstrated on January 15 and again on April 2 of \nthis year when upwards of 30 Chinese immigrants were found emerging \nfrom containers arriving at the Port of Los Angeles. The Subcommittee's \nconcern is that smuggled immigrants could include members of terrorist \norganizations--and/or--that the container could have contained a weapon \nof mass destruction.\n  As the 9/11 Commission put it so succinctly, ``opportunities to do \nharm are as great, or greater, in maritime or surface transportation.'' \nSince 90 percent of global trade moves in maritime containers, we can \nnot allow these containers to be utilized to transport weapons of mass \ndestruction. The consequences of such an event would be devastating to \nour way of life and our economy.\n  Instead, we must secure our supply chain before we pay the high price \nof an attack, and seek the appropriate balance between two often \ncompeting priorities: security and speed. This balancing act resulted \nin the creation of two prominent homeland security programs--the \nContainer Security Initiative, or CSI, and the Customs-Trade \nPartnership Against Terrorism, or C-TPAT. CSI effectively pushed our \nborders out by placing CBP offices in foreign ports to inspect \ncontainers before they reach our shores. C-TPAT exemplified a true \npublic-private partnership, in which the private sector took a leading \nrole in securing its supply chain. These programs alone are laudable--\nbut due to the sheer magnitude of the challenge of securing the global \nsupply chain--we must continue to improve upon these promising \ninitiatives.\n  With that in mind, as Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, I have directed the Subcommittee's 3-year effort to \nbolster America's port security and supply chain security. We have \nidentified numerous weaknesses in our programs that secure the global \nsupply chain. A brief overview of these problems illustrates the \nchallenges confronting these efforts:\n  In CSI, the Subcommittee found that only a de minimus number of such \nhigh-risk containers are actually inspected. In fact, the vast majority \nof high-risk containers are simply not inspected overseas. To make \nmatters worse, the U.S. Government has not established minimum \nstandards for these inspections.\n  The Subcommittee initially found that an overwhelming proportion of \nC-TPAT companies enjoy the benefits before DHS conducts a thorough on-\nsite inspection, called a validation. As of July 2006 this proportion \nhas improved considerably to where 49 percent of the participating \ncompanies have been subjected to a validation. But this still leaves 51 \npercent of companies that have not been subjected to any legitimate, \non-site review to ensure that their security practices pass muster.\n  The Subcommittee found that DHS uses a flawed system to identify \nhigh-risk shipping containers entering U.S. ports. According to CBP \nofficials, the Automated Targeting System or ATS is largely dependent \non ``one of the least reliable or useful types of information for \ntargeting purposes,'' including cargo manifest data and bills of \nlading. Moreover, the Subcommittee found that this targeting system has \nnever been tested or validated, and may not discern actual, realistic \nrisks.\n  Currently, only 70 percent of cargo containers entering U.S. ports \nare screened for nuclear or radiological materials. One part of the \nproblem is that the deployment of radiation detection equipment is \nwoefully behind schedule. As of August 29, 2006, the Department of \nHomeland Security has deployed only 43 percent of the necessary \nradiation monitors at priority seaports.\n  These are just a handful of the significant problems discovered by \nthe Subcommittee. In short, America's supply chain security remains \nvulnerable. Our enemies could compromise the global supply chain to \nsmuggle a Weapon of Mass Destruction, WMD, or even terrorists, into \nthis country. This legislation tackles these concerns--and many other \nweaknesses--in a coherent and comprehensive manner.\n  The SAFE Port Act addresses the problem of inadequate nuclear and \nradiological screening, by requiring the Secretary of DHS to develop a \nstrategy for deployment of radiatioction capabilities and mandating \nthat, by December 2007, all containers entering the United States \nthrough the busiest 22 seaports shall be examined for radiation; \nrequires DHS to develop, implement, and update a strategic plan improve \nthe security of the international cargo supply chain. In particular the \nplan will identify and address gaps, provide improvements and goals, \nand establish protocols for the resumption of trade after a critical \nincident; requires DHS to identify and request reliable and essential \ninformation about containers moving through the international supply \nchain; requires DHS to promulgate a rule to establish minimum standards \nand procedures for securing containers in transit to the U.S.; provides \nCongressional authorization for the CSI program, empowering cap to \nidentify, examine or search maritime containers before U.S.-bound cargo \nis loaded in a foreign port as well as establish standards for the use \nof scanning and radiation detection equipment at CSI ports; and \nauthorizes C-TPAT and establishes certain minimum security and other \nrequirements that applicants must meet to be eligible for C-TPAT \nbenefits.\n\n  Even if we pass this legislation, our job is not completed. We still \nneed to look to the future and develop even more effective and advanced \nprograms and technology. Effectively scanning containers with both an \nx-ray and a radiation scan is the only definitive answer to the \nperplexing and most important question of ``what's in the box?''\n  However, in fiscal year 2005, only 0.38 percent of containers were \nscreened\n\n[[Page S10817]]\n\nwith a nonintrusive imaging device and only 2.8 percent of containers \nwere screened for radiation prior to entering the United States. DHS' \nefforts have improved somewhat from last year's paltry numbers, but we \nhave more work to do. To date, DHS still uses a risk-based approach \nthat targets only high-risk containers. While this approach is \nfundamentally sound, the system used to target high-risk containers has \nyet to be validated or proven to accurately identify high-risk \ncontainers. Moreover, the validity of the intelligence used to enhance \nthis system's targeting ability is increasingly in question. Thus, we \nneed to both enhance our targeting capability and use technology to \nenhance our ability to increase inspections--without impeding the flow \nof commerce.\n  While the United States currently inspects approximately 5 percent of \nall maritime containers, the partial pilot test in the Port of Hong \nKong demonstrates the potential to scan 100 percent of all shipping \ncontainers. Each container in the Hong Kong port flows through an \nintegrated system featuring an imaging machine, a radiation scan, and a \nsystem to identify the container. Coupling these technologies together \nallows for the most complete scan of a container currently available. \nThe Hong Kong concept or similar technology holds great promise and \ncould lead to a dramatic improvement in the efficacy of our supply \nchain security.\n  I am pleased to say that this legislation develops a pilot program in \nthree foreign seaports, each with unique features and varying levels of \ntrade volume to test integrated scanning systems using non-intrusive \ninspected radiation detection equipment. It requires full-scale pilot \nimplementation within 1 year after enactment and an evaluation report \nwould be required to be submitted to Congress 120 days after full \nimplementation of the pilot. If the pilot programs prove successful, \nthen full-scale implementation would follow.\n  The bottom line is this: we are safer now than we were yesterday, but \nwe are not safe enough. The question then becomes: how do we get there? \nIn the words of the hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, ``A good hockey player \nplays where the puck is. A great hockey player plays where the puck is \ngoing to be.'' In other words, we cannot safeguard a post 9/11 America \nby using pre-9/11 methods. If we think that the terrorists are not \nplotting their next move, we are mistaken. We must find where the gaps \nare in our Nation's homeland security and close them before an attack \nhappens. That is the only way to guarantee our security.\n  I agree with what Secretary Chertoff articulated at our full \nCommittee DHS budget hearing, ``the worst thing would be this: to have \na program for reliable cargo that was insufficiently robust so that \npeople could sneak in and use it as a Trojan Horse. That would be the \nworst of all worlds.'' By reforming and strengthening C-TPAT, CSI, ATS, \nby expediting the, deployment of sophisticated radiation portal \nmonitors and testing the ability to scan 100 percent of cargo before it \nenters the United States, the SAFE Port Act closes gaps in our homeland \nsecurity and makes us safer.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  (The conference report is printed in the proceedings of the House in \nthe Record of September 29, 2006).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10817-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I do want to turn to another very important \nissue. It is an issue the Democratic leader and I have been discussing \nand moving towards. It is on the India nuclear arrangement. I will \npropound a unanimous consent request and comment after that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. 3709, the U.S.-India nuclear bill. I ask \nconsent that the managers' amendment at the desk be agreed to, the \nbill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I support \nthis legislation. I have for many months. This was reported out of the \ncommittee sometime in July. And from that time to today, we have given \nthe majority a proposal for a limited number of amendments. When we get \nback after the election--I have spoken to the majority leader--\ncertainly there is a commitment from us that we would complete this \nbill very expeditiously. This has been rejected.\n  As I have indicated, this bill has been on the calendar since July, \nand it has not been scheduled. We could have acted on this a long time \nago. It was held up initially because of an arms control measure that \nwas placed in the bill by Senator Lugar. And a number of people on the \nmajority side, the Republican side, held this up. It took a lot of \ntime. It was not brought forward. And that is unfortunate.\n  So I will object to this consent request. I look forward to working \nwith the majority leader in November to complete this act. It is very \nimportant. I acknowledge that. I hope, certainly, we can do that during \nthe lame-duck session. It is one of my priorities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I know my distinguished Democratic \ncolleague agrees with me about the need to enact this United States-\nIndia Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act.\n  Therefore, once again, I am disappointed that this Senate is \nprevented from passing this important legislation by their objection.\n  All Republican Members of the Senate are prepared, this evening, to \npass the managers' amendment to the legislation without any debate or \namendment. But it is clear the Democrats will not allow us to do so.\n  The reason so many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nare not prepared to pass the legislation is that in some cases they \noppose it and wish to defeat it, and in other cases, a lot of \namendments. In my opinion and the opinion of other Republican Members \nof the Chamber, there really is no need to further amend the managers' \namendment. It was carefully worked out between Chairman Lugar and \nRanking Member Biden of the Committee on Foreign Relations. They have \ndone an outstanding job working on that bill and refining that bill \nthat was reported by their committee. It is a tribute to their fine \nwork, to their dedication, to their hard work that all concerns with \nthat legislation, at least on our side of the aisle, have been fully \naddressed.\n  The reason I have continued to push for it is because it means that \nnow that we have this recess, we will not be able to get back to it \nuntil November. And this means we just lose valuable time in working \nout differences between S. 3709 and the corresponding bill that has \nalready been approved by the House of Representatives for several weeks \nnow. So that is the reason I have tried to work out a reasonable way of \naddressing this and have not been successful to date.\n  So with that, Mr. President, I hope we will be able to do this just \nas soon as possible. If there is no progress made on the other side \nbetween now and November in narrowing down the large number of \namendments on the other side, we would have to take the measure up \nunder cloture. That is not the way I would want to proceed. When I look \nat the large number of amendments on the other side, though, it looks \nlike we would have no alternative. I assure our colleagues that I \nconsider this legislation very high priority, and absolutely I am \ndetermined to bring it back to the floor at the earliest date \npossible--I hope soon after we return.\n\n[[Page S10818]]\n\n  We have a lot of legislation to do when we come back. We need to get \nto this as quickly as possible. With that, there should be no doubt on \nour side of the determination and President Bush's commitment on this \nmatter and to get this done as soon as possible.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may say a final word. The problem with \nthe managers' amendment, all the amendments are Republicans' \namendments. We don't have the numbers, but I think we have a few \namendments that would strengthen the bill. We have discussed this \npublicly and privately and here is where we are. It is unfortunate. It \nis something that should be done. There is not a country in the world, \nin my opinion, that deserves more attention than India--maybe some as \nmuch as them, but they have been a good partner of ours. I think this \nwould be a step forward for the world and our two countries.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is my understanding the managers' \namendment has been worked out between Senator Lugar and Senator Biden \nto their satisfaction.\n  We all agree that it is critical to do this as soon as possible. We \nhave this promise of a new relationship between our Nation and India, \nwhich is the world's largest democracy, and it is a relationship \nPresident Bush has begun to construct. That can only grow if Congress \ndelivers on the commitment the President put forward to revise the U.S. \nlaw. There should be no doubt about our determination to deliver on \nPresident Bush's commitment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/29/senate-section/article/S10818-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 2006\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
