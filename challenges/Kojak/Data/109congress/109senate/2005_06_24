Mr. President, this morning we will begin consideration of \nthe appropriations process by turning to the Interior appropriations \nbill. Senator Burns and Senator Dorgan are our two managers, and we \nexpect to begin consideration of amendments.\n  Last night, following completion of the Energy bill, we reached an \nagreement on the Interior bill that first-degree amendments are to be \noffered today and Monday. We have commitments from several colleagues \nthat they will be available today to offer amendments, and therefore we \nwill make progress on the bill over the course of the day.\n  I announced last night that no votes would occur today as well as \nMonday. However, we will be in session both days working through the \nInterior bill so that we can finish that bill very early next week. We \nwill start voting on amendments to this appropriations bill on Tuesday.\n  As a reminder, we have scheduled a vote on passage of the Energy bill \nat 9:45 a.m. on Tuesday.\n  Next week, in addition to completing the Interior appropriations \nmeasure, we will also complete work on the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill. It may be possible to consider other \nappropriations matters as we move through the week. As always, we will \nbe turning to additional legislative and executive items that can be \ncleared for action during next week.\n  Again, I thank everybody for their cooperation on the Energy bill. It \nis a tremendous success for this body. Members on both sides of the \naisle came together in order to finish that bill, as we had planned, \nwithin 2 weeks.\n  I will be returning to the floor of the Senate later today with \nseveral statements, including one on the Interior appropriations bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/24/senate-section/article/S7331-7", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7331-S7374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES \n                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2006\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The projects shall emphasize reducing \n     risks to human safety and public health and property and \n     enhancing ecological functions, long-term forest \n     productivity, and biological integrity. The projects may be \n     completed in a subsequent fiscal year. Funds shall not be \n     expended under this section to replace funds which would \n     otherwise appropriately be expended from the timber salvage \n     sale fund. Nothing in this section shall be construed to \n     exempt any project from any environmental law.\n       Sec. 413.

No timber sale in Region 10 shall be advertised \n     if the indicated rate is deficit when appraised using a \n     residual value approach that assigns domestic Alaska values \n     for western redcedar. Program accomplishments shall be based \n     on volume sold. Should Region 10 sell, in the current fiscal \n     year, the annual average portion of the decadal allowable \n     sale quantity called for in the current Tongass Land \n     Management Plan in sales which are not deficit when appraised \n     using a residual value approach that assigns domestic Alaska \n     values for western redcedar, all of the western redcedar \n     timber from those sales which is surplus to the needs of \n     domestic processors in Alaska, shall be made available to \n     domestic processors in the contiguous 48 United States at \n     prevailing domestic prices. Should Region 10 sell, in the \n     current fiscal year, less than the annual average portion of \n     the decadal allowable sale quantity called for in the Tongass \n     Land Management Plan in sales which are not deficit when \n     appraised using a residual value approach that assigns \n     domestic Alaska values for western redcedar, the volume of \n     western redcedar timber available to domestic processors at \n     prevailing domestic prices in the contiguous 48 United States \n     shall be that volume: (1) which is surplus to the needs of \n     domestic processors in Alaska; and (2) is that percent\n\n[[Page S7361]]\n\n     of the surplus western redcedar volume determined by \n     calculating the ratio of the total timber volume which has \n     been sold on the Tongass to the annual average portion of the \n     decadal allowable sale quantity called for in the current \n     Tongass Land Management Plan. The percentage shall be \n     calculated by Region 10 on a rolling basis as each sale is \n     sold (for purposes of this amendment, a ``rolling basis'' \n     shall mean that the determination of how much western \n     redcedar is eligible for sale to various markets shall be \n     made at the time each sale is awarded). Western redcedar \n     shall be deemed ``surplus to the needs of domestic processors \n     in Alaska'' when the timber sale holder has presented to the \n     Forest Service documentation of the inability to sell western \n     redcedar logs from a given sale to domestic Alaska processors \n     at a price equal to or greater than the log selling value \n     stated in the contract. All additional western redcedar \n     volume not sold to Alaska or contiguous 48 United States \n     domestic processors may be exported to foreign markets at the \n     election of the timber sale holder. All Alaska yellow cedar \n     may be sold at prevailing export prices at the election of \n     the timber sale holder.\n       Sec. 415. Prior to October 1, 2006, the Secretary of \n     Agriculture shall not be considered to be in violation of \n     subparagraph 6(f)(5)(A) of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable \n     Resources Planning Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 1604(f)(5)(A)) \n     solely because more than 15 years have passed without \n     revision of the plan for a unit of the National Forest \n     System. Nothing in this section exempts the Secretary from \n     any other requirement of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable \n     Resources Planning Act (16 U.S.C. 1600 et seq.) or any other \n     law: Provided, That if the Secretary is not acting \n     expeditiously and in good faith, within the funding \n     available, to revise a plan for a unit of the National Forest \n     System, this section shall be void with respect to such plan \n     and a court of proper jurisdiction may order completion of \n     the plan on an accelerated basis.\n       Sec. 416. No funds provided in this Act may be expended to \n     conduct preleasing, leasing and related activities under \n     either the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.) or the \n     Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.) \n     within the boundaries of a National Monument established \n     pursuant to the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 431 et seq.) \n     as such boundary existed on January 20, 2001, except where \n     such activities are allowed under the Presidential \n     proclamation establishing such monument.\n       Sec. 417. In entering into agreements with foreign \n     countries pursuant to the Wildfire Suppression Assistance Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1856m) the Secretary of Agriculture and the \n     Secretary of the Interior are authorized to enter into \n     reciprocal agreements in which the individuals furnished \n     under said agreements to provide wildfire services are \n     considered, for purposes of tort liability, employees of the \n     country receiving said services when the individuals are \n     engaged in fire suppression: Provided, That the Secretary of \n     Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior shall not enter \n     into any agreement under this provision unless the foreign \n     country (either directly or through its fire organization) \n     agrees to assume any and all liability for the acts or \n     omissions of American firefighters engaged in firefighting in \n     a foreign country: Provided further, That when an agreement \n     is reached for furnishing fire fighting services, the only \n     remedies for acts or omissions committed while fighting fires \n     shall be those provided under the laws of the host country, \n     and those remedies shall be the exclusive remedies for any \n     claim arising out of fighting fires in a foreign country: \n     Provided further, That neither the sending country nor any \n     legal organization associated with the firefighter shall be \n     subject to any legal action whatsoever pertaining to or \n     arising out of the firefighter's role in fire suppression.\n       Sec. 418. Notwithstanding any other provision of law or \n     regulation, to promote the more efficient use of the health \n     care funding allocation for fiscal year 2006, the Eagle Butte \n     Service Unit of the Indian Health Service, at the request of \n     the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, may pay base salary rates to \n     health professionals up to the highest grade and step \n     available to a physician, pharmacist, or other health \n     professional and may pay a recruitment or retention bonus of \n     up to 25 percent above the base pay rate.\n       Sec. 419.

Under the previous order, the committee \nsubstitute is agreed to and considered original text for the purpose of \nfurther amendments.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, my good friend from North Dakota is running \na little late. I will make my opening statement this morning, we will \nget his remarks, and then we will start moving. We are sort of \nconflicted this morning, as the Chair understands, but we will work our \nway through in accepting for consideration the amendments that will be \noffered to this appropriations bill.\n  Today we begin consideration of the Interior, Environment and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Act, which was reported unanimously by the \nAppropriations Committee on June 9. I appreciate the efforts of the two \nleaders to get this bill to the floor before the recess, in the hope \nthat we can get a few appropriations bills to the President's desk \nbefore the August recess.\n  The bill before the Senate combines funding for the traditional \nInterior bill agencies with funding for the Environmental Protection \nAgency and other related agencies that were previously funded in the \nVA-HUD bill. Having these new agencies under our jurisdiction has been \na real learning experience for me, and a real challenge in some areas.\n  The EPA is an agency with a very broad reach. It administers, in \ncooperation with states and tribes, a long list of environmental \nstatutes including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, Superfund, \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act, and FIFRA, the Federal Insecticide, \nFungicide and Rodenticide Act. As such, the agency has a tremendous \nimpact on all sectors of the economy, on our public health and, of \ncourse, on the environment.\n  I have been approached by many different members and outside groups \nabout attaching legislative provisions that would address EPA rules and \nregulations of one sort or another. On a number of these issues, I am \nsympathetic. But with the exception of language relating to regulation \nof small engines, which I think we resolved in the full committee \nmarkup, this bill is very clean with regard to legislative provisions. \nI hope we can keep it that way. Otherwise the number of potential \namendments would be limitless, and we jeopardize our chances of \nenacting this important bill in a timely manner.\n  The bill reported by the committee recommends a grand total of $26.3 \nbillion in new budget authority. It also matches the subcommittee's \ndiscretionary allocation of $26.207 billion. As always, any amendments \nthat add funding for particular programs must be fully offset.\n  The subcommittee's allocation represents a cut of $534 million below \nthe fiscal year 2005 level for the agencies funded in this bill. That \nis a 2 percent cut. In an appropriations bill that is fairly personnel-\nintensive, a 2 percent cut is not insignificant. Simply keeping pace \nwith pay costs and health benefits for park and forest rangers, Indian \nhealth care professionals, and other critical personnel requires a \nsignificant increase in funding over last year. Those increases, \ncombined with the overall reduction in the size of the bill, mean that \nthe grant programs and construction accounts in this bill are squeezed \nsubstantially.\n  One area where this bill does not include a reduction is in the Clean \nWater State Revolving Fund. This program helps finance wastewater \ntreatments systems throughout the country and serves to protect both \nthe health of the American public and the environment.\n  The President's budget proposed cutting the Revolving Fund from $1.1 \nbillion to $730 million. Given the tremendous need in this country for \neffective wastewater treatment, I could not recommend that cut to the \nSenate. This bill restores every penny of the proposed reduction.\n  So if any of my colleagues are wondering what happened to a \nparticular EPA earmark that they may have requested and trust me, I \nhave heard from many of them, the basic answer is that it is in the \nRevolving Fund. EPA earmarks in this bill are greatly reduced from last \nyear's levels. The same goes for many of the programmatic increases \nthat were proposed in the EPA budget. This bill provides few of those \nincreases. These are simply the tradeoffs we had to make.\n  For the land management agencies funded in this bill, we have focused \non maintaining their core operating budgets while restoring a portion \nof the proposed reductions to capital accounts.\n  We have increased funding for park operations by $65 million over \nlast year, and included $20 million over the budget request for basic \npark operations. I continue to hear from my colleagues and from folks \nback in Montana that they are concerned about park operating budgets. I \nam pleased that we have been able to sustain the large increase for \npark operations provided in last year's bill and have been able to \nbuild on that. Preserving such unique American treasures as Yellowstone \nand Glacier National Park will remain a priority as long as I am \nchairman of this subcommittee.\n  In the Bureau of Land Management, increases have been provided for \nlaw enforcement, weed control and minerals management. While these jobs \nmay not be as glamorous or well known as park rangers or smokejumpers, \nthey are no less important. BLM has an enormous responsibility in terms \nof the sheer acreage it manages, and in meeting the multiple use \nmandate with which it is charged.\n  In the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service, this bill \nrestores a portion of the proposed $166 million cut in the two \nagencies' construction accounts. But we are still left with significant \nreductions from last year's funding levels.\n  As outlined in the budget request, language has been included in the \nbill to facilitate the consolidation and sale of Forest Service \nadministrative sites. In the short term, revenues from these sales will \nhelp fill the hole in the construction and maintenance account. But by \nno means does this address the long term capital needs of the Forest \nService. I am concerned about the reductions we are making in this \naccount if funds are not restored in future years.\n  This bill also supports programs that form the backbone of our trust \nrelationship with American Indians and Alaska Natives. In both the \nBureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service, we have \nprovided increases for the core operating accounts.\n  The bill adds $48 million to the budget request for the operation of \nIndian Programs account, with increases for tribally controlled \nschools, welfare programs and Johnson-O'Malley education grants. Both \nSenator Dorgan and I have long believed that tribal community colleges \nare one of the most effective tools we have to educate our young people \nand further economic development in Indian country. That belief is \nreflected in the funding provided in this bill.\n\n  This bill also provides the full $146 million increase proposed in \nthe budget request for Indian health services, which is a healthy 5 \npercent over last year. That amount includes an allowance for medical \ninflation and population growth for the first time in my memory. There \nis little question that the total need for health care services is \ngreater than the funds we can provide, but within the context of the \noverall budget this moves us in the right direction.\n  For the BIA and IHS capital accounts, we have added $55 million to \nthe amount proposed in the budget request. This leaves us below last \nyear's levels, but will enable those agencies to make continued \nprogress on the projects included in their facilities priority lists.\n  I should also mention briefly the issue of Indian trust reform. This \nis an issue on which this subcommittee and the Department of the \nInterior have spent a great deal of time and money. I wholeheartedly \nshare the belief that we owe it to Native Americans to responsibly and \naccurately manage the lands and funds that the Federal Government holds \nin trust for various tribes and individual Indians. There is little \nquestion this hasn't always been the case. But there certainly is a \ncase--several, in fact--about the degree to which the trust has been \nmismanaged, and what amounts the government may owe as a result. The \nIndian Affairs Committee has been working hard on\n\n[[Page S7364]]\n\nthis issue, and I hope that they can find a reasonable way out of this \nintractable mess.\n  It is pretty clear to me, however, that it makes no sense to spend \nmany billions of dollars on a historical accounting like the court is \ntrying to mandate. It defies logic to think that's what Congress \nintended in passing that American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform \nAct. Instead, this bill provides roughly level funding for the \nDepartment to continue a reasonable level of accounting work, and uses \nthe proposed accounting increase to instead shore up various BIA and \nIHS programs that actually benefit Indian people. That is where our \npriorities should be.\n  About wildland fire management, some areas are experiencing a fire \nseason, but we are getting a little moisture in Montana. We hope to \navoid that this year. Another subject that has long troubled this \nsubcommittee is funding for wildland firefighting. Obviously we have no \nway of knowing how much money will be required for firefighting in any \ngiven year, so we budget based on the 10-year average of suppression \ncosts. In particularly bad fire years, that amount leaves us well short \nof the total need, and forces the Forest Service and the Department of \nthe Interior to raid other accounts until supplemental funding can be \nappropriated.\n  On a small scale, that system works. But in very bad fire years the \nmassive borrowing has been highly disruptive to other important \nprograms. Two years ago I worked with the Budget Committee and others \nto provide a pot of supplemental funding that could only be used for \nextraordinary firefighting needs. That mechanism has been highly \nsuccessful thus far, and I hope that we can continue to work with the \nBudget Committee as we go forward to ensure that we are managing the \nfire program in the most cost-effective and efficient way possible.\n  The bill before the Senate provides a total of $2.513 billion for \nwildland fire management activities, including $767 million for the \nBureau of Land Management and $1.746 billion for the Forest Service. \nThe total includes $492 million for hazardous fuels reduction, which is \nan increase of $28 million over the FY 2005 level. We have also \nprovided funds to restore proposed cuts in Rural Fire Assistance and \nState Fire Assistance. State and local governments are a vital part of \nthe effort whenever fire breaks out.\n  In the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the bill provides $404 \nmillion for Land and Water Conservation Fund programs, including \nFederal land acquisition, Forest Legacy, and the Stateside program. \nThis is somewhat below last year's levels for the same group of \nprograms, but is above the budget request and well above the House \nlevel of $214 million. The fund total includes $30 million for the \nStateside program, which provides grants to states and local \ngovernments for recreation development and land acquisition. The budget \nand the House have proposed to terminate this program. A large number \nof my colleagues have expressed their concern about that proposal, so \nI'm pleased we've been able to keep the program going.\n  Let me close by expressing my appreciation once again to the ranking \nmember of the subcommittee, Senator Dorgan. He and his staff have been \na pleasure to work with, and have helped shape this bill so that it \nreflects the priorities of members on both sides of the aisle.\n  I wish we could have done more in some instances, but in the context \nof a difficult budget I have no reservations about recommending this \nbill to my colleagues. For those of you who may have amendments, I urge \nyou to get them to me and to Senator Dorgan--or our staffs--as quickly \nas possible so that we can complete work on this bill, and move on to \nother appropriations bills before the July 4 recess.\n  Again, I thank my good friend from North Dakota. We share a common \nborder, but we also give thanks that there is the little Missouri \nRiver. So I welcome him this morning and look forward to his remarks.\n  Mr. President, I would add, I may go over to that listening session \non Commerce. I would assume that Senator Dorgan is going to be around \nand you can consult with my staff and kind of manage things. Don't get \ntoo frisky and we will get this bill out of here by Tuesday noon.\n  I thank my ranking member.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if my colleague from Montana is going to \nbe leaving the floor for a period, as I understand, to go to a \nlistening session in the Commerce Committee--if he is going to be gone \nfor some while, I may get a lot of legislating done on the floor of the \nSenate. But we will see. Actually, I will consult closely with Senator \nBurns's staff. We have worked well together and we put together a piece \nof legislation that was hard to do.\n  I want to just tell those who think there are no spending cuts, this \nbill that is brought to the floor of the Senate spends $544 million \nless than is spent in the current fiscal year. That means we are a half \nbillion dollars less in spending for the next fiscal year than is now \nbeing spent. Putting together an appropriations bill that cuts a half \nbillion dollars is not a small task. It is hard. There are some areas \nin this legislation that I think we have not done what we should have \ndone. We did the best we could, having to cut a half billion dollars.\n  My colleague from Montana and his staff have been good to work with. \nIt is the case that in the Appropriations Committee, on the \nsubcommittees, there truly is bipartisanship. We work together to try \nto resolve issues in a way that provides a product that all of us can \nsupport. That is the case here today.\n  I will in the course of time offer an amendment that will restore \nsome funds to Indian health. We have desperate conditions on Indian \nreservations with respect to Indian health, and I am going to talk a \nlittle about that today. For example, we restored some funds to the \ntribal colleges. The President was intending to cut that substantially \nin his budget, which really makes no sense to me. We have not only \nrestored those cuts but actually increased it a couple of million \ndollars.\n  So there are many things we have done that my colleague from Montana \nhas described in his opening statement. I think it would not be useful \nfor me to once again review his comments with respect to funding for \nthe Forest Service and the EPA and all of the various accounts in this \nbill. There are many of them. It is a fairly substantial bill. I think \nmy colleague aptly described what we tried to do, things that we have \nsucceeded in doing.\n  He described we have fully funded the EPA clean water State revolving \nfund $1.1 billion. The President proposed a dramatic cut there. We \nrestored that. That is a $370 million increase over the President's \nsubstantial cut.\n  There are a number of things. I will not go through all the details \nonly to repeat what my colleague has said. I want to focus for a moment \non something that I think needs more focus in the Senate, and that is \nIndian health.\n  The reason I do that is I come from a State, as do a number of my \ncolleagues, where we have Indian reservations. We have four Indian \nreservations. We have a genuine bona fide crisis in health care, \nhousing, and education on our reservations. It is easy for people to \nput it out of sight and out of mind and not think too much about it.\n  I have been working with my colleague, Senator Burns, for the last 3 \nyears to increase funding for tribal colleges. I want to read a letter \nthat I read previously to my colleagues because it is such a wonderful \ndescription of the value of tribal colleges. This letter is from a \nyoung woman who wrote to me. This is a woman I happen to know, who has \nquite a remarkable career at this point. But here is the letter she \nwrote to me:\n\n       I grew up poor and considered backward by non-Indians. My \n     home was a two-room log house in a place called the ``bush'' \n     on North Dakota's Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation. I \n     stuttered. I was painfully shy. My clothes were hand-me-\n     downs. I was like thousands of other Indian kids growing up \n     on reservations across America.\n       When I went to elementary school I felt so alone and \n     different. I couldn't speak up for myself. My teachers had no \n     appreciation for Indian culture. I'll never forget that it \n     was the lighter-skinned children who were treated better. \n     They wore usually from families that were better off than \n     mine. My teachers called me savage. Even as a young child I \n     wondered . . .  What does it take to be noticed and looked \n     upon the way these other children are?\n       By the time I reached 7th grade I realized that if my life \n     was going to change for the\n\n[[Page S7365]]\n\n     better, I was going to have to do it. Nobody else could do it \n     for me. That's when the dream began. I thought of ways to \n     change things for the better--not only for myself but for my \n     people. I dreamed of growing up to be a teacher in a school \n     where every child was treated as sacred and viewed \n     positively, even if they were poor and dirty. I didn't want \n     any child to be made to feel like I did. But I didn't know \n     how hard it would be to reach the realization of my dream. I \n     almost didn't make it.\n       By the time I was 17 I had dropped out of school, moved to \n     California, and had a child. I thought my life was over. But \n     when I moved back to the reservation I made a discovery that \n     literally put my life back together. My sisters were \n     attending Turtle Mountain College, which had just been \n     started on my reservation. I thought that was something I \n     would do too, so I enrolled. In those days, we didn't even \n     have a campus. There was no building. Some classes met at a \n     local alcohol rehabilitation center in an old hospital \n     building that had been condemned. But to me, it didn't \n     matter. I was just amazed I could go to college. It was life-\n     changing.\n       My college friends and professors were like family. For the \n     first time in my life I learned about the language, history \n     and culture of my people in a formal education setting. I \n     felt honor and pride begin to well up inside me. This was so \n     unlike my prior school experience where I was told my \n     language and culture were shameful and that Indians weren't \n     equal to others. Attending a tribal college caused me to \n     reach into my inner self to become what I was meant to be--to \n     fight for my rights and not remain a victim of circumstance \n     or of anybody. In fact, I loved college so much that I \n     couldn't stop! I had a dream to fulfill . . .\n\n  This young woman is now a doctor, a Ph.D. She continued in her letter \ntelling me what she was doing. She said:\n\n       I have worked in education ever since, from Head Start to \n     teacher's aide to college professor. Now I'm realizing my \n     dream of helping Indian children succeed. I am a . . . \n     Program Superintendent working with nine schools, three \n     reservations, and I oversee two educational contracts with \n     two tribal colleges.\n\n  Think of this. This young girl grew up feeling hopeless and helpless, \nstuttering, being called a ``savage'' in a school. She, now, is a \nPh.D., helping other children succeed, helping create and nurture an \neducation system that gives others a feeling of hope.\n  The reason I wanted to read that story is this is all about a tribal \ncollege. It is all about giving a young woman an opportunity through a \ntribal college. I can't tell you how many tribal colleges I have \nvisited, but I know that they enrich the lives of those who attend them \nbecause it is an opportunity to step up and out of poverty and \nhopelessness.\n  I recall one day I was asked to speak at a commencement at a tribal \ncollege. I asked the graduates there: Who is the oldest graduate? They \npointed to a woman. They said: She is the oldest graduate.\n  I went over. She was in her mid-forties and she was, on this day, \ngraduating from college. I asked her about herself and I found out a \nbit about her. She was a single mother. I believe her husband had left \nher. I believe she had four children and she was the janitor at the \ncollege, cleaning the hallways and the toilets. She decided that she \nreally wanted to do more than clean the hallways and the toilets in \nthat college, she wanted to attend that college, and she did.\n  She found a way as a single mother to attend that college. The day I \nshowed up she wasn't cleaning anything, she was wearing a cap and a \ngown and a smile. And that smile was a recognition of what she had \ninvested in herself. But she couldn't have done that had there not been \na tribal college, not been Pell grants, not been an opportunity for \nthis country to say to her, through the funding of tribal colleges, \nthrough Pell grants, and through other approaches, that: We want to \nhelp you. We want to offer a helping hand.\n  So there is so much to be done. I am speaking now about education and \ntribal colleges. That is just one piece of it. I am proud to say that \nSenator Burns and I have very substantially changed the recommendations \nof the President. He proposes cutting funding for tribal colleges. We \npropose increasing funding. Why? Because it is the right thing to do. \nIt is investing in people's lives in the right way.\n  The other thing I want to talk about for a moment is Indian health \ncare. I mentioned there is a bona fide crisis in health care, housing, \nand education for American Indians. I have spoken previously on the \nfloor about this.\n  I have talked about a woman who died, froze to death in her bed, a \ngrandmother. She froze to death in her bed on a reservation in South \nDakota when it was 35 below zero, in a home with plastic over the hole \nwhere windows should have been. There were six people living in a very \nsmall space without sufficient beds and a grandmother goes to bed and \nfreezes to death. Most would think from reading that, it is from a \nThird World country. It wasn't. It was from our country. We have \nserious problems on Indian reservations in health care, housing, and \neducation.\n\n  I mentioned education with respect to tribal colleges. Let me mention \nhealth care for a moment because I will offer an amendment dealing with \nhealth care.\n  There simply is not enough money to provide the kind of health care \nAmericans would expect to provide to every child in this country. I \nhave been to reservations to see a dentist working out of a small \ntrailer home, serving 5,000 people. That dentistry is not so much about \ndoing bridgework or fixing a tooth. It is about someone coming in with \nan ache and deciding the tooth has to be pulled because you cannot do \nfancy work in a trailer house when you serve 5,000 people. That is just \nlife on the reservation with respect to the underfunding of Indian \nhealth care.\n  I have held two hearings recently on the subject of teen suicide on \nIndian reservations. I know it is sensitive. These are hearings you \nwould prefer not to be having, to talk about a subject you would prefer \nnot to talk about. But the fact is, we have young people--particularly \nin the Northern Great Plains--across this country, young teenagers on \nIndian reservations who are taking their own lives at the rate of two \nand a half to three times the national average and in the Northern \nGreat Plains 10 times the national average. This is not about \nstatistics. It is about a young person who decides to commit suicide.\n  I have spoken in the Senate previously, with the concurrence of the \nrelatives of this young woman, about Avis Littlewind, the 14-year-old. \nAbout 9 months or a year ago, Avis Littlewind committed suicide. She \nhad missed 90 days of school. She was lying in her bed, missing school, \nin a fetal position, with serious problems. Her sister committed \nsuicide 2 years before. Her dad had taken his life 6 years before. Then \nAvis Littlewind got out of bed one day and went to the closet and they \nfound her there. She had committed suicide. Most are doing it by \nhanging.\n  We have had a cluster of suicides on the Standing Rock Reservation in \nthe last 5 months. I have spoken to the relatives of these young kids \nwho have decided to take their lives. One of the things we discover \nwhen we talk to the psychologists. I went to the reservation where Avis \nLittlewind committed suicide. I talked to the school administrators, \nthose involved in mental health, tribal officials, relatives, to try to \nunderstand how this happens, how does it happen that no one sends up a \nbig warning flag to say, here is a kid in trouble, let's intervene \nsomehow. What I learned there I have known previously, because I had a \nhearing one day on these issues some years ago and the young woman who \nwas in charge of these children's issues testified. She had only worked \nthere about 2 months at this reservation. She said, I have a stack of \npapers on my office floor of allegations of child abuse that have not \neven been investigated. A stack of papers, alleging child abuse in each \nof the folders, with no investigation. Then she said, I cannot even get \na kid to a clinic someplace because I don't have a vehicle so I have to \nbeg for somebody to give a ride to a kid to take them to a clinic, \nperhaps to see a mental health professional. As she began to describe \nthe need to beg for a ride for a kid who is in trouble, she began to \nsob and she broke down and cried. She could not continue at this \nhearing. She quit a month later because she said it was hopeless.\n  My point is we know this is happening right now. Yes, in teen \nsuicide; that is, mental health issues. It is the whole range of health \ncare issues, including substance abuse, devastating substance abuse \nissues with very few in residential treatment beds to deal with it.\n  I will offer an amendment that says it is time for this country to \naddress\n\n[[Page S7366]]\n\nthese issues. We have trust responsibility for the health care for \nIndians. We have a responsibility for health care for people in Federal \nprisons. We spend twice as much per person on health care for Federal \nprisoners as we do to provide health care to American Indians--twice. \nAsk yourself, for a kid who felt hopeless and helpless, who decided to \ntake her own life, shouldn't we face that and decide we have a \ncommitment as a country to meet our trust obligations to provide \nadequate health care? I will offer an amendment regarding that. I \nprobably will do it on Monday. My past experience is the Senate will \nturn it down because tax cuts for wealthy individuals are much more \nimportant than adequate health care funding for Indian children, for \nexample.\n  You say, that is unfair. No, it is not unfair to say that. There is \nplenty of money around here to say those who get money from \ninvestments, ratchet their tax rates down, down, down, so we can remove \nthe burden from people who make millions every year, and say, by the \nway, we don't have enough money left to address the issues of these \nkids.\n  I started this discussion by reading a letter from Loretta De Long, \nwho is now a Ph.D., but who started in school being called a savage, \nwho stuttered, who got into trouble, had a child at 17, moved to \nCalifornia and thought her life was hopeless, as well. Now she is a \nPh.D. She is involved in Indian education. But her letter that I read \ndescribes hope. It describes hope and opportunity and what gave her \nhope and opportunity. Yes, that was tribal colleges and the family \nencouragement to be able to go to a tribal college.\n  My point is simple: We have a big bill here. We have done a lot of \ngood work. In some cases we have come short of what I would like to do. \nIn one area, especially, I am talking about the area in which we have a \nresponsibility to deal with Indian health care, we are desperately \nshort, have always been short. The administration never asks for \nenough--not just this administration, previous administrations, as \nwell--and the Congress is never willing to give enough to provide \nadequate health care to Indians.\n  I hope, perhaps, we can have a broader debate as soon as we are into \nthis bill and perhaps Monday morning I will be able to offer that \namendment.\n  There is much to say about this legislation. My colleague described \nthe EPA, the Forest Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, so many \nareas that are important. We have attempted to do the very best we can \nto provide adequate funding.\n  We are going to be asking for amendments to be offered today and on \nMonday with the understanding that all amendments will be offered by \nthe end of the day Monday, after which we will dispose of those \namendments and then hopefully complete this bill. When we do that, we \ncan go to conference. This is part of that process, this march we \nshould be making to complete our appropriations bills on time, have a \nconference with the House, reach an agreement, and get this funding for \nthe next fiscal year done this way rather than present some big omnibus \nbill that in most cases is exactly the wrong way to legislate, where a \nfew people go into a room and close the door and come out and announce \nto us, we have 800 pages and, by the way, we will vote in 15 minutes, \nand you do not have time to read it nor should you care what is in it.\n  That is the wrong way to legislate. Senator Cochran says he wants to \ndo it the right way, one step at a time. This is one step. It is an \nimportant step because the agencies are important. I hope we can do it \nwith the cooperation of all of our colleagues.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Travel To Cuba\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have here a photograph of a soldier. He \njoined the Army National Guard as a combat medic and went to Iraq. His \nname is Carlos Lazo.\n  Carlos came to my office the other day. That is a picture of him in \nmy office. Carlos is a wonderful soldier. In fact, let me put up \nanother chart that shows you that Carlos won the Bronze Star in Iraq. \nIn the description of the Bronze Star won by this remarkable soldier, \nit says:\n\n       SPC Lazo's courage, initiative, along with his calm, cool \n     composure was instrumental in saving numerous lives on the \n     battlefield and at the BAS all thru this operation.\n\n  They were talking about some very heavy fighting and mortar rounds \nand bombs exploding very close to where Sergeant Lazo was busy saving \nlives. They described the work Mr. Lazo did, this courageous soldier. \nIt was quite extraordinary.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the Bronze Star \ncitation printed in the Record.\n  I show you the Bronze Star citation, which was from last November, \njust in order to tell you that this is an extraordinary person.\n  So Carlos Lazo came to see me on Wednesday of this week. Do you know \nwhy he came to my office? Because he wants to see his kids, and our \nGovernment will not let him see his kids. No, this is not about a child \ncustody fight. His kids are in Cuba. And one of them has been in the \nhospital with a high fever.\n  We have decided in this country to punish Fidel Castro by slapping \naround the American people and injuring their rights to travel. This \nPresident has said that people like Carlos Lazo cannot go to Cuba to \nsee his kids. He cannot visit his kids. It is unbelievable to me.\n  I have been on this floor before talking about the restriction of \ntravel to Cuba. We have people in the Treasury Department who are \ninvestigating Americans because they are under suspicion of taking a \nvacation to Cuba. It is unbelievable.\n  I have brought a picture to the floor of the Senate of Joni Scott. Do \nyou know what Joni Scott did? She went to Cuba to pass out free Bibles. \nWell, guess what her Government did. Guess what the U.S. Government \ndid. They tracked her down and slapped her with a big fine because she \nwas passing out free Bibles in Cuba. A wonderful young woman, filled \nwith spirit and faith, wanting to provide free Bibles on the streets of \nCuba, and this Government tracks her down to fine her.\n  I have shown a picture of Joan Slote, a 75-year-old grandmother who \nis a cyclist who joined a Canadian cycling group to ride bicycles in \nCuba. And guess what they did. While her son was dying of brain cancer, \nthey tracked Joan Slote down, and they threatened to attach her Social \nSecurity payments because they were trying to slap a big fine on her \nbecause she rode a bicycle in Cuba. She did not know you had to have a \nlicense to go to Cuba. She just joined a Canadian group. But, boy, did \nthey track her down. They tracked down Joni Scott and tried to slap a \nfine on her for distributing free Bibles.\n  They tracked down a guy in Seattle whose dad died. His dad's last \nwish was that his ashes should be distributed on the grounds of the \nchurch he served as a pastor in Cuba. So he takes his dad's ashes in a \ncan to Cuba, and they track him down and slap a fine on him. It is \nunbelievable.\n  Now, this young solder, Carlos Lazo, who earned a Bronze Star in \nNovember for bravery on the battlefield. He came from Cuba, by the way. \nHe escaped Cuba. He fled in 1992. He was part of a group that fled \nCuba. Regrettably, the rest of his family was not able to get out. So \nhe has two sons left behind. He has been in contact with his children. \nHe has been able to go back from time to time and visit them a number \nof times under the rules that allowed that kind of family visit.\n  Then, last year, the President decided we are going to tighten all \nthat up. We are shutting all that down. So now Mr. Lazo, someone who \nhas performed heroic service for this country in America's uniform, is \nnow told: Yes, your son has been in a hospital. Yes, he has a high \nfever. But he is in Cuba, so you cannot travel to see him.\n  This Government will not allow this soldier to see his children. Why? \nIs it about him? No, it is not about him.\n  Fidel Castro has poked his finger in this country's eye for a long \ntime, so our country, this Government, this President, wants to injure \nthe rights of the American people to travel in a way to punish Fidel \nCastro.\n\n[[Page S7367]]\n\n  It does not punish Fidel Castro. He has been in office through 10 \nPresidencies. All that does is punish the American people: Joni Scott; \nJoan Slote; and, yes, now Carlos Lazo. Carlos has asked me, ``Is there \nany way you could help me?'' because he has heard me on the floor of \nthe Senate talking time and time again about the absurdity of this \npolicy.\n\n  Let me just say, I don't have any desire to see Fidel Castro remain \nin power. The quicker he is gone, the better. But that will happen, in \nmy judgment, through engagement through trade and travel, just as we \npreach that it will in China and Vietnam--both Communist countries. We \nhave, instead, given Castro his best excuse. He says to the Cuban \npeople, with a sense of nationalism: Of course our economy is in deep \ntrouble because that 500-pound gorilla up north has its fist around our \nneck.\n  It seems to me, after 40 years, when a policy does not work, you \nchange the policy. Yet in this case, after 40 years, when a policy does \nnot work, we have decided to further injure the rights of the American \npeople. I hear all this talk about freedom and liberty. Where is the \nfreedom for this young soldier, who has earned a Bronze Star just \nmonths ago? Where is the freedom of this young soldier to see his son, \nto get on a plane and travel to Cuba?\n  I am asking the State Department and the President to make the right \ndecision here. What on Earth can they be thinking of, deciding Sergeant \nLazo should not see his sick child? When America called, he went to the \nbattlefield. He risked his life. He did his work among bombs and \ngrenades and mortars that were falling all around him--sufficient so he \nreceived the Bronze Star--and now he is told he cannot see his kids?\n  He asks me, What on Earth is happening? Where is the freedom here?\n  Now, I know speaking on the floor about this upsets the people in the \nState Department, who have to follow the dictions of the White House. \nIt upsets the people in Treasury, OFAC, the Office of Foreign Assets \nControl. Incidentally, my colleagues should know there are far more \npeople in the Office of Foreign Assets Control--which is an \norganization designed to track the money to shut down the funding for \nOsama bin Laden and terrorists--there are far more people in OFAC right \nnow working on tracking down Americans suspected of taking a vacation \nin Cuba than there are tracking the money for Osama bin Laden. That is \nshameful, but it is the truth. It has been put in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  My colleague, Senator Baucus, got that information, and so did I. I \nhave asked the Treasury Secretary--I asked the former Treasury \nSecretary, Secretary O'Neill. I said at a hearing: Look, wouldn't you \nsooner use that money to track terrorists as opposed to trying to track \npeople who are vacationing in Cuba? He did not want to answer. I asked \nhim several times. Finally, he said: Mr. Senator, of course I would \nsooner do that. The White House had a press release out instantly \nvilifying the Treasury Secretary for doing that.\n  This is an obsession with this administration. This has nothing to do \nwith good policy. I am not talking this morning about selling wheat to \nCuba. An odd couple--myself and then-Senator John Ashcroft--which is \nreally an odd couple because we are philosophically very different--we \nare the ones who offered the amendment on the floor of the Senate that \nfinally--finally--after 40 years, opened, just a crack, the ability to \nsell food into Cuba.\n  We should never have used food as a weapon. Food and medicine was \nused as a weapon, which I think is fundamentally immoral. Telling our \nfarmers, ``You can't sell food to Cuba'' meant nothing to Fidel Castro. \nHe never missed a meal. Do you think he missed breakfast, dinner, or \nlunch in 40 years?\n  Of course he didn't. It just hurt American farmers and hurt sick, \npoor, and hungry Cubans.\n  So for the first time in 42 years, one day not long ago 22 train \ncarloads full of dried peas left an elevator in North Dakota and ended \nup in Cuba, paid for by cash. The administration opposed that as well.\n  Now they have taken further action. Nearly $1 billion has been sold \nin agricultural commodities by our farmers to the Cubans, and now this \nadministration has decided to tighten that down to try to shut it down.\n  I have more to say about that, and I will speak more about it at \nanother time. It is about farming and it is about agriculture and using \nfood as a weapon, which is fundamentally immoral. This country is above \nthat.\n  But today, this is about this man. It is not about a big policy. It \nis about this man. Can this man see his kids? Can Carlos Lazo--who \nfought for this country in Iraq, who risked his life in Iraq, who \nearned a Bronze Star and was celebrated and honored by his country--\nwill he be allowed by his country to go see his kids?\n  It is unbelievable. Every time I hear another chapter of this book of \nabsurdity coming from this administration with respect to their \nobsession about Cuba, I wonder, Where does it stop? The reason I have \ntaken the floor this morning is because this young soldier came to see \nme the other day and said: Can you help? If logic does not help maybe--\nmaybe--embarrassment will.\n  Perhaps the administration will be sufficiently embarrassed. They \nwere not embarrassed enough to stop trying to find a young woman who \nwas distributing free Bibles in Cuba. Perhaps they will be embarrassed \nby trying to prevent this young man from seeing his children--a young \nman this administration certainly would honor as someone who has done \nheroic things for his country.\n  I am going to call the State Department today. I am going to call the \nWhite House today. I am going to call the Treasury Department today. \nThey will all have the letter I sent. My hope is, they will finally \nfind a way to say yes, it is the right decision, it is the right thing \nfor this country to do.\n  I am here talking about Carlos Lazo, but ultimately this issue is not \njust about Carlos. I hope I can solve this for Carlos. But it is about \nthe broader issue of the administration deciding we are going to injure \nFidel Castro by restricting the right of the American people to travel.\n  It makes no sense at all. My hope is there may be a few other Members \nof the Senate who would be willing to speak out about this absurdity. I \nhope there are a few who are as offended as I am and will decide to \nagain do the right thing.\n  I will report to my colleagues later today about the response of the \nState Department, the White House, and the Treasury Department to see \nwhether they will honor this young soldier, not just by his Bronze \nmedal for heroism on the battlefield but by allowing him to exercise \nthe freedom any American ought to have to see his child.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the Senate is embarking on the \nappropriations process for the year 2006. I think it is important that \nwe start this process by looking at where we are. What concerns me \ngreatly is the fact that we are less than honest with the American \npeople about where we really are today. In fact, if you talk to the \nGeneral Accounting Office, if you talk to economists worldwide, if you \ntalk to economists here, we are on an unsustainable course in terms of \nour fiscal discipline.\n  This chart shows the real numbers for the next few years in terms of \nwhat the deficit is. Washington is notorious about fudging the numbers \nin terms of our obligations. The deficits that are listed coming \nforward through the next 5 years include the off-budget deficit but \nalso the money we are stealing from Social Security, as well as the \nmoney we are stealing from other trust funds, which brings us to a true \ndeficit this year that is going to be about $541 billion. If we divide \nthat $541 billion in deficit by 300 million Americans, and we have less \nthan that, it comes very close to $2,000 per man, woman, and child that \nwe are spending for money we don't have.\n  The appropriation process, as well as the budget process, becomes \nimportant. In 2004, there were 131,000 taxpayers. Our population by \nnext year is supposed to be somewhere around 300 million. The publicly \nheld debt, not privately held, was almost $5 trillion. Based on \nindividuals, the publicly held debt per man, woman, and child, is \naround $16,000. As we can see the course, by the year 2035, if we don't\n\n[[Page S7368]]\n\nmassively change the way this country operates, the individual publicly \nheld debt will be in excess of $220,000 per man, woman, and child. If \nyou divide that by taxpayers, the people who are paying taxes, it comes \nup to $470,000 per taxpayer.\n  This year, as a percent of all the Government is going to spend, 7.5 \npercent is for interest alone on the national debt. If we look at that \nportion of the debt that we have some control over, outside of Medicare \nand Social Security, that percentage of spending is 18.5 percent. In \nother words, $1 out of every $5 that the Government spends today is to \nbe spent on interest, paying for things that we have spent before that \nwe didn't have the money to pay for. So we are digging a hole deeper \nthan we can imagine.\n  The first principle has to be honesty about where we are. Honestly, \nthis year we are at $2,000 per man, woman, and child in spending money \nthat we don't have, which means we are going to borrow it, which means \nwe are going to pay interest on that. Then, next year, we are going to \nhave $500 billion and then, sooner, the trend line is down, but it is \nnot down fast enough for us to get out of the hole.\n  The reason I bring this up is the appropriations process is where we \nhave a chance to do a small amount of good to bring this down faster. \nThis first bill on Interior is a good bill in terms of what it spends \ncompared to last year. But it is important that we bring up some \nprovisions that are in the bill that if, in fact, we are in debt, if \nyou personally find yourself in this kind of debt, 25 percent of the \nmoney you are going to spend you don't have and you are going to borrow \nit, would you be spending money on buying more land, building new \nreception centers, adding things that are not necessary for us to \nfunction?\n  I praise the authors of the bill in terms of keeping within the \nbudget caps. They have done a good job of that. But I have some \nquestions. For example, we are going to spend $162 million that we \ndon't have to buy land--that is for the cost of the land--another $25 \nor $30 million to get that done, then another $25 or $30 million on \nthat land every year hence forward to take care of it, let alone the \nfact that we are taking that land off the public tax rolls. We are \ndiminishing the taxes that will go to the States from that land, and we \nare absorbing them. If we personalized this, would we be doing these \ntypes of things in a budget and financial situation in which we find \nourselves borrowing 25 percent of our budget?\n  More importantly, what is the consequence if we continue to do so? \nThe consequence is that our children and grandchildren end up with a \nstandard of living far below ours. The heritage of our great country \nhas been sacrifice by the generations before to create opportunities \nand prosperity for the generations that are coming. We are about to \nbecome the first generation of Americans to not leave that promise for \nthe next generation.\n  David Walker, Comptroller General of the United States, has written a \nbook everybody ought to read. It is called ``Saving our Nation's \nFuture.'' He outlines the unsustainable course this Nation is on in \nterms of our spending. Quite frankly, we don't seem to have the \ndiscipline, No. 1, to recognize the gravity of the situation in which \nwe find ourselves, the fact that we are going to lay on our children a \ndebt from which they cannot get out.\n  This is what we can control. This doesn't talk about the unfunded \nliabilities associated with Social Security, which are rising $700 \nbillion a year, and yet we are not doing anything to fix; the unfunded \nliability of over $35 trillion with Medicare which we are doing nothing \nto fix, the $8 to $10 trillion cost of Medicare D, a brand new benefit \nthat we don't have any resources to pay for except by stealing it from \nthe future of our children. We fail to grasp the gravity of the \nsituation and the long-term consequences of our inaction today.\n\n  I will be offering several amendments over the next 2 days that the \nSenate is in session, not from a critical point of view but from a \ncommonsense point of view. We have $92 million sitting in accounts now \nto buy land. We are going to make a decision to add another $160 \nmillion, while we borrow $541 billion and charge to it our children? We \nare worse than any credit card addict ever was. There are no \nconsequences for us. We pay no consequences. But the children and the \ngrandchildren are going to pay a severe price for our lack of fiscal \ndiscipline, our lack of long-term vision about what our actions are \ntoday.\n  If we had to, there is no question, across every appropriations bill \nwe have, we could find 10 or 12 or 15 percent that is not absolutely \nnecessary to be spent. The contrast isn't about whether or not we spend \nthe money. It is about where the money comes from and who is paying for \nit.\n  Of all the issues the Senate will discuss--we will talk about all \nsorts of social issues, and we will talk about the ethics of it and the \nmorals of it--none of them compares to the immorality of putting our \nchildren and grandchildren in debtor's prison. That is what we are \ndoing. We need to be talking individually about things that don't have \nto get done today, that can be deferred for the future, and saving that \nmoney today so that we don't compound the debt for our children.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a question.\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. First of all, the chart the Senator uses about deficits \nand accumulated debt, he describes something that is very real, that is \na threat to this country's long-term economic future. There is no \nquestion about that. I have spoken about it with respect to both the \nfiscal policy of this country and our trade policy. Our trade policy \nhas created the largest debt in the history of the country by far. I \nwanted to mention that the House of Representatives approved \nlegislation for another $45 billion in an emergency supplemental. That \ncomes on the heels of the $81 billion we approved. The Senate is going \nto approve the requested emergency supplemental because we are going to \nrestore the funds that the Pentagon says they need to prosecute the war \nin Iraq.\n  But it is interesting, for the $81 billion that we just passed, $45 \nbillion which now comes on the heels of that, not a penny of it is paid \nfor. The administration keeps saying--and these are big numbers--we \nhave to pay for that which we are doing, and we need to restore these \naccounts to the U.S. Army. All of us say, yes, we not going to send \nsoldiers to do a job and not provide the funds necessary. But I ask the \nSenator: Does he agree with me that it is bizarre, to say the least, to \nsend the soldiers to Iraq and then say: By the way, when we pay for all \nthis, let's not ask anybody to pay taxes to do it. Let's just have \nthese soldiers pay the debt when they come back.\n  It is unbelievable. There are spending cuts the Senator likely will \npropose that are meritorious. I think he has pointed out at the start \nof his presentation correctly, this appropriations bill cuts one-half \nof a billion dollars below the previous year's expenditure. But the big \nissue around here is the massive amount of money being requested on an \nemergency basis so that it doesn't have to be paid for and it adds to \nthe Federal debt. And then the soldiers can come home and help pay \nthat. I believe that is unfair. I ask the Senator from Oklahoma to \nrespond, from his perspective, about that.\n  Mr. COBURN. First of all, the $81-billion supplemental that this body \npassed, I had an amendment to cut $19 billion out of that because it is \nnot going to be spent for the next 3 years. So there is no way you can \ncall that an emergency. One amendment on limiting the expenditures on \nthe embassy, we got 44 votes. Fifty-five people thought it was OK. The \nfact is, we are at war. We seem to forget that. In every war this \ncountry has ever had, the Congress trimmed discretionary spending \nmassively to fund the war. We have decided we will not do that. We have \ndecided we can continue. There is no question good work was done to cut \na half-billion dollars out of this bill. The question the American \npeople ought to be asking is, is everything that is in this bill \nnecessary now in light of the fact that any money we spend we are going \nto charge to our grandchildren?\n  We are going to charge the unpaid interest over the next 30 years \nbecause we have no history of paying back our debts. So by the time you \ncompound the interest costs of this $540 billion, now with some $40 \nbillion on top of it $588 billion is the number it will become--what is \nthe real cost?\n\n[[Page S7369]]\n\n  The real cost is no college education for the generation 2 years from \nnow, no homeownership 2 years from now, decreased investment in capital \ngoods for productivity and scientific advancement, decreased investment \nin education and competition in the world. That is the cost. That is \nwhat will be the cost of our inaction to protect the future for our \nchildren by not trimming every absolute penny we need to spend from \nthis bill.\n  The question should be: Can we cut more? Is it wrong for us not to \ncut more, in light of the fact that we are having to borrow? Whether we \nborrow it for this or for the war or we borrow it for interest, the \nfact is, we are borrowing it.\n  And 18 cents out of every dollar we are going to spend this year in \ndiscretionary is going to pay interest on our lack of fiscal discipline \nfrom the past. We ought to be about raising the level--we ought to be \nhonest with the American people. They have no idea. They hear $350 \nbillion, but it is not $350 billion; it is almost double that. Let's be \nhonest about the real cost. Let's be honest about what the real \nproblems are that will come, and they are going to come to our children \nand our grandchildren.\n  This body has a history, since it was first formed, of thinking in \nthe long term, thinking about the next generation. Unfortunately, \nCongress as a whole has changed its direction of thinking too often to \nthink about the next election, rather than the next generation. In \nevery appropriations bill that comes before this body, I am going to be \ndown here talking about the lack of our foresight in thinking about our \nchildren and our grandchildren.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. First, I appreciate his generosity in yielding. It would \nbe interesting for us to have a discussion at some point about the \neconomy and fiscal policy. I think we are wildly off track. Maybe the \nSenator from Oklahoma and I agree on that point. I will make a couple \nof observations, if I might. No. 1, the Senator suggested that we have \nnever paid down the debt. In the late 1990s, we had a fiscal policy \nthat generated revenue by which we began to reduce the debt.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, we did pay off some Treasury bills. But \nthe way you know when we pay down our debt is to look at our total debt \nand whether it declined at the time we did that. It did not. The total \ndebt of the country rose every year we were paying that off. We still \nhad a deficit. We were stealing from trust funds such as the inland \nwaterway trust funds--that is publicly held debt. We transferred that.\n  So the true debt of the country has not declined since 1972. Even \nthough we were in a period of great times, we spent it all; we didn't \npay it down. We actually spent it, and the actual debt of the country \nrose during the time when everybody in Washington said we were in \nsurplus.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield further.\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Of course, the issue of whether our fiscal policy is \ndifferent now than then is not at odds or not in question. At that \npoint, I know the Federal Reserve Board and others, including the \nPresident, all talked about debt held by the public versus total debt. \nIn fact, our fiscal policy at that point was dramatically different \nthan it is now. We were headed in the right direction.\n  Let me make this point. It is, in my judgment, a service to the \nCongress for someone to look at every appropriations bill and say, \nwhere can we trim? Where can we get into a position of not spending \nmoney we should not be spending? That is a service to the Congress. I \nthink it is important to understand that we cannot look at the mouse in \nthe corner when a lion is at the door. We cut a half billion dollars \nout of this subcommittee from last year's spending. So those are real \ncuts. We could do that for 90 years, every single year, and at that \npoint we will just meet the $45 billion that is coming our way in an \nemergency supplemental, none of which is paid for.\n  Do you understand what I am saying? This would be over $200 billion \nnow sent to us by the administration, saying we have to increase these \nexpenditures and we ask you to do it, Congress, but we are not going to \npay for it. We will add it to the debt.\n  In addition to that, the highest priority, of course, is to eliminate \na tax that doesn't exist--the death tax, the tax on inherited wealth, \nmaking the tax cuts permanent, which would benefit upper-income folks. \nLet's trim everything, but let's especially--and I will work with the \nSenator from Oklahoma on this--worry about the big ones. The big one \nthat is coming--and I voted with the Senator on the embassy amendment--\nis the $45 billion. It is headed our way; it is a big deal. Should we \nbe paying for that? Should the President suggest--as most have whenever \nwe have been at war--that perhaps all of America, not just the \nsoldiers, has some responsibility to contribute? But not under this \ncircumstance. This President says no, no, give me an emergency \ndesignation so we can spend it and it doesn't count. It counts on the \nchart of the Senator from Oklahoma. It counts in terms of lost \nopportunity for our children and grandchildren.\n  This burden doesn't belong just to one political party. I agree. I am \nsaying that, in my judgment, we are off track. This fiscal policy \ndoesn't add up. And what is being requested of us by the President is \nto have all our soldiers sacrifice but none of us sacrifice.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, reclaiming my time----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair feels compelled to state that \nyielding is for the purpose of a question, if the Senators would \nremember that.\n  Mr. COBURN. The important thing to remember--and there is some merit \nin the words of the Senator from North Dakota--is from 2000 to 2004, \nthis body increased discretionary spending by 39 percent. We were not \nin a war as we did that. We increased discretionary spending across all \naccounts, in every appropriations bill in that period of time. We \nentered a recession. Did the spending decrease? No, it continued.\n  The tax cuts were meant to stimulate the economy. The fact is, there \nis no discipline. There will not be any great argument on the tax side \nwith me. But there is no discipline within the body of Congress to trim \nspending. What was the Interior Appropriations bill in the year 2000? \nIt was 35 percent less than it is today. Yet, we are proud that we take \n1.7 percent away? It is a good accomplishment. It is almost unheard of \nin the last 15 years in Congress. But the fact is, it already grew \nalmost 40 percent. So what we are doing is taking away from a much \nlarger pie.\n  My point is that we do a disservice to this country if we fail to \nrecognize we have an obligation to think long term, and a half billion \ndollar cut is a great start, but it is not near enough, as the Senator \nsaid. We need to cut across the board. Do you think we cannot find 10-\npercent savings in the Pentagon? We are holding oversight hearings. \nThey spent a billion dollars on a travel system that should have cost \n$20 million.\n  There is no oversight with which to go after the waste, fraud, and \nabuse within the Federal Government. We are more interested in passing \nthe next bill than doing the hard work of oversight to see where the \nwaste, fraud, and abuse is. We are going to do that. We have a Federal \nfinancial management committee. We have an ATP program. It is nothing \nbut corporate welfare. We are going to spend $120 million on that and \nwe are going to give $120 million to GE, IBM, and Chrysler to do \nresearch they are going to do otherwise. Yet we cannot get anybody to \nhelp us cut that out. The House cuts it out, but this body won't cut it \nout.\n  The point is, there is a large need for the constituencies in this \ncountry to start holding us accountable for the spending increases. If \nthe American public would go through this report language, they would \nbe appalled that in a time of war we think it is fine to build new \nvisitor centers all across this country. Remember, we are going to ask \nour grandchildren to pay for it--about four times what it actually \ncosts. There has to be the start of some fiscal discipline that says we \ncannot afford to do that now, period. It is a good idea, but we cannot \nsteal from our children anymore. And throughout this bill are multiple \ninstances like that, which we could wait on. But we don't wait because \nthe next election is more important than the next generation.\n\n[[Page S7370]]\n\n  With that, I say to the American public we are going to be offering \nseveral amendments. I doubt they will pass. But their intent is to \nstart making a beginning in trimming and getting us into line, where we \nneed to be--not for us, not for our political future, but for the \nfuture of our children and grandchildren.\n  I admit to my friend from North Dakota that part of that--the tax \npolicy--is important. But you cannot just look at one side of it. The \nstimulative policy of tax cuts was important to get this country out of \nrecession. But while we were doing that, this body and the other body \nincreased the discretionary spending in this country by 40 percent. And \nwe cannot afford that. We cannot be proud, even though it is a good \nstart. We should not be proud we cut a half billion dollars from this, \nwhen this whole thing was less than $20 billion in 2000. We could go \nthrough, if we wanted to care about our children and grandchildren, and \ncut 10 percent out of every agency. We don't have anybody here with \ncourage who is willing to make the hard decisions to do that, because \nin the short run it hurts; in the long run, it is healthy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was thinking of asking unanimous consent \nso that each time I take the floor it would be assumed that I frame my \ncomments preceded by ``don't you agree'' to satisfy the quaint rules of \nthe Senate with respect to asking a question. I will refrain from that \nand when asking my colleague to yield the next time, I will say ``don't \nyou agree'' before I give my speech.\n  My colleague does a service. I don't disagree with him. I think we \nought to be tightfisted; we spend money on things we should not spend \nmoney on. We are getting huge blocks of funding requests coming in our \ndirection by the administration calling it ``emergency funding.'' We \nhave had almost $200 billion worth, and another $45 billion is coming \nnow. They say, don't pay for it, don't worry about it. We will declare \nit an emergency and we won't count it.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the question I have for the Senator is, \ndoes that request not come from the Appropriations Committee?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Therefore, it comes to the floor, does it not, with the \nrecommendation of the Appropriations Committee? So we are equal \npartners in asking for that money. It is not just the administration.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Absolutely. No question about that. And the control of \nCongress is of the same political party as the White House, and there \nis no interest in having a discussion about whether we should pay for \nthat which we are spending in Iraq. The administration decided we are \ngoing to simply declare it an emergency, add it to the national debt, \nand let somebody else pay for it.\n  That doesn't happen in most wars. Usually, the leadership says here \nis why we have to spend this, and it is a national purpose. But we are \ngoing to ask the soldiers to represent the country and let's find a way \nto do it.\n  I will make this point. The Senator says we have some mutual \nresponses. No question. On one of the early tranches of appropriations \nto replenish these accounts, there was a vote on the floor of the \nSenate to pay for some of it. But the Congress, as he knows, is not of \na mind to do that, when the President says he doesn't want to. You can \ndramatically cut spending or increase some revenue. It would be \ninteresting to see if the administration would be interested in sitting \ndown with the Congress to talk about whether we even should pay for it \nbecause the administration thinks we should. It would be interesting if \nwe had a sit-down discussion about how to pay for it.\n  I happen to think that would be useful for the country. I would like \nus to do that. I think this country has a fiscal policy that is \ndramatically off track. I don't diminish the tax side as much as my \nfriend does. About two-thirds of the current deficit comes from reduced \nrevenue. We are at a lower revenue of GDP than we have been for a long \ntime. Most of that came from the tax cut, and most of it didn't benefit \npeople that I represent, by the way. Making the rich richer doesn't \nbenefit everybody. The President says extend all of the tax cuts, which \nis a substantial amount of money and lost resources, and let's repeal \nthe death tax, which doesn't exist.\n  We should have a long discussion. I think our country deserves a \nfiscal policy grounded in fact and good thought about the future. My \ncolleague from Oklahoma does a service by coming to the floor to talk \nabout those red lines on that chart. I feel strongly about them, not \njust in fiscal policy but also trade policy. I hope at some point all \nof us could decide this is a crisis. There is an urgency here and we \nshould work together on that basis.\n  If my colleague wishes me to yield further, I am happy to do that.\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes. If you took the whole cost of the war today, it is \nless than half of this. The whole cost of the war is less than half of \nthis, thus far. The fact is, tax policy aside, we could even agree on \nit--there is no question that $1 out of every $3 is either wasted, \ninefficient, or defrauded in the Federal Government. That has been said \nby the Grace Commission and the Comptroller General of the country, in \nterms of us failing to do the oversight. So we can raise taxes, I \nbelieve, as a consequence of that. Would the Senator agree that if in \nfact we held the spending level--no increase in spending--and worked \ntoward efficiency in the Federal agencies, could we not accomplish a \ngreat deal and still stimulate the economy?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Grace Commission has long since been discredited. I \nwill not go into the recommendations, some of which were adopted but \nmany of which were absurd. That is a 20-year-old debate. Let's assume \nfor the moment there was no increase in spending of any type. That \nwould represent a huge problem for the poorest of the poor who get \nmedical care from Medicaid.\n  As you know, health care costs are rising dramatically, not having to \ndo with much that is happening in this Chamber. Nonetheless, there is \nsubstantial increase in health care costs every year. If you said to \nthe poorest of the poor, everybody else is going to get health care, \nbut we are going to freeze health care funding for you, I am sorry, \nthey would be in big trouble.\n  We also have more people every month becoming eligible for Medicare. \nThe fact is, we have a rising Medicare population. Every single month \nmore and more people hit the Medicare rolls. With increased medical \ncosts and more people being eligible, does Medicare cost more? Of \ncourse, it does. People are living longer, better lives.\n  I have spoken at great length on the floor of the Senate about my \nUncle Harold. My Uncle Harold is 84 years old now, and he is a runner. \nHe has 43 Gold Medals. He is a 400-meter specialist in the Senior \nOlympics. My aunt thinks he is half goofy. He is always off running \nroad races. He runs the 400-meter and runs faster than anybody his age.\n  It used to be when you reached 80, you found a Lazy Boy and you just \nsat in the house until you died. You were old and you had a right to \nact old. Now people are living longer, active lives.\n  That puts a strain on Medicare. More people are living longer, so \nthey hit the Medicare rolls. Health care costs are up very \nsubstantially, double digits in many cases. So we bear the burden of \nthat on the spending side.\n  If we were to decide tomorrow we are not going to spend a penny above \nlast year, all you say to poor people on Medicaid is: Sorry, you are \nout of luck. You are going to have less health care.\n  My colleague from Colorado is a very interesting Senator. We do not \nknow each other very well. He just arrived in the Senate in January. I \nam looking forward to getting to know him. I am sure I will.\n  I hope we can have further discussions about the economy. I do not \ndismiss quite as quickly, as I think my colleague was trying to do, the \nfact that when you decide to have large tax cuts mostly to benefit the \nwealthiest of the wealthy in this country that you have an enormous \nconsequence on the revenue side that therefore causes a substantial \namount of that red bar on that chart, and one-half to two-thirds, at \nthe moment, of the current deficit is because of less revenue because \nof the tax cuts. I know the minute I started talking about maybe we \nshould pay for the cost of the war, my colleague segued immediately \ninto we want to raise taxes.\n  I am looking to see a fiscal policy that meets the needs of this \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S7371]]\n\nThat is a combination of things that are thoughtful and interesting \nthat puts us right on track so we can have a future that expands \nopportunity for our children rather than contracts opportunity for our \nchildren.\n  I will be happy to yield one more time. I see my colleague would like \nfor me to yield.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am trying to think of how to phrase this \nas a question. First, I think my statement was on discretionary \nspending, not mandatory spending in terms of my relationship to an \nincrease in spending. I would think the Senator would agree that if, in \nfact, we froze discretionary spending, we would drive efficiency, \ninnovation, and productivity among all those agencies. I hope that he \nwould agree with that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me make a final comment. I know we \nhave a couple colleagues who want to speak. Frankly, we Senators are \nnot much of an audience. We much prefer listening to ourselves than \nothers, and we are probably boring them to tears.\n  Discretionary spending is very interesting. As the Senator knows, \nwhat comes from the Appropriations Committee to the floor of the Senate \nis the discretionary spending side. Much of the spending is mandatory. \nThe Senator from Oklahoma is correct that health care is mandatory \nspending. We could virtually eliminate the entire discretionary \nspending side and probably still not put this back on track.\n  The Senator made a point that I want to emphasize. It is a point on \nwhich we agree. All these people walk around saying this is what the \ndeficit is. That is not what the deficit is. My colleague, Fritz \nHollings, who used to sit right behind me, talked about this forever. \nFor him it was a religion. The number they publish as to the Federal \nbudget deficit is total nonsense. That is not what the deficit is. It \nis much higher than that because they are raiding all the trust funds \nto get to that point.\n  We will have a longer discussion. I enjoyed this one. This is an \nimportant issue. There are some issues that are small and unimportant, \nsome big, and often the Senate treats the serious issues too lightly \nand the light issues too seriously. In this case, this is a big issue \nand will affect this country for decades to come. We ought to have more \ndiscussions, both on and off the floor, about how we put America back \non track.\n  Mr. President, I wish to make one final point. This morning's New \nYork Times said IBM is cutting their hiring here to hire over there. \nGet rid of American workers, hire workers in India. The first step--not \nthe second, third, or fourth step--the first step toward sanity would \nbe for everyone in this Chamber to vote the next time I have an \namendment on the floor--I have done it twice and lost twice--that says \nthe first step we ought to do is to decide to stop having tax breaks \nfor those who move their American jobs overseas. Stop the American \npublic from having to pay for this nonsense.\n  We are providing tax cuts to companies that fire their American \nworkers and move them to Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, China, or, in this \ncase, India. That is absurd.\n  I am going to offer that amendment again for a third time, and \nperhaps I will have enough support so we can take the first baby step \ntoward sanity in dealing with job loss in this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Judicial Compromise\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I would like to change gears for a few \nmoments and talk about something that is also important to this body, \nand that is the judicial compromise that 14 Senators, including myself, \nreached on May 23.\n  This agreement, or memorandum of understanding, was signed by seven \nDemocrats and seven Republicans. I hope it has helped bring this august \nbody back from the brink of what we have called nuclear catastrophe.\n  The agreement or compromise on judicial nominees helped prevent the \nso-called nuclear option from occurring. This agreement allowed an up-\nor-down vote on several of President Bush's most controversial judicial \nnominations while protecting minority rights in the Senate, as well as \nthe checks and balances on which our Government was founded.\n  It has been about a month since the agreement was entered into. I \nhave had a little bit of time to reflect on some of the things that \nhappened leading up to and during that time and since that time. So if \nI may, I would like to take just a few moments to share some thoughts.\n  The first thought I wish to share is that I felt it very important to \navoid the nuclear option. The reason I say that is because one of the \ngreat things about this body throughout its history is this body's \nemphasis on protecting the rights of the minority, the rights of those \nwho maybe in other places might not have a chance to be heard. But in \nthe Senate, given our sense of checks and balances and given our \nhistory and the way the Founding Fathers established the Senate, the \nvoice of the minority can be heard.\n  I also think in order to avoid the nuclear winter, if you want to \ncontinue with the analogy of the nuclear option, after the nuclear \ntrigger had been pulled would have been devastating for this body. It \nwould have set a terrible precedent and probably what would have \nhappened--I could be wrong about this; maybe we will never know--\nprobably what would have happened is that we would not have gotten \nanything passed in the Senate, with the exception of our appropriations \nbills and a few pieces of emergency legislation. It would have just \nbeen awful.\n  Quite frankly, I know when the people in Arkansas elected me to the \nSenate, they did not elect me to come up here to twiddle my thumbs and \nget into partisan brouhahas. They elected me to get things done for the \nState, the Nation, and the world. In fact, in the last few weeks we \nhave been able to work through many issues on the Energy bill--we \nanticipate it will pass next week--and the Transportation bill. There \nare a lot of issues involved. Both those bills still have to go to \nconference and have final passage. Regardless, I wonder if those would \nhave been possible had the nuclear option trigger been pulled.\n  I also must say that I have been a little disappointed with some of \nthe rabid rhetoric by special interests around the country and by \ncommentators, maybe statements I have heard on various radio and \ntelevision talk shows. Quite frankly, I think the rhetoric is not \nhelpful. I think it is unfair, it is untrue, and I think a lot of it is \njust plain wrong.\n  I have heard some people say that the Senators who entered into this \nagreement are sellouts or traitors or they call for retribution. If I \nmay say about my 13 colleagues, it took great courage for them to enter \ninto this agreement because they knew the political risk they were \ntaking, but they also knew they were standing up to try to do the right \nthing.\n  One observation I have made about a lot of the people who are \ncritical about this agreement is that they do not necessarily want to \nsee the Senate get things done, that their agenda is not for \nproductivity. Their agenda may be limited to a few narrow issues, and \nthey just want those issues emphasized, talked about, with a sort of \n``win at all costs'' mentality.\n  One of the great things about the Senate is that it is a place where \npeople can come together and find common ground. That has been the \nhistory of the Senate. We learned from this compromise that good things \nhappen when Senators talk to each other.\n  One of the lessons I have learned in Washington--I have been here \nabout 2\\1/2\\ years now--is, quite frankly, we spend a lot more time \ntalking about each other than we do talking to each other. Hopefully, \nthis compromise is an example of when we talk with each other, good \nthings can happen and positive things can flow from that.\n  In fact, I know a lot of people around the country--I have a few in \nmy State of Arkansas--who think that compromise is a dirty word. I just \ncannot disagree more strongly. If we look at the Constitution, the fact \nthat we have a bicameral legislature, the fact that we have a Senate \nand a House of Representatives, and the different structure of those \ntwo, that has always been called the Great Compromise in the \nConstitutional Convention. The fact\n\n[[Page S7372]]\n\nthe Senate even exists today is a result of a compromise. The fact that \nour Government is located in Washington, DC, we all know now from \nhistory, is the result of a compromise. In fact, you can go throughout \nAmerican history and see compromise after compromise where people find \ncommon ground and put the common good above their private interests or \ntheir narrow set of interests.\n  We have seen that just as recently as this week on the Energy bill. I \nthink if you ask all 100 people, they would say this bill is not \nperfect, but it is a compromise, trying to find common ground, trying \nto set national energy policy for the Nation. Compromise can be very \ngood.\n  I think in this particular compromise, both parties won. It was good \nfor the Democrats, and it was good for the Republicans. Both sides had \nto give up something in order to get there. The Senate won, but most \nimportant of all the American people won because the fact the Senate is \nback in business and we have moved through a number of nominations and \nwe already moved through major pieces of legislation and we are \nstarting another piece of legislation today is a win-win for the \nAmerican people.\n  I have no doubt at all--and this is another observation--that this \nagreement will be tested. I have no doubt people will shake it to see \nhow strong it is. It will be scrutinized, and it has been scrutinized. \nThere has been a lot of ink spilled over this agreement as to what \ncertain phrases mean or how it will be applied, how it will be \ninterpreted.\n  One thing I found a little humorous, if I may say, during the course \nof the last 30 days, is I have heard a lot of so-called experts talk or \nwrite, and they try to apply their own definitions to this agreement. \nIt seems particularly true for those who disagree with the agreement \nmost. They try to define it and refine it and shape it in a way that \nmeets with their approval.\n  I will run through a couple of items in the agreement. I will try to \ndo this very quickly because I know there are other colleagues who are \nvery patiently waiting to speak. Sections A and B in the agreement, \npart A states:\n\n       Future Nominations. Signatories will exercise their \n     responsibilities under the Advice and Consent Clause of the \n     United States Constitution in good faith. Nominees should \n     only be filibustered under extraordinary circumstances, and \n     each signatory must use his or her own discretion and \n     judgment in determining whether such circumstances exist.\n\n  Part B states:\n\n       Rule Changes. In light of the spirit and continuing \n     commitments made in this agreement, we commit to oppose the \n     rules changes in the 109th Congress, which we understand to \n     be any amendment to or interpretation of the Rules of the \n     Senate that would force a vote on a judicial nomination by \n     means other than unanimous consent or Rule XXII.\n\n  I will run through a few issues in those phrases, if I may. There are \ntwo basic questions I get continuously. In fact, I was talking to some \nof the Capitol Hill interns yesterday and the first question out of the \nbox, they asked: What are extraordinary circumstances? That is a fair \nquestion. I get that everywhere I go now.\n  The other question I get is: Is the nuclear option off the table for \nthe 109th Congress?\n  As to the question about extraordinary circumstances, I would say \nthis: The 14 Senators sat down in many of our offices for days on end, \nhours and hours of meetings and discussions and one might say \nnegotiations. We would look each other in the eye. We understand how \nimportant this is and we have a strong sense of where our other 13 \ncolleagues are coming from. Extraordinary circumstances will not be \ndefined by outside groups. With all due respect to the leaders and even \nthe other Senators who are not part of this, it will not be defined by \nour leaders or by our colleagues.\n  Extraordinary circumstances means exactly what it says in the \nagreement. We will use our discretion and our judgment in making that \ndetermination. In fact, I would say all 100 Senators, when they were \nsent to Congress by their 50 States, the voters in those States expect \ntheir Senators to use their discretion and judgment in everything we \ndo. This is no different. All 14 of us are very committed to doing that \nand using our discretion and judgment.\n  I think I can speak for the group that we all hope we do not have to \ndeal with extraordinary circumstances, but in the event we do, we trust \neach other. I think that is the bottom line on this agreement. This \nagreement is one that is based on trust.\n  So when we are asked about extraordinary circumstances or when we are \nasked about is the nuclear option off the table, the bottom line we \nwill keep coming back to is trust. We trust each other. The 14 of us \nhave built that level of trust through this process and we are \ncommitted to doing our dead level best to try and make this agreement \nwork.\n  The answer to the second question, is the nuclear option off the \ntable for the 109th Congress, I would say, yes, it is because it is \nbased on trust. During the negotiations and ever since the negotiations \nhave concluded and to this very point today, we have proceeded in good \nfaith. The Democrats have had to make some hard votes on some of these \njudges who had not received up-or-down votes before and we have done \nthat. I think some of the Republican signatories will acknowledge that \nit was very hard for some of the Democrats to do what we have done on \nsome of these judicial nominations.\n  At the same time, we trust our Republican colleagues, our Republican \nsignatories to this agreement, to act in good faith in the future. This \nis based on trust. I am proud of my colleagues. I am proud I was able \nto be part of this agreement.\n  Let me talk about one more section. I know I have colleagues waiting \nto speak so I will try to be very brief. But after part II, sections A \nand B, there is another section that deals with advice and consent. As \neveryone now knows, this language was agreed to, but it was really \nhammered out by Senator Robert Byrd and Senator John Warner, two great \nstatesmen we have in the Senate.\n  The language states:\n\n       We believe that, under Article II, Section 2, of the United \n     States Constitution, the word ``Advice'' speaks to \n     consultation between the Senate and the President with regard \n     to the use of the President's power to make nominations. We \n     encourage the executive branch of government to consult with \n     members of the Senate, both Democratic and Republican, prior \n     to submitting a judicial nomination to the Senate for \n     consideration.\n\n  Such a return to the early practices of our government may serve to \nreduce the rancor that unfortunately accompanies the advice and consent \nprocess in the Senate. Again, Senator Byrd and Senator Warner deserve a \nlot of credit for the phrasing of this language. I think this language \nis exactly right. I think when the Constitution says advice and \nconsent, the Founding Fathers meant what they said, advice and consent.\n  Oftentimes we talk about consent, but the word ``advice'' gets \noverlooked. I would hope that every President would seek the Senate's \nadvice on nominations. I think not only is it required in the \nConstitution, but it is smart and it shows good judgment by the \nPresident.\n  I also think if Presidents would do this, a lot of this rancor would \ngo away and a lot of the nomination process for these folks would get \nmuch smoother. I have not been around the Senate very long, about 2\\1/\n2\\ years, but I did in some ways grow up around the Senate. One of the \nthings I have seen over the years that has changed is there used to be \nmuch more bipartisan cooperation.\n  In fact, I think the people in my State--I cannot speak for people \nall over the country, but I have a clear sense from people in my State \nthat they are sick and tired of the partisan bickering in Washington. \nThey want us to work together. They elect us to work together. They \nexpect us to do that. That is their hope, because we all know, they all \nknow, that for us to get things done in Washington we have to work \ntogether.\n  I am hoping this agreement is an important step in doing that. That \nis not just true within this body--and, by the way, if I can \neditorialize for one moment, I would say we need to be very clear. Both \nparties are to blame for the partisan rancor. It is not limited to one \nside or the other. When it comes to judicial nominations, the Senate \nshares some responsibility and the President shares responsibility, not \njust this President but previous Presidents and previous \nadministrations, Democrats and Republicans. We all share some of the \nblame, we should all own up to that responsibility, and we should all \ndo our best to make it better.\n\n[[Page S7373]]\n\n  Maybe back in the old days the President might call a few Senators \nover to the White House and say, hey, let's have a drink and let's talk \nabout this. I am not going to make a recommendation on the having a \ndrink part, but I do want to strongly encourage the President to invite \nMembers of the Senate over to talk about upcoming judicial nominations. \nI hope he will not just talk to one or two. I hope he does not just \ntalk to members of his party. I hope he will talk to a number of \nSenators about nominations. I think it is very important.\n  The last thing I wanted to say is I cannot speak for my 13 \ncolleagues, but I think if one asks all 14 of us, we would want to be \nvery clear on one point, and that is when we entered into the \nagreement, we in no way, shape, or form wanted to become a rump \nJudiciary Committee. We do not want to do that. We do not want that \nrole. I am speaking for myself here, but I think one could ask my 13 \ncolleagues. We do not see ourselves as having any veto power or any \nunique role now in judicial nominations. I would hope very strongly \nthat the Senate Judiciary Committee would continue to be the place in \nthe normal process these nominations go through. I have a ton of \nrespect for Senators Arlen Specter and Senator Patrick Leahy. They are \ngreat leaders. They are great Americans. They do yeoman's work in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. I would hope those two would be the first \ntwo the President would consult.\n  Quite frankly, I wish they would consult with John Warner and Robert \nByrd because I think those two add a lot. Certainly I would hope the \nWhite House would talk to all members of the Judiciary Committee and \nthe home State Senators before these nominations are made. I think \nthat, again, is a way for us to tone down the rhetoric and to provide a \nsmoother course for these nominations to get through.\n  I cannot predict the future, but I do know what it has been like \naround here in the past. I think things have gotten a little bit better \nin the last 30 days since we entered into this agreement. I am so proud \nof my colleagues that sensible voices have come to the floor. We have \nfound common ground on judicial nominations. I am not sure there has \nbeen a more contentious issue since I have been in the Senate. If we \ncan work that out, we hope that is a good sign for the American people \nthat we can work out a lot of things.\n  Our compromise shows there is still a spirit of trust and \nbipartisanship in this body, and I hope we can foster that and move it \nforward.\n  I thank my 13 colleagues who entered into this agreement. I know many \nof them showed great courage when they did it. Many of them have been \nheavily criticized for doing it, but I am convinced it is the right \nthing to do. I am proud we did it and I hope it provides us a model for \nhow we can move forward and try to find common ground in the future on \na whole variety of issues. I am not saying the 14 should get back \ntogether on every single issue, but I hope it shows that Members of the \nSenate will continue to reach across the aisle, find that common \nground. Just as we heard a few moments ago with the Senator from \nOklahoma and the Senator from North Dakota, they may come out in the \nprocess at different places, but it is great to hear that dialogue \nwhere they can hash out ideas and try to get things done and try to do \nthe right thing for this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I will get back on the subject of the \nInterior appropriations bill, if I might. I start out my comments by \nthanking Senator Burns, my good friend and colleague from Montana, \nchairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, and the ranking \nmember, Senator Dorgan, and their staffs for the hard work that went \ninto this bill. We all knew this was not going to be an easy process \nthis year because it is a tough budget year and difficult adjustments \nhad to be made.\n  I respect the President and his effort to try and hold down Federal \nspending. Senator Burns and I, who both serve on the Budget Committee, \nunderstand the importance of trying to bring some fiscal sanity to the \nprocess. I do respect many of the comments my colleague from Oklahoma \nmade on the floor. The only comment I have is that the time to have \nmade many of those points is when the budget itself was before us. When \nthe budget was before us, we had an opportunity to hold down spending. \nMany of us were disappointed at the level of spending that ended up \nbeing reflected out of the budget proposal, but I do want to commend \nSenator Burns and his staff for staying within the 302(b) allocation, \nor the amount of money that was allocated through the budget to the \nAppropriations Committee, that eventually was reflected in the total \namount of spending in this bill. So from my point of view, I found the \nchairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee to be very \nresponsible and diligent in his duties. I, for one, am very \nappreciative of that.\n  As I mentioned earlier, I respect what the President was trying to do \nto hold down spending. Some of the cuts he put forward, I strongly \nsupport. Some of them I have a disagreement with, and some of those \ndisagreements are reflected in this particular legislation.\n  To give a little historical background, when the State of Colorado \njoined the Union in 1876, we were known as the Centennial State because \nwe came in 100 years after our independence in 1776. Our first Senator, \nSenator Teller, was one of two Senators who assumed his duties and \nthen, after his second term, became Secretary of the Interior. He \nbecame known eventually as the representative of the entire West \nbecause a lot of States were still territories. The jurisdiction of the \nterritories fell under the Department of the Interior. So, \nhistorically, the programs in the Interior Department have been very \nimportant to States in the West. Colorado is no exception to that.\n\n  If we look at today's figures, the Federal Government owns \napproximately 24 million acres in Colorado. That is 34 percent of the \ntotal State lands. All told, about 60 percent of all the lands in the \nState of Colorado are owned by public entities--whether it is the \nFederal Government with its 34-percent share, or State and local lands \nwhich are owned by school districts in the State, as well as State \nparks and local parks and that type of thing. So, like other Western \nStates, the Interior appropriations bill becomes very important.\n  If we contrast that with the State of Indiana, which is made up of \nless than 23 million acres, then the Members of Congress begin to \nappreciate the real significance of Federal lands in States such as \nColorado. Only eight States, all in the West, have a higher percentage \nof Federal land ownership than the State of Colorado. This is important \nwhen we get to programs like the PILT Program, which means Payments In \nLieu of Taxes. This is a program very important to the State of \nColorado, as it is to many Western States. Payments In Lieu of Taxes is \ndesigned to help prevent property tax imbalance.\n  The Federal Government does not pay property taxes. So we have come \nup with this program called PILT, or Payments In Lieu of Taxes. The \nprogram helps those local governments whose property tax bases have \nbeen impacted because of Federal agencies, and helps to fund the \nservices that they provide to their communities. This is an area where \nthe President had suggested a reduction in funding.\n  I support the committee action in this bill to restore those dollars. \nThe PILT funding in this bill is $235 million, $35 million above the \namount of the President's budget request and $8.2 million more than \nlast year's level. But the chairman was able to do this and stay within \nthe budget numbers that were allocated to this committee.\n  Let me say a little bit more about the PILT Programs. These dollars \ngo to the States, but what they help pay for primarily is education \nbecause in the Western States so much of the property tax goes to \neducation. For example, in the State of Colorado a good share of \neducational effort is paid by the local property taxes. There are some \nFederal dollars and some State dollars that go in and match in with the \nlocal dollars, but basically education is a local program. So if you \nwant to have a strong educational program, particularly in the rural \nareas of Colorado, this is an important program.\n  Why shouldn't the Federal Government do its fair share? If they are\n\n[[Page S7374]]\n\nusing the resources of the communities in the States in which the \nFederal Government is doing business and costing those taxpayers money \nbecause of their presence, I think they owe those States, and those \ncounties and local governments, their fair share of the property tax \nburden.\n  Another important program funded through the Interior appropriations \nbill is the Bureau of Land Management Oil and Gas Management Office. \nThis is the office that is responsible for the leasing and permitting \nof onshore oil and gas wells. Throughout the West, there are very long \ndelays in processing these permits, solely because the Bureau of Land \nManagement lacks the staff to do it.\n  I have been told that each month of delay getting these wells on the \nline means that 28 million cubic feet of gas is not reaching the \nmarket. I believe that is critical. It is important to the Western \nStates, but it is critical to the overall good of this country. Again, \nI commend the chairman for seeing the need and addressing the issue in \nthis particular bill. But it concerns me when one considers the \nconstrained supply and high prices all of our constituents are facing. \nSo I am hopeful that down the line, we will be able to find \nsome additional funding for these activities.\n\n  A program that is new to the Interior appropriations bill this year \nis the State and Tribal Assistance Grant Program, often called STAG. \nJust over $2.5 million in STAG funds will be going to Colorado. The \nnice thing about this program is that it is based on grants, so for \nthose communities that have true needs, that money is going to be \navailable to them.\n  This program helps communities around the country fund upgrades to \ntheir drinking water treatment systems. It is especially important to \nsmall communities that have severely aging infrastructure and are \ndisproportionately impacted by increases in requirements and water \nstandards. We have gone through a recent change in water standards that \nis having a disproportionate impact on some of the smaller communities \nthat I represent in the State of Colorado.\n  I would also mention a number of projects that are funded throughout \nthis bill that are important to me and to the State of Colorado. These \nprojects are not locale-designated projects. In other words, not one \ncommunity or one county necessarily benefits, but they do tend to \nbenefit a larger geographical area. As I go through these, I think you \nwill begin to understand what I am trying to accomplish.\n  We get a lot of requests as Members of the Senate from specific \ncities and specific counties wanting projects designated specifically \nfor their area. But I have tried to keep these generally spread out \nbecause then the entire State of Colorado benefits. There are a lot of \nneeds out there.\n  We set aside some money for the High Elk Corridor. It is a migration \nroute for elk, and it is important in central Colorado, so we have set \nsome money aside for that. The Platte River fish recovery project--this \nis for the entire drainage system of the south Platte and also the \nnorth Platte. It affects, actually, more States than just Colorado. It \nis an attempt to restore endangered species within the drainage system \nso the Endangered Species Act doesn't come into play in a way that \nimpacts property rights, which is a very important issue as far as \nWestern States are concerned.\n  I also have some money here for the Upper Colorado Fish Recovery \nProgram. This is the Colorado River drainage system. Not only does it \nhelp the State of Colorado, but other States that are on the Colorado \nRiver, because we are trying to sustain an endangered fish population \nin that river system so that our water users do not get \ndisproportionately impacted.\n  We have some money in there to complete a conservation easement on \nthe Banded Peaks Ranch, and funds for the Colorado Canyons conservation \narea. We want to help sustain the conservation efforts there.\n  It is projects such as these that benefit the public as a whole, and \nI am pleased we were able to secure funding for them.\n  Finally, before closing, I again thank the full committee chairman \nand ranking member, Senators Cochran and Byrd, and the majority and \nminority leader for bringing this bill to the floor so quickly. Again, \nI also recognize the diligent effort by Senator Burns and his ranking \nmember, Senator Dorgan. This is the first appropriations bill we have \nup on the Senate floor this year. It reflects their hard work and \ncommitment to getting us through this session in a timely way.\n  I believe it is very important that Congress meet its \nresponsibilities to pass funding bills before the end of the fiscal \nyear. I think that continuing resolutions and omnibus bills tend to be \nmessy, and an inappropriate way to go about fulfilling our \nresponsibilities to fund the Federal Government. I am pleased we seem \nto be on track to pass the appropriations bills on time this year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1010\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Voinovich, I call up \namendment No. 1010, which relates to Indian gaming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Burns], for Mr. Voinovich, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1010.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to take certain land into trust \n without the consent of the Governor of the State in which the land is \n                                located)\n\n       On page 254, after line 25, add the following:\n       Sec. 4    . None of the funds made available by this Act \n     may be used to take land into trust on behalf of an Indian \n     tribe for the specific purpose of gaming without the consent \n     of the Governor of the State in which the land is located.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I think that is about the only amendment \nthat we have to be offered in today's business. We have kind of run our \ntrap lines. Senator Dorgan?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I don't know of any amendment also intended to be offered \ntoday. I do know we have had some colleagues talking to us about \namendments they wish to offer on Monday, but at least on this side, I \nknow of no amendments to be offered for the remainder of the day. My \nunderstanding about the amendment the Senator has just laid down on \nbehalf of Senator Voinovich is we are not going to dispose of that \namendment at this point. We have some issues we need to discuss. We \nwill begin to think about action on that on Monday; is that right?\n  Mr. BURNS. That is correct. We will huddle on that, on this amendment \nand others that will be coming to the floor later on.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for as long as I \ncontinue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will not speak for a lengthy time, but I wanted to \nthank my colleague from Montana as he leaves. He will be back on Monday \nas we take up this bill again, and I look forward continuing to work \nwith him. We put together a pretty decent bill.\n  As I indicated previously, this bill actually cuts by $\\1/2\\ billion, \nslightly more, spending over the previous year. So it has been a chore \nto get this done because of the substantial cuts. But the Senator from \nMontana has been good to work with.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/24/senate-section/article/S7374-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, I want to make a comment today about \nactions taken yesterday by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. I \nhave spoken about this on the floor of the Senate previously. Let me \ndescribe just a bit of the history here.\n  I read some while ago that Mr. Kenneth Tomlinson, who is the Chairman \nof the Board of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting--again, \nChairman of the Board of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, was \nmaking the case publicly that public broadcasting has a liberal bias. \nHe was relentlessly making the case that public broadcasting has a \nliberal bias--public television, public radio, and so on. Maybe he \nthinks Big Bird is a Republican--or a Democrat. Maybe he thinks the \nCookie Monster goes to precinct meetings someplace for some political \nparty or other. I have no idea what he thinks. Frankly, he was \nconcerned about Bill Moyers, who was doing a program called ``NOW.'' He \nwas sufficiently concerned about that, having made allegations that \nthere is a liberal bias in the public television, that he hired a \nconsultant to do an evaluation of the program that Bill Moyers does.\n  This consultant was paid for with public funds. So I wrote Mr. \nTomlinson and I said: You believe there is a liberal bias here with \npublic broadcasting. You have paid taxpayers' monies to have a \nconsultant--who himself, by the way, is a partisan--a consultant to \nevaluate a specific set of programming. I would like the results of \nthat.\n  So he sent me the raw data, which is about I think maybe 70 pages. It \nis a rather large stack of raw data--no summary. So I called him back \nand said: I really want the summary. There wasn't a summary, he said. \nHe said he is making a summary, preparing a summary. He said he would \nhave it to me, I think, a week ago now. And I have not yet received the \nsummary, but the raw data was interesting. At least in portions, this \nprogram was evaluated, by a particular consultant who himself was a \npartisan, as is Mr. Tomlinson, the raw data was evaluating segments in \npublic television, particularly in the NOW program, on whether they \nwere anti-Bush or pro-Bush. Anti-Bush, anti-Bush, anti-Bush. Apparently \nthe lens or prism through which they are evaluating public broadcasting \nwas: Do they support the President or not?\n  One was interesting. For example, in one case, it was labeled \n``antidefense'' because it was a program about waste in the Pentagon. \nMy colleague from Oklahoma talked about waste a little earlier. He said \nthere is a lot of waste in the Pentagon. If you talk about waste in the \nPentagon, you, apparently, are ``antidefense.'' Unbelievable.\n\n  I mentioned previously, my colleague, Senator Chuck Hagel from \nNebraska, a red-blooded American patriot who served this country, a \nRepublican conservative, by all accounts, who serves in the Senate, \nsomeone with whom I am proud to serve, was on one of the programs. He \napparently said something that was at odds with the President's policy, \nso he was labeled a ``liberal.'' Yes, my friend, Chuck Hagel, \nconservative Republican Senator from Nebraska, is labeled liberal \nbecause he was on public broadcasting and said something at odds with \nthe policy of the Bush administration. Unbelievable.\n  Anti-Bush, anti-Bush, liberal, antidefense. What an unbelievable \nthing to have done to hire a partisan consultant to evaluate for a \nliberal bias in public broadcasting.\n  Is Big Bird a Democrat? What a weighted question.\n  So Mr. Tomlinson, Chairman of the Board of the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting, was not only embarking on this effort to prove an \nallegation he had been making--that is, there is a liberal bias in \npublic broadcasting--but also working to put in a new president of the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting.\n  So who does Mr. Tomlinson want as the head of the Corporation for \nPublic Broadcasting? The former Co-Chair of the Republican National \nCommittee. Yes, that is right.\n  You say, well, that cannot be.\n  Of course, that is exactly right. In fact, that person was just hired \nin a split vote by the Board of Directors of the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting. It is unbelievable.\n  The Chairman spends his time alleging the organization he heads has a \nliberal bias, hires a partisan to try to prove it, to put together work \npapers that come from evaluating programming, and then embarks on an \neffort to decide there should be a former Co-Chair of the Republican \nNational Committee to run the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n  I don't know, maybe it is hard to take a level look when you are a \npartisan. But public television has a program that deals with the Wall \nStreet Journal editorial board. No one would suggest the Wall Street \nJournal editorial pages are anything other than solid, hard-rock \nRepublican. No question about that. They don't pretend. There is no \nveil over their secrecy about their politics. That is what they are.\n  They have a program on public broadcasting with Tucker Carlson. I \ndon't know Tucker Carlson. I don't know Tucker Carlson from a block of \nwood. He wears a bow tie. He is a conservative Republican, and so they \nhire him to do a program. I think he has just left. It is not as if \npublic broadcasting has not had conservative voices. They are just \nupset with the ``NOW'' program by Bill Moyers. Why are they upset with \nBill Moyers? Let me give one example.\n  Public broadcasting tackles subjects others will not tackle. One \nsubject is the concentration of media ownership in this country. What \nhas happened with the radio and television industry is it has been \ngobbled up into huge packages. One company owns 1,200 radio stations. \nThe Federal Communications Commission, under pressure from the \nbroadcast industry, was going to change the rules on ownership, and \nthey did. Pressure from the publishers, pressure from the television, \npressure from the radio industry. The Federal Communications Commission \ndid the most complete cave-in to corporate interests I have ever seen \nin my life. They have new ownership rules that say, totus porcus, you \ncan own everything. Here is what they said in the rules: In the largest \ncity in this country, or in the largest cities, it is okay for one \ncompany to own eight radio stations, three television stations, the \ndominant newspaper, and the cable company. That is all fine. That is \nnirvana.\n  That is absolutely nuts. Yet that was the rule the FCC came up with. \nMajority party, representing the interests of the President, says this \nis what we are doing. We will allow more concentration in broadcasting \nso that four, five, or six people will largely control what the \nAmerican people see, hear, and read.\n  Guess what. A Federal appeals court decided they were going to stay \nthose rules. Three-quarters of a million people wrote to the FCC \nsaying, do not do this. It was the largest outpouring of letters I can \nrecall. The FCC did it anyway, caved in to the corporate interests, and \nthe Federal court stayed the rules, it went up to the Supreme Court, \nthe stay was not lifted and it is back to the FCC to do over. We will \nsee whether they cave in, once again, or whether the public interest \nmight prevail.\n  My point of telling that story is this: Bill Moyers did stories on \nthis issue about the concentration in the broadcasting industry. Do you \nthink anybody else was interested in doing big stories about this? Do \nyou think CBS would do a story about that? Or FOX? Or ABC? Or NBC? Not \non your life, because they are the beneficiaries of those policies. \nThey want to be bigger. They want more. They think it is fine if you \nlive in one city, that one company will call the tune on information. \nOne company will own eight radio stations, three television stations, \nthe newspaper, and the cable company. They think that is fine.\n  You are not going to see stories as you peruse the television dial \nabout this subject from the major companies. They will not do it. Guess \nwho did it. Bill Moyers, on a program called ``NOW.'' Did that upset \nsome people? I suppose, sure. They do not like that. But the fact is, \npublic broadcasting has been independent. It was created as the \nindependent source of news, oblivious and impervious to the pressures \nand partisan wins.\n  So the ``NOW'' program does a couple of programs on concentration of \nbroadcasting and they collect a firestorm of\n\n[[Page S7376]]\n\nprotests by the big economic interests and by those who support the \nPresident's policies on this.\n\n  Let them all merge. They say, well, all these mergers do not matter. \nYou have all these television channels these days, you have more \nopportunities. What you have are more voices coming from one \nventriloquist. Add up where all the channels are owned and where they \ncome from. It is exactly the same concentration.\n  There are investigations going on at the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting. Mr. Tomlinson was named Chairman by the President, \nSeptember 2003. He spends his time telling us there is a liberal bias \nin public broadcasting so he hired a consultant to track the political \nleanings of certain programming. He hired a conservative partisan to do \nthat. Paid for it with taxpayers' money. That is now being evaluated by \nthe Inspector General. He did not tell the Board of Directors about \nthis expenditure. He, in a letter to me, said, maybe I didn't tell the \nBoard of Directors but that is because the President of CPB signed the \ncontract.\n  That is not accurate. He signed the contract several months before \nthe President that he alleged signed it had actually become President \nat the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n  Now they have appointed a new President at the urging of Mr. \nTomlinson, a partisan former Co-Chair of the Republican National \nCommittee. Some of the members of the Board of Directors of the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting have alleged to me personally that \nthe process by which that was done was a stilted process, not a fair \nand open process. I am going to ask the Inspector General to include \nthat in his investigation as well.\n  I did not join all those in the Senate last week who signed a letter \nto suggest Mr. Tomlinson should resign. I was not one of those who \nsigned it. But I now think he should. I think orchestrating the hiring \nof a partisan former Co-Chair of the Republican National Committee to \nrun the Corporation for Public Broadcasting after he has made a mini-\ncareer here out of alleging there is a liberal bias, to suggest he \nshould be the point of the spear to move it in a direction that clearly \nis partisan is unfortunate, in my judgment, and will do dramatic injury \nto public broadcasting.\n  My hope is public broadcasting will recover from these missteps. \nPublic broadcasting has done a wonderful service in our country. I \nkidded about Big Bird. Big Bird is not a partisan. When American \nchildren watch ``Sesame Street'' and see wonderful programming--which, \nby the way, they took care of that program and it does not exist on \ncommercial television--most Americans in the polls I have seen believe \npublic broadcasting does a real service.\n  I don't think there is a better newscast than PBS, Jim Lehrer. I \nthink he is incredibly good. You get it straight. You do not get it in \n8-second sound bites as is the case with the network news. You get a \ndiscussion by both sides, in depth, about issues that matter to this \ncountry. Those who are deciding to take it upon themselves to try to do \ninjury to public broadcasting did no service to this country.\n  I know there is a network of radio and broadcast opportunities out \nthere for largely one voice, the conservative voice, that is \nrelentless, every day, all over the dial. The fairness doctrine is gone \nso they can do that. There does not have to be balance on commercial \nstations. There used to be. It does not have to be anymore because \nunder President Reagan the fairness doctrine was obliterated.\n  I know they do not like this message about the push-back on public \nbroadcasting. In my judgment, when I see someone doing injury to public \nbroadcasting, I think it is important to speak out. I think Mr. \nTomlinson is doing injury to something that is very important to our \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota was an \nimportant part of the work on clean energy that we finished work on \nlast night and will vote on next Tuesday. I will make some remarks \nabout that in a few minutes, but I acknowledge his contribution and \nthat of the ranking Democrat, Jeff Bingaman, who worked with our \nchairman, Pete Domenici, and the Presiding Officer, who has experience \nin the House of Representatives on the Energy Committee.\n  These last 2 weeks have been extraordinarily good for the Senate. I \nthink we got a good result.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/24/senate-section/article/S7376-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7376-S7377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ENERGY POLICY ACT\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I support what Senator Durbin is \ntrying to achieve with this amendment regarding CAFE standards. Over \nthe past few years, I have looked closely at this issue and believe \nstrongly that we need a consensus path forward. I do not believe, \nhowever, that Senator Durbin's amendment or Senator Bond's amendment \nwill achieve that goal. I have followed closely the information \navailable from the National Academy of Sciences and have spoken with \nlabor groups, automobile manufacturers, and environmental groups. We \ncan, and must, significantly increase the efficiency of our automobile \nfleet, but we cannot do it without creating new incentives for \nautomobile manufacturers to retool plants to produce advanced \ntechnology, more efficient vehicles, and lead the way toward an energy-\nindependent America.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I want to thank the bill managers, \nSenator Bingaman and Senator Domenici, for accepting my amendment \ncalling for an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission into \ngasoline price manipulation and anticompetitive practices by oil \ncompanies and refineries. I also want to thank Senator Dorgan and \nSenator Boxer for their hard work on this issue.\n  We are living in a time when the average American family has no \nassurance from week to week that they will be able to afford to fill \ntheir vehicle with gas.\n  Over the past year, gasoline prices have increased by 23 percent. And \nsince December the average price for oil has climbed 40 cents per \ngallon. To make matters even worse, prices fluctuate wildly from week \nto week and month to month, making it impossible for families to budget \nfor the cost of gasoline. In fact, I heard from a constituent in \nLansing on Monday that gasoline was $2.10 a gallon at 7:30 in the \nmorning and by 9:30 it had jumped over 12 percent to $2.35 a gallon. \nGas prices in the Upper Peninsula range from $2.19 to $2.24 a gallon. \nPeople in Detroit are paying the highest prices in the State at $2.40 a \ngallon.\n  Furthermore, the Energy Information Administration estimates that \npump prices for the summer will average about $2.17 per gallon, which \nis 26 cents per gallon above the price from last year. So what does \nthis mean for the average American family? Using the AAA Trip \nCalculator I discovered that a family driving their Ford station wagon \nfrom Grand Rapids, MI to Washington, DC, would spend $89.82 on gas. \nThese high prices may mean the difference between a family trip to \nvisit grandparents and extended family and staying home. So you see we \nare talking about real impacts to working families.\n  At the same time that our families are struggling to find room for \nthe cost of gasoline in their household budgets and canceling their \nsummer vacations, oil companies are chalking up record-breaking profits \nfor the first quarter of this year.\n  Families are worried about whether or not they can afford the gas to \nget to work, while oil companies are raking in billions of dollars.\n  I think my colleagues must agree with me that there is something \nseriously wrong when American families are struggling to make ends meet \nand the world's top five petroleum companies are reporting more than \n$230 billion in profits since 2001.\n  Furthermore, when we consider that the cost of crude oil makes up \nless than 50 percent of the total cost of gasoline, there can be no \ndoubt that oil companies and refineries are making their profits off \nthe backs of hardworking Americans.\n  In a recent CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll, 78 percent of people surveyed \nsaid that gasoline prices are not fair.\n  I agree with them.\n\n[[Page S7377]]\n\n  There are two ways we can start to lower gasoline prices. One way is \nto release oil from our National Strategic Petroleum Reserves, which \nwill lower prices by increasing supply while sending a clear signal to \nOPEC that we are not going to sit back and take whatever they decide to \ndeal. The second is to make sure that no anticompetitive practices are \ntaking place among the big oil companies and oil refineries here in our \nown country.\n  My amendment gets to this second point. I have called for an \ninvestigation by the Federal Trade Commission into gasoline price \nmanipulation. We need to make sure that American families are not being \nunfairly taken advantage of by oil companies and refineries.\n  Should the FTC's investigation find that illegal practices are taking \nplace, they have a couple of options. First, the FTC can pursue a civil \naction and fine companies breaking the law. Or, if they find evidence \nof criminal behavior, the FTC can then notify the Department of \nJustice, which would then pursue criminal action.\n  We have seen the devastating effects that market manipulation can \nhave when energy companies withheld power from California's power grid \nin 2000 and 2001 in order to drive up the price of electricity. The \nresult was 38 days of blackouts, rolling brownouts, service \ninterruptions, and ultimately over $11 billion from the California \nState Treasury. A later report by the California Public Utilities \nCommission stated that the vast majority of the power failures could \nhave been prevented.\n  We need to make sure the same kind of intentional market manipulation \nand preventable economic losses do not happen to American consumers \nwhen they buy gasoline.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for part of this \nweek and want to indicate how I would have voted if I had been present.\n  If present, I would have voted in the following ways: ``no'' on the \nNelson (FL) amendment, rollcall vote No. 143; ``yes'' on the Hagel \namendment, roll call vote No. 144; ``yes'' on the Voinovich amendment, \nrollcall vote No. 145; ``no'' on the McCain-Lieberman amendment, \nrollcall vote No. 148; ``yes'' on the motion to table the Bingaman \namendment, rollcall No. 149; ``no'' on the Alexander amendment, \nrollcall vote No. 150; ``yes'' on the Kerry amendment, rollcall vote \nNo. 151; ``yes'' to invoke cloture on the energy bill; rollcall vote \nNo. 152; and ``yes'' to waive the budget point of order on the \nDomenici-Landrieu amendment, rollcall No. 153.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/24/senate-section/article/S7377-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         HONORING JEAN O'LEARY\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor an \noutstanding American whose tireless work helped bring to national \nattention the matter of gay civil rights. Jean O'Leary represented the \nideals of a truly integrated society, a Nation that saw equality for \ngay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people of this world. On June \n4, 2005, my dear friend, Jean O'Leary died at the age of 57, in her \nhome in San Clemente, CA. Her passing is a great loss to her family and \nshe will be missed by all who knew her. I offer my deepest condolences \nto her family and am joined by the thousands of Californians, as well \nas those throughout the country, who have benefited from her work to \nend the injustices that segregate this great Nation. Jean O'Leary's was \na light, a remarkable voice in an area that needed a champion. Her \nlegacy will live on through the passion and energy she gave to the gay \nrights movement.\n  Jean Marie O'Leary lived a life of extraordinary accomplishments. \nBorn in Kingston, NY, but raised mostly in Ohio, Ms. O'Leary attended \nparochial schools from third grade through high school and in 1966 \njoined the Sisters of the Holy Humility of Mary to become a nun. Many \nwere surprised by her decision which contradicted her independent and \nrebellious nature. Years later she revealed that she wanted to become a \nnun because she ``wanted to do something special, to have an impact on \nthe world.''\n  Jean O'Leary left the covenant in 1971, returning to New York where \nshe immersed herself in the gay rights movement. She was a member of \nthe Gay Activists Alliance, founder of the Lesbian Feminist Liberation, \nco-executive director of the National Gay Task Force, and head of the \nNational Gay Rights Advocates where she helped bring visibility to the \nmovement.\n  In 1977, Ms. O'Leary through her close friendship with Midge \nCostanza, an advisor to President Jimmy Carter, organized the first-\never meeting of gay rights advocates in the White House. This historic \ngathering of gay and lesbian leaders spurred a national discussion to \nreview and begin to correct the antigay policies by Federal Government \nagencies. President Carter later appointed her to the National \nCommission on the Observance of International Women's Year where she \nnegotiated the inclusion of gay and lesbian rights on the commission's \nconference held in Houston. In her work as a Democratic Party activist, \nO'Leary was a pillar of strength and support that helped advance the \nrights of gay men and lesbians, women and people living with HIV and \nAIDS.\n  Truly, she lived up to her dreams to shape the world. In a career \nthat spanned 35 years, I remember Ms. O'Leary as an exception activist, \na woman with a soft-spoken, charming, and compassionate nature that \nshown through in her tremendous ability to pioneer an issue that \ninvolves millions worldwide.\n  Jean O'Leary was an exemplary American who worked to improve the life \nof all persons in the Nation. She was an outstanding individual, a \nclose and trusted friend, and an inspiration to this Nation. We will \nall miss her spirit and passion, and our thoughts go out to her family \nand friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/24/senate-section/article/S7377-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:27 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2985.

A bill to provide grants for use by rural local educational \nagencies in purchasing new school buses; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, many years ago, when I attended school in \nSearchlight, I walked to school. And when it was time for high school, \nI hitched a ride into a town forty miles away and had to stay with \nfamily during the week. There weren't many options back then. That was \nthe transportation system in rural America: walk or hitchhike.\n  Now, of course, we have school buses to get children to school.\n  Unfortunately, rural school districts across America are strapped. \nThey can't afford to buy newer, safer buses. And skyrocketing gas \nprices have only made the problem worse. As a result, many rural areas \nhave no choice but to operate outdated, unsafe school buses for as long \nas they can pass inspection.\n  Last year, I met with the school superintendents in my State. While \neach district identified their own, unique challenge, they all had an \nurgent need for school buses. I was astonished to learn that the school \nbuses in some rural Nevada counties travel a combined million miles in \na single school year.\n  The superintendents asked for my help, and I want to help. And based \non conversations with some of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \nI am pretty confident the need for newer and safer school buses is not \nunique to Nevada's rural school districts.\n  I am introducing legislation today that will help rural districts \ntransport children to school in a way that is safe, affordable, and \nenvironmentally sound.\n  The ``Bus Utility and Safety in School Transportation Opportunity and \nPurchasing Act of 2005''--or BUS STOP--authorizes the Federal \nGovernment to provide $50,000,000 in grants on a competitive basis to \nrural local education agencies seeking Federal share assistance to \npurchase school buses. The Federal share will be 75 percent.\n  Some may wonder why we need such a program when the Environmental \nProtection Agency already has a cost-share grant program to help school \ndistricts purchase new buses powered by natural gas or other \nalternative fuels.\n  Unfortunately, most of the rural districts in my State, and, I would \nimagine, across the country cannot apply for these grants because they \ndon't have the infrastructure in place to support this technology.\n  However, working in the spirit of clean air and healthy children, my \nbill will help rural school districts buy newer buses that are better \nfor our air, and safer for our children.\n  There are many small, rural towns in America, like Searchlight, where \nthe kids need our help. They deserve no less than safe. clean, \neconomical buses to get them to school.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1311\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bus Utility and Safety in \n     School Transportation Opportunity and Purchasing Act of \n     2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

He and I have forged a productive \npartnership in this Congress to support and strengthen FOIA. We \nintroduced two bills earlier this year and held a hearing on our bill, \nS. 394, the Open Government Act, during Sunshine Week in March.\n  The bill we pass today simply requires that when Congress sees fit to \nprovide a statutory exemption to FOIA, it must state its intention to \ndo so explicitly. The language of this bill was previously introduced \nas section 8 of the Open Government Act.\n  No one argues with the notion that some Government information is \nappropriately kept from public view. FOIA contains a number of \nexemptions for national security, law enforcement, confidential \nbusiness information, personal privacy, and other matters. One \nprovision of FOIA, commonly known as the (b)(3) exemption, states that \nrecords that are specifically exempted by statute may be withheld from \ndisclosure. Many bills that are introduced contain statutory exemptions \nor contain language that is ambiguous and might be interpreted as such \nby the courts. In recent years, we have seen more and more such \nexemptions offered in legislation. A 2003 Justice Department report \nstated that Congress has been ``increasingly active in enacting such \nstatutory provisions.'' A June 3, 2005, article by the Cox News Service \ntitled, ``Congress Cloaks More Information in Secrecy,'' pointed to 140 \ninstances ``where congressional lawmakers have inserted such \nexemptions'' into proposed legislation.\n  Our shared principles of open government lead us to believe that \nindividual statutory exemptions should be vigorously debated before \nlawmakers vote in favor of them. Sometimes such proposed exemptions are \nclearly delineated in proposed legislation, but other times they amount \nto a few lines within a highly complex and lengthy bill. These are \ndifficult to locate and analyze in a timely manner, even for those of \nus who stand watch. As a result, such exemptions are often enacted with \nlittle scrutiny, and as soon as one is granted, others are requested.\n  The private sector has sought many exemptions in exchange for \nagreeing to\n\n[[Page S7384]]\n\nshare information with the Government. One example of great concern to \nme is the statutory exemption for critical infrastructure information \nthat was enacted as part of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the law \nthat created the Department of Homeland Security. In this case, a \nreasonable compromise--approved by the White House--to balance the \nprotection of sensitive information with the public's right to know was \npulled out of the bill in conference. It was then replaced with text \nproviding an overly broad statutory exemption that undermines Federal \nand State sunshine laws. I have introduced separate legislation, called \nthe Restoration of Freedom of Information Act, to revert to that \nreasonable compromise language.\n  Not every statutory exemption is inappropriate, but every proposal \ndeserves scrutiny. Congress must be diligent in reviewing new \nexemptions to prevent possible abuses. Focusing more sunshine on this \nprocess is an antidote to exemption creep. The American people deserve \nour ongoing diligence in limiting undue exemptions that only serve to \nclog the plumbing and limit the public's right to know.\n  When we introduced the Open Government Act in February, we addressed \nthis matter with a provision that would require Congress to identify \nproposed statutory exemptions in newly introduced legislation in a \nuniform manner. Today, we pass that single section as a new bill. I \nurge the House to take action quickly and the President to sign this \nbill into law.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Texas for his personal dedication to \nthese issues, and I thank all Senators for their support of this bill.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to express strong support for S. \n1181, concerning the Federa1 Freedom of Information Act--or FOIA. The \nbill is cosponsored by Senator Leahy--with whom I am pleased to be \nworking on a number of FOIA issues--as well as by Senators Alexander, \nFeingold, Isakson, and Specter. I am pleased that S. 1181 enjoys strong \nbipartisan support and the support of numerous organizations across the \nideological spectrum. I can't imagine a more commonsense, good \ngovernment bill. It should not be controversial. I am aware of any \nopposition to it. I am informed that the administration has no concerns \nabout it. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the measure by voice \nvote on June 9, and I am hopeful that the Senate will take up this \nmatter shortly.\n  On February 16, shortly before the President's Day recess, the \nSenator from Vermont and I introduced the OPEN Government Act of 2005, \nS. 394--bipartisan legislation to promote accountability, \naccessibility, and openness in government, principally by strengthening \nand enhancing the Federal law commonly known as the Freedom of \nInformation Act. On March 15, the Terrorism subcommittee convened a \nhearing on that legislation. Like S. 1181, the OPEN Government Act is a \ngood bill to strengthen and enhance FOIA. But I recognize that the OPEN \nGovernment Act will take some time to work through.\n  When I served as attorney general of Texas, it was my responsibility \nto enforce Texas's open government laws. I am pleased to report that \nTexas is known for having one of the strongest set of open government \nlaws in our Nation. And since that experience, I have long believed \nthat our Federal Government could use ``a little Texas sunshine.'' I am \nthus especially enthusiastic about the OPEN Government Act because that \nbill attempts to incorporate some of the most important principles and \nelements of Texas law into the Federal Freedom of Information Act. And \nI am gratified that Senators Alexander, Feingold, Isakson, and Nelson \nof Nebraska are cosponsors of this bipartisan Cornyn-Leahy legislation.\n  The OPEN Government Act is the culmination of months of extensive \ndiscussions between the offices of Senators Cornyn and Leahy and \nmembers of the requestor community. It is supported by Texas Attorney \nGeneral Greg Abbott and a broad coalition of organizations across the \nideological spectrum, including:\n\n       American Association of Law Libraries; American Civil \n     Liberties Union; American Library Association: American \n     Society of Newspaper Editors; Associated Press Managing \n     Editors; Association of Alternative Newsweeklies; \n     Association of Health Care Journalists; Center for \n     Democracy & Technology; Coalition of Journalists for Open \n     Government; Committee of Concerned Journalists; Common \n     Cause; Defenders of Property Rights; Education Writers \n     Association; Electronic Privacy Information Center; \n     Federation of American Scientists/Project on Government \n     Secrecy; Free Congress Foundation/Center for Privacy & \n     Technology Policy; Freedom of Information Center, Univ. of \n     Mo.; The Freedom of Information Foundation of TX; The \n     Heritage Foundation/Center for Media and Public Policy; \n     Information Trust; League of Women Voters of the United \n     States; Liberty Legal Institute; Magazine Publishers of \n     America; National Conference of Editorial Writers; \n     National Freedom of Information Coalition; National \n     Newspaper Association; National Press Club; National \n     Security Archive/Geo. Wash. Univ.; Newspaper Association \n     of America; OMB Watch; One Nation Indivisible; \n     OpenTheGovernment.org; People for the American Way; \n     Project on Government Oversight; Radio-Television News \n     Directors Association; Reporters Committee for Freedom of \n     the Press; Society of Environmental Journalists.\n\n  I am particularly pleased to report the recent endorsements of three \nconservative public interest groups--one devoted to the defense of \nproperty rights--Defenders of Property Rights, led by Nancie G. \nMarzulla--one devoted to the issue of racial preferences in affirmative \naction programs--One Nation Indivisible, led by Linda Chavez--and one \ndevoted to the protection of religious liberty--Liberty Legal \nInstitute, led by Kelly Shackelford.\n  This broad and diverse support across political parties and across \nthe ideological spectrum is important because it demonstrates that the \ncause of open government is neither a Republican nor a Democrat issue--\nneither a conservative nor a liberal issue. Rather, it is an American \nissue. Accordingly, I look forward to future Senate action on the OPEN \nGovernment Act.\n  In the meantime, S. 1181 should be very easy for the Senate to \napprove today. It simply implements section 8 of the OPEN Government \nAct. It would simply help to ensure an open and deliberate process in \nCongress by providing that any future legislation to establish a new \nexemption to the Federal Freedom of Information Act must be stated \nexplicitly within the text of the bill. Specifically, any future \nattempt to create a new so-called ``(b)(3) exemption'' to the Federal \nFOIA law must specifically cite section (b)(3) of FOIA if it is to take \neffect.\n  The justification for this provision is simple: Congress should not \nestablish new secrecy provisions through secret means. If Congress is \nto establish a new exemption to FOIA, it should do so in the open and \nin the light of day. FOIA establishes a presumption of disclosure. But \nif documents are to be kept secret pursuant to a future act of \nCongress, as is sometimes appropriate and necessary, we should at least \nmake sure that that act of Congress itself not be undertaken in secret.\n  I want to be clear: This bill does not affect current law in any way, \nand it does not affect the executive branch in any direct way. It only \napplies to the process through which Congress must enact any FOIA \nexemption in the future. For those who are interested in the technical \naspects of this bill, I will point out that this provision is modeled \nafter other Federal laws--such as the War Powers Resolution--50 U.S.C. \nSec. 1547(a)--and the Federal Vacancies Reform Act--5 U.S.C. \nSec. 3347--which also require Congress to act in an explicit fashion in \norder to carry out particular objectives. Think of it as a direction to \nthe courts--a canon of interpretation, advising on how to construe \nfuture acts of Congress.\n  Senator Leahy and I firmly believe that all of the provisions of the \nOPEN Government Act are important--and that, as a recent Cox News \nService report demonstrates, section 8 in particular is a worthy \nprovision that can and should be quickly enacted into law.\n  July 4 is the anniversary of the 1966 enactment of the original \nFederal Freedom of Information Act. Accordingly, we have devoted our \nefforts this month to getting section 8 approved by Congress and \nsubmitted to the President for his signature by that anniversary date. \nToward that end, we ask our Senate colleagues to support this measure. \nAnd we look forward to working with our colleagues in the House--\nincluding Representatives Lamar Smith and Brad Sherman, the lead \nsponsors of the OPEN Government Act\n\n[[Page S7385]]\n\nin the House, H.R. 867; Chairman Tom Davis, who leads the House \nCommittee on Government Reform; Chairman Todd Platts, who leads the \nHouse Government Reform Subcommittee that recently held a hearing to \nreview the Federal FOIA law; and Representatives Henry Waxman and \nEdolphus Towns, the ranking members of the committee and subcommittee.\n  S. 1181 is a commonsense, uncontroversial provision that deserves the \nsupport of every Member of Congress. I hope that it can be enacted into \nlaw quickly, and that Congress will then move to consider the other \nimportant provisions of the OPEN Government Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the news report I previously \nmentioned be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Cox News Service, Jun. 3, 2005]\n\n              Congress Cloaks More Information in Secrecy\n\n                           (By Rebecca Carr)\n\n       Washington.--Few would argue with the need for a national \n     livestock identification system to help the federal \n     government handle a disease outbreak such as mad cow.\n       But pending legislation calling for the nation's first \n     electronic livestock tracking system would prohibit the \n     public from finding out anything about animals in the system, \n     including the history of a cow sick with bovine spongiform \n     encephalopathy.\n       The only way the public can find out such details is if the \n     secretary of agriculture makes the information public.\n       That's because the legislation, sponsored by Rep. Collin C. \n     Peterson, D-Minn., includes a provision that exempts \n     information about the system from being released under the \n     Freedom of Information Act.\n       Formally called the ``third exemption,'' it is one of nine \n     exemptions the government can use to deny the release of \n     information requested under the FOI Act.\n       Open government advocates say it is the most troubling of \n     the nine exemptions because it allows Congress to cloak vital \n     information in secrecy through legislation, often without a \n     public hearing or debate. They say Congress frequently \n     invokes the exemption to appease private sector businesses, \n     which argue it is necessary to protect proprietary \n     information.\n       ``It is an easy way to slap a secrecy stamp on the \n     information,'' said Rick Blum, director of \n     openthegovernment.org, a coalition of more than 30 groups \n     concerned about government secrecy.\n       The legislative intent of Congress is far more difficult to \n     challenge than a federal agency's denial for the release of \n     information, said Kevin M. Goldberg, general counsel to the \n     American Society of Newspaper Editors.\n       ``This secrecy is often perpetuated in secret as most of \n     the (third exemption) provisions consist of one or two \n     paragraphs tucked into a much larger bill with no notice that \n     the Freedom of Information Act will be affected at all,'' \n     Goldberg said.\n       There are at least 140 cases where congressional lawmakers \n     have inserted such exemptions, according to a 2003 Justice \n     Department report.\n       The report notes that Congress has been ``increasingly \n     active in enacting such statutory provisions.''\n       The exemptions have become so popular that finding them in \n     proposed legislation is ``like playing a game of Wackamole,'' \n     one staffer to Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., joked. ``As soon as \n     you handle one, another one pops up.''\n       Congress used the exemption in its massive Homeland \n     Security Act three years ago, granting businesses protection \n     from information disclosure if they agreed to share \n     information about the vulnerabilities of their facilities.\n       And in another twist on the exemption, Congress inserted a \n     provision into the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004 \n     that states that ``no funds appropriated under this or any \n     other act may be used to disclose'' records about firearms \n     tracking to the public.\n       Government agencies have also sought protection from \n     information disclosure.\n       For example, Congress passed an amendment to the National \n     Security Act in 1984 that exempted the CIA from having to \n     comply with the search and review requirements of the FOI Act \n     for its ``operational files.''\n       Most of the information in those files, which included \n     records about foreign and counterintelligence operations, was \n     already protected from disclosure under the other exemptions \n     in the FOI Act.\n       But before Congress granted the exemption, the agency had \n     to search and review each document to justify withholding the \n     information, which cost time and money.\n       Open government advocates say many of the exemptions \n     inserted into legislation are not justified.\n       ``This is back door secrecy,'' said Thomas Blanton, \n     executive director of the National Security Archive at George \n     Washington University, a nonprofit research institute based \n     in Washington.\n       When an industry wants to keep information secret, it seeks \n     the so-called third exemption, he said.\n       ``It all takes place behind the sausage grinder,'' Blanton \n     said. ``You don't know what gristle is going through the \n     spout, you just have to eat it.''\n       But Daniel J. Metcalfe, co-director of the Justice \n     Department's Office of lnformation and Privacy, said the \n     exemption is crucial to the FOI Act's structure.\n       In the case of the animal identification bill, the \n     exemption is critical to winning support from the cattle \n     industry and on Capitol Hill.\n       ``If we are going to develop an animal ID system that's \n     effective and meaningful, we have to respect participants' \n     private information,'' said Peterson, the Minnesota lawmaker \n     who proposed the identification system. ``The goal of a \n     national animal I.D. system is to protect livestock owners \n     as well as the public.''\n       As the livestock industry sees it, it is providing \n     information that will help protect the public health. In \n     exchange for proprietary information about their herds, they \n     believe they should receive confidence that their business \n     records will not be shared with the public.\n       ``The producers would be reluctant to support the bill \n     without the protection,'' said Bryan Dierlam, executive \n     director of government affairs at the National Cattleman's \n     Beef Association.\n       The animal identification bill provides the government with \n     the information it needs to protect the public in the event \n     of a disease outbreak, Dierlam said. ``But it would protect \n     the producers from John Q. Public trying to willy-nilly \n     access their information.''\n       Food safety experts agree there is a clear need for an \n     animal identification system to protect the public, but they \n     are not certain that the exemption to the FOI Act is \n     necessary.\n       ``It's sad that Congress feels they have to give away \n     something to the cattle industry to achieve it,'' said \n     Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of the food safety program at \n     the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit \n     organization based in Washington.\n       Slipping the exemption into legislation without notice is \n     another problem cited by open government advocates.\n       It has become such a problem that the Senate's strongest \n     FOI Act supporters, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Sen. \n     Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., proposed that lawmakers be required to \n     uniformly identify the exemption in all future bills.\n       ``If Congress wants to create new exemptions, it must do so \n     in the light of day,'' Cornyn said. ``And it must do so in a \n     way that provides an opportunity to argue for or against the \n     new exemption--rather than have new exemptions creep into the \n     law unnoticed.''\n       Leahy agreed, saying that Congress must be diligent in \n     reviewing new exemptions to prevent possible abuses.\n       ``In Washington, loopholes tend to beget more loopholes, \n     and it's the same with FOI Act exemptions,'' Leahy said. \n     ``Focusing more sunshine on this process is an antidote to \n     exemption creep.''\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be \nread the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1181) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1181\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, late last night the Senate finished \nwork on what I call the Clean Energy Act of 2005. For Americans who \nwatch the legislative process, this is not likely to have been the \nfront-page news, but it is by far one of most important things we have \ndone in this Senate because it affects millions of Americans. Our final \nvote is on Tuesday. I anticipate it will be a strong, bipartisan vote \nin support, just as the work that was done here was strong and \nbipartisan.\n\n[[Page S7386]]\n\n  The first thing the bill will do, and most important, in my opinion, \nis to stabilize and lower natural gas prices. We hear a lot of talk \nabout $60 a barrel oil. No one likes to pay high prices for gasoline at \nthe pump. The bigger problem is the price of natural gas. In North \nCarolina and Tennessee, all across this country, there are millions of \nblue-collar workers who work in plants where the cost of natural gas is \ndriving their jobs overseas. Natural gas used to be in this country the \nlowest price in the industrial world at a unit price of $2 or $3. Our \neconomy was geared to it. Today it is at $7, and headed up.\n  If you are working at the Eastman plant in Tennessee, where 10,000 or \n11,000 people work, and 40 percent of the cost of your product is \nnatural gas--because they make chemicals there; and you can buy natural \ngas at $7 here, and you can buy it at $5, $4 overseas--those jobs are \ngoing to be headed overseas if that keeps up for very long.\n  If you are a farmer in North Carolina or Tennessee, the cost of \nfertilizer has gone up $200 to $500 per unit. That is a big pay cut for \nyou if you are a farmer.\n  If you are a homeowner across this country and you rely on natural \ngas to heat and cool your home--and natural gas heats and cools more \nhomes than any other kind of fuel--you might find your bill going up 50 \npercent recently.\n  So for blue-collar workers, for farmers, and for homeowners, this \nlegislation we will be voting on Tuesday stabilizes and potentially \nlowers the price of natural gas. That is one of the single most \nimportant things we can do for our country.\n  The second thing, in my view, the bill does that is important is it \nrecognizes that global warming is a problem. There is not a complete \nconsensus about that in the Senate, but the bill has a different kind \nof consensus that makes more difference, in my opinion, than the \nmandates that we did not adopt because the bill changes the way we \nproduce electricity toward ways that are low carbon and no carbon. If \nyou produce less carbon, then you have less global warming, if you \nbelieve carbon makes a difference in global warming.\n  So there is a big difference in the conversation and debate in the \nSenate this year over last year, in my judgment. While the McCain-\nLieberman amendment was rejected--I voted against it myself--there was \nadopted the Hagel amendment, which has significant new incentives for \nproducers of carbon across this country to reduce the amount of carbon \nthey emit.\n  We did pass the Bingaman sense-of-the-Senate resolution, which I \nvoted for, which says we expect one day to have mandatory controls that \nlead us toward a lower carbon production economy. But I, for one, am \nnot yet ready to impose mandatory controls on this big, complicated \neconomy because I do not think we know enough about what it would do to \nthe economy, and I do not think it is wise.\n  Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman have said they will begin, in \nJuly, to hold hearings about this complicated process and to assess how \nthe incentives we may enact--or likely will enact--in this bill \noperate. Over the next year or two or three or four years, we may learn \nmore.\n  We may learn enough where a majority of us are willing to have some \nsystem of mandatory caps, just as we have in other areas of clean air \nand acid rain, for example. But in my opinion, we are not there yet.\n  But the second most important thing in this legislation, in my view, \nis a shift in attitude toward global warming, a recognition by a \nmajority of the Senators that it is a real problem and taking \nsignificant steps to change the way we make electricity so that we make \nit in a low-carbon or no-carbon way.\n  The third big change, I believe, is the technologies we use to meet \nthose objectives of lowering natural gas prices and of producing low-\ncarbon or no-carbon electricity. I would call it a new realism about \nenergy in this country. This is a big country. We produce 33 percent of \nall the money. We use 25 percent of all the energy in the world. We are \nnot some desert island. We use a lot of electricity for our computers \nand our jobs and our homes. If we have any disruption in that--whether \nit is a blackout or it is a price that is too high or a lack of \nsupply--it has devastating consequences for us.\n  So there is a new realism, I would say, about exactly what is \navailable to help us get where we want to go. First is aggressive \nconservation. That is new about this bill. It is twice the amount of \nconservation that was in the bill that we passed a year ago which never \nbecame law. By conservation, I mean new efficiency standards for \nappliances. The estimate of our committee is that these new efficiency \nstandards for appliances will avoid the building of as many as 45 large \ngas electricity plants. That is significant conservation.\n  There is a provision in the bill that would give 300,000 Americans a \n$2,000 deduction to buy a hybrid or an advanced-diesel car. That \nreduces the use of oil. That is aggressive conservation.\n  There is an amendment in the bill that would have the President \nmandate a million-barrels-a-day reduction in the use of oil. That is \naggressive conservation because that amount of oil equals about the \nentire production onshore of the State of Texas or the entire projected \nproduction from ANWR in Alaska. So we have aggressive conservation. We \nstart there because that is the first thing we can do to save oil, \nincrease supply, and reduce prices.\n  The second thing this bill does is recognize we need new supplies. We \nhave taken steps to make it easier to bring liquefied natural gas into \nthis country. Some may say: Oh, we don't want to go down that road. We \nare already bringing in too much oil.\n  We all agree with that. But if we do not bring the natural gas in, we \nare going to be sending the jobs out. And for the foreseeable future, \nfor the short term, if we want to reduce the cost of natural gas, we \nneed to bring a lot of it in from overseas. And having a few more \nterminals, as provided in the streamlined provisions in this bill--\nwhich still give States and communities input into where it goes--is a \nvery important provision.\n  This legislation basically relaunches the American interest in \nnuclear power. That is realistic, too. There is a growing interest \nin global warming. That is caused, many say, by carbon in the air. So \nwe need energy that has less carbon. Seventy percent of the carbon-free \nelectricity we produce in the United States today comes from nuclear \npower. So if we care about global warming, we better care about nuclear \npower. There is no other way around it.\n\n  There are incentives for advanced nuclear power, the kind of reactors \nthat do not cost as much to build. We know how to operate them. Twenty \npercent of our electricity is already from that. We invented the \ntechnology. Dozens of our Navy vessels operate with nuclear reactors. \nThey have, without incident, since the 1950s. France is now 80 percent \nnuclear power. They are the European country most likely to meet the \nKyoto standards because they have adopted the technology that is likely \nto produce the largest amount of carbon-free electricity--nuclear \npower.\n  We also have come to a consensus within the last year--I think I am \naccurate on this--that waiting in the wings behind nuclear power is \ncoal gasification and carbon sequestration. Long words, but it simply \nmeans we take this several-hundred-year supply of coal that we have and \nwe find a clean way to burn it. The way we are encouraging that in this \nlegislation is to turn the coal into gas and then burn the gas. That \ngets rid of the nitrogen and the mercury and the sulfur, but it leaves \nthe carbon.\n  There are also provisions, incentives in this bill, and loan \nguarantees and authorization, then, to have large demonstrations of \ncarbon sequestration, taking the remaining carbon dioxide--the major \nresidue or pollutant from coal gasification--and putting it in the \nground.\n  Now, this is the strategy that is preferred by several important \nenvironmental groups. That sounds like a surprise. They would prefer \ncoal? Here is the reason. They have some concerns about nuclear--the \nproliferation problems, the storage of waste--but if coal can be burned \nin a clean way and the carbon can be recaptured and put in the ground, \nthat is a solution to global warming without mandates.\n  That is a solution, and not just in the United States but around the \nworld. Because we might clean up our air, but if China and India and \nthe rest of the\n\n[[Page S7387]]\n\nworld build hundreds of coal plants that are dirty, it will not matter \nwhat we do because the air just goes around the world, and we will be \nbreathing it, too. So a very important way for us to help the world \nhave clean air and an adequate supply of electricity is coal \ngasification.\n  So I call that the new realism: conservation; increased natural gas \nsupplies, including from overseas; relaunching nuclear; and coal \ngasification and carbon sequestration. If we do that over the next 10 \nyears, we will have an adequate supply of American-produced, reliable, \nlow-carbon electricity. And the debate about global warming will be off \nour desks because we will not be producing enough carbon to affect \nglobal warming, and we can argue about something else.\n  Now, there is also generous support in this legislation for renewable \nenergy. I am especially pleased that for the first time, we have \nsupport for solar energy in a useful way. Up to this time, we have had \na renewable tax credit that solar could not take advantage of. But the \nFinance Committee changed that. Solar shows some promise, as does \nbiomass, as does some geothermal, as does wind. I think my colleagues \nknow I think wind is heavily oversubsidized and overestimated, but it \nis supported in here.\n  But there is a realism about that. We are not going to run the \nAmerican economy on windmills and solar panels. They will provide a few \npercent of what we need by the year 2025. If we want carbon-free \nadequate supplies of American-produced energy, we are going to have to \nconserve, launch nuclear again, do coal gasification, and bring in \nsupplies of natural gas. Renewables are fine, but they are a very small \npart of the answer. While we do not all agree on that here in the \nSenate, there is still a consensus.\n  There is also generous support for longer term technologies. I think \nwe are realistic about that as well. There is a great deal of \nexcitement about the hydrogen-fuel-cell vehicle.\n  When I was in Yokohama a year ago, I visited a hydrogen-fuel-cell \nvehicle filling station. There were seven SUVs parked, all of them from \ndifferent manufacturers in the world, many of them American. I filled \nup the Nissan hydrogen-fuel-cell vehicle. Carlos Ghosn is the chief \nexecutive of Nissan. He drives that vehicle around Tokyo every weekend. \nHe is spending $700 million of Nissan money every year on hydrogen-\nfuel-cell research. And Toyota is doing the same. Others--Ford, General \nMotors--are all interested.\n  But the potential of hydrogen is down the road. It's several years \naway. We are going to be talking about it, working on it--and hopefully \nit will come to fruition. But it is several years down the road. When \nwe produce enough hydrogen to run our automobiles, we will have to use \nnuclear power or natural gas or coal gasification to produce that \nhydrogen.\n  So I would say of special note--to reemphasize some of the points I \nmade--is the serious interest in conservation. This is a bipartisan \nbill. You do not hear the word ``conservation'' come out of the mouths \nof every Senator first. You might not think Republican Senators would \nstart out talking, first, about conservation. But we know if we want to \nreduce the cost of natural gas, if we want to reduce our reliance on \noil, that the quickest and easiest way to do that is aggressive \nconservation.\n  Nuclear power--Senator Domenici, our chairman, mentioned to me we had \nsomething like 167 amendments offered to this bill at one time, and so \nfar as we could tell, not a single amendment was antinuclear, not a \nsingle amendment was antinuclear. There is a growing awareness that if \nwe want carbon-free electricity, we are going to have to have some \nnuclear powerplants to do that. That is a big change even just from \nlast year.\n  Another big change, as I mentioned, is the emergence of coal \ngasification and carbon sequestration and support and research for that \nin a very serious way, both in industrial sites and in freestanding \nplants, and sequestration demonstrations. None of that was being \ndiscussed broadly by the Energy Committee last year. A few Senators \nunderstood that, but most of us, I think it is fair to say, did not \nreally see the significance of this technology. Now we do, and we have \nstrong support for it.\n  The importance of liquefied natural gas and the streamlining of \nsiting--that may be the most important provision in the bill in terms \nof an immediate impact because there are large amounts of natural gas \nthat can be brought in.\n  Another important development is the serious discussion of new \nsupplies of natural gas here at home. Now, this is a very controversial \nsubject. But last year we could not even get an inventory of what \nsupplies of natural gas we have offshore. We have plenty of natural \ngas; we just have rules that say you cannot drill for it. There was no \nserious discussion of giving States the opportunity--other States, such \nas Virginia--the option of drilling in Federal waters offshore for \nnatural gas, as Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana now do.\n  We couldn't get a vote on that because of the controversy, but I \nbelieve there were 51 votes in the Senate for giving States the option \nof deciding for themselves whether they wanted to allow natural gas \ndrilling offshore, take a share of the money for the State, put a share \nof the money in a national fund for wildlife preservation, put the rest \nin the Federal Treasury, and put the gas into our system so we could \nlower the cost of natural gas. There is a lot of progress there.\n  Finally, I pay tribute to two parts of the Senate. One is to the \nFinance Committee for what it did with the tax title. The total amount \nof money of incentives is $14 to $16 billion. But rather than the \namount of money, it is what it is for because it is completely \nconsistent with clean energy objectives for low-carbon and no-carbon, \nnew technologies. There is money for clean energy bonds for certified \ncoal products, consumer incentives for hybrid and diesel vehicles, \nincentives for energy-efficient appliances and buildings, incentives \nfor coal gasification powerplants, incentives for solar energy \ndevelopment in an important way for the first time in a long time, \nincentives for the deployment of advanced nuclear power, incentives for \ncogeneration projects. All of these will change the way we produce \nelectricity.\n  I compliment Chairman Grassley and his staff for this. I hope very \nmuch that the Senate version of how we spend our tax dollars in support \nof research and development for clean energy is dominant in the \nconference rather than another version. That will be something we will \nhave to work out with our friends in the House of Representatives.\n  I think a great deal of credit needs to go to Chairman Domenici and \nto Senator Bingaman, ranking Democrat on the committee. This bill came \nout 21 to 1 in favor from our committee. For those who are not in the \nSenate, this may sound like inside housekeeping. This body operates \nonly by consensus. Nothing happens here--because of the unique nature \nof this body, where every Senator is an equal, every single one of us \ncan stop anything at least for a while, unless there is a consensus. \nThe consensus came because of the kind of leadership, beginning with \nChairman Domenici, who personally visited all the members of the \ncommittee, including the Democratic members, in their offices, took \ntheir advice, incorporated their ideas, and we came to a consensus.\n  Senator Bingaman pointed out in our hearing that we had many votes, \nbut he didn't remember a single party-line vote. We had close votes, \nbut we voted our convictions and our regions of the country and our \nbackgrounds and attitudes. We didn't line up and say: This is a \nRepublican view and a Democratic view.\n  I am glad we have waited until next Tuesday morning to vote on the \nClean Energy Act of 2005, until Chairman Domenici and Senator Bingaman \ncan be here. They had to be in New Mexico yesterday for a BRAC hearing. \nThey deserve to be here. I want the full Senate and our country to see \nthe result that they have led. I believe their being here and the big \nvote we have will get us off to a big start.\n  I feel very good about what the Senate has done. I hope there is a \nbig vote on Tuesday. For the American people, the result will be \nstabilized and lower natural gas prices for homeowners, for blue-collar \nworkers, and for farmers; No. 2, a recognition that global warming is a \nproblem, and the beginning of aggressive conservation and a variety\n\n[[Page S7388]]\n\nof technologies to deal with that by producing low-carbon and no-carbon \nelectricity; and, finally, a realism about the base load that we need \nto encourage in this country to produce that kind of electricity, \naggressive conservation, new supplies of natural gas, relaunching \nnuclear power, coal gasification, and carbon sequestration.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

WILSON, JR.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this morning the Washington Post carries \nan article about the death of GEN Louis Wilson who was a former \nCommandant of the U.S. Marine Corps. He died on June 21 at his home in \nBirmingham, AL. He was a native of my State of Mississippi and was a \npersonal friend and a great soldier and a wonderful Commandant of the \nU.S. Marine Corps. He and his wife Jane lived here in Washington in the \nMarine barracks, the Commandant's residence, and befriended my wife \nRose and me when I was a young Member of Congress before I was elected \nto the Senate. He was serving as Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n  We enjoyed many opportunities to visit with them when they were \nresident in Washington. He was a very distinguished officer in the \nMarine Corps during World War II. He was given the congressional Medal \nof Honor for gallantry during his service in the battle in Guam on \nFonte Hill. The description of his exploits and gallantry are contained \nin the citation that was issued when he was awarded the Congressional \nMedal of Honor.\n  The article talks about his career in glowing terms, a well-earned \ntribute for a courageous and brave soldier, and the first Marine Corps \nCommandant to serve as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He \nestablished a tradition when he was selected to serve on the Joint \nChiefs of Staff which is carried on today. It was because of his strong \nleadership and his example that there is no question that a good \ndecision was made to include in the Joint Chiefs of Staff the \nCommandant of the Marine Corps.\n  We mourn his passing, but we rejoice in the great life he lived and \nthe inspiration that his career provided to marines in all of the \nsucceeding generations of service in the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article in today's Washington Post \nand a copy of the citation for Louis Hugh Wilson, Jr., upon his being \nawarded the Congressional Medal of Honor be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jun. 24, 2005]\n\n             Gen. Louis Wilson Dies; Awarded Medal of Honor\n\n                          (By Adam Bernstein)\n\n       Gen. Louis H. Wilson Jr., 85, who received the Medal of \n     Honor for taking and holding a key position on Guam during \n     World War II and later served as commandant of the Marine \n     Corps, died June 21 at his home in Birmingham. He had a \n     degenerative nerve disorder.\n       On July 1, 1975, Gen. Wilson became the 26th commandant of \n     the Marine Corps. He was the first commandant to serve full \n     time on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, providing the corps with a \n     greater say on defense matters.\n       During his four-year tenure, he was credited with shaping a \n     post-Vietnam corps of strong expeditionary units ready for \n     ``high mobility and high-intensity combat.'' He made \n     personnel changes to raise morale and address disciplinary \n     problems.\n       He increased academic enlistment standards (he wanted 75 \n     percent of recruits to have high school diplomas); ordered \n     the discharge of thousands of Marines with discipline \n     problems; and offered tougher directives on weight \n     requirements. ``Obesity must vanish,'' he said and set for \n     himself a daily jogging regimen.\n       As commandant, he had a reputation for being blunt, \n     thoughtful and refreshing. He publicly acknowledged the \n     brutal treatment of recruits by some drill instructors and \n     tried to change the policies that granted drill instructors \n     ``too much autonomy. ``\n       In 1975, he told an interviewer that the Vietnam War had \n     been fought in vain from a military view-point.\n       He also castigated draft laws that ``had been gerrymandered \n     so that only the poor, the blacks and disadvantaged were \n     really drafted. A great many fine young men came in. But many \n     draftees, thrown in with them, were the dregs of society \n     [and] many with continuing dissatisfaction with the war.''\n       ``It's not like the old days,'' he added, ``when you could \n     leave your wallet on your sack.''\n       The Mississippi native was an effective witness on Capitol \n     Hill, prepared and authoritative in his bearing. Earlier, he \n     had been a corps liaison to Congress. He was a favorite of \n     Sen. John C. Stennis (D-Miss.), head of the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee, who became his advocate for full \n     membership on the Joint Chiefs of Staff in October 1978.\n       Previously, Marine Corp commandants attended meetings of \n     the Joint Chiefs only when there was business of pressing \n     concern to the corps.\n       Louis Hugh Wilson Jr. was born Feb. 11, 1920, in Brandon, \n     Miss. His father was a farmer who died when Louis was 5. He \n     was raised by his mother, and her large, extended family \n     helped them through the Depression.\n       As a young man, he sold vegetables from a goat cart. He \n     later studied economics at Millsaps College in Jackson, \n     Miss., where he played football and was on the track team. A \n     Marine Corps recruiter who came to campus persuaded him to \n     enter the service after his graduation in 1941.\n       He landed at Guadalcanal, Efate and Bougainville and \n     received the Medal of Honor, the military's highest award for \n     valor, while fighting Japanese forces at Fonte Hill, Guam, on \n     July 25 and 26, 1944. At the time, he was a captain and the \n     commanding officer; of a rifle company.\n       Launching a daylight attack against massive machine gun \n     resistance, he pushed his men 300 yards across open terrain \n     and captured a portion of a hill that contained the enemy \n     command post. That night, he took command of other \n     disorganized units and motorized equipment and fortified \n     defenses while risking exposure to enemy fire.\n       Wounded three times within five hours, he briefly sought \n     treatment before volunteering to return to duty to defend \n     against counterattacks that lasted through the night.\n       At one point, he dashed 50 yards through flying shrapnel \n     and bullets to rescue a wounded Marine beyond the front \n     lines. That was followed by hand-to-hand fighting over a 10-\n     hour span, repelling Japanese troops that sought to overrun \n     the Allied lines through 11 full-fledged attacks.\n       His Medal of Honor citation continued: ``Then organizing a \n     17-man patrol, he immediately advanced upon a strategic slope \n     essential to the security of his position and, boldly defying \n     intense mortar, machinegun, and rifle fire which struck down \n     13 of his men, drove relentlessly forward with the remnants \n     of his patrol to seize the vital ground.''\n       He was credited with a pivotal role in the victory, which \n     included the deaths of 350 Japanese troops. President Harry \n     S. Truman presented him with the Medal of Honor on Oct. 5, \n     1945.\n       After the war, he held recruiting and command assignments, \n     graduated from the National War College and served as \n     assistant chief of staff to the 1st Marine Division in \n     Vietnam during the war there.\n       He was promoted to brigadier general in 1966 and, after \n     being appointed lieutenant general in 1972, assumed command \n     of the Marine force in the Pacific. His decorations included \n     three awards of the Legion of Merit.\n       After retiring from the military in 1979, he served on the \n     corporate boards of such businesses as Merrill Lynch, the \n     financial services company, and Fluor Corp., an engineering \n     and construction company.\n       Survivors include his wife of 61 years, Jane Clark Wilson, \n     and a daughter, Janet Taylor, both of Birmingham; and two \n     grandsons.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                        Wilson, Louis Hugh, Jr.\n\n       Rank and organization: Captain, U.S. Marine Corps, \n     Commanding Rifle Company, 2d Battalion, 9th Marines, 3d \n     Marine Division. Place and date: Fonte Hill, Guam, 25-26 July \n     1944. Entered service at: Mississippi. Born: 11 February \n     1920, Brandon, Miss. Citation: For conspicuous gallantry and \n     intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call \n     of duty as commanding officer of a rifle company attached to \n     the 2d Battalion, 9th Marines, 3d Marine Division, in action \n     against enemy Japanese forces at Fonte Hill, Guam, 25-26 July \n     1944. Ordered to take that portion of the hill within his \n     zone of action, Capt. Wilson initiated his attack in mid-\n     afternoon, pushed up the rugged, open terrain against \n     terrific machinegun and rifle fire for 300 yards and \n     successfully captured the objective. Promptly assuming \n     command of other disorganized units and motorized equipment \n     in addition to his own company and reinforcing platoon, he \n     organized his night defenses in the face of continuous \n     hostile fire and, although wounded 3 times during this 5-hour \n     period, completed his disposition of men and guns before \n     retiring to the company command post for medical attention. \n     Shortly thereafter, when the enemy launched the first of a \n     series of savage counterattacks lasting all night, he \n     voluntarily rejoined his besieged units and repeatedly \n     exposed himself to the merciless hail of shrapnel and \n     bullets, dashing 50 yards into the open on 1 occasion to \n     rescue a wounded marine lying helpless beyond the frontlines. \n     Fighting fiercely in hand-to-hand encounters, he led his men \n     in furiously waged battle for approximately 10 hours, \n     tenaciously holding his line and repelling the fanatically \n     renewed counterthrusts until he succeeded in crushing the \n     last efforts of the hard-pressed Japanese early the following \n     morning. Then\n\n[[Page S7389]]\n\n     organizing a 17-man patrol, he immediately advanced upon a \n     strategic slope essential to the security of his position \n     and, boldly defying intense mortar, machinegun, and rifle \n     fire which struck down 13 of his men, drove relentlessly \n     forward with the remnants of his patrol to seize the vital \n     ground. By his indomitable leadership, daring combat tactics, \n     and valor in the face of overwhelming odds, Capt. Wilson \n     succeeded in capturing and holding the strategic high ground \n     in his regimental sector, thereby contributing essentially to \n     the success of his regimental mission and to the annihilation \n     of 350 Japanese troops. His inspiring conduct throughout the \n     critical periods of this decisive action sustains and \n     enhances the highest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, as we bring this week to a close and look \nback, I am pleased with the progress that has been made on the Energy \nbill which we have completed, in essence, except for final passage \nwhich we will do Tuesday. Then we are ahead of what I initially \nanticipated, having proceeded to our first appropriations bill, the \nInterior appropriations.\n  The bill, as has been mentioned, is an excellent bill. I congratulate \nboth the leaders on that bill, the chairman and the ranking member on \nthe Interior Subcommittee, for their superb shepherding of this bill \nthrough their subcommittee, and now bringing it to the floor. I also \nthank the committee for reporting a bill that keeps to the spending \nallocation under this year's budget resolution.\n  As we travel back home, and as we will see when we go back during the \nFourth of July recess, the American people expect us to adhere to that \nbudget, a very strict spending budget, a budget on which Chairman Gregg \nled, and we passed, the fastest budget we have ever passed but, more \nimportant than that, a budget that shows fiscal discipline. Indeed, the \nranking member and chairman of the subcommittee adhered to that \nallocation throughout. Senators Burns and Dorgan have worked hard to be \nresponsible stewards of American taxpayer dollars. At the same time it \nis reflected in the bill the importance of being stewards of the \nnatural wonders and the heritage and the beauty of our great country. I \nthank Senator Burns and Senator Dorgan for their hard work.\n  It is our first bill as we approach the appropriations process. It is \nthe first of 12 newly constituted appropriations bills that we will \nconsider. It is my hope to see all 12 of these bills passed. We need to \ndo our very best to avoid the scenario that has unfolded all too often \nin recent years. Come November or December, we should not have to \nresort to an omnibus bill that lumps all of these individual bills that \nwe wouldn't have been able to pass into a single bill. We are going to \ndo everything possible to systematically address each one of these \nbills as they come along, and then be able to pass them to avoid coming \nto what has almost become customary, and that is an omnibus process.\n  It has been a decade, 10 years, not since 1995, since all \nappropriations bills were wrapped up before beginning the fiscal year. \nOver that last decade, the average was sending only 2.1 appropriations \nbills to the President for his signature before the beginning of the \nfiscal year, only 2. Actually it was 2.1, as I mentioned, \nappropriations bills.\n  We need to do better. We can do better, and we will do better. We \nneed to get the job done--get every bill done right and done on time. I \nam very optimistic we can do that. This year, we passed the budget, as \nI mentioned, in the fastest time in history. That budget establishes an \noverall 2006 spending ceiling for all appropriations bills. And because \nof that ceiling, because of all of us working together, and by working \ntogether, I am hopeful that the process will proceed smoothly. We have \ninitiated that process today with the Interior Appropriations bill. As \nwe considered the bill before us today, I want to leave with a special \nplace I think of when I contemplate what my vote on this bill means for \nAmerica.\n  On a second issue, as we look to the appropriations bill that is \nlikely and almost certain to follow the Interior Appropriations bill, I \nwant to comment very briefly and introduce what we will see at the end \nof next week, and that is a comment on homeland security.\n  As September 11 so tragically demonstrated, protecting our borders--\nwhether by air, by sea, or by land--has taken on a level of urgency and \nimportance as never before. When you are talking to people at home, it \narises again and again--it is almost the first, second, or third \nquestion at every town meeting we hold--border security.\n  Border security is no longer just an immigration issue or a customs \nissue. Border security must be a unified and coordinated strategy to \nthwart terrorism, which is something we didn't think about prior to \nSeptember 11 nearly as much as we do today--thwarting terrorism and \nenforcing the laws.\n  Next week, we will debate the Homeland Security Appropriations bill, \nand we must include the necessary resources to meet these challenges.\n  This bill will address concerns regarding insecurity of our borders, \nwhich we know in fact does threaten national security. It is time to \naddress that issue. We will again do that next week.\n  As we all know, each year thousands of people cross our borders \nillegally. The vast majority seek little more than better lives for \ntheir families, which we understand. But some do bring drugs. Some do \ntraffic in human beings. Some may even have ties to terrorist groups. \nWe don't know exactly how many come or will come. We don't know exactly \nwhat their backgrounds are. We don't know who might harm us. In today's \ntime, that is wrong.\n  We know one thing: If drug dealers and human traffickers can operate \non our borders, terrorists can as well. Our national security requires \na safer and more secure border, and it is up to us to deliver that.\n  We face a crisis. Over 7,000 miles of land stretch across our \nborders. If you look at our ports, they handle as many as 16 million \ncargo containers; and 330 million noncitizens--students, visitors, and \nworkers--cross our borders each year; 330 million noncitizens go back \nand forth across the borders. An unprecedented flow of illegal \nimmigrants, criminals, terrorists, and unsecured cargo crosses our \nborders.\n  As representatives of the people, we need to focus on the rule of \nlaw. We will be focusing on that rule of law. This Nation is founded on \nthe concept that all men are created equal and all have the inalienable \nright to be free. But those freedoms are protected by our institutions \nand these institutions require respect for the rule of law.\n  Those illegal immigrants who may wish us no harm have still violated \nour rule of law. We must remember this as this debate unfolds on border \nsecurity next week.\n  Finally, America has always opened our doors to immigrants. We must \ncontinue to do so and we will continue to do so. People come to America \nlooking for a better life, and we live better lives because of them. \nThey contribute to our economy. They help weave that rich cultural \nfabric that makes up our society. But we must ensure that immigrants \nwho come to America come here legally.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for such \ntime as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to address an amendment that is \nvery important to me and my State relating to Montana's magnificent \nRocky Mountain front. I filed the amendment to the Energy bill and, \neven though we are not on the bill at the moment, I will talk about the \namendment. I will speak about what it would have accomplished because I \nwill not press for action on this amendment. Rather, I will offer it at \na later time.\n  So what is the front? The front, as we call it back home, is one of \nthe largest\n\n[[Page S7390]]\n\nand most intact wild places left in the lower 48 States. We call it a \nfront because that is what it is. It is a front.\n  Anybody driving across the State of Montana westward, coming in from \nthe east, first encounters open plains and prairies; they are vast. And \nthen, suddenly, out in the distance the Rocky Mountains, the \nContinental Divide, jumps out of the plains. That is what we call the \neastern front.\n  It is amazing and it astounds me every time I drive across the State \nand see it from a distance. It is special to Montanans and it is sacred \nto the Blackfeet Indian tribe. It is home to the Nation's largest \npopulation of big horn sheep, and the second largest population of elk, \nas well as deer, grizzly bear, and countless other species of fish and \nwildlife. In fact, the front is the only place in the lower 48 where \ngrizzly bears still roam the plains, just as they did when Lewis and \nClark passed through the area 200 years ago.\n  Because of this exceptional wild space, which includes Glacier \nNational Park, millions of acres of wilderness and the Blackfeet Indian \nReservation, the front offers unsurpassed hunting, fishing, and \nrecreational opportunities.\n  Sportsmen, local landowners, local elected officials, hikers, Tribal \nleaders, local communities, and many other Montanans have worked for \ndecades to protect and preserve the front for future generations. I \nhave hiked in the front many times, including to the top of Ear \nMountain. It's special to me personally.\n  Most Montanans believe very strongly, frankly, that oil and gas \ndevelopment and the front just don't mix.\n  The front is too wild and too precious to subject it to roads, \npipelines, noise and other such development activities. In addition, \nsurveys of the area indicate that there just isn't that much oil and \ngas in the front, certainly not enough to justify disturbing this \npristine area.\n  That is why it has been well over a decade since any development \nactivity occurred there at all, and why this administration last year \nhalted an environmental impact study in the Blackleaf Area of the \nFront. The administration conceded that the time and expense associated \nwith evaluating drilling options in the front was not the best use of \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  They conceded that this area might indeed be one of those special \nplaces where the benefits of oil and gas development do not outweigh \nits costs. Even the administration understands that it's highly \nunlikely that any leaseholder will ever be able to drill in the front.\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  That's why I filed an amendment to the energy bill that offers a \npermanent solution to the century-long conflict over development on the \nfront.\n  My amendment would establish a voluntary program allowing \nleaseholders in the Badger-Two Medicine or Blackleaf Areas of the front \nto cancel their leases. In exchange, leaseholders could receive rights \nto drill elsewhere in Montana, or bidding, rental or royalty credits \nfor existing leases in Montana, or a tax credit.\n  Any canceled lease would be permanently withdrawn from future leasing \nand oil and gas development activity. This withdrawal provision would \nalso apply to a lease canceled for any other reason, including as the \nresult of a private buy-out.\n  To encourage leaseholders to take advantage of the program, it would \nexpire at the end of 2009. Finally, it would provide economic \ndevelopment grants to Teton County, Montana, to compensate the county \nfor the loss of any potential revenue from these leases.\n  This is a win-win proposal that provides leaseholders value for their \ninvestment, while providing permanent protections for the front. \nBecause it's a purely voluntary program, leaseholders don't have to \nparticipate, but there will be a strong incentive for them to do so--\nthey know that their leases will probably never be developed, given the \nintense local opposition and the expense and time involved with trying \nto drill in the front.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the time was not right for me to call \nfor a vote on ame mendment, but I thought it was very important to \nshare it with my colleagues. I will work hard in the coming months to \nbuild support for my proposal, which I think is critical to ending the \nconflict over the front and preserving its beauty and wildlife for \nfuture generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/24/senate-section/article/S7390-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7390-S7393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      AMERICA'S PLACE IN THE WORLD\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, a little less than 2500 years ago, in \nAthens, Pericles the king looked out from the Acropolis. In the bay \nbeyond the port city, he saw some of Athens's 200 ships, which brought \npeace, commerce, and Athenian pottery to a free-trade area of more than \n100 Greek city-states. Pericles boasted: ``The wares of the whole world \nfind their way to us.''\n  Pericles stood astride one the wealthiest, most culturally-advanced \nstates of his time. Greeks had vanquished the evil empire of Persia to \nthe east. Pericles had transformed the Delian League, a defensive \nalliance formed to contain Persia, into an Athenian empire. And \nPericles advanced the world of ideas, advocating the new idea of \ndemocracy.\n  Said Pericles: ``Athens alone, of the states we know, comes to her \ntesting time in a greatness that surpasses what was imagined of her. . \n. . Future ages will wonder at us, as the present age does now.''\n  Pericles had every reason to believe that Divine Providence had \nsmiled on him and on his city.\n  A little less than 500 years ago, in Aachen, Charles V looked up to \nreceive the crown of Germany. Charles had become the most powerful \nruler in Christendom: Holy Roman Emperor and sovereign over what is now \nSpain, Central Europe, southern Italy, and Spain's new overseas \ncolonies. Sir Walter Scott said: ``The sun never sets on the immense \nempire of Charles V.'' Charles sought to unite his empire into a \nuniversal, multinational, Christian empire. His motto was: ``Even \nfurther.''\n  Charles had every reason to believe that divine providence had smiled \non him and on his empire.\n  A little more that 150 years ago, in London, Queen Victoria, adorned \nin pink, silver, and diamonds, escorted by a troop of the Household \nCavalry, road in a closed carriage from Buckingham Palace to Hyde Park \nto see the Great Exhibition at The Crystal Palace. Trumpets flourished, \nand a thousand voices greeted her, singing Handel's Hallelujah Chorus.\n  She walked through the Exhibition, a world's fair, and saw exhibits \ndisplaying the riches of Britain's far-flung colonies: carved ivory \nfurniture from India, furs from Canada, hats made by convicts from \nAustralia. The theme of the Exhibition was one word: ``Progress.''\n  Victoria saw exhibits representing an England that was industrially \nsupreme. England controlled one-third of the world's international \ntrade. The English merchant navy handled three-fifths of the world's \noceangoing tonnage. Senator Daniel Webster called the English empire: \n``A power which has dotted over the surface of the whole globe with her \npossessions and military posts, whose morning drum-beat, following the \nsun, and keeping company with the hours, circles the earth with one \ncontinuous and unbroken strain of the martial airs of England.''\n  Victoria had every reason to believe that Divine Providence had \nsmiled on her and on her empire.\n  The citizens of Periclean Athens, Habsburg Spain, and Victorian \nEngland each could feel that their nation had reached the zenith of \nhuman endeavor. From where they stood, Pericles, Charles, and Victoria \nwere the most powerful leaders of their time. Their centuries belonged \nto them.\n  Pericles looked to ``future ages.'' Charles envisioned going ``even \nfurther.'' And Victoria saw ever more ``progress.''\n  But within a century, each nation had been eclipsed.\n  Periclean Athens fell victim to war. Not long after Pericles's death, \nthe devastating Peloponnesian War with Sparta weakened Athens. Within a \nhundred years, the great city was dominated by a little known northern \ncountry called Macedonia.\n  Charles V, seeking to harness a new technology of shipbuilding and \nroyal navies, incurred spiraling defense costs. Charles's wars caused \nhim to pledge his revenues to bankers for years into the future. By \n1543, two-thirds of his ordinary revenue went to pay interest on past \ndebts alone. Not\n\n[[Page S7391]]\n\nlong after Charles' death, dynastic division rent his empire apart. And \nwithin a hundred years, Europe had become a continent of many roughly-\nequal powers.\n  Not long after Victoria's death, England found itself surpassed by \nAmerican economic growth and mired in World War. And within a hundred \nyears, Britain's once-great empire had spun off into a splintered \ncommonwealth.\n  And so began what Henry Luce called ``the American Century.'' At the \nbeginning of the 20th century, America's economy was already 40 percent \nlarger than China's and more than twice as big as Britain's.\n  And in the wake of World War II, America was the only major power \nwhose homeland had not suffered massive devastation. America's economy \ndominated the world. At mid-century, America's gross domestic product \nwas 5 times Britain's, 5\\1/2\\ times China's.\n  Look out today at the ships docked in the port of Seattle. Count the \ncontainers that bring grain and beef from Montana to the world. Count \nthe containers that bring ``the wares of the whole world . . . to us.''\n  On behalf of a great and powerful nation, on February 2, President \nBush could look out over lawmakers assembled in the House of \nRepresentatives and say: ``[W]e've declared our own intention: America \nwill stand with the allies of freedom to support democratic movements \nin the Middle East and beyond, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny \nin our world.''\n\n  America's is a great promise. Ours is the leading nation. We live in \nthe preeminent country on earth.\n  Americans have every reason to believe that Divine Providence has \nsmiled on us and on our Nation.\n  Today, Americans account for fewer than 1 in 20 of the world's \npeople. But Americans produce more than a fifth of the world's economic \noutput.\n  Today, America has a $12 trillion economy, three times the size of \nJapan's, fives times the size of Germany's.\n  But China's economy, when measured on a purchasing power parity \nbasis, is now $7.3 trillion. And it is growing fast.\n  Like Athens or Spain or England in their day, America is the greatest \npower of our time. But our lease on greatness is no more certain than \nthose of the great powers of the past. We, no more than they, cannot \nmaintain our leadership of the world without effort.\n  The next two decades will challenge America. We face competition from \nrising economic powers, powers with vast populations with nowhere to go \nbut up. And foremost among those competitors will be China.\n  We cannot blithely sit back and rest on our laurels. We must energize \nourselves anew to maintain America's place in the world.\n  Over the last two decades, China's economy has grown an average of \n9.5 percent, roughly three times as fast as America's. And although \nAmerica is a populous country of almost 300 million people, China is \nhome to 1.3 billion people. India is not far behind, with just over a \nbillion people.\n  Starting in the late 1970s, China and India began to reform their \neconomies. And in the late 1980s, Communism collapsed in Eastern \nEurope. In the last two decades, these transformations have led to \nnearly half the world's population--about 2.6 billion people--entering \nthe global workforce. The world has only just begun to feel the effects \nof this awakening.\n  Visit export-zone China, and you will see that corporate America and \ncorporate--Japan are already well in evidence. The international \ncorporations already understand that China will fuel this century's \neconomy.\n  Much of America, however, still has a shock ahead of it. Before 2020, \nChina may surpass America as the world's largest economy. Superpower \nAmerica has competition, after all. And we had better hustle, too, or \nthe Chinese will eat our lunch.\n  Well-educated young people in China, India, and Eastern Europe \nincreasingly have the skills to compete with Americans for high-value-\nadded jobs. Companies are moving jobs offshore to workers in these \ncountries not only because they work for less, but also because they \nare well educated in math and science.\n  An old Chinese proverb says: ``What you cannot avoid, welcome.'' \nDramatic Chinese growth appears unavoidable.\n  China has drunk the Kool-Aid of capitalism and it is not looking \nback. Big city China hustles, bargains, and works hard for a better \nlife. Skylines soar in Shanghai and Beijing.\n  Big city Chinese public street signs come in Chinese and English. \nWestern and Japanese companies' neon signs dominate the skyline. \nWestern commerce is well represented, half a world from the West. China \nis no longer as foreign as you might expect.\n  You can see one district of Beijing that still sports Cyrillic \nbillboards and shop signs. But this Russian enclave sells furs, not \nideas. You can see which economic system won the cold war.\n  They call it ``market socialism.'' And the European economic \ntradition is full of the melding of the two systems, so we cannot \nnecessarily say that the term is a contradiction. But plainly the \nMaoist state-controlled economy is on the descent, and free-enterprise, \nself-interested capitalism is on the rise. Chinese government officials \nsmile as they explain, quote, ``Communism.''\n  The bargaining economy now permeates China. Chinese merchants love to \nhaggle over sales great and small.\n  The change began with Deng Xiaoping, who ruled from 1978 to 1997. But \nthe change has now firmly taken root. Some will explain, in muffled \ntones, that in the wake of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, the government \nmade a concerted effort to demonstrate that China was ``open for \nbusiness.''\n  China, India, and Eastern Europe are now actively seeking to move \nunderemployed populations into more productive occupations--occupations \nthat America and other developed countries once dominated. Millions of \njobs in high-tech manufacturing, software development, and services are \nmoving to these growing labor markets.\n  More than 700 million workers live in China. Half of them still work \nin agriculture and forestry. More than three out of every five Chinese \nstill live in the countryside. As many as 200 million underemployed \nChinese workers in rural areas could move into the cities and \nindustrial jobs.\n  This huge pool of surplus labor presents China with a vast \nopportunity to modernize its economy, continue rapid growth, and move \nits people up the value-added ladder into more productive employment.\n  Tour an American or Japanese company plant in Shanghai. You will see \nrows of diligent, uniformed workers filling rows of clean, well-lit \nwork stations. The plant manager will tell you how he pays these \nworkers $1 an hour--+about $2,000 a year-plus food and housing \nbenefits. That is a good wage in a country with an average income of \n$1,100 a year. Compare that to America's average income of $37,600. \nPlants like this boast of a 90-percent retention of employees.\n\n  The plant manager will complain, however, that for the less-\nsophisticated operations, still-lower-cost centers are already nipping \nat their heels. Even within China, competitive businesses need to \nprofit from innovation and new ideas, or fall victim to even-lower-cost \ncompetition.\n  In the long-term, Chinese labor rights must advance to help lift \nChinese wages. But with 200 million job seekers at the door, \nsubstantial wage increases still appear a ways off. For the near \nfuture, China appears to own the role of the world's low-cost \nmanufacturer.\n  And China's workers are not all unskilled laborers. China has focused \non its education system. It is quite good for a country its size. The \nliteracy rate tops 86 percent.\n  Visit a primary school in a middle-sized Chinese city. Bright, \nenthusiastic, charming children will greet you and win your heart. \nHappy first graders will greet you in English. Chinese schools are \npreparing students to compete in an intertwined, multinational, \nmultilingual world economy.\n  Are American schoolchildren learning Mandarin? Are they even learning \nSpanish? The coming generation of Chinese businesspeople will do \nbusiness around the world. Americans need to broaden our linguistic \nabilities, or Chinese businesspeople will cut the deals before us.\n  China's growing population of college graduates also fuels its \nincreasing strength in high tech. Last year, nearly 3 million Chinese \nentered the workforce from colleges and graduate programs. That was \none-third more than\n\n[[Page S7392]]\n\nthe year before and double the year before that. Last year, China \nproduced 220,000 new engineers. America educated only 60,000.\n  China now has an unusually open economy. Foreign investment in China \nis more than a third of its economy, compared with only 2 percent in \nJapan. In 2004, the sum of exports and imports is likely to reach \nthree-quarters of China's GDP, far more than in other large economies. \nIn American, Japan, India, and Brazil, the figure is 30 percent or \nless. China has allowed foreigners to participate in its growth and \ndevelopment.\n  China has stoked the engines of its economic development through \nmeans both fair and foul. China promotes its domestic high-tech \nindustry at the expense of foreign firms. World Trade Organization \ncommitments prohibit discriminatory taxation of foreign products. But \nChina applied a 17 percent value added tax on all semiconductor sales, \nand then rebated 11 percent of this for semiconductors produced in \nChina and 14 percent for semiconductors designed and produced in China. \nThe United States had to bring a WTO case to challenge the policy. \nChina agreed to drop the policy last year.\n  And China does an abysmal job of protecting patents and intellectual \nproperty. Walk into an open-air market in Shanghai, and you can buy \nties that bear less than credible labels: well-known brand names, \n``Made in Italy.''\n  And it is not just ties that Chinese businesses knock off. A red sign \nfestooned a Shanghai market: Respect ``trademark law,'' it cajoled. But \nas you walk under the sign, literally dozens of men hawk DVDs and \nwatches of plainly dubious vintage.\n  And China also uses its currency exchange rate to distort the market. \nChina has set, or pegged, its currency to the dollar, with an exchange \nrate of 8.28 renminbi to the dollar. Critics argue that as China's \neconomy has grown, its currency should have appreciated against the \ndollar, making Chinese goods more expensive relative to American goods. \nThe renminbi has not appreciated--and Chinese goods have not gotten \nmore expensive--because of the peg. Many argue that China keeps the peg \nin place to support its manufacturing sector.\n  The reality may be more complex. But there is no denying that China \ndoes not have a free-floating currency. And there is no denying that a \nfree-floating currency would be better for China and its trading \npartners, over the longer term. How to get there, especially with \nChina's badly insolvent banking system, is what the debate is about.\n  China's economy could easily stumble, as America's did during the \nbooms and busts of the 19th century. But barring any truly devastating \ncrisis, China's economy will likely continue its upward trajectory. \nChina will become the world's largest economy. The only question is \nwhen.\n  Faster growth in China should mean faster growth elsewhere. If \nChina's real income grows by 8 percent per year--and it is--income \ndistribution remains unchanged, then by 2020, China's top 100 million \nhouseholds will have an average income equal to the current average in \nWestern Europe. That is a giant new market for consumer goods.\n  China's boost to global growth could exceed even those that the world \neconomy has recently enjoyed from the spread of computers. Like that IT \nrevolution, China's growth may lead to the loss of some jobs in the \nUnited States. But it will also likely lead to the creation of \ndifferent jobs in greater numbers.\n  Notwithstanding the pervasive influence of American and Western \nculture even in once-isolated China, one senses a love-hate \nrelationship with America. Chinese officials will note how our two \nnations had once been sworn enemies in a war that Americans, with our \nshort memories, forgot long ago. On Chinese streets, men will walk up \nto you, asked you if you are American, and debate you about American \nforeign policy.\n  The Chinese Government maintains power through two tools: One, an \nimproving standard of living, and two, nationalistic sentiment. In \nfurthering the latter, China often paints America as the enemy keeping \nChina from reuniting with Taiwan. The U.S. is thus second only to the \nJapanese in unpopularity in China. It need not be so.\n  Together, America and China accounted for half the world's economic \ngrowth in recent years. We are economic partners. We share interests in \na non-nuclear Korean peninsula. And we share a common concern with \nradical terrorists. But many Chinese appear put off by the swagger of \ncurrent U.S. foreign policy. We still have work to do to thaw U.S.-\nChinese relations.\n  No American Government can prevent the challenges to the American \neconomy posed by the increasing sophistication of labor markets in \nChina, India, and Eastern Europe. We must accept the reality of these \nchallenges.\n  The ancient Persians looked with disdain at the Athenian marketplace, \nthe Agora. It was a proverb among the Persians that there: ``Greeks \nmeet to cheat one another.'' But we can no more prevent the spread of \nthe world's commerce than Persia could stop the spread of Hellenism.\n  Some may seek to avoid the unavoidable future. But we would do better \nto learn how to embrace it. We must adjust our policies to meet the \nchallenge.\n  The American Government cannot stop international companies from \nhiring overseas workers instead of American workers, without inflicting \ngreat harm on the American economy. American companies compete in a \nglobal environment. If an American company cannot hire those hard-\nworking but low-wage Shanghai workers, a foreign company will. That \nother company will sell the products of that factory at lower cost. \nConsumers worldwide will buy them. And the American company will lose \nthe business and jobs.\n  Neither can we erect tariff barriers that wall off foreign \ncompetition. Higher tariffs are taxes that harm both the foreign \nsellers trying to sell into America and the American buyers who seek to \nbuy foreign products. Tariffs impose a dead-weight loss on both sides. \nAnd protectionist measures invite retaliation. Protectionism thus \nultimately harms a country's economy. Protectionism puts at even \ngreater risk the jobs the politicians seek to protect.\n  Rather, to help prepare America to meet the challenges of the next 2 \ndecades, we need to ensure that Americans develop the skills needed to \ncontinue to compete in higher-value-added fields. We need to continue \nour tradition of rewarding innovation and risk-taking. We need to fight \nto open new markets around the world. And we need to remove burdens \nthat hinder our international competitiveness, like the high cost of \nhealth care in America.\n  Engineers play a critical role in the development of new jobs and new \nindustries. In 1975, the United States ranked third in the world in the \npercentage of 24-year olds who held a science or engineering degree. By \n2000, we had slipped to fifteenth. By 2004, we were seventeenth. At the \nsame time, the Department of Labor projects that new jobs requiring \nscience, engineering, and technical training will increase four times \nfaster than the average national job growth rate.\n  Only a little more than 1 in 20 high school seniors who took the 2002 \ncollege entrance exam planned to pursue an engineering degree. The \nUnited States trains only half as many engineers as Japan and Europe, \nand less than a third as many as China. We should increase scholarships \nand loan forgiveness for engineering students to entice more young \nAmericans to study engineering.\n  We should support community colleges, and strengthen the link between \nthem and the workforce. Schools can then develop training programs \nrelevant to jobs that actually exist in any given community.\n  We should make it easier, consistent with the requirements of \nnational security, for foreign students to study in America. America \nhas benefited from our ability to attract and to retain the best and \nbrightest students from countries all over the world. Yet, since 9/11, \nmany students are having a difficult time getting visas to study in \nAmerica. Foreign applications to American graduate schools fell 28 \npercent in 2004. And enrollments of foreign students at all levels of \ncollege declined for the first time in 30 years.\n  Foreign students are increasingly studying in Europe and elsewhere. \nWe are losing a generation of foreign minds, minds that in another time \nwould have come to our shores. These\n\n[[Page S7393]]\n\ndeclines are due in large part to the difficulties foreign students now \nface in getting a visa to study in America.\n  We must not compromise our security needs to host foreign \nbusinesspeople or students. But there must be ways to streamline visa \nprocedures and otherwise lighten the burden to make it easier for \nforeigners to study and conduct business here.\n  American universities and research institutes do much of the most \ninnovative research in the world. But over the last 20 years, Federal \nresearch funding in the physical sciences and engineering has actually \ndeclined by nearly one-third as a share of the economy.\n  Money invested in Federal research programs pays dividends many times \nthe investment. For example, National Science Foundation funding of \nresearch in the basic sciences and engineering has helped discover new \ntechnologies that have led to multi-billion dollar industries and \ncreated countless new jobs. These include jobs in fiber optics, radar, \nwireless communication, nanotechnology, plant genomics, magnetic \nresonance imaging, ultrasound, and the Internet.\n  We should invest in our future by fully funding research support \norganizations such as the National Science Foundation, National \nInstitutes of Health, and the Office of Science at the Department of \nEnergy.\n  Without Government support, private investment in research and \ndevelopment would be less than it should be. The society as a whole \nneeds to foster the research that will build a better nation in the \nfuture. The R tax credit has helped. But we can improve the R tax \ncredit by simplifying it and making it permanent.\n  The Government has expended a tremendous amount of time, money, and \nmanpower negotiating trade agreements with countries like Bahrain, \nMorocco, and Colombia. None of these small economies offers much to \nAmerican exporters.\n  By contrast, last year, American companies lost more than $3.8 \nbillion to business software piracy in China alone. Putting more \nresources toward defending American intellectual property rights would \nhave a real effect on the bottom line for many American companies.\n  American companies sold $626.6 billion in copyrighted products in \n2002, 6 percent of American GDP, and employed 5.5 million workers, or 4 \npercent of the American workforce. Their foreign sales and exports \namount to $89 billion, more than most other export sectors. Our \nintellectual property is among our most valuable assets. Some would say \nit is now the American comparative advantage. We must do a better job \nprotecting it.\n  The political bargain that has kept a consensus in support of \nliberalized trade has long been that in exchange for labor market \nflexibility, those hurt by trade would have help finding new jobs. That \nbargain has eroded.\n  America spends less on labor-adjustment assistance than any major \nindustrialized country. Japan spends nearly twice the share of GDP, \nCanada nearly three times, and Germany more than eight times as much.\n  Trade adjustment assistance provides retraining, income support, a \nhealth insurance tax credit, and other benefits to workers who lose \ntheir jobs due to trade. TAA is not a handout for idle workers, but a \nmeans to retrain them for competitive employment and help them through \nthe transition.\n  We should expand trade adjustment assistance to service workers and \nemphasize, and possibly expand, the wage insurance program.\n  And we need to do more to keep jobs in America. For most American \ncompanies, health care costs are the single biggest disincentive to \nhiring new workers. The costs are enormous, increasing at a double-\ndigit pace, far outstripping health care costs in other countries.\n  America spends more on health care than any other country in the \nworld. Per capita spending on health care in America is nearly 2\\1/2\\ \ntimes the average in the industrialized world.\n  Employers in America also bear much of the cost of the rising number \nof uninsured Americans through cost-shifting by hospitals and other \nhealth care providers. Last year, employers paid an average of nearly \n$2,900 for single employee coverage and more than $6,500 for family \ncoverage.\n  By contrast, most employers in other industrialized countries do not \npay anything for their employees' health care. A Government-sponsored \nuniversal health program bears those costs. The difference is hurting \nAmerica's competitiveness.\n  We can take several small, practical steps to help lessen health \ncare's burden on American companies. We could provide tax credits to \nsmall employers, fund employer-based group-purchasing pools, increase \nfunding for high-risk pools, expand Medicaid and the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, and permit a Medicare buy-in for the near-\nelderly.\n  But we cannot keep kidding ourselves. We need real change to address \nthe problem of American health care costs. We need to do so, to meet \nthe challenge to America's place in the world.\n  In reality, the economic reforms in China, India, and Eastern Europe \nthat cause the challenge to American leadership are a good thing. We \nshould want China, India, and Eastern Europe to educate their people, \nopen their markets, and trade with us.\n  Since World War II, there has been no greater advocate for free \nmarkets around the world than America. America has much to gain in a \nworld of free markets. When foreign workers move into more productive \nwork, their incomes will rise. As foreign workers become more \nprosperous, they will become better able to buy American goods and \nservices. And by keeping our markets open to foreign products, consumer \nprices fall on everything from footwear to electronics, making the \nAmerican consumer's dollar go further. Everyone can be better off.\n  Trade is not a zero sum game. Increasing competition from China, \nIndia, and Eastern Europe does not mean that America will suffer.\n  Remember, after World War II, America prospered as it helped to \nrebuild a shattered Europe. Competition from recovering European \neconomies did not hurt America. Rather, as Europe emerged from the \ndevastation of war, the American economy grew along with Europe's. With \nthe right policies, much the same can happen perhaps with much larger \npositive effects with the growth in China, India, and Eastern Europe.\n  Remember, in 1957, when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first \nman-made satellite to orbit the Earth. The challenge of Sputnik gave \nAmerica the political will to devote the resources needed to become the \nworld's premier space power.\n  In the same vein, the economic challenge of the next 2 decades \npresents its own opportunities. The challenge posed by economic \ndevelopment in China, India, and Eastern Europe could help create a \npolitical consensus in favor of change and growth.\n  The former Librarian of Congress Daniel Boorstein wrote: ``The most \nimportant lesson of American history is the promise of the unexpected. \nNone of our ancestors would have imagined settling way over here on \nthis unknown continent. So we must continue to have a society that is \nhospitable to the unexpected, which allows possibilities to develop \nbeyond our own imaginings.''\n  We cannot rest on our laurels. But if we remain open to the \nunexpected, if we allow the possibilities to develop, we can maintain \nAmerica's leadership in the world.\n  It will take work. But if we redouble our education, if we open more \nmarkets, if we better manage our healthcare, then we can face the \nchallenges of the decades to come.\n  We must get to work. But if we do, we can make an America that, in \nPericles's words, ``comes to her testing time in a greatness that \nsurpasses what was imagined of her.''\n  If we do, America can continue to ``stand with the allies of \nfreedom'' throughout the world.\n  And if we do, ``Future ages will wonder at us, as the present age \ndoes now.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner).

Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senate for \nits expeditious consideration of Ms. Linda Springer of Pennsylvania to \nbe the Director of the Office of Personnel Management.\n  On Wednesday, June 15, I chaired a hearing of the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs to consider the nomination \nof Ms. Springer. One week later, the committee unanimously approved her \nnomination. As my colleagues in the Senate know, I am committed to \nfinding solutions to the human capital challenges of the Federal \nGovernment. Clearly, there is no more important partner in the \nexecutive branch of Government than the Director of the Office of \nPersonnel Management in addressing these issues.\n  The Federal civil service now is undergoing the most dramatic changes \nin more than a quarter century. For example, agencies are implementing \nnew performance management and a related pay for performance systems \nfor the senior executive service. The Department of Homeland Security \nand the Department of Defense are designing new, modern, and flexible \npersonnel systems to meet their national security missions. As these \nand other reforms continue, leadership from the Office of Personnel \nManagement is imperative to guarantee that the merit principles that \nare the core of our Federal civil service are upheld and that the new \npersonnel systems are fair and equitable for employees.\n  During the committee's hearing, I found Ms. Springer to be focused, \ndedicated, and more than capable of taking on this important job. Prior \nto the hearing, I met with Ms. Springer in my office and was impressed \nwith her candor and recognition of the challenges confronting the \nworkforce.\n  Ms. Springer's experience in the private sector and as Controller of \nthe Office of Management and Budget has prepared her to lead this \nFederal agency. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this \nnomination.
