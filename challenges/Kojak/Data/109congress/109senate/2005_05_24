Madam President, I think it would be better--I haven't had \na chance to discuss this with the majority leader--to vitiate the vote \non cloture and then set a time to complete the debate on Priscilla \nOwen. We would be willing to do that. It would move things along. I \nwanted the leader to know that. We would be happy to talk about \nschedule, how much time people need, and what we are going to do the \nrest of the week. We haven't had time to talk this morning.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, we will talk over the course of the \nmorning because over the next 5 days, with the memorandum of \nunderstanding, we would like to move ahead and address many of the \njudges. At the same time, we have the nomination of John Bolton, whom \nthe Democratic leader and I have briefly discussed. I do want to be \nable to continue with the cloture vote that is now on the schedule for \nnoon today. It is important to do so in part because of the events of \nyesterday, and I want to follow regular order. With that memorandum of \nunderstanding, which is important--it is not what the Democratic leader \nor I asked for--it is important that we see how it is going to be \nimplemented, and the first step will be that vote today.\n  We do have a lot to do this week. I want to keep things organized \nefficiently and well and use time wisely.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if I could direct another question to the \ndistinguished leader, it was my understanding of our conversation late \nlast night that we were not going to move forward on more judges this \nperiod but move forward to other matters. Do you now feel differently?\n  Mr. FRIST. Well, I think we need to think how much we can do \nrealistically this week. With that understanding and the backlog we \nhave on judges, if we can move those expeditiously--and we put in a \nplan or process to do so--we should do just that. We have had\n\n[[Page S5816]]\n\nvarious offers from your side of the aisle on the Michigan judges and \non Griffith, and now we have this memorandum of understanding for up-\nor-down votes on three other nominees we have been debating. Leadership \nto leadership, we ought to sit down and plan how we can deal with \njudges since we have waited a long time for these up-or-down votes and \nsince offers have been made back and forth. In light of the \nunderstanding the 14 Senators came to, I think we should move \nexpeditiously and address the judges who have been waiting a long time. \nAt the same time, we have other very important business--John Bolton to \nbe Ambassador to the U.N.--which we do need to address as well.\n  As I say that, I want to make an appeal to Senators. A lot has been \nsaid about many of the judges, and I don't believe we have to say it \nagain. Whether it is on Priscilla Owen, who I am confident will get an \nup-or-down vote, or on to some of the other judges, I want to make sure \neverything gets said. But on a lot of these, we have had a lot of \ndebate. I would like to sit down with the Democratic leader, in light \nof the events of yesterday, and plan out this week so it will be \nproductive. We have a lot of other important business, such as an \nenergy bill and a highway bill, that we need to also address.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/24/senate-section/article/S5816-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I wish to briefly comment on the events \nof last night. The evening moved very quickly, and it did alter the \ncourse of what likely would have occurred over the course of today. \nCertain adjustments will be made and are being made, as we just heard \nin the colloquy between the Democratic leader and I, in terms of the \nschedule. Although I am not a party of the memorandum of understanding \nsigned last night by 14 of our colleagues, I have had the opportunity \nto further review that agreement in more detail.\n  I do believe the memorandum of understanding makes modest progress in \nthat three individuals will get up-or-down votes on the floor of the \nSenate. To me, it does stop far short of guaranteeing judicial nominees \nthe fair up-or-down votes they deserve--other nominees, nominees in the \nfuture.\n  I say that and recognize that with civility and trust, which are two \nvalues I have tried to stress again and again, and with that memorandum \nof understanding being a starting point and the spirit in which it was \ngenerated, I believe we can successfully bring these nominees to the \nfloor, after coming through the Judiciary Committee, debate them \nextensively, and ultimately bring them to a vote. I believe that is the \nspirit. It will be spun by the left and the right and conservatives and \nliberals in various ways. I did not sign off on the memorandum of \nunderstanding because it stops far short of the principle, but it does \nput us in a position to move forward expeditiously without delay, \nwithout filibuster, giving these nominees the votes they deserve and \nthe courtesy of a vote. It is our responsibility to vote and give them \nthat advice and consent through that up-or-down vote.\n\n  On the agreement, first, it does begin to break the partisan \nobstruction we have seen over the last 2 years. Thematically, it is \nimportant to get away from extreme partisanship. Parties are important, \nthe clash of ideas is important, But where partisanship is injected \ninto the system and brings advice and consent to a stop, it is wrong. I \nbelieve that is the spirit in which the memorandum of understanding, \nwith seven Senators from both sides of the aisle, was written.\n  Indeed, Priscilla Owen will get an up-or-down vote later today. \nJanice Rogers Brown will get an up-or-down vote. William Pryor will get \nan up-or-down vote. They all will receive the courtesy and fairness of \na vote.\n  Other qualified nominees who have been waiting deserve that same \ncourtesy and fairness. Why just those three? Why exclude two others? \nWhy be silent on others? That is where the agreement stops far short of \nthe principle I have brought to the floor, a principle based on \nfairness.\n  Second, the agreement, if followed in good faith, will make \nfilibusters in the future, including Supreme Court nominees, almost \nimpossible. The words in that agreement of ``will not filibuster except \nunder extraordinary circumstances,'' obviously, I am concerned about \nbecause if extraordinary circumstances are defined as they were in the \nlast Congress, which I believe is wrong, on people such as Miguel \nEstrada, who came to this country as an immigrant from Honduras, not \nable to speak English very well, who with hard work worked his way to \nthe top of his profession, arguing 15 cases in the Supreme Court, if \nthat is extraordinary circumstances, then this agreement will mean very \nlittle. We have to wait and see. The agreement will have to be \nmonitored. The implementation of the memorandum of understanding is \ncritical.\n  Third, let me be clear: The constitutional option remains on the \ntable. It remains an option. I will not hesitate to use it if \nnecessary. It should be used as a last resort. Nobody wants to use the \nconstitutional option, but it is the only response if there is a change \nin behavior as we saw in the last Congress that is extraordinary, which \nis something that I believe has been absolutely rejected by the \nmemorandum of understanding in saying that we are not going to be \nfilibustering as we did in the last Congress.\n  My goal is restoring the principle of fair up-or-down votes, the \nprinciple that governed this body for 214 years until the last \nCongress.\n  I will say that if the other side of the aisle acts in bad faith, if \nthey resume that campaign of routine obstruction where one out of every \nthree or four nominees coming from the President who make it through \nthe Judiciary Committee, who make it to the Executive Calendar is \nfilibustered, the constitutional option is going to come out again. I \nwill bring it out. And once again, I will set a date to use it. If that \nis what it takes to move this body forward, we will do that once again.\n  The constitutional option is not a threat. It ought to be used as a \nresponse behavior which I believe is inappropriate to this body as we \nconsider nominees. All the constitutional option does is it brings it \nto the floor. One hundred Senators can make the decision as to whether \nthe fairness of up-or-down votes is a principle to which they agree.\n  I look at all of this today as having the opportunity to begin the \nexecution of the memorandum of understanding, using regular order of \nbusiness. The regular order is, as was set out several weeks ago, to \ndebate Priscilla Owen extensively, exhaustively, which we have done, \nover 21 days of debate on the Senate floor on Priscilla Owen, and then \nbring it to closure. We had to file a cloture motion. We made an offer \nof 10, 15 hours, and that was turned down by the other side. So we \nfiled a cloture petition, and we will have the cloture vote in regular \norder. Depending on the outcome, we will in all likelihood move to an \nup-or-down vote.\n  I expect this afternoon that we will confirm Priscilla Owen and, by \nthe end of the week's process, Janice Rogers Brown, and William Pryor. \nI will work with the minority leader in terms of the best timing. I \nwill work with the Judiciary Committee as well and other Senators to \nmove forward expeditiously on other nominees.\n  We have had discussions and offers from the other side to move ahead \nwith Tom Griffith, which I hope we can do shortly; offers on the Sixth \nCircuit nominees David McKeague, Susan Neilson, and Robert Griffin, all \nof whom deserve a vote on the floor of the Senate, an up-or-down vote. \nSo all this has been a very significant, substantial debate.\n  I believe the injustice of judicial obstruction in the last Congress \nhas been exposed, talked about, recognized, and I believe we have now--\nit is not guaranteed--the opportunity to return to the traditions of \n214 years and precedents of 214 years to give these nominees fair up-\nor-down votes.\n  I hope that progress continues. I am confident it will. I am \ncautiously optimistic. Fair up-or-down votes is a principle I believe \nin and will continue to fight for on the floor of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/24/senate-section/article/S5817-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5817]]\n                      DOING THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I support the memorandum of understanding. \nIt took the nuclear option off the table. It is gone for our lifetime. \nWe don't have to talk about it anymore. I am disappointed there are \nstill the threats of the nuclear option. Let's move on. We need not go \nover this, but there were 218 nominees of the President and we turned \ndown 10.\n  All filibusters are extraordinary. There will be filibusters of \njudges and of other things. That is what the Senate is all about. That \nis what the 14 Senators acknowledged. I admire and respect what they \ndid. I am thankful they kept me advised as to what they were doing. It \nis too bad there were not other opportunities to make a ``deal'' \nbetween the majority leader and me.\n  We have to understand that the Senate needs to operate. I say to my \nfriend, the distinguished majority leader, there was an agreement made \non three judges. We feel the merits of those three judges are not good \nand that we need time to talk about those three judges. We will \ncontinue to do that. The rules of the Senate have not been changed. \nThat is what is so good about the agreement of these 14 Senators, who \nrose above the battle and did the right thing.\n  I am willing to work with the majority leader. I have said that \npublicly and privately. But we have to be realistic. Unless we work \ninto next week, we cannot do all these judges. If that is the order--\nthat we are going to work into next week--people should be told that \nnow. We are willing to work within the confines of the rules of the \nSenate. If cloture is invoked today, the rule is you get 30 hours. We \nare happy to work on that to shorten it a little bit and to have a vote \nsometime tomorrow and then go to other matters. I would think we could \ngo to another judge--a controversial judge. We have indicated that the \njudges from Michigan are not controversial. They were held up on \nprocedural things because of longstanding problems with the Michigan \nSenators. We would need to debate that for a while.\n  We are here to work the will of the Senate. Again, I am somewhat \ndisappointed that we still hear threats of nuclear option. That is \ngone. Let's forget about it. I am happy that one of the things the 14 \ntalked about is having some consultation with the President. I am \nconfident that will work out better for the White House and the Senate. \nI hope that transpires. We here want to move forward. We have so much \nthat needs to be done.\n  The distinguished majority leader has talked about things that need \nto be done, such as the Bolton nomination, which is also controversial. \nWe will be happy to try to work to some degree to make that as easy as \npossible for everybody. It is a difficult issue. I have spoken to \nSenator Biden early this morning. He has a plan as to what he feels \nshould be done on Bolton. None of this is going to take an hour or two. \nThere are things we have to talk about with Bolton.\n  As I indicated last night, last night was a good day for the Senate \nand today is a good day. Let's move forward and work as the Senate \nfeels it should work. There have been no rule changes. We are here to \ndo the will of the people of this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/24/senate-section/article/S5817-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 11:40 shall be equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I will say a few things about the \ncompromise that was reached last night. It has a lot of good things in \nit. I think, first and foremost, it represented a consensus of a group \nof Senators who would represent the majority, saying that filibusters \nare not to be routinely utilized in the confirmation process. As a \nmatter of fact, they said only in ``extraordinary circumstances'' \nshould a filibuster be utilized.\n  This was a rejection of what we have seen for over 2 years in the \nSenate. It was a movement toward the historical principles of \nconfirmation that I think are very important. I think it is worthy of \nnote that the majority leader, Senator Bill Frist, who just left the \nfloor, moved so ably on this issue. He spent nearly 2 years studying \nthe history, seeking compromises, working with colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle, and as of a few weeks ago had, I believe, quite clearly \nachieved a majority of the Senators who were prepared to exercise the \nconstitutional option to establish the rule that we would not \nfilibuster judicial nominees. We have not had a judicial filibuster in \n214 years and we should not have one now. A majority in this Senate was \nprepared to act to ensure that we would not have one.\n  It was only at that point that serious discussions began on a \ncompromise and, as a result of those discussions, seven Senators on \neach side agreed they would act in a certain way and issued the \nstatement they did. It does not reflect the majority of either party, \nbut it does reflect, in my view, the fact that a majority of this \nCongress does not believe that filibusters are the way to go and should \nnot occur except in extraordinary circumstances.\n  Frankly, I think that is not the principle we need to adhere to. When \nPresident Clinton was President and he sought nominees that he chose \nfor the Federal bench, and people on the Republican side discussed \nwhether a filibuster was appropriate, the Republicans clearly decided \nno and allowed nominees such as Berzon and Paez to have an up-or-down \nvote. They were given an up-or-down vote and both were confirmed, even \nthough they were controversial. I think that was significant.\n  I have to tell you how thrilled I am that Judge Bill Pryor will be \nable to get an up-or-down vote. He is one of the finest nominees who \nhas come before this body. The hard left groups out there, who have \nbeen driving this process, attacked him early on and misrepresented his \npositions, his character, his integrity, and his legal philosophy. They \ncalled him an activist, when he is exactly the opposite of that, and \nthey created a storm and were able to generate a filibuster against \nhim. He had a majority of votes in the Senate, if he could have gotten \nan up-or-down vote. But he was denied that through the inability of the \nmajority to cut off debate and have a vote.\n  I am so glad the group of 14 who met and looked at these nominees \nconcluded he was worthy of being able to get a vote up or down. I have \nto say that has colored my pleasure with the agreement, even though I \nknow some other good judges or nominees were not part of the agreement.\n  I want to point this out. The minority leader seems to suggest that \nfilibusters are here to stay and they are normal and logical, and get \nover it and accept it, and that, oh, no, the constitutional option can \nnever be used. That was not in that agreement and that is not what is \nin the hearts and minds of a majority of the Senators in this body. If \nthis tactic of filibustering is continued to be used in an abusive way, \nor in a way that frustrates the ability of this Congress to give an up-\nor-down vote to the fine nominees of President Bush, there has been no \nwaiver of the right to utilize the constitutional option.\n  As I understand it, even yesterday Senator Byrd, on the Senate floor, \nadmitted the constitutional option is a valid power of the Senate \nmajority. I would say this. It ought not to be abused; it ought not to \nbe used for light or transient reasons. It ought to be used only in the \nmost serious circumstances--the most serious circumstances of the kind \nwe have today when, after 200 years of tradition, 200 years of \nfollowing the spirit of the Constitution to give judges up-or-down\n\n[[Page S5818]]\n\nvotes, the Senate is systematically altered as it was in the last \nCongress. That is why it was brought out, and with the threat of the \nconstitutional option and a majority of Senators who were prepared to \nsupport it, a compromise was reached. I believe it is significant.\n  Finally, I want to note it is exceedingly important that we, as \nMembers of this Senate, understand how judges should be evaluated, how \nthey have basically always been evaluated, except in recent times. How \nshould they be evaluated? They should be evaluated on their judicial \nphilosophy, not their political views or their religious views. There \nare nominees who have come before this Senate who have demonstrated \nthrough a career of practice that they comply with the law, whether \nthey agree with it or not. Some of them are pro-life, some of them are \npro-choice, some of them are for big Government, some of them are for \nsmaller Government, some of them are for strong national defense, some \nof them are not. That is not the test and cannot be the test.\n  We had one situation that troubled me. I was pleased eventually that \nthis nominee was confirmed. A man and a woman--the man was nominated \nfor judge and had been No. 1 in his law school class. They had written \na letter to the members of their church, a Catholic Church in Arkansas, \nand they discussed their view of marriage in the Christian tradition. \nThey affirmed that and quoted from Scripture. We had persons attack \nthat nominee because they said it somehow elevated a man over a woman. \nThat is not the rich tradition of marriage as was explained in their \nletter. But it led to that attack. That made starkly clear in my mind \nwhat is at stake here. This is the question: Are we to expect that \nevery nominee that comes here has to lay out their personal philosophy, \ntheir marital philosophy, their religious beliefs, and we sit and judge \nthem on whether we agree with that?\n  Is that the way you judge a judge to see if they are qualified: Do I \nagree with their theology? Do I agree with their political philosophy? \nDo I agree with their opinion on Franklin Delano Roosevelt? Is that \nwhat we do?\n  We cannot do that. We should not do that. We ought to be pleased that \na nominee has cared enough about his or her country to speak out on the \nissues that come before the country. We ought to be pleased that they \nhave been active and they care and they participate in the great \npolitical debate in America. But we ought not say to them, because you \nsaid one thing about abortion, and you are pro-life or you are pro-\nchoice, you can never follow the law of the Supreme Court or the \nConstitution and, therefore, we are not going to allow you to be a \njudge. We cannot do that. That is a wrong step.\n  I think that was implicit in this compromise--at least I hope it was. \nI think it said that judges, such as Judge Bill Pryor who, when asked \ndid if he said abortion was bad, answered: Yes, sir, I do. And when he \nwas asked: Do you still believe it? He said: Yes, sir. I do. He had a \nrecord, fortunately, that he could then call on to show that he was \nprepared to enforce the law whether he agreed with it or not. If he had \nbeen in the legislature, he might have voted differently. But as a \njudge or as attorney general, he had a record on which he could call to \nshow that he enforced the law.\n  For example, Judge Pryor would certainly have opposed partial-birth \nabortion, one of the worst possible abortion procedures. But as \nattorney general in the 1990s, when Alabama passed a partial-birth \nabortion ban, he wrote every district attorney in the State on his own \nmotion--he did not have to, but he had the power to do so as attorney \ngeneral--and told them that portions of that bill, with which he \nprobably agreed, were unconstitutional and should not be enforced.\n  Later, when the Supreme Court of the United States rendered the \nStenberg decision that struck down an even larger portion of the \nfoundation of partial-birth abortion statutes that had passed around \nthe country, he wrote another letter to the district attorneys and told \nthem the Alabama statute was unconstitutional.\n  Does that not prove what we are about here? It is not your personal \nbelief but your commitment to law that counts?\n  What about the circumstance when he was accused of being too pro-\nreligion? I do not think the facts show an abuse of his power in any \nway. In fact, he found himself in the very difficult circumstance in \nAlabama of being the attorney general and having the responsibility to \nprosecute or present the case against the sitting chief justice of the \nAlabama Supreme Court who placed the Ten Commandments in the supreme \ncourt building. The chief justice had been ordered to remove it by the \nFederal courts, and he did not remove it. Other judges removed it. \nAttorney General Bill Pryor presented that case, and Judge Moore was \nremoved from office.\n  That was a big deal. It was a tough deal. Time after time, he has \ndone that.\n  Priscilla Owen also is a nominee of the most extraordinary \nqualifications. She made the highest possible score on the bar exam in \nTexas. That is a big State and bar exams are not easy. She is a \nbrilliant lawyer, highly successful in the private practice of law in \nTexas. They encouraged her to run for the supreme court. She did so. \nShe won. The last time she ran, she received 84 percent of the vote in \nTexas. This is a professional lawyer/jurist, brilliant, hard-working, a \nwoman of great integrity and decency. She has questioned the concept or \nthe idea that judges have a right to go back and reinterpret the \nmeaning of the Constitution or statutes and read into them whatever \nthey like to make them agree with the judge's philosophy. Many today \nseem to think they are at liberty to do this. In fact, some judges go \nback and try to twist, bend, stretch the meaning of words to promote \nagendas in which they believe. Priscilla Owen does not believe in that \nand has spoken against it.\n  Her philosophy as a judge reflects restraint, and a dedication to \nfollowing the law. That is what she has stood for, and she has been \ncriticized roundly as being an extremist--a judge who received 84 \npercent of the vote and was endorsed by every newspaper in the State.\n  Judge Priscilla Owen also was rated by the American Bar Association \nunanimously well qualified, the highest rating they give. This is not \nan extremist.\n  What was it here? Outside groups who have made a history of \nidentifying and attacking these nominees have mischaracterized her, \njust as they did Judge Pryor. Both of these nominees, for example, have \ntremendous support within their State, tremendous bipartisan support in \nconference.\n  That is why I am confident the 14 people who got together and \nreviewed this situation felt they could not leave her or the other two \njudges off this list. They just could not deny Janice Rogers Brown, \nPriscilla Owen, or Judge Bill Pryor an up-or-down vote. They were too \ndecent, had too much of a good record, too many supporters in the \nAfrican-American community, in the Democratic leadership of their \nStates, and that is why they were given this vote.\n  I think perhaps we are now moving forward to a new day in \nconfirmations. I hope so. We have been far too bitter in attacking good \npeople. Records have been distorted dishonestly, particularly by \noutside groups and sometimes that has been picked up by Senators. My \nDemocratic colleagues have outsourced their decisionmaking process at \ntimes, I am afraid. They have allowed the People for the American Way \nand Ralph Neas and the Alliance for Justice, the people who spend their \nlives digging up dirt, sullying people's reputations, twisting \nfacts, taking cases out of context, taking statements out of context, \ntaking speeches out of context, posturing and painting nominees as \nthings they are absolutely not, to influence their decisions. It is \nwrong. Hopefully, we are now moving in a better direction.\n\n  I am also hopeful that as a result of this agreement, the nomination \nprocess in the future will go better. Maybe even issues such as \ntransportation, energy, and defense will go better in this Congress. I \nhope so. I will try to do my part.\n  I want to say one thing, the constitutional option has not been \nremoved from the table. We cannot allow filibusters to come back and be \nabused. We absolutely cannot. The majority should never allow that \nhistoric change\n\n[[Page S5819]]\n\nto occur while they have the ability to resist and that ability still \nexists. I believe the majority leader, Bill Frist, is correct in that \nanalysis. He has stated the ideals of this Senate. He has reminded us \nof the history and traditions of the Senate. He has reminded us that \nRepublicans were faithful to that tradition and the Democrats need to \nbe, too. So I hope we will be able to move forward with the \nconsideration of more and more nominees as President Bush goes forward \nin his term, and that as we do so, they will be given a fair hearing. I \nhope that Senators on both sides of the aisle will look at the facts \nand allegations about nominees to make sure those are truthful, \naccurate, and fair characterizations of them, and not \nmischaracterizations, not distortions, not misrepresentations of what \nthey are and what they have done. If we do that, we are going to be OK.\n  Let me say this about President Bush. He has gone to the American \npeople. He has stated his case to them. He stated clearly and \neffectively he believes that judges should be committed to the rule of \nlaw, should follow the law, that they should not be activist, they \nshould not seek to impose personal and political agendas through the \nredefinition of words of statutes or our Constitution. The American \npeople have affirmed him in that.\n  The Senate obstruction and filibuster of Federal judges has been a \nbig issue in the last two election cycles in this Senate, and \nRepublicans have, as a result, in my opinion--it is my opinion, I will \nadmit--picked up six new Senate seats. I think a large part of that is \nbecause people in these States have been concerned about the \nobstruction of good and decent nominees, and the people of this country \nare of the opinion that their liberties are in jeopardy when an \nunelected lifetime-appointed judge starts setting social policy. If \nthey are not happy with my vote on social policy, I can be removed from \noffice, but a judge has a lifetime appointment, and the American people \nunderstand that. They understand that an activist judge is, indeed, \nantidemocratic. It is an antidemocratic act when a judge, without \naccountability to the public, starts setting social and political \npolicy, as we have seen too often in recent years.\n  As a result, I believe we need to return to our traditions that have \nserved both sides well, and if we do that, we can move forward, I \nbelieve, to a better process on judges and other issues that come \nbefore this body. I am cautiously optimistic for the future.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time on this side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I understand that by previous \nagreement, time is allocated; is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And there is to be 1 hour for one side, 1 hour to the \nother side, prior to the leadership time?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 47 minutes remaining for \nthe minority.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  First, I commend my friend and colleague, our leader, Senator Reid, \nfor his perseverance during these past several weeks and adherence to \nthe great traditions of the institution of the Senate. It has been an \nextraordinary example of devotion to the Senate, to our Constitution, \nthe checks and balances which are written into the Constitution. Our \nPresident has a veto, and the Members of Congress have the right to \nspeak. There are those who would like to muzzle, silence, effectively \ncut off the debate in the Senate. With this agreement of last evening, \nthat time, hopefully, has ended. It certainly has been for this \nCongress.\n  I was listening to some of my colleagues earlier. I read from the \nagreement about rules change:\n\n       In light of the spirit and continuing commitments made in \n     this agreement, we commit to oppose the rules changes in the \n     109th Congress, which we understand to be any amendment to or \n     interpretation of the Rules of the Senate that would force a \n     vote on a judicial nomination by means other than unanimous \n     consent or rule XXII.\n\n  The current rule. There it is. Yet we heard the mention by the leader \nearlier this morning that he believes somehow the nuclear option is \nstill alive and well.\n  It does seem to me the American people want to get about the American \npeople's business. This has been an enormous distraction.\n  I listened to my friend and colleague from Tennessee who says we want \nto follow the rules and traditions of the Senate, so we are going back \nto the regular order. If we go back to the regular order, we are going \nback to the traditions and rules as they stand: You have the vote of \nevery member on this side. That is not what the majority leader was \ntalking about. He was talking about we will go back to the regular \norder; he was going to change the order with a whole series of changed \nrules.\n  That is what the members of this side and the courageous Republicans \non the other side found offensive. We believe we ought to be about our \npeople's business. We have approved 95 percent of the Republicans' \nnominees. I am sure some are, perhaps, pro-choice; many of them--\nprobably most of them--are pro-life. They have still gone through. The \nreal question is whether we are going to be stampeded and be silenced \nwith regard to judges who are so far outside of the mainstream of \njudicial thinking that it was going to be the judgment of the majority \nleader that he was going to change the rules in a way that would deny \nthe Senate's Parliamentarian, who has been the safeguarder of these \nrules for the 214 years of the Senate, and bring in the Vice President, \nwho was going to rule according to his liking rather than to the \ntraditions of the Senate.\n  That kind of abridgement, that kind of destruction, that kind of \nrunning roughshod over the Senate rules is offensive to the American \npeople and offensive to us. It was avoided by the actions that were \ntaken last evening in which our Democratic leader was the principal \narchitect and supporter.\n  Yesterday was a day that will live in American history, and our \ngrandchildren and their grandchildren will discuss what happened. They \nwill do so with much more insight than we can today because they will \nknow what the results of yesterday's agreements actually turned out to \nbe. I hope that history will judge us well as an institution. We came \nclose to having a vote that threatened the essence of the Senate and of \nour Government. It risked destruction of the checks and balances among \nthe branches that the Framers so carefully constructed. It risked \ndestruction of the independence of the judiciary, which is at the heart \nand soul of this issue. It risked an accumulation of power in the \nPresident that might have turned back the clock toward the day when we \nwere subjects instead of citizens.\n  We have avoided that confrontation and have done so within the \ntraditions of the Senate: discussion, debate, negotiation and \ncompromise. Moderation and reason have prevailed. As in any compromise, \nsome on each side are unhappy with specific aspects of the result, but \nthe essence is clear. A majority of this body does not want to break \nits rules and traditions. Those rules and traditions will be preserved.\n  This body's self-regulating mechanisms will continue to be a \nmoderating influence, not only within the body but also on the other \nHouse and the other branches of Government. Once again, the Senate has \nreminded the Chief Executive that we are not merely occupants of a \nbeautiful building at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. We taught \nGeorge Washington that lesson when we rejected one of his Supreme Court \nnominations. We taught Thomas Jefferson that lesson when we refused to \nconvict an impeached Justice whose opinions Jefferson did not like. We \ntaught Franklin Roosevelt that lesson when he tried to pack the Supreme \nCourt. We taught Richard Nixon that lesson when he sent us a worse \nnominee after we defeated his first nominee for a Supreme Court \nposition.\n  As even the Republicans in the agreement group said, this agreement \nshould persuade the President to take more seriously the advice portion \nof the advice and consent. If the President understands the message and \ntakes it to heart, his nominees will be better off, the courts will be \nbetter off, and the Nation will be better off.\n  Our principal goal was to preserve the ability of the Senate to \nprotect the independence of the Federal courts, including the Supreme \nCourt, and we\n\n[[Page S5820]]\n\nhave succeeded in doing so. We have sent a strong message to the \nPresident that if he wants to get his judicial nominees confirmed, his \nselections must have a broader support from the American people.\n  As a result of this agreement, we can hope that no Senator will ever \nagain pretend that the Constitution commands a final vote on every \nExecutive nominee, for it has never done so and it does not do so now.\n  We can hope that no one will again pretend that there has never been \na filibuster of a judicial nominee when they can look across the Senate \nfloor at three Democratic Senators who witnessed the Republican \nfilibuster against Justice Fortas and Republican Senators who \nparticipated in other judicial filibusters. We can hope that no one \nagain will pretend that it is possible to break the fundamental Senate \nrule on ending a filibuster without shattering the basic bonds of trust \nthat make this institution the world's greatest deliberative body.\n  I believe history will judge that we have not failed those who \ncreated America two centuries ago by what we have done. We have fought \noff those who would have destroyed this institution and its vital role \nin our Government for shameful partisan advantage. By rejecting the \nnuclear option, the Senate has lived up to its responsibilities as a \nseparate and equal branch of Government.\n  I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, that agreement \ndoes not change the serious objections to the nominations that have \nbeen debated in the past days. Those of us who care about the \njudiciary, who respect mainstream values, who reject the notion that \njudgeships are spoils to be awarded to political fringe groups, will \ncontinue to oppose the nomination of Priscilla Owen, Janice Rogers \nBrown, and William Pryor because they would roll back rights and \nfreedoms important to the American people.\n\n  Now that these nominees are slated to get a vote on the floor, I hope \ncourageous and responsible Republicans will show their independence \nfrom the White House and thoroughly examine the records of each of \nthem. If they do, I hope they will agree that these nominees should not \nbe given lifetime appointments to the Nation's courts, where they will \nwield enormous power over the lives of all Americans.\n  Those of us who oppose the nomination of Priscilla Owen have done so \nwith good cause because her record makes clear that she puts her own \nideology above laws that protect the American people. I have made that \ncase. I just remind our colleagues of what the Houston Chronicle said. \nThe Houston Chronicle, from her own area, wrote that her record shows \nless interest in impartiality and interpreting law than in pushing an \nagenda. She too often contorts rulings to conform to her particular \nconservative outlook. Those are not fringe groups. That is the Houston \nChronicle.\n  Austin American-Statesman: Priscilla Owen is so conservative she \nplaces herself outside of the broad mainstream of jurisprudence and she \nseems all too willing to bend the law to fit her views.\n  Those are not leftwing fringe groups. That is the Austin American-\nStatesman.\n  San Antonio Express News: She has always voted with a small court \nminority that consistently tries to bypass the law as written by the \nlegislature.\n  I have included at other times in the Record the 10 different \noccasions when the current Attorney General of the United States \ncriticized Priscilla Owen for being outside of the mainstream of \njudicial thinking. I ask unanimous consent that six or eight of those, \nand the cases, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Examples of Gonzales's Criticisms of Owen\n\n       In one case, Justice Gonzales held that Texas law clearly \n     required manufacturers to be responsible to retailers that \n     sell their defective products. He wrote that Justice Owen's \n     dissenting opinion would ``judicially amend the statute'' to \n     let manufacturers off the hook.\n       In a case in 2000, Justice Gonzales and a majority of the \n     Texas Supreme Court upheld a jury award holding that the \n     Texas Department of Transportation and the local transit \n     authority were responsible for a deadly auto accident. He \n     explained that the result was required by the ``plain \n     meaning'' of Texas law. Justice Owen dissented, claiming that \n     Texas should be immune from these suits. Justice Gonzales \n     wrote that her view misread the law, which he said was \n     ``clear and unequivocal.''\n       In another case, Justice Gonzales joined a majority opinion \n     that criticized Justice Owen for ``disregarding the \n     procedural limitations in the statute,'' and ``taking a \n     position even more extreme'' than had been argued by the \n     defendant in the case.\n       In another case in 2000, private landowners tried to use a \n     Texas law to exempt themselves from local environmental \n     regulations. The court's majority ruled that the law was an \n     unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to \n     private individuals. Justice Owen dissented, claiming that \n     the majority's opinion ``strikes a severe blow to private \n     property rights.'' Justice Gonzales joined a majority opinion \n     criticizing her view, stating that most of her opinion was \n     ``nothing more than inflammatory rhetoric which merits no \n     response.''\n       Justice Gonzales also wrote an opinion holding that an \n     innocent spouse could recover insurance proceeds when her co-\n     insured spouse intentionally set fire to their insured home. \n     Justice Owen joined a dissent that would have denied coverage \n     of the spouse, on the theory that the arsonist might somehow \n     benefit from the court's decision. Justice Gonzales' majority \n     opinion stated that her argument was based on a ``theoretical \n     possibility'' that would never happen in the real world, and \n     that violated the plain language of the insurance policy.\n       In still another case, Justice Owen joined a partial \n     dissent that would have limited the right to jury trials. The \n     dissent was criticized by the other judges as a ``judicial \n     sleight of hand'' to bypass the Texas Constitution.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This is Attorney General Gonzales on the supreme court \nwith Priscilla Owen, critical of her of being outside the mainstream. \nThat is the point we have basically made.\n  This week, the American people are saying loudly and clearly that \nthey are tired of the misplaced priorities and abuse of power by the \nrightwing. This agreement sends a strong message to the President that \nif he wants to get his judicial nominees confirmed, his selections need \nto have broad support from the American people.\n  Going forward on any nomination, the President must take the advice \nand consent clause seriously. The Senate is not a rubberstamp for the \nWhite House. The message of Monday's agreement is clear: Abuse of power \nwill not be tolerated. Attempts to trample the Constitution will be \nstopped.\n  Over the last few weeks, the Republican Party has shown itself to be \noutside the mainstream, holding up the Senate over the judges while gas \nprices have jumped up through the ceiling, stubbornly insisting on the \nSocial Security plan that cuts benefits and makes matters worse, \npassing a budget that offers plenty to corporations but little to \nstudents, nurses, and cops, and running roughshod over ethics rules. \nThese are not the priorities of the American people. The American \npeople want us to get back to what is of central concern to their \nlives, the lives of their children, their parents, and their neighbors. \nThat is what we ought to be about doing, and preserving the \nConstitution and the rules of the Senate. The agreement that was made \nin a bipartisan way does that, and it should be supported by our \ncolleagues in the Senate.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, No. 1, there has been a lot said about \nlast night. I was one of the signatories of the agreement. I think last \nnight gives us a chance to start over. Seldom in life do people get a \nchance to start over and learn from their mistakes.\n  There have been some mistakes made for about 20 years on judges, and \nit finally all caught up with us. It started with Judge Bork. He was \nthe first person I can remember in our lifetime who was basically \nsubjected to ``how will he decide a particular case,'' and he was \nattacked because of his philosophy, not because of his qualifications. \nIt has just gotten worse over time. Clarence Thomas--we all remember \nthat.\n  The truth is, when the Republicans were in charge of the Judiciary \nCommittee, there is a pretty good case to be made that some of \nPresident Clinton's nominees were bottled up when we had control of the \nJudiciary Committee, and they never got out into the normal process.\n  Where do we find ourselves now? It started with an attack on one \nperson because people did not like the philosophy of that person, which \nwas new for the Senate. Before that, when a judge\n\n[[Page S5821]]\n\nwas sent over, we looked at whether they were qualified ethically and \nintellectually.\n  One has to understand that there is a consequence to an election. \nWhen a President wins an election, that President has a right to send \nnominees over to the Senate for Federal courts. It has always been \nassumed that conservative people are going to pick conservative judges, \nand moderate and liberal people are going to be somewhere in the \nmiddle. That has worked for 200 years.\n  The bottom line is, the President can send over somebody who they \nthink is conservative, and they can be fooled. They can send somebody \nthey think is liberal, and over a lifetime they may change. What we \nhave been able to do as a body is to push back but eventually give \npeople a chance to be voted on.\n  I was a ``yes'' vote. Senator DeWine and myself were ready to vote \nfor the nuclear option this morning if we had to, the constitutional \noption. It can be called whatever one wants to call it, but it would \nhave been a mess for the country. It would have been better to end this \nmess now than pass it on to the next generation of Senators because if \nthe filibuster becomes an institutional response where 40 Senators \ndriven by special interest groups declare war on nominees in the \nfuture, the consequence will be that the judiciary will be destroyed \nover time. People can get rid of us every 6 years, thank God, but once \na judge is put on the bench, it is a lifetime appointment. We should be \nserious about that.\n  We should also understand that people who want to be judges have \nrejected the political life, and when we make them political pawns and \npolitical footballs, a lot of good, qualified men and women who are \nmoderate, conservative, or liberal will take a pass on sitting on the \nbench. If the filibuster becomes the way we engage each other on \njudges, if it becomes the response of special interest groups to a \nPresident who won who they are upset with, the Senate will suffer a \nblack eye with the American people, but the judiciary will slowly but \nsurely become unraveled.\n  That is why I think we have a chance to start over. That is why I \nvoted for us to start over, and I hope we have learned our lesson.\n  As to Priscilla Owen, it is the most manufactured opposition to a \ngood person I have seen short of Judge Pickering, only to soon-to-be \nJudge Pryor and a close third is Justice Brown. What has been said \nabout these people is beyond the pale. They have been called \nNeanderthals. If one has somebody they know and care about and they are \nthinking about being a judge, I think they need to be given fair \nwarning that if they decide a case that a special interest group does \nnot like, a lot of bad things are going to be coming their way.\n  Do we really need to call three people who have graduated near the \ntop of their class, who have had a lifetime of service to the bar, \nNeanderthals? We have a chance to start over, and we better take it, \nbecause one thing the American people have from this whole show is that \nthe Senate is out of touch with who they are and what they believe \nbecause we have allowed this thing to sink into the abyss. Priscilla \nOwen got 84 percent of the vote in Texas, and John Cornyn knows her \nwell. He served with her. She graduated at the top of her class; scored \nthe highest on the bar exam. She has been a solid judge. What has been \nsaid about her has been a cut-and-paste, manufactured character \nassassination. Whether she is in the mainstream, the best way to find \nout is when people vote. When Priscilla Owen finally gets a vote here \nsoon, you are going to see she is very much in the mainstream, if a \nsupermajority of Senators count for anything. She is going to get \nvotes. She is going to get a lot more than 50 of them. So is Judge \nPryor.\n\n  The problem I have had with Bill Pryor and the way he has been \nhandled is that he is the type person I grew up with. He is a \nconservative person. He is a good family man. But he has made some \ncalls in Alabama that are unbelievably heroic, when it comes to \npolitics and the law. Being for the Ten Commandments is a big deal in \nAlabama. Judge Moore, Justice Moore took that and rode that horse and \nbeat it to death and it got to be a hot issue in Alabama and it got to \nbe a hot issue all over the country. The attorney general of Alabama, \nBill Pryor, followed the law and took on Justice Moore. He didn't have \nto, but he chose to.\n  At every turn he has proved to me he is bigger than the political \nmoment. When he gets voted on, I am going to take this floor and we are \ngoing to talk a little bit longer about him. The people in Alabama \nacross the board should be proud of Bill Pryor. He is going to make a \nheck of a Federal judge.\n  Now, where do we go? This agreement was among 14 Senators who \nbelieved that starting over would matter--14 Senators from different \nregions of the country, supported by their colleagues in a quiet \nfashion, more than you will ever know. What happens in the future \ndepends on all of us working together. It depends on trust and good \nfaith. The White House needs to talk with us more, and they will. Our \nDemocratic friends need to understand that the filibuster as a tool to \npunish George W. Bush is not going to sustain you very long and will \nput you on the wrong side of the American people and will eventually \ndestroy the judiciary.\n  The agreement says that in future nomination battles, the seven \nDemocrats will not filibuster unless there are extraordinary \ncircumstances. What does that mean? Well, we will know it when we see \nit. It means we will keep talking. It means they don't have to lay down \nin the road if there is a Supreme Court fight. There is going to be a \nSupreme Court nomination coming, probably soon, and that is what this \nis about. But our seven Democratic colleagues decided to find a middle \nway to bring some calm to the body. I think we can get a conservative \njustice nominated and confirmed if we try hard. Nobody should expect \nanything less from George W. Bush. But there is a way to get there from \nhere and I do believe the seven Democrats who signed this agreement \nwill work very hard to make that happen along with all Senators at the \nend of day.\n  But if there comes a point in time in the future when one of the \nseven Democrats believes this person before them is so unacceptable \nthey have to get back in the filibuster business, here is what it means \nto the Republicans--because I helped write the language. It means we \nwill talk, we will listen, and we will discuss why they feel that way. \nBut it means I am back in the ball game. If one of the seven decides to \nfilibuster and I believe it is not an extraordinary circumstance for \nthe country, for the process, then I have retained my rights under this \nagreement to change the rules if I think that is best for the country. \nThat is only fair. My belief is we will never have to cross that \nbridge. But those who say this is a one-sided deal misrepresent what \nhappened in that room. This is about moving forward, avoiding conflict \nin the future by talking and trusting.\n  But there may come a time, and I hope to God it doesn't happen, where \nwe go different directions. The only reason we will ever go different \ndirections is that we will start playing politics again and lose sight \nof the common good.\n  The two nominees who were in category two I think will get back in \nthe process in a fair way. The truth is all of the nominees were never \ngoing to make it. There are some Republicans who will vote against some \nof these nominees. But they all deserve a fair process and they all \ndeserve to be fairly treated. None of them deserve to be called \nNeanderthals.\n  It is my hope and my belief we will get this group of nominees fairly \ndealt with. Some are going to make it and some will not. But they will \nget the process back to the way it used to be. As to the future, it is \nmy belief that by talking and working together in collaboration with \nthe White House, we can pick Supreme Court Justices, if that day ever \ncomes, so that everybody can be at least happy with the process, if not \nproud of the nominee. That is possible because we have done it for 200 \nyears. But please don't say, as a Democrat, you can do anything you \nwant to do in the 109th Congress and nothing can happen, because that \nis not true.\n  I have every confidence we can get through this mess, but there is no \nagreement that allows one side to unilaterally do what it would like to \ndo and the other side be ignored. Because if that were the case, it \nwasn't much of an agreement.\n  I look forward to voting for Justice Owen, I look forward to voting \nfor\n\n[[Page S5822]]\n\nJudge Pryor, I look forward to voting for Justice Brown, and putting to \nrest the idea that these nominees were out of the mainstream.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Before my friend and colleague from South Carolina \nleaves, I want to congratulate him and my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle for bringing us to this point. The most important point about \nwhat has happened in the last 12 hours is we have maintained the checks \nand balances in the Senate. We are retaining the ability for minority \nviews to be heard. That is most important.\n  It is not always Democrats versus Republicans. It could be little \nStates, such as the State of my friend from Delaware, whom I see on the \nfloor, versus Michigan or California. It could be different groups of \npeople. It could be Great Lakes Senators banding together to protect \nour Great Lakes versus others who want to divert water. It could be a \nvariety of issues.\n  The fact that the Senate is the place we can come together and \nminority views can be heard is a part of our democratic process. It is \na part of our democracy that has held us together for over 200 years. I \ncommend my colleagues for standing up and saying no to eliminating the \nfilibuster and no to eliminating the checks and balances of our \nGovernment.\n  It involves some compromise, as these agreements always do. While I \npersonally will not support the nomination of the person before us \ntoday, I understand that in order to maintain the broad principle of \nchecks and balances in the Senate, in order to allow us to exercise our \nminority views at a future point if there are extreme nominees coming \nforward, this was an important compromise to make.\n  Part of that is an important piece that Senator Levin and I \ncontributed to the process of allowing the Senate to move forward on \nthree nominees of the Sixth Circuit from Michigan. So there are \ncompromises that have been made in the interests of the larger good, in \nthe interests of maintaining the checks and balances, the ability for \nus to work together on both sides of the aisle to get things done for \nthe American people. That is why we are here.\n  Now we need to get about the business of getting things done for \npeople. When I go home every weekend, when I talk to my family in \nMichigan, when I talk to everyone I represent--families all across \nMichigan, they say, We want you to focus on jobs, American jobs. We \nwant our jobs here. We want to reward work in this country and know \nthat when we work hard every day and play by the rules, we are going to \nbe able to care for our families and that we have respect for the \ndignity of work and that we will reward Americans who are working hard \nevery day.\n  They say to me they are desperately concerned about their pensions. \nLook what is happening. We in this body need to be focusing on \nprotecting the pensions, the retirement security of all the Americans \nwho worked all their lives. They put that money aside and they count on \nthat pension in retirement for themselves and their families. Now they \nare seeing that American dream eroded. Pension security, strengthening \nSocial Security, making sure health care is available to every \nAmerican--these are the issues that, in this body, we need to be \nworking on together because they directly affect every single person we \nrepresent.\n  I am hopeful we will now be able to put this aside and we will be \nable to move on with the people's agenda for this country, creating \nopportunities for everybody to succeed, rewarding work, making sure we \nare protecting and expanding American jobs and American businesses, \nmaking sure we are energy independent.\n\n  We will be having legislation brought before us shortly. I know there \nis important bipartisan work going on. But we need to say we are going \nto be independent in terms of energy resources and that we are going to \nmove forward as well on issues that relate to national security--not \nonly a strong defense abroad but making sure our police officers and \nfirefighters have what they need, and our emergency responders, so that \nwe have security at home. When somebody calls 911, they will know they \nare going to get the response they need in terms of their security.\n  We have a lot of work to do. People are expecting us to get about the \npeople's business. I am very proud that last night our leader on this \nside of the aisle, the Democratic leader, Senator Reid, spoke to those \nissues. In praising where we are now, the fact that we will continue to \nhave the rules and checks and balances of the Senate, he also then \nspoke about the fact that we have to get about the people's business \nbecause every day when people get up in the morning they are wondering \nwhat is going to happen that day for themselves and their families.\n  It is our job to do everything we can to make sure their hard work is \nrewarded and opportunities for the future, for our children and \ngrandchildren, are protected. This is a fight for the future. It is a \nfight about where we need to go as a country. Our families are counting \non us to turn to the things they care about every day. The values and \npriorities of the American people need to be what we are talking about \nand acting on in this Chamber. I am hopeful we will very quickly turn \nto those matters: jobs, health care for every single American, \nopportunities for our kids to be successful, energy independence, a \nstrong defense here and abroad. If we do that, then we will be able to \nhold our heads high, because we will have done those things that matter \nmost to the families we represent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, when I was in college and law school, \nthere was a character played by the actress Gilda Radner on ``Saturday \nNight Live,'' who was known best for purporting to do the news and \nwould engage in this screed about some subject, and then she would be \ncorrected, only to have her then reply, ``Never mind.''\n  I thought about that when I have contemplated the occurrences of the \nlast few days, particularly the last day when it came to the sort of \napocalyptic terms that were used as we approached breaking the logjam \nover the President's long-delayed judicial nominees. But for this \nsecret negotiation conducted by 14 Senators that none of the rest of \nthe Senate was a party to, we would be, I believe, about the process of \nreestablishing the precedent of majority rule that had prevailed for \n214 years in the Senate, that would say any President's nominees, \nwhether they be Republican or Democrat, if they have the support of a \nmajority of the Senate, will get an up-or-down vote in the Senate. \nSenators who believe these nominees should be confirmed can vote for \nthem and those who believe they should not be confirmed can vote \nagainst them.\n  I was not a party to the negotiations and what happened in this room \noff the Senate floor, but I do have some concerns I wanted to express \nabout what has happened.\n  It is important to recognize what this so-called agreement among \nthese 14 Senators does and what it does not do. First of all, one of \nthe things it does, it means that at least three of the President's \nnominees--Bill Pryor, Janice Rogers Brown, and Priscilla Owen--will get \nan up-or-down vote on the Senate floor and that they will be, I trust, \nconfirmed to serve in the Federal judiciary.\n  What this agreement by these 14 Senators does not do, it does not \ngive any assurance that other nominees of the President--Mr. Myers, in \nparticular, and others--will get an up-or-down vote that they deserve \naccording to the common understanding of the Senate for more than 200 \nyears by which those who enjoyed majority support did get that vote and \ndid get confirmed.\n  What this agreement says, we are told, is that seven Democrats and, \npresumably, seven Republicans reserve the right to filibuster judicial \nnominees under extraordinary circumstances, but we are left to wonder \nwhat those extraordinary circumstances might be. What makes me so \nskeptical about this agreement among these 14 is that extraordinary \ncircumstances are in the eye of the beholder.\n  Looking at the litany of false charges made against Priscilla Owen \nfor the last 4 years makes me skeptical that any nominee, no matter how \nqualified, no matter how deserving, that under appropriate \ncircumstances our colleagues, some of our colleagues, will find the \ncircumstances extraordinary and still reserve unto themselves what\n\n[[Page S5823]]\n\nthey perceive as their right to engage in a filibuster and deny a \nbipartisan majority our right to an up-or-down vote.\n  It is clear to me this agreement among these 14 to which 86 Senators \nwere not a party does not solve anything. What it does do is perhaps \ndelay the inevitable. Senator DeWine, in particular, one of the \nsignatories of this agreement, says this is an effort to break the \nlogjam on these three nominees, hopefully, change the standard by which \nat least seven Senators on the other side of the aisle will engage in a \nfilibuster, and perhaps start anew.\n  I hope Senator DeWine is correct in his reading and his understanding \nof this agreement. I was not a party to it; presumably, 84 Senators \nwere not a party to it. Negotiations took place in a room where I \ndidn't participate, where the American people were not given the \nopportunity to listen and judge for themselves.\n  The thing that disturbs me most about this temporary resolution, if \nyou can call it that, is that while 7 Republicans and 7 Democrats were \na party to this agreement, a product of these negotiations, the fact is \nthat the 7 Republicans of this 14 would have agreed to close off debate \nand would have agreed to allow an up-and-down vote, while it is clear \nthat the 7 Democrats would not have agreed otherwise to withhold the \nfilibuster and allow an up-or-down vote.\n  What reminds me so much of Roseanne Rosannadanna on Saturday Night \nLive and Gilda Radner, now in effect what they are saying after 4 years \nof character assassination, unjustified attacks, and a blatant \nmisrepresentation of the record of these fine nominees, they are \nsaying, in effect, never mind, as if it never happened. But it did \nhappen. It is important to recognize what has happened. It is a blight \non the record of this body, and it is further evidence of how broken \nour judicial confirmation process has been.\n  I have nothing but admiration for the courage of our majority leader \nin bringing us to this point. I believe if he had not had the courage \nand determination--and, I might add, our assistant majority leader, \nMitch McConnell--if our leadership had not had the determination to \nbring us to this point, I have no doubt that we would not have reached \nat least this temporary resolution. They are entitled to a whole lot of \ncredit for their courage and their willingness to hold the feet to the \nfire of those in the partisan minority who would have denied a \nbipartisan majority the right to an up-and-down vote on these nominees.\n  This agreement of these 14 Senators delays but does not solve the \nproblem. Of course, we all anticipate that before long, there will be a \nSupreme Court vacancy which will test this definition of what these 14 \ncall extraordinary circumstances. I wonder whether this standard will \nbe applied to the other nominees who were not explicitly covered by \nthis agreement; that is, other nominees who have been pending for years \nwho were not given, as Justice Owen, Justice Brown, and Judge Pryor \nhave been, the opportunity for an up-or-down vote.\n  Let me say I hope I am wrong. But there is plenty of reason to be \nskeptical about this so-called agreement of these 14. Perhaps we will \nsee a triumph of hope over experience, but our experience over the last \n4 years has been a bad one and one which I don't think reflects well on \nthe Senate.\n  I hope I am wrong. I hope what has been established is a new \nprecedent that says that the filibuster is inappropriate and will not \nbe used against judicial nominees because of perceived difference in \njudicial philosophy, that people who have certain fundamental \nconvictions will not automatically be disqualified from judicial \noffice. I hope that is where we are. As we know, though, extraordinary \ncircumstances could be interpreted by some to mean that if you can \nvilify and demonize a nominee enough, that, indeed, the filibuster \ncontinues to be justified. We know from the false accusations made \nagainst too many of President Bush's nominees how easy that is to do.\n\n  After $10 million--that is one estimate I have heard--in the various \nspecial interest attack ads have been run against Priscilla Owen and \nJanice Rogers Brown and others, after $10 million or more, perhaps, the \nAmerican people are told, never mind, we did not really mean it; or \neven if we did mean it, you are not supposed to take us seriously \nbecause what this is all about is a game.\n  This is about the politics of character assassination, the politics \nof personal destruction. In Washington, perhaps people can be forgiven \nfor believing that happens far too much. Indeed, that is what has \nhappened with these fine nominees. But now they are told, particularly \nin the case of Justice Owen, after 4 years, never mind, all the things \nthat were said about you, all the questions raised are beside the \npoint, and you are not going to serve on the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals after waiting 4 years for an up-or-down vote.\n  I worry some nominees in the future will simply say: I am not going \nto put my family through that. I think about Miguel Estrada, who waited \n2 years for an up-or-down vote with the wonderful American success \nstory, but after 2 years he simply had to say: I can't wait anymore. My \nreputation cannot sustain the continued unjustified attacks. I am \nsimply going to withdraw.\n  Unfortunately, when we have good men and women who simply say, I \ncan't pay the price that public service demands of me and demands of my \nfamily, I fear we are all losers as a result of that process.\n  I am skeptical of this agreement made by 14 after secret negotiations \nthat we were not a party to. Perhaps I am being unduly skeptical. I \nhope I am wrong. I hope what has happened today and I hope we are \nreassured over the hours and days that lie ahead that what has been \nestablished is a new precedent, one that says we will not filibuster \njudicial nominees, we are not going to assassinate their character, we \nare not going to spend millions of dollars demonizing them.\n  I hope I am wrong and that we have a fresh start when it comes to \njudicial nominations. The American people deserve better. These \nnominees deserve better. This Senate deserves better than what we have \nseen over the last 4 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, a week ago, I stood in this Chamber and I \nreminded Members to look back some 200 years. The issue of how we are \ngoing to nominate and confirm judicial appointees is not a new issue. \nAt the 1787 Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, there were many \nissues to resolve. One of the last issues resolved was, who is going to \nselect these Federal judges to serve a lifetime appointment?\n  Ben Franklin led the forces on one side in an effort to try to curb \nthe powers of this President we are going to establish to make sure we \ndid not have a king in this country. And Ben Franklin and those who \nsided with him said the judges ought to be selected by the Senate, by \nthe Congress.\n  There was another school of thought that prevailed as well in the \nConstitutional Convention, those forces led by Alexander Hamilton. \nHamilton and his allies said: No, the President should choose the \npeople who are going to serve lifetime appointments to the Federal \nbench.\n  In the end, a compromise was proposed and voted on. Here is the \ncompromise: The President will nominate, with the advice and consent of \nthe Senate, men and women to serve lifetime appointments to the Federal \nbench. That compromise was voted on. It was defeated. They wrangled for \na while longer and came back and they voted on the same compromise \nagain. It was defeated. They went back and wrangled among themselves \nand came back and voted a third time on the same compromise. And it was \naccepted. That was 1787.\n  A lot of years have passed since then, and this issue, this check and \nbalance that was embedded in our Constitution, is one we have revisited \nover and over again. We did it this week. It was a big issue when \nThomas Jefferson was President, the beginning of his second term when \nhe sought to stack the courts and was rebuffed by his own party. That \nwas in the 1800s. It was a big issue in the 1900s when FDR, at the \nbeginning of his second term, sought to stack the courts, pack the \ncourts. He, too, was rebuffed largely by his own party.\n\n  Is this compromise hammered out over the last couple of weeks going \nto\n\n[[Page S5824]]\n\nlast forever? My guess is probably not. Just as this has been an issue \nof contention for over 200 years, it is probably going to be a source \nof controversy for a while longer.\n  My friend from Texas, who spoke just before me, talked about the \nmistreatment of those who have been nominated to serve on the Federal \nbench by President Bush over the last 4 years. He mentioned a number, \nas it turns out, about 10 out of over 200, who were confirmed over the \nlast 4 years. He mentions the 10 who, frankly, have had their lives \ndisrupted, and in some cases were held up to poor commentary in the \npublic and in the Senate with respect to their worthiness to serve on \nthe bench for a lifetime appointment.\n  I like to practice treating other people the way I want to be \ntreated. I know most of us try to live by that credo. Sometimes we fall \nshort. I know I do. But I think just to be fair we ought to go back to \nthe first 4 years of when Bill Clinton was President. It was not just 5 \npercent of his nominees who were not confirmed. Some 19 percent of his \nnominees were not confirmed. It was not that they were denied a vote on \nthe floor, they never got out of committee.\n  One person--one person--could put a hold, stop a nominee from even \nhaving a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee. A handful of \nSenators in the committee could deny a nominee ever coming out of \ncommittee to be debated and voted on in the Senate. And somehow the \nidea that Bill Clinton could only get 81 percent of his nominees \nconfirmed the first 4 years was OK for some, but yet a 95-percent \napproval rate for this President's nominees in his first 4 years was \nunacceptable. I see an irony there. I hope others do, too.\n  Let me talk about the compromise that is before us. Most compromises \nI have been familiar with, frankly, do not leave either side especially \nhappy for the final result. And that certainly is true in this case as \nwell. But in the final analysis, the center of this body has held, \nbarely, but it has held. A critical element of our Nation's system of \nchecks and balances has been tested, but it still lives. For that, most \nof us should be happy--and if not happy, we should at least be \nrelieved.\n  I believe the path to a productive legislative session has been \nreopened, too. And almost like Lazarus rising from the grave, I think \nprospects for arriving at a middle ground on a whole range of issues we \nface has a new lease on life. We need to transfer the trust that I hope \nhas grown out of this negotiation among the seven Democrats and seven \nRepublicans. I salute them all for the good work they have done. I am \nnot going to get into naming names, but they know who they are, and I \nam grateful to each of them.\n  But what we need to do, as a body, as a Senate, is to transfer some \nof the trust that is a foundation of this agreement. We need to capture \nthat trust and turn it to addressing some of the most pressing issues \nthat face America: our huge and growing dependence on foreign oil, an \nenormous trade deficit and budget deficit, reining in the growth of \nhealth care and trying to make sure more people have health care \navailable, winning this war on terrorism, and finding ways to improve \nour Nation's air quality. All those issues beg to be addressed.\n  For this Senator, the good news that comes out of this agreement over \nthe last 24 hours is that now we can turn to our Nation's business. We \ncan get back to work. We need to. America wants us to.\n  For the President and our friends in the White House, let me say, in \ngoing forward on judicial nominees, if you will consult with the \nCongress--Democrats and Republicans--we can actually approve most of \nthose nominees. If this President will nominate mainstream judges, \nconservative judges--I expect them to be Republicans--if he will \nnominate those, for the most part, if they are not outside the \nmainstream, they will be approved. If the President will actually \nconsult with the Senate, as the Constitution calls for, we will be \nbetter off, he will be better off, and, frankly, our Nation will be \nbetter off.\n  The same applies to the legislative agenda that is now before us. For \nif the administration, the President, will work not just with \nRepublicans but with Democrats, too, we can make real progress, and \nwhen we look back on the 109th Congress, we can say, with pride, that \nwe got a lot done that needed to get done.\n  I yield back the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, debate will continue \nuntil 11:40. The minority side has 20 minutes remaining. The majority \nside has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer, my neighbor \nacross the Connecticut River.\n  Mr. President, last night I spoke, praising the Senators on both \nsides of the aisle who came together to avert the so-called nuclear \noption. I see on the floor the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, \nthe chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I think those Senators \nhave made his and my work a lot easier. I also commend the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware for his comments.\n  This President, with the compliance of the Republican majority, has \ntried to push the Senate across an unprecedented threshold that would \nforever change and weaken this body. This move would have stripped the \nminority of the crucial rights that have been a hallmark of this \nchamber, and it would have fundamentally altered the brilliant system \nof checks and balances designed by the Founders.\n  This misguided bid for one-party rule, the nuclear option, has been \ndeterred for now. This ill-advised power grab was thwarted through the \nwork and commitment of a bipartisan group of 14 Senators who have \nprevented the Republican majority leader from pulling this potentially \ndevastating trigger. Pursuant to that agreement, I expect a few \nDemocrats who had previously voted against cloture on the Owen \nnomination in the last Congress to vote in favor of cloture today. I \nunderstand that they are taking this action to save the Senate from the \nnuclear option and to preserve the filibuster.\n  This Republican tactic put the protection of the rights of the \nminority in this chamber in serious risk. That protection is \nfundamental to the Senate and to the Senate's ability to act as a check \nand balance in our national government. That protection is essential if \nwe are to protect the independence of the Judiciary and the Judiciary \nis to remain a protector of the rights of all Americans against the \noverreaching of the political branches.\n  I will continue to work in good faith, as I have always done, to \nfulfill the Senate's constitutionally-mandated role as a partner with \nthe Executive branch in determining who will serve in the Judiciary. I \nurge all Senators to take these matters to heart and to redouble our \nefforts to invest our advice and consent responsibility with the \nseriousness and scrutiny it deserves. As I have said before, just as \nDemocratic Senators alone could not avert the nuclear option, \nDemocratic Senators alone cannot assure that the Senate fulfills its \nconstitutional role with the check and balance on the Executive. I \nbelieve Republican Senators will also need to evaluate, with clear \neyes, each of the President's nominees for fitness. If they have doubts \nabout the suitability of a nominee to a lifetime judicial appointment, \nwell, they can no longer look the other way and wait for Democratic \nSenators to save them from a difficult vote. And there will be a number \nof difficult votes on the horizon on a number of problematic nominees. \nThere may be even more.\n  But I also remind everybody that while the Senate is supposed to \nserve as a check and balance, the whole process begins with the \nPresident. I have served here with six Presidents. Five of them have \nconsulted with the Senate and worked with the Senate. President Ford, \nPresident Carter, President Reagan, former President Bush, and \nPresident Clinton have done that. Frankly, if this President would work \nwith Senators on both sides of the aisle to identify and nominate \nconsensus choices, we can easily add to the tally of 208 confirmations. \nIf the White House will take the view that the President should be a \nuniter and not a divider, then we can make significant progress.\n  The design of checks and balances envisioned by the Founders has \nserved us well for over 200 years, and the agreement made last night \nhas preserved it.\n\n[[Page S5825]]\n\nJudicial nominations are for lifetime appointments to what has always \nbeen revered as an independent third branch of Government, one that \nwhile reliant on the balance between the executive and legislative \nbranches, is actually controlled by neither.\n  For more than two centuries, these checks and balances have been the \nsource of our Government's stability. It has been its hedge against \ntyranny. We have to preserve them in the interests of the American \npeople. We do that so the courts can be fair and independent. We should \nnot look at our Federal judiciary as being a Democratic judiciary or a \nRepublican judiciary. It should be independent of all of us because \nthey are the backstop to protect the rights of all Americans against \nencroachment by the Government. And all Americans have a stake in that, \nno matter who may control the Government at any given time.\n\n  The Senate remains available as a rudder that checks against abuse of \npower, and as a keel that defends the independence of the judiciary. As \nthe distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, noted \nlast night, the Senate has answered the call sounded by Benjamin \nFranklin at the conclusion of the Constitutional Convention by \npreserving our democracy and our Republic, as the Senate has been \ncalled upon to do so many times before.\n  Now we have before us the controversial nomination of Priscilla Owen. \nI will probably speak to this nomination more after the cloture vote, \nthe cloture vote which now is a foregone conclusion. For some reason we \nare still having it, but there is no question, of course, that the \nSenate will now invoke cloture.\n  Three years ago, after reviewing her record, hearing her testimony, \nand evaluating her answers, I voted against her confirmation, and I \nexplained at length the strong case against confirmation of this \nnomination. Nothing about her record or the reasons that led me then to \nvote against confirmation has changed.\n  I believe she has shown herself over the last decade on the Texas \nSupreme Court to be an ends-oriented judicial activist, intent on \nreading her own policy views into the law. She has been the target of \ncriticism by her conservative Republican colleagues on the court, in a \nvariety of types of cases where the law did not fit her personal views, \nincluding in cases where she has consistently ruled for big business \nand corporate interests in cases against workers and consumers.\n  The conservative Republican majority of the Texas Supreme Court has \ngone out of its way to criticize her and the dissents she joined in \nways that are highly unusual and in ways which highlight her ends-\noriented activism.\n  In FM Properties v. City of Austin, the majority called her dissent \n``nothing more than inflammatory rhetoric.''\n  In Montgomery Independent School District v. Davis, the majority, \nwhich included Alberto Gonzales and two other appointees of then-\nGovernor George W. Bush, is quite explicit in its view that Justice \nOwen's position disregards the law and that ``the dissenting opinion's \nmisconception . . . stems from its disregard of the procedural elements \nthe Legislature established,'' and that the ``dissenting opinion not \nonly disregards the procedural limitations in the statute but takes a \nposition even more extreme than that argued for by the board. . . .''\n  In the case of In re Jane Doe, the majority includes an extremely \nunusual section explaining its view of the proper role of judges, \nadmonishing the dissenters, including Justice Owen, for going beyond \ntheir duty to interpret the law in an attempt to fashion policy. In a \nseparate concurrence, then-Justice Alberto Gonzales says that to \nconstrue the law as the dissent did ``would be an unconscionable act of \njudicial activism.''\n  I understand he now says that when he wrote that opinion he was not \nreferring to her. I recognize why he is saying that. Of course, he has \nto defend not Governor Bush's appointment but now President Bush's \nnomination. But a fair reading of his concurring opinion leads me to \nsee it as a criticism of the dissenters, including Justice Owen. And he \nadmitted as much in published statements in the New York Times before \nJustice Owen's first hearing before the Judiciary Committee.\n  In the case of In re Jane Doe III, Justice Enoch writes specifically \nto rebuke Justice Owen and her fellow dissenters for misconstruing the \nlegislature's definition of the sort of abuse that may occur when \nparents are notified of the minor's intent to have an abortion, saying:\n\n       Abuse is abuse; it is neither to be trifled with nor its \n     severity to be second guessed.\n\n  In Weiner v. Wasson, Priscilla Owen went out of her way to ignore \nTexas Supreme Court precedent to vote against a young man injured by a \ndoctor's negligence. The young man was only 15 years old. Her \nconservative Republican colleagues on the court, led by then-Justice \nJohn Cornyn--now the junior Senator from Texas--lectured her about the \nimportance of following that 12-year-old case and ruling in the boy's \nfavor, calling the legal standard she proposed ``unworkable.''\n  In Collins v. Ison-Newsome, yet another case where Justice Owen \njoined a dissent criticized by the majority, the court was offended by \nthe dissenters' arguments. The majority says the dissenters agree the \ncourt's jurisdiction is limited, ``but then argues for the exact \nopposite proposition. . . . This argument defies the Legislature's \nclear and express limits on our jurisdiction.''\n  These examples show a judge out of step with the conservative \nRepublican majority of the Texas Supreme Court, a majority not afraid \nto explain the danger of Priscilla Owen's activist views.\n  Justice Owen has made other bad decisions where she skews her \ndecisions to show bias against consumers, against victims, and against \njust plain ordinary people, as she rules in favor of big business and \ncorporations. In fact, according to a study conducted last year by the \nTexas Watch Foundation, a nonprofit consumer protection organization in \nTexas, over the last 6 years, Priscilla Owen has not dissented once \nfrom a majority decision favoring business interests over victims, but \nhas managed to differ from the majority and dissent in 22 of the 68 \ncases where the majority opinion was for the consumer.\n  As one reads case after case, her legal views in so many cases \ninvolving statutory interpretation simply cannot be reconciled with the \nplain meaning of the statute, the legislative intent, or the majority's \ninterpretation.\n  This all leads to the conclusion that she sets out to justify a \npreconceived idea of what the law ought to mean. This is not an \nappropriate way for a judge to make decisions, but it is a way for a \njudge to make law from the bench--an activist judge.\n  Justice Owen's activism and extremism is noteworthy in a variety of \ncases, including those dealing with business interests, malpractice, \naccess to public information, employment discrimination and Texas \nSupreme Court jurisdiction, in which she writes against individual \nplaintiffs time and time again, in seeming contradiction of the law as \nwritten. A few examples of this include:\n  FM Properties v. City of Austin, where Justice Owen showed her \nwillingness to rule in favor of large private landowners against the \nclear public interest in maintaining a fair regulatory process and \nclean water. Her dissent, which the majority characterized as, \n``nothing more than inflammatory rhetoric,'' was an attempt to favor \nbig landowners. At her first hearing, and since, Justice Owen and her \nsupporters on the Committee have tried to recast this case as something \nmore innocent, but at the time she wrote her dissent, Justice Owen was \ncertainly clear about the meaning of this case--property rights for \ncorporations.\n  GTE Southwest, Inc. v. Bruce, is another example where Justice Owen \nwrote in favor of GTE in a lawsuit by employees for intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress. Despite the majority's recitation of \nan exhaustive list of sickening behavior by the supervisor, and its \nclear application of Texas law to those facts, Justice Owen wrote a \nconcurring opinion to explain that the conduct was not, as the standard \nrequires, so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to \ngo beyond all possible bounds of decency. The majority opinion shows \nJustice Owen's concurrence advocating a point of view that ignores the \nfacts in evidence in order to reach a predetermined outcome in the \ncorporation's favor.\n  City of Garland v. Dallas Morning News, Justice Owen dissented from a \nmajority opinion and, again, it is difficult to justify her views other \nthan as\n\n[[Page S5826]]\n\nbased on a desire to reach a particular outcome. In this case, she \nseeks to shield government decision-making from public view.\n  Quantum Chemical v. Toennies, another troubling case where Justice \nOwen joined a dissent advocating an activist interpretation of a \nclearly written statute, this time in the context of employment \ndiscrimination. The majority concluded that they must rely on the plain \nlanguage of the statute as amended, which could not be any clearer that \nunder Title VII discrimination can be shown to be a motivating factor, \ncontrary to Justice Owen's more activist view.\n  Mr. President, I said time and time again that when somebody walks \ninto a Federal court, they should not have to say, I may be treated one \nway because I am a Republican and a different way because I am a \nDemocrat, or one way because I am a plaintiff and a different way \nbecause I am a defendant, or one way because I am rich, and a different \nway because I am poor. They should be treated on the merits of the \ncase, no matter who they are.\n  In Priscilla Owen's case, it was almost predetermined how she would \nrule based upon who you are. The rich and powerful are protected. The \npoor or those hurt by the rich and powerful--she is going to rule \nagainst you. This is judicial activism.\n  After all these years, I am sure the President will get the votes to \nput Priscilla Owen on the court. But would it not have been better to \nhave nominated somebody who would unite us and not divide us?\n  Last night, 14 Senators--7 Republicans and 7 Democrats--said: We will \nprotect the Senate, actually protect the Constitution, protect advice \nand consent, and protect the checks and balances by giving the death \nknell to this so-called nuclear option. That was a good first step. But \nI urge the President to look at what was also said in that agreement. \nThey called upon the President to now finally work with Senators from \nboth parties in these lifetime appointments. No political party should \nown our Federal courts. In fact, no political party should be able to \ncontrol our Federal courts. Let us work together to have courts that \nactually work, that are independent of the executive, independent of \nbeing swayed, and are truly independent. We can do that and call on the \nPresident to do what every President since I have been here--the five \nbefore him--has always done, and that is work with both Republicans and \nDemocrats, work to unite us, not divide us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, Member time is \nreserved until 11:40, and the time between 11:40 and 12 o'clock is \nreserved for both the majority and minority leaders.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield the balance of my time to the \nDemocratic leader to use as he wishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the couple of \nextra minutes be divided between the majority leader and me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in my remarks this morning, I will speak \nvery briefly about the Priscilla Owen nomination and, more generally, \nabout the negotiations that led to the defeat of the so-called nuclear \noption. As I said this morning, the nuclear option is off the table, \nand we should stop talking about it after today. I continue, though, to \noppose the nomination of Priscilla Owen for the U.S. Court of Appeals.\n  As a member of the Texas Supreme Court, Justice Owen has consistently \nruled for big business, corporate interests, and cases against workers \nand consumers. Her colleagues on the Texas court, including the man who \nis now Attorney General of the United States, Alberto Gonzales, have \ncriticized her decisions. Judge Gonzales even called one of her \nopinions an act of ``unconscionable judicial activism.'' In case after \ncase, her record marks her as a judge who is willing to make law from \nthe bench rather than following the language of the statute and the \nintent of the legislature. Even on the conservative Supreme Court of \nTexas, Justice Owen is a frequent dissenter, and her opinions reveal an \nextreme ideological approach to the law.\n  As a result of the agreement announced last night, it is clear that \nthis nominee will receive an up-or-down vote. I intend to vote against \nher confirmation. I urge my colleagues to do so as well. I specifically \nurge my Republican colleagues to render an independent judgment on \nthis, and the other nominations will follow in the months to come. I am \nconfident they will.\n  If Justice Owen is confirmed as a Federal judge, I hope she surprises \nthose of us who have fought her nomination. Perhaps her experience as a \njudicial nominee has exposed her to a broader range of views, and that \nexperience may make her more sensitive to concerns regarding privacy, \ncivil rights, and consumer rights. I have never questioned her \nintellectual capabilities.\n  The agreement that will allow Justice Owen to receive an up-or-down \nvote also had the effect of taking the nuclear option off the table for \nthis Congress and, I think, in our lifetime. I wish to review what I \nbelieve was at stake in this debate. The agreement makes clear that the \nSenate rules have not changed. The filibuster remains available to the \nSenate minority, whether it be Democrat or Republican.\n  Last night, the seven Democrats agreed that filibusters will be used \nonly in extraordinary circumstances. In my view, the fact that there \nhave been so few out of the 218 nominations in the last 4 years means \nthat filibusters already are rare.\n  In any event, the agreement provides that ``each signatory must use \nhis or her own discretion and judgment in determining whether \n[extraordinary] circumstances exist.'' This, of course, is a subjective \ntest, as it always has been.\n  The 14 Democrats and Republicans who entered into the agreement last \nnight, and the rest of us who were prepared to vote against the nuclear \noption, stood for the principles of extended debate, minority rights, \nand constitutional checks and balances. For 200 years, the Senate rules \nembodying those principles have protected our liberties and our \nfreedoms. Those rules have not made life easy for Presidents and \nparties in power, but that is the way our Constitution was written, and \nthat is good.\n  Most every occupant of the White House, most every majority on \nCapitol Hill, has grown frustrated with the need to build consensus \ninstead of ruling by their own desires. But that is precisely what our \nFounding Fathers intended. That is our Constitution.\n  Those Founders created this body as a place secure from the winds of \nwhim, a place for deliberation and honorable compromise. It is why \nNevada, with its little over 2 million people, has as much to say in \nthis body as California, which has 35 million people. It is why \nsometimes we are governed not by the principles of ``one man, one \nvote'' but by the principles of one person who rises with a voice of \nconscience and courage.\n  When Thomas Jefferson and Franklin Roosevelt tried to pack our \ncourts, patriots of both parties put aside their personal interests to \nprotect our American rights and rules. In Caro's definitive work, \n``Master of the Senate,'' he has a wonderful 10 pages where he talks \nabout Roosevelt's attempt to pack the court. It is so revealing. \nRoosevelt calls Senate leaders to the White House--Democratic leaders--\nand the President didn't live in the White House, as they do now. His \nVice President, James Garner, a former Senator, walked out of that \nmeeting shaking his head and said that the President will not get his \nsupport on this, and he didn't. He didn't get the support of a majority \nof the Democrats. When Jefferson and Roosevelt tried to pack our \ncourts, it didn't work because Members of their own parties rose up \nagainst them. They were both Democrats.\n\n  Nothing in the advice and consent clause of the Constitution mandates \nthat a nominee receive a majority vote, or even a vote of any kind. \nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, over 500 judicial \nnominees since 1945--18 percent of all judicial nominees--were never \nvoted on by the full Senate. Most recently, over 60 of President \nClinton's judicial nominees were denied an up-or-down vote. In \ncontrast, we have approved 208 of President Bush's 218 nominees.\n  Last night, when I came to the floor, I said it is a happy night for \nme because the 8 years of the Clinton judicial situation are gone. I \nsaid last\n\n[[Page S5827]]\n\nnight that the 4 years of problems with the Bush administration, as it \nrelates to judges, are gone. Why? Because we are going to start \nlegislating as Senators should. If there is a problem with a judge, \nthat issue will be raised.\n  There will be occasions, although very infrequent, where a filibuster \nwill take place. That is what the Senate is all about.\n  The difference between a 95-percent confirmation rate and a 100-\npercent rate is what this country is all about. That 5 percent reflects \nthe moderating influence and spirit and openness made possible by the \nadvice and consent clause of our Constitution.\n  When our Founders pledged their lives and fortunes and their sacred \nhonor to the cause of our Revolution, it was not simply to get rid of \nKing George III. It was because they had a vision of democracy. James \nMadison, the Father of the Constitution, wrote:\n\n       The accumulation of all powers legislative, executive, and \n     judiciary in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many--\n     and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective--may \n     justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\n\n  Stripping away these important checks and balances would have meant \nthe Senate becomes merely a rubberstamp for the President. It would \nhave meant one political party, be it Republicans today or Democrats \ntomorrow, could effectively seize control of our Nation's highest \ncourts. It would have removed the checks on the President's power, \nmeaning one man sitting in the White House could personally hand out \nlifetime jobs whose rulings on our basic rights can last forever.\n  It is too much power for one person. It is too much power for one \nPresident. It is too much power for one political party. It is not how \nAmerica works.\n  Our democracy works when majority rules not with a fist but with an \noutstretched hand that brings people together. The filibuster is there \nto guarantee this.\n  The success of the nuclear option would have marked another sad, long \nstride down an ever more slippery slope toward partisan crossfire and a \nloss of our liberties. Instead, this is the moment we turned around and \nbegan to climb up the hill toward the common goal of national purpose \nand rebuilding of America's promise. America owes a debt of gratitude \nto the 14 Senators who allowed us to be here today.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I begin by thanking the distinguished \nDemocratic leader for his comments and noting with particularity his \nstatement that the use of the filibuster will be occasional and very \ninfrequent. I think that characterization is very important for the \nfuture of the Senate in the consideration of judicial nominations.\n  The term ``extraordinary circumstances'' does not lend itself to any \neasy interpretation. But when the Democratic leader asserts that this \nterm means occasional and very infrequent, it is very reassuring.\n  The Senator from Nevada went on to say this wipes away 8 years of \nClinton and 4 years of the second President Bush. That puts the whole \ncontroversy, in my judgment, into context, because what we have been \ntalking about in the course of these filibusters has been the pattern \nof payback which began in the last 2 years of President Reagan's \nadministration when Democrats won control of the Senate and the \nJudiciary Committee, where the nominating process was slowed down, and \n4 years of President George H. W. Bush. Then it was exacerbated during \nthe administration of President Clinton when we Republicans won the \nSenate in the 1994 election. And for the last 6 years of President \nClinton's tenure, we had a situation where some 60 judges were bottled \nup in committee, which was about the same as a filibuster.\n  I think it is worth noting that both Senator Frist, our Republican \nleader, and Senator Reid, the Democratic leader, are entitled to \nplaudits, because a week ago today, late in the afternoon in a room off \nthe first floor, a few steps from where we are at the present time, the \nleaders met with so-called Republican moderates and Democratic \nmoderates.\n  While not quite the imprimatur of propriety, their presence signified \nthey knew what was going on, that they were prepared to participate in \nit, and that, again, while it was not quite the Good Housekeeping stamp \nof approval, they were interested to see what occurred.\n  In a series of floor statements on this issue, as the Congressional \nRecord will show, I had urged the leaders to remove the party loyalty \nstraitjacket from Senators so the Senators could vote their consciences \nbecause of the consistent comments I heard in the corridors and in the \ncloakrooms by both Republicans and Democrats that they did not like \nwhere we were headed; that Democrats were not pleased with this pattern \nof filibusters, and Republicans were not pleased with the prospect of \nthe so-called constitutional or nuclear option.\n  And finally, in effect, that did happen when a group of moderate \nSenators got together, totaling 14 in number, as the parties signatory \nto the memorandum of understanding of last night, to forge an \narrangement where the very important constitutional checks and \nbalances, the very important constitutional separation of powers, would \nbe maintained.\n  When we talk about the delicate balance of separation of powers, the \nconstitutional scholars traditionally talk about it as so-called play \nin the joints. Had there been a formal determination of a rule change \nso that 51 Senators could cut off debate, that would have materially \naffected the delicate separation of powers where the President would \nhave had much greater authority, be he a Republican President or a \nDemocratic President.\n  Similarly, had the so-called constitutional or nuclear option been \ndefeated, then I think it is fair to say the minority party--Democrats \nin this situation--would have been emboldened to go further in the use \nof the filibuster.\n  The nominees who have been subjected to the filibuster, in my \njudgment, have been held hostage, pawns in this escalating spiral of \nexacerbation by both sides.\n  In my 25 years in the Senate, during all of which I have served on \nthe Judiciary Committee, I have seen our committee and this body \nroutinely confirm judicial nominees who were the equivalents of those \nwho have been filibustered here. These nominees have every bit the \nqualification of circuit judges who have been confirmed in the past.\n  Priscilla Owen, who is the specific nominee in question, would have \nbeen confirmed as a matter of routine had she not been caught up in \nthis partisan battle. She has an extraordinary academic record. She was \ncum laude from Baylor both for an undergraduate degree and a law \ndegree, scored the highest on the Texas bar exam, worked 17 years with \na very prestigious law firm in Texas, served 11 years on the Texas \nState Supreme Court, earned well-qualified ratings from the American \nBar Association, and is personally known to President Bush, who speaks \nof her in the most complimentary terms.\n\n  The senior Senator from Texas, Kay Bailey Hutchison, has been a \npersonal friend for years and knows her intimately. She speaks of her \nglowingly. She shepherded her to many private meetings with Senators. I \nspoke with Justice Owen at some length and was very much impressed with \nher on the academic level, on the professional level, and on the \npersonal level.\n  Our colleague on the Judiciary Committee, Senator John Cornyn, served \nwith her on the Texas Supreme Court and, again, spoke of her in \noutstanding terms.\n  I have spoken at length about Justice Owen in the past, and I would \nsimply incorporate by reference the comments which I made which appear \nin the Congressional Record for May 18 of this year, where I cited a \nselection of cases showing her judicial balance and showing her \nexcellent record on the Texas Supreme Court.\n  Mr. President, we have been joined by, as I turn around, two \ndistinguished Senators--one a current Member of this body, Senator Bill \nFrist, the other a former Member of this body, Senator Alfonse D'Amato. \nI did not recognize him at first because he was not in his pink suit.\n  One day, in the back row, Alfonse D'Amato appeared and sang E-I-E-I-O \nin a pink suit. There was some comment in the Chamber about how much it \nimproved his appearance. I did not agree with this.\n\n[[Page S5828]]\n\n  I have a very short story. I had a brother who was 10 years older \nthan I. One day he came down from the drugstore to the junkyard where I \nworked. He said: Arlen, I was just at Russell Drug. Down there they \nwere saying you weren't fit to eat with the pigs. But my brother said: \nI stuck up for you, Arlen. I said you were. So when I see Alfonse \nD'Amato on the Senate floor, I remember those good times.\n  Now I yield to the distinguished majority leader, whose time I hope I \nhave not unduly encroached upon. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a few moments, we will vote to conclude \ndebate on the nomination of Judge Priscilla Owen to the Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. It has been over 4 years since the Senate began \nconsideration of Justice Owen for this position, and the Senate over \nthat time has thoroughly and exhaustively investigated, looked at, \nexamined, and debated Judge Owen's nomination.\n  She has endured 9 hours of committee hearings, more than 500 \nquestions, and 22 days--it is interesting, 22 days. That is more than \nall sitting Supreme Court Justices combined have had on the floor of \nthe Senate--all sitting Supreme Court Justices combined. We have had \nPriscilla Owen's nomination debated on this floor for more days. There \nhas been more than 100 hours of floor debate. Now finally, after more \nthan 4 years of waiting, Judge Owen will receive a fair up-or-down vote \non the floor of the Senate.\n\n  As her critics now appear to be concede, Judge Owen is a mainstream \ncandidate, who is thoughtful, who is dignified, and imminently \nqualified. Her academic and professional qualifications are \noutstanding. The American Bar Association unanimously--unanimously--\nrated her as well qualified, its highest possible rating. She was \nreelected to the Texas Supreme Court with 84 percent of the vote. She \nis supported by Republicans and Democrats on the Texas Supreme Court. \nShe has been endorsed by every major newspaper in her State of Texas.\n  Moreover, in the face of continuous, sometimes vicious, attacks and \ndistortions of her record in the nominations process, Judge Owen has \nshown extraordinary patience with this body. Despite 4 years of attacks \non her integrity, Priscilla Owen has quietly, has patiently, has \ngracefully waited for an up-or-down vote.\n  Priscilla Owen has worked hard, played by the rules, faithfully \ninterpreted the law and gained the respect of her colleagues and \nconstituents. We cannot ask for more from a judicial nominee. It is \ntime to close our debate. It is time to give Justice Owen an up-or-down \nvote on the floor of the Senate.\n  Today's vote will allow that up-or-down vote. It will affirm each \nSenator's right to weigh the facts and vote his or her conscience up or \ndown, yes or no, confirmed or rejected. It is as simple as that. It is \nabout principle. It is about fairness. It is about our constitutional \nduty to give advice and consent.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 12 \no'clock having arrived, pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Executive \n     Calendar No. 71, the nomination of Priscilla Owen, of Texas, \n     to be United States Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit.\n         Bill Frist, Arlen Specter, Trent Lott, Lamar Alexander, \n           Jon Kyl, Jim Talent, Wayne Allard, Richard G.

Mr. President, I read from the King James version of the \nHoly Bible, from the 22nd chapter of Proverbs, the 28th verse:\n\n       Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have \n     set.\n\n  Mr. President, in his second inaugural address, Abraham Lincoln \nobserved that:\n\n       With malice toward none; with charity for all; with \n     firmness in the right, as God give us to see the right, let \n     us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the \n     nation's wounds. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, I have always believed that the Senate, by its nature, \nattracts and probably also creates men and\n\n[[Page S5829]]\n\nwomen of the quality and character who are able to step up when faced \nwith crises that threaten the ship of state, to calm the dangerous seas \nwhich, from time to time, threaten to dash our Republic against rocky \nshoals and jagged shores.\n  The Senate proved it to be true again yesterday, when 14 Members--\nfrom both sides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats; 14 Members--of \nthis revered institution came together to avert the disaster referred \nto as the ``nuclear option'' or the ``constitutional option''--these \nmen and women of great courage.\n  As William Gladstone said, in referring to the Senate of the United \nStates, the Senate is\n\n     that remarkable body, the most remarkable of all the \n     inventions of modern politics.\n\n  I thank all of those Republicans and Democrats who worked together to \nkeep faith with the Framers and the Founding Fathers. We have kept the \nfaith with those whose collective vision gave us this marvelous piece \nof work, the Constitution of the United States. Thank God--thank God--\nthat this work has been done and that it has been preserved, that a \ncatastrophe has been averted.\n  Article II, section 2, of the Constitution gives to the President the \npower to nominate, and ``by and with the Advice and Consent of the \nSenate,'' to ``appoint . . . Judges of the supreme Court, and all other \nOfficers of the United States. . . .''\n  There are two parts to that phrase: the ``advice'' on the one hand, \nand the ``consent'' on the other, and both must be present before any \nPresident can appoint any nominee to the Supreme Court or any other \nFederal court. It is, therefore, a shared responsibility between the \nU.S. Senate and the President of the United States.\n  By its agreement yesterday, the Senate is keeping that construct \nalive, this shared responsibility between the President of the United \nStates, on the one hand, and the Senate of the United States, on the \nother.\n  The agreement that was obtained yesterday by the cooperation between \nand among the 14 Members of the Senate--representing Republicans and \nDemocrats--it was that agreement that reminds us of the words of our \nConstitution, by encouraging the President of the United States, on the \none hand, to consult with the Senate of the United States, on the \nother. In other words, the Senate will be in on the takeoff, meaning \nprior to sending up his nominees for our consideration. In recent \ntimes--and by that I mean under Presidents of both parties--there has \nnot been all that much consultation by the President with the Senate.\n  So here we are, in the Senate, offering the hand of partnership to \nthe Chief Executive and saying: Consult with us. That is what the \nFramers intended, that the President of the United States should \nconsult with the Senate. You don't have to take our advice, but here it \nis. And by considering that advice, it only stands to reason that any \nPresident will be more assured that his nominees will enjoy a kinder \nreception in the Senate.\n  The agreement, which references the need for ``advice and consent,'' \nas contained in the Constitution, proves once again, as has been true \nfor over 200 years, that our revered Constitution is not simply a dry \npiece of parchment. It is a living document.\n  Yesterday's agreement was a real-life illustration of how this \nhistorical document continues to be vital in our daily lives. It \ninspires, it teaches, and yesterday it helped the country and the \nSenate avoid a serious catastrophe.\n  Mr. President, for this reason and others, I ask that at the end of \nmy remarks the agreement reached by the 14 Senators be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do this so that we in the Senate and the \nPresident may all have a way of easily revisiting the text of that \nagreement for future reference.\n  On the heels of this agreement, I believe that we should now move \nforward, propelled by its positive energy, in a new direction. We \nshould make every effort to restore reason to the politically partisan \nfervor that has overtaken our Senate, this city, and our country. We \nmust stop arguing and start legislating.\n  Divisive political agendas are not America's goals. The right course \nlies someplace in the middle. It is our job to work as elected \nrepresentatives of a reasonable people to do what is right, regardless \nof threats from any of the angry groups that seem dedicated to \nintimidation. The skeptics, the cynics, the doubters, the Pharisees, \nthose who are intoxicated by the juice of sour grapes did not prevail \nand must not prevail. The 14 Republican and Democratic Senators rose \nabove those who do not wish to see accord but prefer discord.\n  Chaucer's ``Canterbury Tales''--we have all read Chaucer's \n``Canterbury Tales'' in high school--contains ``The Pardoner's Tale.''\n  The story tells about the journey by the pilgrims to Canterbury, to \nthe shrine of Canterbury. The scene took place in Flanders, where once \nthere sat drinking in a tavern three young men who were much given to \nfolly. As they sat, they heard a small bell clink before a corpse that \nwas being carried to the grave. Whereupon, one of the three called to \nhis knave and ordered him to go and find out the name of the corpse \nthat was passing by.\n  The boy answered that he already knew and that it was an old comrade \nof the roisterers who had been slain, while drunk, by an unseen thief \ncalled ``Death,'' who had slain others in recent days.\n  And so out into the road the three young ruffians went in search of \nthis monster called Death. They came upon an old man and seized him, \nand with rough language they demanded that he tell them where they \ncould find this cowardly adversary who was taking the lives of their \ngood friends around the countryside.\n  The old man pointed to a great oak tree on a nearby knoll, saying, \n``There, under that tree you will find Death,'' that monster. In a \ndrunken rage, the three roisterers set off in a run until they came to \nthe tree, and there they found a pile of gold--eight basketfuls of \nflorins, newly minted, round, gold coins. Forgotten was the monster \ncalled Death, as the three pondered their good fortune. And they \ndecided that they should remain with the gold until nightfall, when \nthey would divide it among themselves and take it to their respective \nhomes. It would be unsafe, they reasoned, to attempt to do so in broad \ndaylight, as they might be fallen upon by thieves who would take their \ntreasure from them.\n  It was proposed that the three draw straws, and the person who drew \nthe shortest straw would go into the nearby village and purchase some \nbread and wine and cheese, which they could then enjoy as they whiled \naway the daylight hours. So off toward the village the young man who \ndrew the shortest straw went. When he was out of sight, the remaining \ntwo decided that there was no good reason why this fortune, this pile \nof gold, should be divided among three individuals. So one of them said \nto the other, ``When he returns, you throw your arm around him as if in \ngood sport, as in jest, and I will rive him with my dagger, and with \nyour dagger, you can do the same. Then all of this gold will be divided \nnot among three of us but just between two of us--you and me.''\n  Meanwhile, while the two were planning the demise of the third, the \nyoungest rogue, as he made his way into the town, thought to himself \nwhat a shame it would be that the gold would be divided among three, \nwhen it just as well could be so easily belong only to the ownership of \none, himself. Therefore, in town the young man went directly to an \napothecary and asked to be sold some poison for the large rats and a \npolecat that had been killing his chickens. The apothecary--the \npharmacist--quickly provided some poison, saying that as much as \nequaled only a tiny grain of wheat would result immediately in sudden \ndeath for the creature that drank the mixture.\n  Having purchased the poison, the young villain crossed the street to \na winery, where he purchased three bottles--two for his friends, one \nfor himself. After he left the village, he sat down, opened two bottles \nof wine and deposited an equal portion in each, and then returned to \nthe oak tree, where the two older villains did as they had planned. One \nthrew his arm, as if in jest, around the shoulders of the third, and \nboth buried their daggers in him. He fell dead on the pile of gold. The\n\n[[Page S5830]]\n\nother two villains then sat down, broke the bread, cut the cheese, and \nopened the two bottles of wine. Each took a good, deep swallow, and \nthen, suffering a most excruciating pain, both fell dead upon the pile \nof gold and upon the body of the third. So there they were across the \npile of gold, all three of them dead.\n\n  Their avarice, their greed for gain, their love of material things \nhad destroyed them. There is a lesson here in Chaucer's Tales, as given \nto us by ``The Pardoner.'' The strong temptation for political \npartisanship that has prevailed in the Senate can tear this Senate \napart and can tear the Nation apart and confront all of us with \ndestruction, so that in the end we three--the President, the Senate, \nand the people--will all be destroyed, as it were.\n  So we almost saw that happen here on the Senate floor--until \nyesterday, when that catastrophe, looming as it was before the Senate, \nwas averted. I applaud the fact that the center, the anchor, held, and \nwe stood together for the good of the country against mean-spirited, \nshallow, political ends.\n  Mr. President, I implore all of us to endeavor to lift our eyes to \nthe higher things. We can perform some much needed healing on the body \npolitic. If we can come together in a dignified way to orderly and \nexpeditiously move forward on these nominations, perhaps we can yet \nsalvage a bit of respect and trust from the American people for all of \nus, for the Senate, and for our institutions of free government.\n  We have a duty, at this critical time, to rise above politics as \nusual, in which we savage one another, and in so doing, destroy \nourselves, like the three villains in ``The Pardoner's Tale.''\n  Let us put the Nation first. The American people want us to do that. \nIn the long run, that is how we will be judged and, more importantly, \nit is how the Senate will be judged.\n  It is easy to tear down; it is difficult to build.\n\n     I saw them tearing a building down,\n     A group of men in a busy town.\n     With a ``Ho, Heave, Ho and a lusty yell,\n     They swung a beam and the sidewall fell.\n\n     I said to the foreman, ``Are these men skilled?\n     The type you would hire if you had to build.''\n     He laughed, and then he said, ``No indeed,\n     Just common labor is all I need;\n     I can easily erect in a day or two,\n     That which takes builders years to do.''\n\n     I said to myself as I walked away,\n     ``Which of these roles am I trying to play?\n     Am I a builder who works with care,\n     Building my life by the rule and square?\n     Am I shaping my deeds by well-laid plan,\n     Patiently building the best I can?\n     Or am I a wrecker who walks the town\n     Content with the labor of tearing down.''\n\n  Mr. President, it is easy to tear down, but it takes a long time to \nbuild. We have been 217 years in building this Senate, making it what \nit was intended to be by the Framers who wrote it 219 years ago, who \nestablished three equal coordinate branches of Government, who \nestablished a separation of powers, who established checks and balances \nin this Constitution of the United States.\n  The work of those Framers and the work of the larger group of \nFounders took 219 years. It was about to be destroyed in a single day, \nthis day. But thank God 14 Senators from both sides of the aisle met \nand rose above partisan politics and kept the faith with the Framers \nand with the Founders so that our posterity might enjoy the blessings \nof liberty, the blessings of freedom of speech, the roots of which go \nall the way back to the reign of Henry IV, who reigned from 1399 to \n1413 and who in 1407 proclaimed that the members of Parliament--the \nHouse of Lords and the House of Commons--could speak freely and without \nfear.\n  And those words were written into the Declaration of Rights, which \ndeclaration was submitted to William III of Orange and Mary, a \nDeclaration of Rights which included freedom of speech in Parliament. \nThat declaration was presented on February 13, 1689, to William III and \nMary. They both accepted it and were then proclaimed by the House of \nCommons joint sovereigns of the nation.\n  Then, on December 18, 1689, those words were included in a statute, \nthe English Bill of Rights--freedom of speech, the roots going back a \nlong way. That freedom of speech then was provided to those of us in \nthe Senate, provided by the Constitution, and since 1806, when the \nprovision for the previous question was discarded upon the \nrecommendation of Vice President Aaron Burr, since 1806 that provision \nfor the previous question or the sudden cutting off debate was \ndiscarded. Since 1806, until the year 1917, the year in which I was \nborn during the administration of Woodrow Wilson, that freedom of \nspeech has prevailed in the Senate, and it has lived since then except \nfor unanimous consent agreements and the cloture provision which was \nfirst agreed to in 1917, the cloture provision shutting off debate \nunder the rules of the Senate.\n  Freedom of speech has reigned in this body, and it still lives, \nthanks again to the 14 Republicans and Democrats who rose above \npolitics yesterday and came forward with this accord.\n  So, Mr. President, let us be true to the faith of our fathers and to \nthe expectation of those who founded this Republic. The coming days \nwill test us again and again, but let us go forward together hoping \nthat in the end, the Senate will be perceived as having stood the test, \nand may we, both Republicans and Democrats and Independents, when our \nwork is done, be judged by the American people and by the pages of \nhistory as having done our duty and as having done it well.\n  Our supreme duty is not to any particular person, not to any \nparticular President, not to any political party, but to the \nConstitution, to the people of the Nation, and to the future of this \nRepublic. It is in that spirit that we may do well to remember the \nwords of Benjamin Hill, a great Senator, a great orator from the State \nof Georgia, his words being inscribed on a statue in Atlanta, GA, as \nthey are and as they appear today upon that monument:\n\n       Who saves his country saves himself, saves all things, and \n     all things saved do bless him. Who let's his country die dies \n     himself ignobly, and all things dying curse him.\n\n  Remember that ancient proverb: Remove not the ancient landmark, which \nthy fathers have set.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n          Memorandum of Understanding on Judicial Nominations\n\n       We respect the diligent, conscientious efforts, to date, \n     rendered to the Senate by Majority Leader Frist and \n     Democratic Leader Reid. This memorandum confirms an \n     understanding among the signatories, based upon mutual trust \n     and confidence, related to pending and future judicial \n     nominations in the 109th Congress.\n       This memorandum is in two parts. Part I relates to the \n     currently pending judicial nominations; Part II relates to \n     subsequent individual nominations to be made by the President \n     and to be acted upon by the Senate's Judiciary Committee.\n       We have agreed to the following:\n\n\n          Part I: Commitments on Pending Judicial Nominations\n\n       A. Votes for Certain Nominees. We will vote to invoke \n     cloture on the following judicial nominees: Janice Rogers \n     Brown (D.C. Circuit), William Pryor (11th Circuit), and \n     Priscilla Owen (5th Circuit).\n       B. Status of Other Nominees. Signatories make no commitment \n     to vote for or against cloture on the following judicial \n     nominees: William Myers (9th Circuit) and Henry Saad (6th \n     Circuit).\n\n\n              Part II: Commitments for Future Nominations\n\n       A. Future Nominations. Signatories will exercise their \n     responsibilities under the Advice and Consent Clause of the \n     United States Constitution in good faith. Nominees should \n     only be filibustered under extraordinary circumstances, and \n     each signatory must use his or her own discretion and \n     judgment in determining whether such circumstances exist.\n       B. Rules Changes. In light of the spirit and continuing \n     commitments made in this agreement, we commit to oppose the \n     rules changes in the 109th Congress, which we understand to \n     be any amendment to or interpretation of the Rules of the \n     Senate that would force a vote on a judicial nomination by \n     means other than unanimous consent or Rule XXII.\n       We believe that, under Article II, Section 2, of the United \n     States Constitution, the word ``Advice'' speaks to \n     consultation between the Senate and the President with regard \n     to the use of the President's power to make nominations. We \n     encourage the Executive branch of government to consult with \n     members of the Senate, both Democratic and Republican, prior \n     to submitting a judicial nomination to the Senate for \n     consideration.\n       Such a return to the early practices of our government may \n     well serve to reduce the rancor that unfortunately \n     accompanies the advice and consent process in the Senate.\n       We firmly believe this agreement is consistent with the \n     traditions of the United States Senate that we as Senators \n     seek to uphold.\n         E.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that the time I \nconsume come out of my time postcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n         Retirement of Colonel Russ Howard, United States Army\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \naccomplishments of Colonel Russ Howard, head of the department of \nsocial sciences and director of the Combating Terrorism Center at West \nPoint. Colonel Howard is retiring June 3, 2005, after 37 years of \nActive and Reserve military service.\n  In his previous position, he was the deputy department head of the \ndepartment of social sciences. Prior to that, Colonel Howard was an \nArmy chief of staff fellow at the Center for International Affairs at \nHarvard University. Formerly, Colonel Howard was the commander of the \n1st Special Forces Group (Airborne) at Fort Lewis, WA. Other recent \nassignments include assistant to the Special Representative to the \nSecretary General during UNOSOM II in Somalia, deputy chief of staff \nfor I Corps, and chief of staff and deputy commander for the Combined \nJoint Task force, Haiti/Haitian Advisory Group. He also served as the \nadministrative assistant to ADM Stansfield Turner and as a special \nassistant to the commander of SOUTHCOM.\n  When Colonel Howard was commander of 3rd Battalion, 1st Special \nWarfare Training Group (Airborne) at Fort Bragg, NC, he developed the \ncurriculum for the first ever graduate degree program for the Civil \nAffairs and Psychological Operations officers.\n  Prior to Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, Colonel Howard took a \nmobile training team to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to train the ``lost \nboys,'' newly appointed Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations \nofficers already deployed to the Persian Gulf.\n  The newly trained officers performed superbly during operations and \n3rd Battalion won the Army Superior Unit Award, largely due to the \nefforts and foresight of Colonel Howard.\n  As a newly commissioned officer, a much younger officer, Colonel \nHoward served as ``A'' team commander in the 7th Special Forces Group \nfrom 1970 to 1972.\n  He left the Active component and served in the U.S. Army Reserve from \n1972 to 1980. During this period, he served as an overseas manager, \nAmerican International Underwriters Melbourne, Australia, and China \ntour manager and Canadian Pacific Airlines.\n\n  He was recalled to active duty in 1980 and served initially in Korea \nas an infantry company commander. Subsequent assignments included \nclassified project officer, U.S. Army 1st Special Operations Command at \nFort Bragg, and operations officer and company commander 1st Battalion, \n1st Special Forces Group in Okinawa, Japan.\n  Colonel Howard earned a bachelor of science degree in industrial \nmanagement from San Jose State University, bachelor of arts degree in \nAsian studies from the University of Maryland, a master of arts degree \nin international management from the Monterey Institute of \nInternational Studies, and a masters of public administration degree \nfrom Harvard University.\n  Colonel Howard was an assistant professor of social sciences at the \nU.S. Military Academy and a senior service college fellow at the \nFletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University.\n  During his extraordinary career of public service, Colonel Russ \nHoward was a dedicated leader, enlightened visionary, effective \noperator, and exemplary role model for cadets, soldiers, and civilians.\n  For the past 7 years, he made enormous contributions to the U.S. \nMilitary Academy, its graduates, and to the Nation through his \nrelentless pursuits of excellence in the department of social sciences \nand his advancement of education, research, and policy development in \nthe global war on terror.\n  He was the right person at the right time in exactly the right job as \nthe Academy and the Nation responded to the events of 9/11 and the \nglobal war on terror. Building on his extraordinary skills as a \nresearcher and educator, he knew the intellectual response to the war \non terror would have to be as significant as the operational response \nand set a course for the department and the Academy to lead this \nresponse.\n  Building on an exceptional experience as a Special Forces officer who \ncommanded at every level from team leader to Special Forces Group, he \nwas able to integrate the intellectual issues of understanding \nterrorism with the practical issues of countering terrorism and include \nthem in the curriculum, and eventually led to the establishment of the \nCombating Terrorism Center at West Point.\n  He inspired support from the academy leadership, from General-retired \nWayne Downing, Mr. Vinnie Viola, Mr. Ross Perot, and many others, so \nthat the U.S. Military Academy has become the international leader in \nundergraduate terrorism education and research.\n  Simultaneously, Colonel Howard enhanced all aspects of the academy \nand the Department of Social Sciences by supporting a robust teaching \nprogram. He taught more than 15 different courses, created 4 new ones, \npublished 3 books and 15 articles, and encouraged and cultivated \nresources for other faculty to follow his example.\n  His support for faculty and cadet development through the \nscholarship, debate, model U.N., domestic affairs forum, finance forum, \nsports, and a myriad of other activities was exceptional. Most \nimportantly, he is a trusted, caring, concerned, and dedicated leader \nwho evokes the best from everybody with whom he comes in contact.\n  It has been my privilege to know Colonel Howard for many years, to \nrespect him as a soldier and a scholar, and to at this moment \ncongratulate him on a career of exceptional service to the Army and to \nthe Nation. As he parts for other venues and other responsibilities, I \nwish him well.\n  I yield back my time, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Embryonic Stem Cell Research\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an issue that has \nbeen worked on in the country for some period of time. Soon, a House \nvote will take place on embryonic stem cell research. The issue that \nwill soon be voted on in the House--and may come before this body--is \nwhether to allow the taxpayer funding of destruction of young human \nlife.\n  This legislation being considered in the House of Representatives \nwould take young human embryos, would provide taxpayer dollars to \ndestroy these embryos and conduct research on the stem cells derived \nfrom them. I believe we all have a duty to protect innocent life. We \nhave a duty and a responsibility to look out for the downtrodden, those \nwho do not have a voice. These are the youngest of human lives; they \nshould be protected, and they should not be researched on.\n  We have at times in the past in the United States researched on other \nhuman beings. Whenever we have done so, at the moment in time when it \nwas done, people did it on the basis that we need to know, or we need \nto be able to conduct this research, or this research will provide a \ncure for something. Yet in every instance--either in this country or \nothers--when it has been done and the society at large has allowed it, \nwe have always, always regretted it later. It has always been wrong for \none group of humans who are in a more powerful position to research on \nsomebody in a lesser position. That has always been true, and it \nremains true today. We should not use taxpayer dollars to fund research \non the youngest of human lives. It is wrong, it is not necessary, and \nit should be stopped.\n\n[[Page S5832]]\n\n  I am pleased that the President has promised to veto this \nlegislation. However, I also intend to not let this piece of \nlegislation make it forward, to move to the President's desk. If others \nchoose to bring this destruction of human life--taxpayer-funded \ndestruction of human life--in front of this body, I intend that we are \ngoing to talk about it for a long time and address a whole series of \nissues, whether it be human cloning, which is associated with this \nhuman destructive legislation, or the creation of human-animal crosses \nfor research purposes. We are going to spend a lot of time discussing \nthis because young human lives are at stake. I will not sit idly by and \nacquiesce in their tragic destruction.\n  If this human destructive legislation, or a Senate counterpart, comes \nbefore this body, I will use all means available to impede its \nprogress. At the very least, we should have a lengthy debate on this \nissue before taking any action. The reason is that young human lives \nare at stake. I believe the very nature of our culture--whether we will \nhave a culture of life or not is at stake. Will we honor human life \nbecause it is sacred per se, or are we going to use it for a research \napparatus for the benefit of others? We have always regretted that when \nwe have done it before. Today is a similar type of discussion.\n  Some are saying this doesn't really look like a human life; it is so \nsmall, so microscopic in some cases, that some say it really cannot be \nhuman life. Yet, according to the biological and scientific definition, \nthis is young human life. If allowed to be nurtured, it becomes you, \nme, or anybody watching. Life has to be nurtured at all stages. It is \nno different biologically at that stage versus at a later stage. It has \nthe same biological components, or ``software,'' if you will, or DNA \nstructure. It needs to be nurtured, and it matures into an adult human. \nIf we are going to proceed on this, I think we are really hurting \nourselves as a society.\n  I also point out that some people are saying we need to do this to \nfind cures. I want to find cures, also--cures for people with cancer, \nAlzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injuries, or \njuvenile diabetes--and I have been working on that. The thing is, we \nhave a route to find these cures that is ethical and moral.\n  The House is also considering a cord blood bill from Congressman \nSmith today, and there are also adult stem cells. We have had this \ndiscussion before, but I think people hear ``stem cells,'' and they \nsay: I am for it. We need to be clear that there are different types of \nstem cells: There are cord blood stem cells in the umbilical cord, \nthere are embryonic stem cells, where you have to destroy the embryo \nitself to get the stem cells, and there are adult stem cells in my body \nand yours and anybody watching. These adult stem cells are a kind of \nrepair cell that goes around the body fixing different parts of the \nbody. We have been able to take adult stem cells out and grow them \noutside the body to the point that, today, over 58 different human \ndiseases are being treated in human patients. There are published \nclinical studies using adult stem cells--the stem cells from one's own \nbody.\n  A Parkinson's disease patient, treated with his own adult stem cells, \ncontinues to exhibit relief of 80 percent of his symptoms more than 6 \nyears after the surgery. I had the man come in himself, who was treated \nwith his own adult stem cells taken from the base of his nose, grown \noutside the body, put in the left-hand side of his brain, with a \nsubstantial improvement on the right-hand side of his body. That is \npurely ethical research. It is working and getting the job done.\n  Spinal cord injuries. Dr. Carlos Limas treated 34 patients in \nPortugal with their own adult stem cells. I had two of them in to \ntestify at a hearing last year--one is a paraplegic and one is a \nquadriplegic--and they are walking with the assistance of braces and \ntheir own adult stem cells.\n  Also, umbilical cord blood cells were used to treat a South Korean \nwoman who had been paralyzed for 19 years. She had not walked for 19 \nyears, and she can now walk with braces.\n  What about juvenile diabetes? This disease affects a lot of people. \nThis is one that has vexed a lot of people. We all want to find a cure \nfor juvenile diabetes.\n  Dr. Denise Faustman at Harvard is a leading diabetes researcher. She \nhas completely reversed end-stage juvenile diabetes in mice and has FDA \napproval to begin human clinical trials using adult stem cell therapy.\n  My point in mentioning these 3 of the 58 different areas is that we \nhave an ethical answer. We have an answer that does not involve the \ndestruction of human life, and it is right before us. We can do it. We \ncan fund it, and we can move forward with it. We do not have to destroy \nyoung human life to do this, and it is wrong if we do.\n  There is going to be a big discussion. We are going to have a lot of \ndebate about this issue on the floor or in committee or other places if \npeople decide to move this legislation forward. This is not about \nbanning human embryonic stem cell research. This is about taxpayer \nfunding of human embryonic stem cell research. Embryonic stem cell \nresearch is legal. It is being conducted in this country. It is being \nfunded by the Government of the United States on a limited set of \nlines. The President had the discussion and put forward the \nguidelines--a limited set of lines that were identified, on which a \nlife-and-death decision had already been made prior to funding. That \nresearch continues and goes on today.\n  The House bill would expand that and say we can kill young human life \ntoday for research on embryonic stem cells, and we want to do it with \ntaxpayer funding. That is what I am saying I am opposed to is the \ntaxpayer funding where a life-and-death decision has not been made, and \nwe involve the destruction of young human lives. The House bill should \nnot move forward.\n  Mr. President, there are two statements that the President has put \nforward saying that he would veto such legislation if it comes forward. \nI ask unanimous consent to print these statements in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Statement of Administration Policy--May 24, 2005\n\n\n       H.R. 2520--Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005\n\n                 (Rep. Smith (R) NJ and 78 cosponsors)\n\n       The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. \n     2520, which would facilitate the use of umbilical-cord-blood \n     stem cells in biomedical research and in the treatment of \n     disease. Cord-blood stem cells, collected from the placenta \n     and umbilical cord after birth without doing harm to mother \n     or child, have been used in the treatment of thousands of \n     patients suffering from more than 60 different diseases, \n     including leukemia, Fanconi anemia, sickle cell disease, and \n     thalassemia. Researchers also believe cord-blood stem cells \n     may have the capacity to be differentiated into other cell \n     types, making them useful in the exploration of ethical stem \n     cell therapies for regenerative medicine.\n       H.R. 2520 would increase the publicly available inventory \n     of cord-blood stem cells by enabling the Department of Health \n     and Human Services (HHS) to contract with cord-blood banks to \n     assist them in the collection and maintenance of 150,000 \n     cord-blood stem cell units. This would make matched cells \n     available to treat more than 90 percent of patients in need. \n     The bill would also link all participating cord-blood banks \n     to a search network operated under contract with HHS, \n     allowing physicians to search for matches for their patients \n     quickly and effectively in one place. The bill also would \n     reauthorize a similar program already in place for aiding the \n     use of adult bone marrow in medical care. There is now $19 \n     million available to implement the Cord Blood Cell Bank \n     program; the Administration will work with the Congress to \n     evaluate future spending requirements for these activities. \n     The bill is also consistent with the recommendation from the \n     National Academy of Science to create a National Cord Blood \n     Stem Cell Bank program.\n       The Administration also applauds the bill's effort to \n     facilitate research into the potential of cord-blood stem \n     cells to advance regenerative medicine in an ethical way. \n     Some research indicates that cord blood cells may have the \n     ability to be differentiated into other cell types, in ways \n     similar to embryonic stem cells, and so present similar \n     potential uses but without raising the ethical problems \n     involved in the intentional destruction of human embryos. The \n     Administration encourages efforts to seek ethical ways to \n     pursue stem cell research, and believes that--with the \n     appropriate combination of responsible policies and \n     innovative scientific techniques--this field of research can \n     advance without violating important ethical boundaries. HR \n     2520 is an important step in that direction.\n\n[[Page S5833]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n            Statement of Administration Policy--May 24, 2005\n\n\n          H.R. 810--Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005\n\n                (Rep. Castle (R) DE and 200 cosponsors)\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R \n     810, which would require Federal taxpayer dollars to be used \n     to encourage the ongoing destruction of nascent human life. \n     The bill would compel all American taxpayers to pay for \n     research that relies on the intentional destruction of human \n     embryos for the derivation of stem cells, overturning the \n     President's policy that supports research without promoting \n     such ongoing destruction. If H.R 810 were presented to the \n     President, he would veto the bill.\n       The President strongly supports medical research, and \n     worked with Congress to dramatically increase resources for \n     the National Institutes of Health. However, this bill would \n     support and encourage a line of research that requires the \n     intentional destruction of living human embryos for the \n     derivation of their cells. Destroying nascent human life for \n     research raises serious ethical problems, and many millions \n     of Americans consider the practice immoral.\n       The Administration believes that government has a duty to \n     use the people's money responsibly, both supporting important \n     public purposes and respecting moral boundaries. Every year \n     since 1995, Congress has on a bipartisan basis upheld this \n     balance by prohibiting Federal funds for research in which an \n     embryo is destroyed. Consistent with this provision, the \n     President's policy permits the funding of research using \n     embryonic cell lines created prior to August 9, 2001, along \n     with stem cell research using other kinds of cell lines. \n     Scientists can therefore explore the potential application of \n     such cells, but the Federal government does not offer \n     incentives or encouragement for the destruction of nascent \n     human life.\n       H.R 810 seeks to replace that policy with one that offers \n     very little additional practical support to the research, \n     while using Federal dollars to offer a prospective incentive \n     for the destruction of human embryos. Moreover, H.R 810 \n     relies on unsupported scientific assertions to promote \n     morally troubling and socially controversial research. \n     Embryonic stem cell research is at an early stage of basic \n     science, and has never yielded a therapeutic application in \n     humans. It is too early to say if a treatment or a cure will \n     develop from embryonic stem cell research.\n       The Administration believes that the availability of \n     alternative sources of stem cells further counters the case \n     for compelling the American taxpayer to encourage the ongoing \n     destruction of human embryos for research. Researchers are \n     continually exploring alternative ways to derive pluripotent \n     stem cells. And alternative types of human stem cells--drawn \n     from adults, children, and umbilical-cord blood without doing \n     harm to the donors--have already achieved therapeutic results \n     in thousands of patients with dozens of different diseases. \n       Moreover, private sector support and public funding by \n     several States for this line of research, which will add up \n     to several billion dollars in the coming few years, argues \n     against any urgent need for an additional infusion of Federal \n     funds which, even if completely unrestricted, would not \n     approach such figures. Whatever one's view of the ethical \n     issues or the state of the research, the future of this field \n     does not require a policy of Federal subsidies offensive to \n     the moral principles of millions of Americans.\n       H.R. 810 advances the proposition that the Nation must \n     choose between science and ethics. The Administration, \n     however, believes it is possible to advance scientific \n     research without violating ethical principles: both by \n     enacting the appropriate policy safeguards and by pursuing \n     the appropriate scientific techniques. HR 810 is seriously \n     flawed legislation that would undo those safeguards and \n     provide a disincentive to pursuing those techniques. \n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, we will have much discussion of this \nissue if it comes before this body. I am going to be working \naggressively with a number of individuals to see that we continue this \nstem cell work in an ethical manner, but not where it involves the \ndestruction of human life.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I voted no on cloture, and I will vote \nno on the nomination of Priscilla Owen to be a judge on the U.S. \nCircuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit Court. I would like to \ntake a few minutes today to explain my votes. I also would like to make \na few comments on the events that led up to these votes.\n  I strongly oppose the threat of the nuclear option. I believe this \nwas an illegitimate tactic, a partisan abuse of power that was a threat \nto the Senate as an institution and to the country. Attempting to \nblackmail the minority into giving up their rights that have been part \nof the Senate's traditions and practices for centuries was a new low \nfor a majority that has repeatedly been willing to put party over \nprinciple. Unfortunately, the blackmail was partially successful. While \nI do applaud the efforts of the Senators who worked hard to broker an \nagreement, the end result is that three nominees who do not deserve \nlifetime appointments to the judiciary will now be confirmed.\n  The agreement reached by our colleagues states that filibusters \nshould be reserved for extraordinary circumstances. For me, that has \nalways been the test. I think Democrats have stuck to that standard in \nblocking just 10--just 10--out of the 218 nominations of President Bush \nthat have been brought to the floor. A number of very conservative and \nvery controversial nominees have been confirmed by the Senate. Jeffrey \nSutton, now a judge on the Sixth Circuit, was confirmed by a vote of 52 \nto 41. No filibuster was used there. Jay Bybee, the author of the \ninfamous torture memo, now sits on the Ninth Circuit. He was not \nfilibustered. Michael McConnell, a very conservative and anti-choice \nlaw professor, often mentioned as a possible Supreme Court nominee, was \nconfirmed for the Tenth Circuit. He was not filibustered. Dennis Shedd \nwas confirmed to the Fourth Circuit by a vote of 55 to 44. He could \nhave been filibustered, but he was not filibustered.\n  The idea that the filibuster has been used over the past several \nyears as a tool to block all the nominees that the minority opposed is \nludicrous. There were, and there continue to be, very good reasons to \nblock a certain small number of nominees. Nothing that occurred last \nnight changed that one iota. I will continue to vote against cloture \nonly in extraordinary circumstances. I did that when we voted on \ncloture on the Owen nomination in 2003 and each subsequent time, and I \nhave done that again today. For the majority to have created this \nconstitutional crisis over what came down to five nominees was wrong, \nwas an abuse of power. The American people did not support it, and I do \nnot think they will support it in the future.\n  With respect to the Owen nomination, there are a number of factors \nthat I believe require us to give this nomination very careful \nconsideration. First, we should consider that judges on our courts of \nappeal have an enormous influence on the law. Whereas, decisions of the \ndistrict courts are always subject to appellate review, the decisions \nof the courts of appeals are only subject to discretionary review by \nthe Supreme Court. The decisions of the courts of appeal are, in almost \nall cases, final, as the Supreme Court agrees to hear only a very small \npercentage of the cases on which its views are sought. That means that \nthe scrutiny we give to circuit court nominees must be greater than \nthat we give to district court nominees. And then, of course, the \nscrutiny we give to Supreme Court nominees will even be greater.\n\n  Another important consideration is the ideological balance of the \nFifth Circuit. The Fifth Circuit is comprised of Texas, Louisiana, and \nMississippi. The Fifth Circuit contains the highest percentage of \nminority residents, over 40 percent of any circuit other than the DC \nCircuit. It is a court that, during the civil rights era, issued some \nof the most significant decisions supporting the rights of African-\nAmerican citizens to participate as full members of our society.\n  As someone who believes strongly in freedom, liberty, and equal \njustice under law and the important role of the Federal courts to \ndefend these fundamental American principles, I am especially concerned \nabout the makeup of our circuit courts and their approaches to civil \nrights issues.\n  Even after 8 years of a Democratic President, the Fifth Circuit had \ntwice as many Republican appointees as Democratic appointees. That is \nbecause during the last 6 years of the Clinton administration, the \nJudiciary Committee did not report out a single judge to the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. As we all know, that was not for a lack of \nnominees to consider. President Clinton nominated three well-qualified \nlawyers to the Fifth Circuit--Jorge\n\n[[Page S5834]]\n\nRangel, Enrique Moreno, and Alston Johnson. None of these nominees even \nreceived a hearing before the committee.\n  Then-Chairman Leahy held a hearing in July 2001 on the nomination of \nJudge Edith Brown Clement for a seat on the Fifth Circuit only a few \nmonths after she was nominated and less than 2 months after Democrats \ntook control of the Senate. It was the first hearing in the Judiciary \nCommittee for a Fifth Circuit nominee since September 1994. And Judge \nClement, of course, was confirmed later in the year.\n  The fact is, there is a history here and a special burden on \nPresident Bush to consult with our side on nominees for this circuit; \notherwise, we will be simply rewarding the obstructionism that the \nPresident's party engaged in over the last 6 years of the Clinton \nadministration by allowing him to fill, with his choices, seats that \nhis party held open for years, even when qualified nominees were \nadvanced by President Clinton.\n  I say, once again, my colleagues on the Republican side bear some \nresponsibility for this situation. There was a time when I thought they \nmight help resolve it by urging the administration to address the \nSenate's failure to take up Clinton nominees. This entire controversy \nover judges that has come to a head over the last several weeks could \nhave been avoided if our Republican colleagues had convinced the \nPresident to renominate even a few of those Clinton nominees who never \nreceived a hearing or vote in the committee, including nominees to the \nFifth Circuit. But, of course, that did not happen. There was no effort \nto reach a real compromise to take into account the concerns of all \nparties.\n  A compromise at the point of a gun is not a compromise. That, I'm \nafraid, is what we had last night.\n  With that background, let me outline the concerns that have caused me \nto reach the conclusion that Justice Owen should not be confirmed.\n  Justice Owen has had a successful legal career. She graduated at the \ntop of her class from Baylor University Law School, worked as an \nassociate and partner at the law firm of Andrews and Kurth in Houston, \nand has served on the Texas Supreme Court since January 1995. These are \ngreat accomplishments.\n  But Justice Owen's record as a member of the Texas Supreme Court \nleads me to conclude that she is not the right person for a position on \nthe Fifth Circuit. I am not convinced that Justice Owen will put aside \nher personal views and ensure that all litigants before her on the \nFifth Circuit received a fair hearing. Her decisions in cases involving \nconsumers' rights, worker's rights, and reproductive rights suggest \nthat she would be unable to maintain an open mind and provide all \nlitigants a fair and impartial hearing.\n  Justice Owen has a disturbing record of consistently siding against \nconsumers or victims of personal injury and in favor of business and \ninsurance companies. When the Texas Supreme Court, which is a very \nconservative and pro- business court, rules in favor of consumers or \nvictims of personal injury, Justice Owen frequently dissents. According \nto Texas Watch, during the period 1999 to 2002, Justice Owen dissented \nalmost 40 percent of the time in cases in which a consumer prevailed. \nBut in cases where the consumer position did not succeed, Justice Owen \nnever dissented.\n  At her first hearing, Senator Kennedy and then-Senator Edwards asked \nJustice Owen to cite cases in which she dissented from the majority and \nsided in favor of consumers. Justice Owen could cite only one case, \nSaenz v. Fidelity Guaranty Insurance Underwriters. But Justice Owen's \nopinion in this case hardly took a pro-consumer position since it still \nwould have deprived the plaintiff of the entire jury verdict. She did \nnot join Justice Spector's dissent, which would have upheld the jury \nverdict in favor of Ms. Saenz.\n  Also during that first hearing, Senators Feinstein and Durbin \nquestioned Justice Owen about Provident American Ins. Co. v. Castaneda. \nIn that case, the plaintiff sought damages against a health insurer for \ndenying health care benefits, after the insurer had already provided \npre-operative approval for the surgery. Justice Owen, writing for the \nmajority, reversed the jury's verdict in favor of the plaintiff and \nrejected the plaintiff's claim that the health insurer violated the \nTexas Insurance Code and the Deceptive Trade Practices Act. At the \nhearing, Justice Owen defended her opinion by saying that she believed \nthat the plaintiff was seeking extra-contractual damages and that the \nplaintiff had already received full coverage under the policy and \nstatutory penalties. But, in the words of her colleague, Justice Raul \nGonzalez, who wrote a dissent, Justice Owen's opinion ``may very well \neviscerate the bad-faith tort as a viable case of action in Texas.'' \nThe cause of action for bad faith is designed to deter insurers from \nengaging in bad faith practices like denying coverage in the first \nplace.\n  In addition, with respect to several decisions involving \ninterpretation and application of the Texas parental notification law, \nI am deeply troubled by Justice Owen's apparently ignoring the plain \nmeaning of the statute and injecting her personal beliefs concerning \nabortion that have no basis in Texas or U.S. Supreme Court law. In \n2000, the Texas legislature enacted a parental notification law that \nallows a minor to obtain an abortion without notification of her \nparents if she demonstrates to a court that she has complied with one \nof three ``judicial bypass'' provisions: (1) that she is ``mature and \nsufficiently well informed'' to make the decision without notification \nto either of her parents; (2) that notification would not be in her \nbest interest; or (3) that notification may lead to her physical, \nsexual, or emotional abuse.\n  During Justice Owen's first confirmation hearing, Senator Cantwell \nquestioned Justice Owen about her positions in cases interpreting this \nlaw, focusing on Justice Owen's insistence in In re Jane Doe. In that \ncase, a teenager is required to consider ``philosophic, social, moral, \nand religious'' arguments before seeking an abortion. In her opinion, \nJustice Owen cited the Supreme Court's decision in Planned Parenthood \nof Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey to support her contention that \nStates can require minors to consider religious views in their decision \nto have an abortion. But, as Senator Cantwell noted, Casey in no way \nauthorizes States to require minors to consider religious arguments in \ntheir decision on whether to have an abortion. Upon this further \nquestioning, Justice Owen then said that she was referring to another \nSupreme Court case, H.L. v. Matheson, even though her opinion only \ncited Casey for this proposition. And even Matheson does not say that \nminors can be required by State law to consider religious arguments. It \nis my view that Justice Owen was going beyond not only a plain reading \nof the Texas statute, but Supreme Court case law, and inappropriately \ninjecting her own personal views to make it more difficult for a minor \nto comply with the statute and obtain an abortion.\n  I was also not satisfied with Justice Owen's responses to my \nquestions about bonuses to Texas Supreme Court law clerks. I asked her \nat the hearing whether she saw any ethical concerns with allowing law \nclerks to receive bonuses from their prospective employers during their \nclerkships. I also explored the topic further with her in followup \nwritten questions. Justice Owen stated repeatedly in her written \nresponses to my questions that she is not aware of law clerks actually \nreceiving bonuses while they were employed by the court. She reaffirmed \nthat testimony in her second hearing. This seems implausble given the \ngreat amount of publicity given to Ian investigation pursued by the \nTravis County attorney of exactly that practice and the well publicized \nmodifications to the Texas Supreme Court's rules that resulted from \nthat investigation and the accompanying controversy.\n  Even more disturbing, Justice Owen took the position, both at the \nfirst hearing and in her responses to written questions, that because \nthe Texas Supreme Court Code of Conduct requires law clerks to recuse \nthemselves from matters involving their prospective employers, there \nreally is no ethical concern raised by law clerks accepting bonuses \nwhile employed with the court. I disagree. It is not sufficient for law \nclerks to recuse themselves from matters involving their prospective \nemployers if they have received thousands of dollars in bonuses while \nthey are working for the court. The appearance\n\n[[Page S5835]]\n\nof impropriety and unfairness that such a situation creates is \nuntenable. As I understand it, the Federal courts have long prohibited \nFederal law clerks both from receiving bonuses during their clerkships \nand from working on cases involving their prospective employers. I am \npleased that the Texas Supreme Court finally recognized this ethical \nproblem and changed its code of conduct for clerks. Justice Owen, in \ncontrast, seems intent on defending the prior, indefensible, practice.\n  Finally, I want to note the unusual nature of this particular \nnomination. Unlike so many nominees during the Clinton years, Justice \nOwen was considered in the Judiciary Committee under Senator Leahy's \nleadership in 2002. She had a hearing, and she had a vote. Her \nnomination was rejected. This has been the first time in history that a \ncircuit nominee who was formally rejected by the committee, or the full \nSenate for that matter, has been renominated by the same President to \nthe same position. I do not believe that defeated judicial nominations \nshould be reconsidered like legislation that is not enacted. After all, \nlegislation can be revisited after it is enacted. If Congress makes a \nmistake when it passes a law, it can fix that mistake in subsequent \nlegislation. Let us all remember that judicial appointments are for \nlife. Confirmations cannot be taken back or fixed. A vote to confirm a \nnominee is final. A vote to reject that nominee should be final as \nwell. For the President to renominate a defeated nominee and the Senate \nto reconsider her simply because of the change of a few seats in an \nelection cheapens the nomination process and the Senate's \nconstitutional role in that process.\n  I believe Justice Owen is bright and accomplished, but I sincerely \nbelieve that based on her judicial record, Justice Owen is not the \nright choice for this position.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I discuss the nomination of Priscilla \nOwen to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and to briefly discuss the \ncompromise before us on the so-called nuclear option.\n  I continue to oppose all three of the nominees that will proceed to \nup-or-down votes as the result of this compromise, and I will be voting \nagainst cloture on Priscilla Owen as a result. But I do acknowledge the \nimportance of preserving the process of debating judicial nominees. I \ndo not feel that the filibuster has been misused with regard to \nPresident Bush's nominees, as I'll explain shortly, but I am impressed \nat the efforts of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to avoid the \nall-or-nothing nuclear option vote that threatened to cause us to break \ndown as an institution.\n  I also express my hope that the term ``extraordinary circumstances'' \nthat is in this compromise is interpreted sensibly. When extreme \nnominees threaten the balance of our federal courts, I view those as \nextraordinary circumstances. I will continue to vote to block any \nnominee who is not suitable for the bench, and it will continue to be \nan unusual exception for me not to support a nominee. My standard has \nbeen extraordinary circumstances all along.\n  As a former member of the Judiciary Committee, I attended a hearing \non Priscilla Owen that lasted a full day. During that hearing, Owen's \nrecord showed a particular disregard for precedent and the plain rule \nof law.\n  Anyone who walks into a courtroom as a plaintiff or a defendant in \nthis country should do so having the full confidence that there is \nimpartiality on the part of the judge on the bench. They should have \ntotal confidence that the rule of law will be followed, and believe the \nissues will be judged on their merits rather than viewed through the \nprism of an individual judge's personal values or beliefs.\n  There is reason to be concerned about the record of Priscilla Owen. \nTime after time, even her own Republican colleagues, on a predominantly \nRepublican Texas Supreme Court bench, criticized her for failing to \nfollow precedent or interpreting statutes in ways that ignore the clear \nintent of the law.\n  What some of Owen's colleagues on the bench have said about her \nopinions I think is important. In a case dealing with a developer \nseeking to evade Austin's clean water laws, her dissent was called \n``nothing more than inflammatory rhetoric.''\n  In another case, her statutory interpretation was called \n``unworkable.'' In yet another case, the dissent she joined was called \n``an unconscionable act of judicial activism.''\n  There is another reason this nomination is so important. This is \ncritical to all the nominees we are considering for appointment to the \nFederal bench, and especially important for you here this morning. That \nis, what is the judicial philosophy and commitment to upholding current \nlaw as it relates to a citizen's right to privacy. I asked Justice Owen \nat her hearing about her beliefs on the right to privacy. I asked her \nif she believed there was constitutional right to privacy and where she \nfound that right in the Constitution.\n  She declined at the time to answer that question without the relevant \ncase information and precedents before her. When Senator Feinstein \nfollowed up with a similar question, Owen against would not answer \nwhether she believes a right to privacy does exist within the \nConstitution.\n  The question of whether a nominee believes that the right to privacy \nexists with regard to the ability to make decisions about one's own \nbody is only the tip of the privacy iceberg. I believe that we are in \nan information age that poses new challenges in protecting the right to \nprivacy. We are facing difficult issues including whether U.S. citizens \nhave been treated as enemy combatants in a prison without access to \ncounselor trial by jury, whether businesses have access to some of your \nmost personal information, whether the Government has established a \nprocess for eavesdropping or tracking U.S. citizens without probable \ncause, and whether the Government has the ability to develop new \nsoftware that might track the use of your own computer and places where \nyou might go on the Internet without your consent or knowledge. There \nare a variety of issues that are before us on an individual's right to \nprivacy and how that right to privacy is going to be interpreted. A \nclear understanding of a nominee's willingness to follow precedent on \nprotecting privacy is a very important criterion for me, and it should \nbe a concern for all Members.\n  Of course, some of my concern and skepticism about Justice Owen's \nviews on privacy results from the opinions she wrote in a series of \ncases interpreting the Texas law on parental notification. In 2000 the \nState of Texas passed a law requiring parental notification. But they \nalso included a bypass system for extreme cases.\n  Eleven out of 12 times Owen analyzed whether a minor should be \nentitled to bypass the notice requirement, she voted either to deny the \nbypass or to create greater obstacles to the bypass.\n  Owen wrote in dissent that she would require a minor to demonstrate \nthat she had considered religious issues surrounding the decision and \nthat she had received specific counseling from someone other than a \nphysician, her friend, or her family. Requirements, I believe, that go \nfar beyond what the statute requires.\n  In interpreting the ``best interest'' arm of the statute, Owen held \nthat a minor should be required to demonstrate that the abortion \nitself--not avoiding notification--was in the individual's best \ninterests. In this particular case, I think she went far beyond what \nthe statue required.\n  Where does that put us? Women in this country rely on the right to \nchoose. It is an issue on which we have had 30 years of settled law and \ncase precedent. In the Fifth Circuit, there are three States that \ncontinue to have unconstitutional laws on the books, and legislatures \nthat are hostile to that right to choose. The Federal courts are the \nsole protector of women's right to privacy in these states. I do not \nbelieve that the rights of the women of the Fifth Circuit can be \ntrusted to Justice Priscilla Owen.\n  The Senate provides each of us with the procedural privilege to \nthoroughly discuss my concerns about this nominee--the filibuster. The \nfilibuster has been used against me on issues I care deeply about, just \nas I have used this procedure when it was necessary to protect the \npeople of my state. This body, in which I am so privileged to serve, is \nmore important than any one of us, precisely because even one Senator \ncan stand up for her state in the face of a powerful majority.\n\n[[Page S5836]]\n\n  This agreement, whatever else I might think of it, preserves the \nrights in this body that make it unique and that give it the most \ncredibility. Each of us has to respect the views of the rest. When 40 \nof us stand together, the other 60 must negotiate. That is healthy and \nthat is what happened here. The rules of the Senate, and the existence \nof the Federal judiciary itself, pose proper checks on majority and \nPresidential power. That is the way it should stay.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to respond to a statement that the \nSenior Senator from West Virginia made yesterday. In his remarks, the \nSenator conceded the legitimacy of the constitutional option, what he \ncalled the ``nuclear option,'' as a way for the Senate to determine its \npractices and procedures. The option is, of course, the leader's right \nto obtain a ruling from the presiding officer that certain actions of \nSenators are dilatory and cannot preclude the Senate from voting on a \njudicial nomination.\n  Here is what he said: ``The so-called nuclear option has been around \nfor a long time. It doesn't take a genius to figure that out.'' He went \non to explain that this constitutional option had been available since \nat least 1917, and he repeatedly emphasized that this tool has been \naround ``for a long time.''\n  I appreciate this acknowledgment from the Senator from West Virginia, \nbecause I know he has studied the history of the Senate, and I know he \nhas intimate familiarity with the workings of the Constitutional \nOption. There is nothing new about the constitutional option, as I \ndiscussed in my May 19 floor speech outlining the legal and \nconstitutional rationale for its exercise. The constitutional option is \nsimply the Senate's exercise of its power to define its own \nprocedures--a power that comes directly from the Constitution and has \nbeen affirmed by the Supreme Court. (U.S. v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1 (1892)) \nI appreciate that the Senator has acknowledged its legitimacy.\n  The Senator from West Virginia also argued, however, that past \nmajority leaders have never used the constitutional option to \n``tamper'' with extended debate. As my May 19 statement established, as \ndid yesterday's statements by Senators McConnell, Hatch, and Bennett, \nthat is not actually the case.\n  The fact is that the Senator himself used the constitutional option \nfour times when serving as majority leader--in one case to outright \neliminate the filibuster for motions to proceed to Executive Calendar \nnominations. Moreover, in February 1979, he forced the minority to \nagree to a formal rules change after credibly threatening that he would \nexercise the constitutional option. At that time, the Senator said on \nthis floor, ``if I have to be forced into a corner to try for a \nmajority vote, I will do it because I am going to do my duty as I see \nmy duty, whether I win or lose.''\n  The Senate was nearly forced into a similar ``corner'' this week. Had \nDemocrats not supported cloture on Priscilla Owen today, then all \nSenators would have had to make a conclusive decision as to whether it \nshould take 60 or 51 votes to confirm a judge. Instead, we are putting \noff that decision until another day.\n  That may still come. And if it does come, I hope that we hear no more \ntalk of the ``illegitimacy'' of the constitutional option. There is \nplenty to discuss as to whether exercising the option is prudential in \na particular case. Some of the debate these past few days has addressed \nthat prudential question, including some of the discussion from the \nSenator from West Virginia. But there has also been talk about the \nconstitutional option being a case of ``lawlessness'' or ``breaking the \nrules to change the rules.'' The constitutional option is a part of \nSenate history. In Senator Byrd's words, it ``has been around for a \nlong time.''\n  And it will always be with us. The constitutional option is not, as \nthe minority leader has repeatedly insisted, ``off the table.'' It is \nsimply unnecessary at present. If it becomes necessary again, we may be \ncalled on to live up to our responsibilities to the Constitution and to \nthe Senate to ensure that we restore our traditions and guarantee up-\nor-down votes to all judicial nominees who reach the Senate floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, at various times during the course of \ndebate in recent days over the nomination of Justice Priscilla Owen, a \nnumber of her previous rulings have been badly mischaracterized. Last \nThursday, May 19, I rose to speak about a number of those cases and to \ncorrect the record. And just this morning, I published an op-ed in \nNational Review Online to further rebut these baseless criticisms. I \nask unanimous consent that an excerpt of that op-ed be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       It is now conceded that Justice Owen, Justice Brown, and \n     Judge Pryor all deserve up-or-down votes. I happen to know \n     personally that the case against Justice Owen was especially \n     weak, because I know Priscilla personally from our service \n     together on the Texas supreme court. Just consider the \n     following litany of supposedly ``out of the mainstream'' \n     rulings for which she was criticized:\n       A number of senators criticized Justice Owen's opinion in \n     Montgomery Independent School District v. Davis. One senator \n     specifically attacked her for failing to protect a teacher \n     who was ``wrongly dismissed.'' The case involved the \n     authority of a local school board to dismiss a poorly \n     performing and abusive teacher. The teacher had admitted that \n     she had referred to her students as ``little s***s.'' When \n     confronted, the teacher justified the use of the expletive on \n     the bizarre ground that she used exactly the same language \n     when talking to her own children. The teacher regularly \n     insulted parents as well. The opinion joined by Justice Owen \n     concluded that the school board was authorized to dismiss \n     this teacher. It noted that the majority's ruling ``allows a \n     state hearing examiner to make policy decisions that the \n     Legislature intended local school boards to make,'' and that \n     the majority had ``misinterpreted the Education Code.''\n       One senator attacked Justice Owen for her opinion in Texas \n     Farmers Insurance Co. v. Murphy. In this case, Justice Owen \n     simply joined an opinion holding that neither an arsonist nor \n     his spouse should benefit from his crime by recovering \n     insurance proceeds. The opinion followed two unanimous \n     decisions of the Fifth Circuit, the very court to which \n     Justice Owen has been nominated.\n       Justice Owen was also criticized for a ruling she and I \n     both joined in Peeler v. Hughes & Luce and Darrell C. \n     Jordan--in which we simply held that an admitted criminal \n     could not benefit from criminal activity by suing the \n     criminal-defense attorney for malpractice.\n       A number of senators focused on Justice Owen's opinion in \n     FM Properties Operating Co. v. City of Austin. One senator \n     specifically criticized her for refusing to rule that a Texas \n     water law ``was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative \n     authority.'' Yet liberal attorneys regularly criticize the \n     nondelegation doctrine and claim that conservatives wrongly \n     use it to invalidate laws duly enacted by the legislature. In \n     fact, just last month one senator criticized another nominee, \n     Bill Pryor, for championing the nondelegation doctrine. So \n     Justice Owen's critics seem to argue that if you support the \n     nondelegation doctrine, you are out of the mainstream, and \n     that if you oppose the nondelegation doctrine, you are out of \n     the mainstream. It reminds me of a country-western song: \n     ``Darned If I Don't, Danged If I Do.''\n       One senator claimed that, in Read v. Scott Fetzer Co., \n     Justice Owen ruled that a woman raped by a vacuum-cleaner \n     salesman could not sue the company that had employed him \n     after failing to undertake a standard background check--an \n     allegation recently articulated in an op-ed in Roll Call. Yet \n     as my letter to the editor noted, that allegation is plainly \n     false. As the opinion joined by Justice Owen noted, ``[n]o \n     one questions that [the company that had hired the rapist] is \n     liable.'' The justices simply disagreed on whether another \n     company--one that had not hired the rapist and had no \n     relationship with the rapist--should also have been held \n     liable.\n       Justice Owen was also criticized for her ruling in Hyundai \n     Motor Co. v. Alvarado. In that case, an automobile alleged to \n     be defective had in fact fully satisfied the federal standard \n     then in effect. The plaintiff chose to sue anyway, despite \n     federal law. Justice Owen simply held that Congress had \n     forbidden such lawsuits once the federal standard had been \n     met--a technical legal doctrine known as federal preemption. \n     For this, she was sharply criticized. Yet her opinion simply \n     followed the ``solid majority of the courts to consider this \n     issue''--including precedents authored by judges appointed by \n     President Jimmy Carter. Moreover, the U.S. Supreme Court \n     later adopted Justice Owen's approach (Geier v. American \n     Honda Motor Co., Inc.), in an opinion authored by Clinton \n     appointee, and former Democrat chief counsel of the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee, Justice Stephen Breyer.\n       Justice Owen was likewise criticized for her rulings in \n     Quantum Chemical Corp. v. Toennies, a case involving a Texas \n     civil-rights law expressly modeled after Title VII of the \n     federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, and City of Garland v. \n     Dallas Morning News, a Texas open-government law modeled \n     after the federal Freedom of Information Act. Once again, all \n     she did was follow precedents adopted by appointees of \n     Presidents Carter and Clinton.\n       Justice Owen and I happened to disagree in Weiner v. \n     Wasson, a case involving a technical matter of applying a \n     statute of limitations to a medical malpractice suit. One \n     senator argued that my opinion was ``a lecture\n\n[[Page S5837]]\n\n     to the dissent'' about the importance of stare decisis and \n     following precedent. The argument is baseless. In fact, \n     Justice Owen didn't try to overturn precedent in that case; \n     only the defendant did. Moreover, Justice Owen's ruling \n     contained an equally emphatic ``lecture'' to the defendant \n     about the importance of following precedent.\n       And of course, there were the now-famous cases involving \n     the popular Texas parental-notification law--a parental-\n     rights law that generally requires minors to notify one \n     parent before obtaining an abortion. Readers should ask \n     themselves one simple question: Who would you trust to \n     analyze and determine the quality of Justice Owen's legal \n     analysis in those cases? The author of the Texas law--who \n     supports Owen? Her former colleagues on the court, including \n     former Justices Alberto Gonzales and Greg Abbott, who support \n     her? Now-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who has \n     testified--under oath--that he supports Justice Owen and \n     that, contrary to false reports, he never accused her of \n     ``judicial activism''? The pro-choice Democrat law professor \n     appointed by the Texas supreme court to set up procedures \n     under the statute--who supports Owen, and who has written: \n     ``If this is activism, then any judicial interpretation of a \n     statute's terms is judicial activism''? Or do you trust the \n     liberal special-interest groups who sharply opposed the Texas \n     law, and never wanted that law to be enacted in the first \n     place? Or the groups who literally make a living destroying \n     the reputation of this president's nominees?\n       The attacks on these rulings by Justice Owen reminded me of \n     what Mark Twain once said: ``A lie can travel halfway around \n     the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes.'' \n     But let's keep our eye on the ball. The American people know \n     a controversial ruling when they see one--whether it's the \n     redefinition of marriage, or the expulsion of the Pledge of \n     Allegiance and other expressions of faith from the public \n     square--whether it's the elimination of the three-strikes-\n     and-you're out law and other penalties against convicted \n     criminals, or the forced removal of military recruiters from \n     college campuses. Justice Owen's rulings fall nowhere near \n     this category of cases. There is a world of difference \n     between struggling to interpret the ambiguous expressions of \n     a legislature, and refusing to obey a legislature's \n     directives altogether.\n       Thankfully, the Senate has now effectively acknowledged \n     this important distinction, by guaranteeing Justice Owen an \n     up-or-down vote after four long years.\n\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. What is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate business is the nomination of \nPriscilla Owen to be United States Circuit Court Judge.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to speak as in \nmorning business for such time as I consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             GLOBAL WARMING\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, over the past few weeks, I have debunked \nthe notion of scientific consensus about global warming. The claim \nthere is consensus rests on four fundamental pillars. My previous talks \nmade clear that the first three pillars are made of sand.\n  It is not true, for example, that the National Academy of Sciences \nbelieves the science of climate change is settled. In fact, the report \nis replete with caveats, warning the reader of the many uncertainties \nassociated with claims of global warming. Yet advocates continue to \nrecite small excerpts while ignoring the caution about uncertainties \ncontained within the same paragraph or even the same science.\n  It is also not true that the second pillar, the U.N. science report \nknown as the IPCC, proves a consensus. The flagship study on which the \nIPCC report relies, known as the hockey stick, which shows an \nunprecedented rise in 20th century temperatures, has been thoroughly \ndiscredited by scientists on both sides of the debate. In fact, \nrecently, and since 1999, there hasn't been anyone who has agreed there \nis authenticity to the issue. In addition, the U.N. report relies on an \nexplosive increase in emissions from poor countries over the next \ncentury based on the political decision by the report's author that \ncountries such as Algeria will be as wealthy or wealthier than the \nUnited States.\n  The third pillar, supposedly proving that the science is settled that \nthe Arctic is melting, is based on political science. Arctic \ntemperatures are no warmer than they were in the 1930s. Similarly, the \nthickness of the Arctic glaciers and the sea ice appears to vary \nnaturally by as much as 16 percent annually.\n  These and other factors which the alarmists find inconvenient would \nseem to indicate that projections of an Arctic climate catastrophe are \nspeculative, at best.\n  Today I conclude the series on the four pillars of climate alarmists \nby discussing the problems associated with global climate models.\n  Let me begin by briefly explaining the climate models and how they \nfunction. Climate models help scientists describe changes in the \nclimate system. They are not models in the conventional sense; that is, \nthey are not physical replicas. Rather, they are mathematical \nrepresentations of the physical laws and processes that govern the \nEarth's climate. According to Dr. David Legates of the University of \nDelaware, climate models ``are designed to be descriptions of the full \nthree-dimensional destruction of the earth's climate.'' Dr. Legates \nclaims models are used ``in a variety of applications, including the \ninvestigation of the possible role of various climate forcing \nmechanisms and the simulation of past and future climates.''\n  Thousands of climate changes studied rely on computer models. The \nArctic Council, whose work I addressed last week, stated that arctic \nwarming and the impact stemming from that warming are firmly \nestablished by computer models.\n  Quoting from him:\n\n       While the models differ in their projections of some of the \n     features of climate change, they are all in agreement that \n     the world will warm significantly as a result of human \n     activities, and that the Arctic is likely to experience \n     noticeable warming, particularly early and intensely.\n\n  Similarly, the IPCC, which I also discussed in the earlier talks, \nrelied on such earlier models to project a long-term temperature \nincrease ranging from 2.5 to 10.4 degrees Celsius and assorted and \npotentially dangerous climate changes over the next century.\n  According to Dr. Kenneth Green, Dr. Tim Ball, and Dr. Steven \nSchroeder, the politicians clearly do not realize that the major \nconclusions of the IPCC's reports are not based on hard evidence and \nobservation but, rather, largely upon the output of assumption-driven \nclimate models.\n  The alarmists cite the results of climate models as proof of the \ncatastrophic warming hypotheses. Consider one alarmist's description, \nwho wrote recently:\n\n       Drawing on highly sophisticated computer models, climate \n     scientists can project, not predict, how much temperatures \n     may rise by say 2100 if we carry on with business as usual.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       Although scenarios vary, some get pretty severe, and so do \n     the projected impacts of climate change, rising sea levels, \n     species extensions, glacier melting and so forth.\n\n  It sounds pretty scary, but the statement is completely false. It \nsheds no light on the likelihood or reliability of such projections. \nIf, for example, a model shows a significant temperature increase over \nthe next 50 years, how much confidence do we have in that projection? \nAttaching probabilities to model results is extremely difficult and \nrife with uncertainties.\n  In the 2000 edition of ``Nature,'' four climate modelers noted that:\n\n       A basic problem with all such predictions to date has been \n     the difficulty of providing any systematic estimate of \n     uncertainty.\n\n  This problem stems from the fact that:\n\n       These [climate] models do not necessarily span the full \n     range of known climate system behavior.\n\n  According to the National Academy of Sciences:\n\n     . . . without an understanding of the sources and degree of \n     uncertainty, decision-makers could fail to define the best \n     ways to deal with the serious issue of global warming.\n\n  This fact should temper the enthusiasm of those who support Kyoto-\nstyle regulations that will harm the American economy.\n  Previously, we have talked about the harm to the economy and have \nreferred to the Wharton Econometric Survey which was conducted by the \nWharton School of Economics. It gets into a lot of detail as to what is \ngoing to happen.\n\n[[Page S5838]]\n\nFor example, to comply with Kyoto, it would cost the average family of \nfour some $2,700 a year. So it is a very significant thing.\n  Now note, too, the distinction between ``project'' and ``predict.'' \nThe alarmist writer noted earlier creates the misimpression that a \nprojection is more solid than a prediction. But a projection is the \noutput of a model calculation. Put another way, it is only as good as \nthe model's equations and inputs. As we will see later in this \npresentation, such inputs or assumptions about the future can be \nextremely flawed, if not totally divorced from reality. And this, to be \nsure, is only one of the many technical shortcomings that limit the \nscientific validity of climate modeling.\n  Unfortunately, rarely does any scrutiny accompany model simulations. \nBut based on what we know about the physics of climate models, as well \nas the questionable assumptions built into the models themselves, we \nshould be very skeptical of their results. This is exactly the view of \nthe National Academy of Sciences. According to the NAS:\n\n       Climate models are imperfect. Their simulation skill is \n     limited by uncertainties in their formulation, the limited \n     size of their calculations, and the difficulty of \n     interpreting their answers that exhibit as much complexity as \n     in nature.\n\n  At this point, climate modeling is still a very rudimentary science. \nAs Richard Kerr wrote in Science magazine:\n\n       Climate forecasting, after all, is still in its infancy.\n\n  Models, while helpful for scientists in understanding the climate \nsystem, are far from perfect. According to climatologist Gerald North \nof Texas A University:\n\n       It's extremely hard to tell whether the models have \n     improved; the uncertainties are large.\n\n  Or as climate modeler Peter Stone of the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology put it:\n\n       The major [climate prediction] uncertainties have not been \n     reduced at all.\n\n  Based on these uncertainties, cloud physicist Robert Charlson, \nprofessor emeritus at the University of Washington-Seattle, has \nconcluded:\n\n       To make it sound like we understand climate is not right.\n\n  This is not to deny that climate modeling has improved over the last \nthree decades. Indeed, scientists have constructed models that more \naccurately reflect the real world. In the 1970s, models were capable \nonly of describing the atmosphere, while over the last few years models \ncan describe, albeit inadequately, the atmosphere, land surface, \noceans, sea ice, and other variables.\n  But greater complexity does not mean more accurate results. In fact, \nthe more variables scientists incorporate, the more uncertainties \narise. Dr. Syukuro Manabe, who helped create the first climate model \nthat coupled the atmosphere and oceans, has observed:\n\n       Models that incorporate everything from dust to vegetation \n     may look like the real world, but the error range associated \n     with the addition of each new variable could result in near \n     total uncertainty. This would represent a paradox: The more \n     complex the models, the less we know.\n\n  We are often reminded that the IPCC used sophisticated modeling \ntechniques in projecting temperature increases for the coming century. \nBut as William O'Keefe and Jeff Kueter of the George C. Marshall \nInstitute pointed out in a recent paper:\n\n       The complex models envisioned by the IPCC have many more \n     than twenty inputs, and many of those inputs will be known \n     with much less than 90 percent confidence.\n\n  Also, tinkering with climate variables is a delicate business--\ngetting one variable wrong can greatly skew model results. Dr. David \nLegates has noted that:\n\n       Anything you do wrong in a climate model will adversely \n     affect the simulation of every other variable.\n\n  Take precipitation, for example. As Dr. Legates noted:\n\n       Precipitation requires moisture in the atmosphere and a \n     mechanism to cause it to condense (causing the air to rise \n     over mountains, by surface heating, as a result of weather \n     fronts, or by cyclonic rotation). Any errors in representing \n     the atmospheric moisture content or precipitation-causing \n     mechanisms will result in errors in the simulation of \n     precipitation.\n\n  Dr. Legates concluded:\n\n       Clearly, the interrelationships among the various \n     components that comprise the climate system make climate \n     modeling difficult.\n\n  The IPCC, in its Third Assessment Report, noted this problem, and \nmany others, with climate modeling, including--this is a quote from \ntheir report; the very basis that many of the alarmists are basing \ntheir decisions on:\n\n       Discrepancies between the vertical profile of temperature \n     change in the troposphere seen in observations and models.\n       Large uncertainties in estimates of internal climate \n     variability (also referred to as natural climate variability) \n     from models and observations.\n       Considerable uncertainty in the reconstructions of solar \n     and volcanic forcing which are based on limited observational \n     data for all but the last two decades.\n       Large uncertainties in anthropogenic forcings associated \n     with the effects of aerosols.\n       Large differences in the response of different models to \n     the same forcing.\n\n  I want to delve a little deeper into the first point concerning the \ndiscrepancies between temperature observations in the troposphere and \nthe surface. This discrepancy is very important because it tends to \nundermine a key assumption supporting the warming hypothesis--that more \nrapid warming should occur in the troposphere than at the surface, \ncreating the so-called greenhouse ``fingerprint.'' But the National \nResearch Council believes real-world temperature observations tell a \ndifferent story.\n  In January of 2000, the NRC panel examined the output from several \nclimate models to assess how well they mimicked the observed surface \nand lower atmospheric temperature trends. They found that:\n\n       Although climate models indicate that changes in greenhouse \n     gases and aerosols play a significant role in defining the \n     vertical structure of the observed atmosphere, model-\n     observation discrepancies indicate that the definitive \n     model experiments have not been done.\n\n  John Wallace, the panel chairman and professor of atmospheric \nsciences at the University of Washington, put it more bluntly. He said:\n\n       There really is a difference between temperatures at the \n     two levels that we don't fully understand.\n\n  More recently, researchers at the University of Colorado, Colorado \nState University, and the University of Arizona, examined the \ndifferences between real-world temperature observations with the \nresults of four widely used climate models. They probed the following \nquestion: Do the differences stem from uncertainties in how greenhouse \ngases and other variables affect the climate system or by chance model \nfluctuations; that is, the variability caused by the model's flawed \nrepresentation of the climate system?\n  As it turned out, neither of these factors was to blame. According to \nthe researchers:\n\n       Significant errors in the simulation of globally averaged \n     tropospheric temperature structure indicate likely errors in \n     tropospheric water-vapor content and therefore total \n     greenhouse-gas forcing, precipitable water, and convectively \n     forced large-scale circulation.\n\n  Moreover, based on the ``significant errors of simulation,'' the \nresearchers called for ``extreme caution in applying simulation results \nto future climate-change assessment activities and to attributions \nstudies.\n  They also questioned ``the predictive ability of recent generation \nmodel simulations, the most rigorous test of any hypothesis.''\n  There does not seem to be much wiggle room here: Climate models are \nuseful tools, but unable, in important respects, to simulate the \nclimate system, undermining their ``predictive ability.''\n  Based on this hard fact, let me bring you back to the alarmist writer \nI referenced earlier. As he wrote recently:\n\n       Drawing on highly sophisticated computer models, climate \n     scientists can project--not predict--how much temperature may \n     rise by, say, 2100, if we carry on with business as usual.\n\n  Again, based on what I have just recounted, this is disingenuous at \nbest. I think a fairminded person would find it horribly misleading and \ninaccurate.\n  Another serious model limitation concerns the interaction of clouds \nand water vapor with the climate system.\n  Dr. Richard S. Lindzen, professor of meteorology at MIT, reports of \n``terrible errors about clouds in all the\n\n[[Page S5839]]\n\nmodels.'' He noted that these errors ``make it impossible to predict \nthe climate sensitivity because the sensitivity of the models depends \nprimarily on water vapor and clouds. Moreover, if clouds are wrong,'' \nDr. Lindzen said, ``there's no way you can get water vapor right. \nThey're both intimately tied to each other.''\n  In fact, water vapor and clouds are the main absorbers of infrared \nradiation in the atmosphere. Even if all other greenhouse gases, \nincluding carbon dioxide, were to disappear, we would still be left \nwith over 98 percent of the current greenhouse effect. But according to \nDr. Lindzen, ``the way current models handle factors such as clouds and \nwater vapor is disturbingly arbitrary. In many instances the underlying \nphysics is simply not known.''\n  Dr. Lindzen notes that this is a significant flaw, because ``a small \nchange in cloud cover can strongly affect the response to carbon \ndioxide.'' He further notes, ``Current models all predict that warmer \nclimates will be accompanied by increasing humidity at all levels.'' \nSuch behavior ``is an artifact of the models since they have neither \nthe physics nor the numerical accuracy to deal with water vapor.''\n  I think sometimes you have to look at the science and the \ncontradictions, and even if we don't thoroughly understand what these \npeople are saying, the fact is, they contradict each other. Sometimes \nyou have to go back and look at reality. If they say the increase in \nthe use of carbon dioxide and the presence of it is the major thing \ncausing anthropogenic gases and global warming temperatures, look at \nwhat happened right after the war. After the war, they increased the \nuse of CO2 by 85 percent. You would think that would \nprecipitate a warmer period, but it didn't. It precipitated a cooling \nperiod. When you get back to the arguments and discrepancies, they \nagree there are problems.\n  Along with water vapor and clouds, aerosols, or particles from \nprocesses such as dust storms, forest fires, the use of fossil fuels, \nand volcanic eruptions, represent another major uncertainty in climate \nmodeling. To be sure, there is limited knowledge of how aerosols \ninfluence the climate system. This, said the National Academy of \nSciences, represents ``a large source of uncertainty about future \nclimate change.''\n  Further, the Strategic Plan of the U.S. Climate Change Science \nProgram, CCSP, which was reviewed and endorsed by the National Research \nCouncil, concluded that the ``poorly understood impact of aerosols on \nthe formation of both water droplets and ice crystals in clouds also \nresults in large uncertainties in the ability to project climate \nchanges.''\n  Climate researcher and IPCC reviewer Dr. Vincent Gray reached an even \nstronger conclusion, stating that ``the effects of aerosols, and their \nuncertainties, are such as to nullify completely the reliability of any \nclimate models.''\n  Another issue affecting model reliability is the relative lack of \navailable climate data, something the National Research Council \naddressed in 2001. According to the NRC, ``[a] major limitation of \nthese model forecasts for use around the world is the paucity of data \navailable to evaluate the ability of coupled models to simulate \nimportant aspects of past climate.''\n  There is plenty of evidence to support this conclusion. Consider, for \nexample, that most of the surface temperature record covers less than \n50 years and only a few stations are as much as 100 years old. The only \nreliable data come from earth-orbiting satellites that survey the \nentire atmosphere. Notably, while these temperature measurements agree \nwith those taken by weather balloons, they disagree considerably with \nthe surface record.\n  There is also concern of an upward bias in the surface temperature \nrecord, caused by the ``urban heat island effect.'' Most meteorological \nstations in Western Europe and eastern North America are located at \nairports on the edge of cities, which have been enveloped by urban \nexpansion. In the May 30, 2003, issue of Remote Sensing of Environment, \nDavid Streutker, a Rice University researcher, found an increase in the \nHouston urban heat island effect of nearly a full degree Celsius \nbetween 1987 and 1999. This study confirmed research published in the \nMarch 2001 issue of Australian Meteorological Magazine, which \ndocumented a significant heat island effect even in small towns.\n  Although climate modelers have made adjustments to compensate for the \nurban heat island effect, other researchers have shown such adjustments \nare inadequate. University of Maryland researchers Eugenia Kalnay and \nMing Cai, in Nature magazine, concluded that the effect of urbanization \nand land-use changes on U.S. average temperatures is at least twice as \nlarge as previously estimated.\n  Finally, to expand on a point I raised earlier, climate models are \nhelpful in creating so-called ``climate scenarios.'' These scenarios \nhelp scientists describe how the climate system might evolve. To arrive \nat a particular scenario, scientists rely on model-driven assumptions \nabout future levels of economic growth, population growth, greenhouse \ngas emissions, and other factors. However, as with the IPCC, these \nassumptions can create wildly exaggerated scenarios that, to put it \nmildly, have little scientific merit. In 2003, scientists with the \nFederal Climate Change Science Program agreed that potential \nenvironmental, economic, and technological developments ``are \nunpredictable over the long time-scales relevant for climate \nresearch.''\n  William O'Keefe and Jeff Keuter of the George C. Marshall Institute \nreiterated this point recently. As they wrote, ``The inputs needed to \nproject climate for the next 100 years, as is typically attempted, are \nunknowable. Human emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols will be \ndetermined by the rates of population and economic growth and \ntechnological change. Neither of these is predictable for more than a \nshort period into the future.''\n  Put simply, computer model simulations cannot prove that greenhouse \ngas emissions will cause catastrophic global warming. Again, here's the \nNational Academy of Sciences: ``The fact that the magnitude of the \nobserved warming is large in comparison to natural variability as \nsimulated in climate models is suggestive of such a linkage, but it \ndoes not constitute proof of one because--and this is a point I want to \nemphasize--the model simulations could be deficient in natural \nvariability on the decadal to century time scale.''\n  It's clear that climate models, even with increasing levels of \nsophistication, still contain a number of critical shortcomings. With \nthat in mind, policymakers should reject ridiculous statements that \nessentially equate climate model runs with scientific truth.\n  As I discussed today, climate modeling is in its infancy. It cannot \npredict future temperatures with reasonable certainty that these \npredictions are accurate. The physical world is exceedingly complex, \nand the more complex the models, the more potential errors are \nintroduced into the models. We understand little about how to \naccurately model the troposphere and about the role of aerosols, clouds \nand water vapor. Moreover, there are enormous data gaps in the very \nshort temperature records that we have. And surface data often conflict \nwith more accurate balloon and satellite data.\n  Models can enhance scientists' understanding of the climate system, \nbut, at least at this point, cannot possibly serve as a rational basis \nfor policymaking. It seems foolish in the extreme to undermine \nAmerica's economic competitiveness with policies based on computer \nprojections about what the world will look like in 100 years. In short, \nwe have no idea what the world will look like in 20 years, or even 10 \nyears.\n  So this concludes the fourth of the pillars of climate alarmists, \nhopefully just to show the science is flawed.\n  I think it is clear, as I mentioned a minute ago, that the science is \nnot there. Since 1999, the old argument of Michael Mann, the guy who \ninvented the hockey-stick theory, where he was measuring the Earth's \ntemperatures, we come into the 20th century--and that is the blade on \nthe hockey stick--he intentionally left out the fact that between the \nyears 700 A.D. and 1100 A.D., there is another blade on the hockey \nstick that went up the other way and temperatures were warmer than they \nare today.\n  If you read the Wharton Econometrics Survey, you will realize what \nwill happen to America if we were to\n\n[[Page S5840]]\n\nsign on to this, the economic damage we would have to sustain, the fact \nit would double the cost of energy, double the cost of gasoline to run \nour cars, and it would cost the average American family $2,700, and you \nhave to ask the question: If the science is not real and it would \ninflict that much danger, what is the reason we are doing it?\n  I think we can find the answer in quoting from Margot Wallstrom. \nMargot Wallstrom is the European Union's Environment Commissioner. She \nstates that Kyoto is not about climate change, it is ``about leveling \nthe playing field for big businesses worldwide.''\n  One of your favorite people, I am sure, French President Jacques \nChirac, in a speech during The Hague in 2000, said that Kyoto \nrepresents ``the first component of an authentic global governance.''\n  I think we have had an opportunity to discuss this over and over, and \nit is somewhat warming to me to realize that things are not getting \nthat much warmer, and if that is happening, the science is not showing \nit is due to anthropogenic gases.\n  Consequently, we as policymakers, have to look at this and be sure \nbefore we make any rash decisions that the science is there. Clearly, \nthe science is not there.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Stem Cell Research\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the House of Representatives just minutes \nago took a historic stand on behalf of the millions of Americans who \ncan benefit from the enormous promise of stem cell research. By a vote \nof 238 yeas to 194 nays, the House passed H.R. 810. I congratulate both \nCongressman Castle, a Republican from Delaware, and Congresswoman \nDeGette, a Democrat from Colorado, who led a bipartisan effort in this \nregard to have this very historic vote in the House of Representatives.\n  Indeed, a bipartisan majority rejected the restrictive policies of \nthis administration and voted to expand the number of stem cell lines \nthat are eligible for federally funded research. In doing so, they have \nbrought new hope to Americans who suffer from diseases such as \nParkinson's and juvenile diabetes, ALS, as well as spinal cord \ninjuries.\n  Now it is up to us in the Senate to pass the same bill without \namendments so we can send it to the President's desk as soon as \npossible. The American people cannot afford to wait any longer for our \ntop scientists to realize the full potential of stem cell research.\n\n  Regrettably, research has been stymied and slowed under the \nPresident's stem cell policy. When President Bush announced his policy, \nthe administration said that 78 stem cells lines were eligible for \nfederally funded research, meaning they had to be derived before the \ntotally arbitrary date and time of August 9, 2001, at 9 p.m. Why it was \npermissible to use stem cell lines derived before 9 p.m. but not at \n9:01 or 9:05 p.m. has always eluded me. Again, it is just an arbitrary \ntime and date.\n  The administration said there were 78 stem cell lines, but now we \nknow today that only 22 of those are available for research, not nearly \nenough to reflect the genetic diversity that scientists need. But more \nimportantly, all 22 stem cell lines--all 22--that are available under \nthe President's policy are contaminated with mouse feeder cells, making \nthem useless for humans.\n  So the President's policy is not a way forward; it is, indeed, a \ndead-end street. It offers only false hope to the millions of people \nacross this country who are suffering from diseases that could be \npotentially cured or treated through stem cell research.\n  We need a policy that offers true, meaningful hope to these patients \nand their loved ones. That is why Senator Specter and I, along with \nSenators Hatch, Feinstein, Smith, and Kennedy, introduced a companion \nbill to the Castle-DeGette legislation that just passed the House. Our \nbill expands the number of stem cell lines that federally funded \nscientists can study by lifting the arbitrary eligibility date of \nAugust 9, 2001.\n  Under our legislation, all stem cell lines would be eligible for \nFederal research regardless of the date they were derived, as long as \nthey met strict ethical requirements.\n  Since August of 2001, scientists have made great strides and great \nadvances in deriving stem cell lines. Many of the new lines were grown \nwithout mouse feeder cells. So I ask, should not our top scientists be \nstudying those lines that have great potential and which could be used \nto alleviate human suffering, instead of being limited to the 22 cell \nlines contaminated with mouse cells that will never be used in humans?\n  We do not require our astronomers to explore the heavens with 19th \ncentury telescopes. We do not require our geologists to study the Earth \nwith a tape measure. If we are serious about realizing the promise of \nstem cell research, our biomedical researchers need access to the best \nstem cell lines available.\n  I also emphasize that none of the additional lines would require the \ncreation of any new embryos. Instead, these lines could be derived from \nany of the more than 400,000 embryos that remain from fertility \ntreatments and will otherwise be discarded. We are talking about \nembryos that are going to be thrown away, legally. Should we not use \nthem instead to ease human suffering?\n  Think about this: We have 400,000 frozen embryos left over from in \nvitro fertilization. When a woman who has been a donor of these eggs \nnotifies that they are no longer wanted, that she is not going to use \nthem--maybe she has already had a child or two and does not need these \nembryos--that person can give permission to discard them. Why should \nthat person not be able to give permission to allow them to be used by \nour top scientists for stem cell research that could then save other \nlives? That is what some people are asking us to do--just throw them \naway, do not let them be used for research that could save human \nsuffering and save human lives. To this Senator, that simply does not \nmake any sense.\n  So as I said, we have strict ethical guidelines that are set up so \nthat they cannot be used for cloning, they cannot be used for other \nthings; only to derive the stem cells. That is all. If there is a \nperson who can give the authority right now to the in vitro \nfertilization clinic to discard them, why should that person not have \nthe right to say, No, use those frozen embryos to derive stem cells so \nthat someone with a spinal cord injury might walk again, so that \nsomeone with ALS can escape the death sentence, so that someone with \nParkinson's can be returned to normal functioning?\n  The House performed a great public service today. I thank both sides \nof the aisle, Republicans and Democrats, who stepped up and voted for \nthis bill. By passing the Castle-DeGette bill, they have given hope to \nmillions of suffering humans that we will indeed proceed with stem cell \nresearch that will alleviate their suffering. It is now time for the \nSenate to act.\n  So together with Senator Specter, we are going to urge the majority \nleader to bring up the bill as soon as possible and let us have a vote \nin the Senate and get this bill to the President so we can move ahead \nwith embryonic stem cell research in this country.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to pay tribute to an \nexceptional young man who gave his life in the defense of freedom. \nMarine Cpl Todd Godwin, from Zanesville, OH, died on July 20, 2004, \nwhen the Humvee he was riding in was struck by shrapnel from a roadside \nexplosive in the Al Anbar province in Iraq. He was 21 years old.\n  CPL Godwin was a sniper with the 1st Battalion, 8th Marines, 2nd \nMarine Division and was on his second tour-of-duty in Iraq. Always \nready with a smile or a joke, Todd was an easy going, respectful person \nwith a big heart. He was also a Marine through and through--something \nhe took very seriously--something he had been training for his whole \nlife.\n  Born on March 4, 1983, to Bill and Kathy Godwin, Todd was an alert, \nenergetic child who grew up with an interest in the military. His \nfather remembers him playing with G.I. Joes, wearing fatigues, and \nsimulating wars. According to his brother, Aaron, the two boys would \nhang dolls outside and shoot at them with a BB gun, honing their \ntargeting skills.\n  Apart from these activities, Todd sought to perfect his body. He \ncould often be found working out at ``the Fieldhouse'' fitness center \nor practicing his Tae Kwon Do, for which he received two black-belts. \nWhether intentional or not, Todd seemed to be grooming himself for the \nmilitary, acquiring a host of skills that would serve him well in the \nMarines.\n  After graduating from Zanesville Christian School in June 2001, he \njoined the Marines. His high school principal said that Todd ``had a \ngoal of being a Marine, and he wasn't going to let anything get in the \nway of that.''\n  Todd excelled as a Marine and completed the intensely competitive and \nselective sniper training to win a spot in the sniper platoon. It was a \nspot he wanted because, according to his mother, ``He wanted to be with \npeople who were really serious about what they did.'' Indeed, Todd \nGodwin was a serious Marine who took pride in his duty to defend our \ncountry and to spread freedom to other parts of the world.\n  Todd was an exemplary Marine and also just a good, decent person--the \ntype of person others remember as having ``a way about them''--the type \nof person who was quick to smile, who was compassionate, and who was \ngood at making people feel at ease. It seems as though everyone who \nknew Todd liked him.\n  One of his friends, Austin Thompson, remembers Todd's ability to \nlaugh in almost any situation: ``He always had a great sense of humor, \nand he was also very loyal to his friends. He always looked out for \nthem and loved to be with them.''\n  Todd encouraged one of his friends, Josh Carpenter, to ``hang tough'' \nin Marine boot camp. He wrote a letter to Josh that said, ``I'm sure \nyou can't wait to graduate and get some of the comforts of life back. \nJust remember you have to pay your dues, just like every Marine. I'm \nsure you'll do fine--I have confidence you'll succeed.'' Josh had \njoined the Marines because he looked up to Todd. Todd's letter helped \nJosh get through the challenges of boot camp, so that he, too, could be \none of the few and the proud.\n  A letter like that is a little thing, a small deed, but Todd Godwin \nwas always doing those ``little things'' for others. That is just who \nhe was. When Todd saw that his fiancee's younger brother, Caleb, was \nwearing a U.S. Navy tie clasp, he brought him a Marine clasp to wear, \ninstead. It was a small gift that meant a great deal to Caleb, who \ndescribes Todd as ``my best buddy I ever had.''\n  One of Todd's friends from high school, Kimberly Burley, remembers \nanother of his deeds that took place on the night of the Zanesville \nChristian School junior-senior banquet:\n\n       It was raining that night, and he came out to greet all the \n     girls at their car with an umbrella.\n\n  Such a gallant act was really typical of Todd. It was just another \n``little thing'' he had done for others.\n  But, when we look at all the ``little things'' together--the letters, \nthe tie clasps, the way he acted always, the jokes that made people \nsmile--we see such a much bigger picture, a picture of an exceptionally \ncaring, thoughtful, generous young man. We see that he did the ``little \nthings'' for people because he had a very big heart.\n  Todd also had big plans. He was engaged to Andrea Mendenhall, whom he \nloved dearly. They were planning on getting married when Todd finished \nhis tour of duty in Iraq. Todd and Andrea were going to go to college \nwith money Todd was saving through the GI bill. They also talked of \nsomeday moving to Corpus Christi, TX. These plans, of course, were not \nrealized because Todd, once again, was looking out for others, as he \ndid all his life. His dreams were put on hold so that others could be \nfree and safe and able to fulfill their own dreams.\n  Mr. President, and Members of the Senate, a uniform does not make a \nmarine. The person wearing that uniform makes a marine. And, each color \nof that uniform signifies the characteristics of the marine inside it. \nTodd Godwin wore his uniform with pride. He exemplified the blue \nstanding for bravery, the white standing for honor, and the red \nstanding for sacrifice. Unique to the Marine uniform, of course, is the \nbright, red stripe that runs the length of each trouser leg--the \n``bloodstripe.'' It represents all the blood shed by marines in battle. \nIt is a red stripe of sacrifice--and for Todd Godwin, it represents the \nultimate sacrifice.\n  Todd was truly a man of faith, who lived the Marine credo ``Semper \nFidelis,'' which means, of course, ``always faithful.'' Todd was \nforever faithful to his friends and family, through his love and care; \nto his community, through his respect and good deeds; and to his \ncountry, through his courage and his sacrifice. For all that Todd gave \nus, we honor him today.\n  My wife, Fran, and I continue to keep Todd's parents, Bill and Kathy; \nhis brother, Aaron; his sisters, Sarah and Anna; his grandparents, \nClement and Esther Jones; and, the love of his life, Andrea Mendenhall, \nin our thoughts and in our prayers.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/24/senate-section/article/S5841-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5841-S5842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE HEAD START REAUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I cosponsor 1107, the Head Start \nImprovements for School Readiness Act, a bill to reauthorize Head \nStart. I join my colleagues Senators Enzi, Kennedy, and Dodd in support \nof this legislation.\n  I would like to see Head Start expanded and serve more children but \nfirst we must ensure that this program is accountable, financially \nsolvent, and meeting the purpose for which it was intended.\n  This bill strengthens the Head Start program, making four key \nimprovements by:\n  No. 1, establishing 200 Centers of Excellence that would serve as \nmodel Head Start programs across the country;\n  No. 2, providing that grantees shall re-compete to receive grants \nevery 5 years to help ensure a constant, high level of quality;\n  No. 3, clearly defining ``deficiency'' so that local Head Start \nproviders know the standards by which they will be held accountable; \nand\n  No. 4, providing clear authority to the governing boards to \nadminister--and be held accountable for--local Head Start programs \nwhile ensuring policy councils, on which parents sit, continue to play \nan important advisory role.\n  Head Start has been one of our country's most successful and popular \nsocial programs. That is because it is based upon the principle of \nequal opportunity, which is at the core of the American character. \nAmericans uniquely believe that each of us has the right to begin at \nthe same starting line and that, if we do, anything is possible for \nanyone one of us.\n  We also understand that some of us need help getting to that starting \nline. Most Federal funding for social programs is based upon this \nunderstanding of equal opportunity. Head Start began\n\n[[Page S5842]]\n\nin 1965 to make it more likely that disadvantaged children would \nsuccessfully arrive at one of the most important of our starting lines: \nthe beginning of school.\n  Head Start over the years has served hundreds of thousands of our \nmost at-risk children. The program has grown and changed. It has been \nsubjected to debates and studies touting its successes and decrying its \ndeficiencies. But Head Start has stood the test of time because it is \nso very important.\n  We have made great progress in what we know about the early growth \nand development of young children since Head Start began in 1965. At \nthat time very few professionals had studied early childhood education. \nEven fewer had designed programs specifically for children in poverty \nwith their many challenges.\n  The origins of Head Start come from an understanding that success for \nthese children was not only about education. The program was designed \nto be certain these children were healthy, got their immunizations, \nwere fed hot meals, and--of crucial importance--that their parents were \ndeeply involved in the program.\n  From the beginning comprehensive services and parent and community \ninvolvement were essential parts of good Head Start programs. And that \nis still true today. In the early days, teacher training and curriculum \nwere seen as less important. But we now know a great deal more about \nbrain development and how children learn from birth.\n  Today young children are expected to learn more and be able to do \nmore in order to succeed in school. Public schools offer kindergarten \nin response to these changes. And 40 States now offer early childhood \nprograms.\n  As we reauthorize the Head Start program, it is important to \nrecognize its importance and commit to making it stronger. But we must \nalso recognize that the program is not fulfilling its promise. Head \nStart is not meeting its purpose of serving our children who are most \nat risk when dollars are being squandered by those people who have been \ncharged with providing this service. Current practices do not meet my \npersonal standard for managing and running a program.\n  This bill attempts to address this issue by holding up successful \nlocal programs so that others may follow their example and by \nclarifying lines of accountability so that any corrupt practices may be \nrooted out. The bill would create a way for States to help strengthen \nand coordinate Head Start, but would continue to send Federal funds \ndirectly to nearly 1,700 grantees that provide services in over 29,000 \nHead Start centers that serve just over 900,000 disadvantaged children.\n  First, the bill authorizes the Secretary of HHS to create a \nnationwide network of 200 Centers of Excellence in Early Childhood \nbuilt around exemplary Head Start programs. These Centers of Excellence \nwould be nominated by governors. Each Center of Excellence would \nreceive a Federal bonus grant of at least $200,000 in each of 5 years, \nin addition to its base funding.\n  The Centers of Excellence bonus grants will be used for centers:\n  No. 1, to work in their community to model the best of what Head \nStart can do for at-risk children and families, including getting those \nchildren ready for school and ready for academic success;\n  No. 2, to coordinate all early childhood services in their community;\n  No. 3, to offer training and support to all professionals working \nwith at-risk children;\n  No. 4, to track these families and ensure seamless continuity of \nservices from prenatal to age 8;\n  No. 5, to become models of excellence by all performance measures and \nbe willing to be held accountable for good outcomes for our most \ndisadvantaged children; and\n  No. 6. to have the flexibility to serve additional Head Start or \nEarly Head Start children or provide more full-day services to better \nmeet the needs of working parents.\n  While Head Start centers are uneven in performance, they have \ngenerally excelled in two areas critical to success in caring for and \neducating children--developing community support and encouraging \nparental involvement. Alex Haley, the author of Roots, lived by these \nsix words, ``Find the good and praise it.'' For me that was an \ninvaluable lesson. That's what I hope these centers will do.\n  In addition to providing for the establishment of Centers of \nExcellence to highlight and encourage better practices among local Head \nStart programs, the bill establishes three new methods for ensuring \naccountability in the management and running of the programs.\n  First, it provides that grantees shall re-compete for grants every 5 \nyears. This ensures that, after 5 years, their program is still meeting \nits standards. I recognize that consistency is very important for the \nHead Start programs, especially for the children served by these \ngrants. Many Head Start grantees are doing a very good job \nadministering their grants, and I hope this reapplication process will \nhighlight their success. To help streamline the process for successful \nprograms, grantees that have not been found deficient nor to have had \nan area of noncompliance left unresolved for more than 120 days will \nreceive a priority designation during the re-competition process.\n  Second, the bill for the first time defines what makes a local \nprogram ``deficient.'' This will provide clarity for Head Start \ngrantees so that they know the precise standards to which they will be \nheld. Under the bill, a program may be deemed deficient if it is found \nto threaten the health, safety, or civil rights of children or staff, \ndeny parents the exercise of their full roles and responsibilities, \nmisuse funds, lose its legal status or financial viability, or violates \nother standards specified in the bill.\n  Finally, the bill makes clear that the Governing Board shall be the \nbody that is charged with running local programs and which will be held \naccountable for those programs. During our hearing on April 5, we \nlearned from Mayor Wharton of Shelby County, TN, and other witnesses, \nthat the dual governance structure between the governing board and the \npolicy council was inadequate and neither body had decision-making \nauthority. This bill gives governing boards direct authority--and holds \nthem accountable--while ensuring that policy councils, on which parents \nsit, continue to play an important advisory role in the running of \nlocal Head Start programs.\n  My mother taught me the importance of preschool education. When I was \ngrowing up, she ran a kindergarten in a converted garage in our \nbackyard in Maryville, TN. She helped our community appreciate the \nvalue of a good preschool program. I have remembered both lessons in \nworking with my colleagues to fashion this proposal to bring out the \nbest in Head Start.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in advancing this critical \nlegislation to ensure the Head Start program meets its full potential.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/24/senate-section/article/S5842-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5842-S5843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nLINCOLN FINANCIAL GROUP: CELEBRATING A CENTURY OF EXCELLENCE--1905-2005\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of the \ncentennial anniversary of Lincoln Financial Group.\n  In 1905, Lincoln Financial Group began with one product, one company, \nfour employees and a small rented space above a telegraph office in \ndowntown Fort Wayne, Indiana. Amid the stir of controversy that gripped \nthe big, established insurers at the time, Lincoln's founders \nenvisioned a new insurance enterprise--one based on dependability and \nhonesty. Believing that the name of Abraham Lincoln would powerfully \nconvey this spirit, the founders wrote the 16th President's only \nsurviving son, Robert Todd Lincoln, to ask for permission to use a \nportrait of his father on the company stationery. Robert Todd Lincoln \nagreed, and that is how Lincoln's legacy began with a name that \nreflects its character.\n  Since its founding, Lincoln Financial has consistently leveraged its \nstrong capital foundation to grow. From 1905-1955, Lincoln Life grew to \nbecome the ninth largest life insurance company in the United States. \nEven during the Great Depression, Lincoln acquired three companies. In \n1968, Lincoln National Corporation was formed as an Indiana \ncorporation. At the time, it\n\n[[Page S5843]]\n\nwas one of the first holding companies in the insurance industry.\n  In the last decades of the 20th century, Lincoln transformed itself \nfrom a life insurance company into a nationally recognized financial \nservices enterprise. The corporation adopted the name Lincoln Financial \nGroup as its marketing name in 1998. In addition to Fort Wayne, Lincoln \nmaintains primary offices in Philadelphia, PA; Hartford, CT; Chicago, \nIL; Portland, ME; and Barnwood, Gloucester, England.\n  Today, Lincoln is a family of companies working together to provide \nan array of financial planning, retirement income, life insurance, \nannuity, mutual fund, and investment management solutions to its \nclients. As of year-end 2004, Lincoln had consolidated assets of $116 \nbillion and annual consolidated revenues of $5.4 billion in 2004.\n  Lincoln's growth has been spurred by a corporate culture that rewards \ncreativity and believes that success is derived from a diverse and \ntalented workforce. The people of Lincoln have always valued the trust \ncustomers place in the company each time they seek financial advice, \npurchase a Lincoln product or recommend the company to a friend. The \ncompany has seven shared values that reflect the principles expressed \nby its namesake and characterize the quality of its products: \nintegrity; commitment to excellence; responsibility; respect; fairness; \ndiversity; and employee ownership.\n  Lincoln's sense of responsibility shapes not only its business \npractices, but also its commitment to the communities where it \noperates. Since its founding, Lincoln has recognized that investing in \nthese communities is fundamental to its success. The company's spirit \nof philanthropy led to the establishment of the Lincoln Financial Group \nFoundation in 1962, which further inspired a rich tradition of giving. \nToday, Lincoln sets aside 2 percent of its pre-tax earnings for \nphilanthropy. Over the past 30 years, the Lincoln Financial Group \nFoundation has given over $70 million in charitable giving in Indiana.\n  In addition to the company's monetary donations, its employees bring \nthe company's spirit of philanthropy to life every day. Collectively, \nthey donate thousands of hours each year in personal volunteerism and \nparticipation in various company-sponsored community activities. To \nencourage and recognize their efforts, Lincoln provides employees with \npaid time off to participate in various volunteer projects. The \ncompany's Matching Gifts program to colleges and universities also \nmaximizes employee donations. From food drives to donating blood, \nhomebuilding projects to tutoring, Lincoln employees actively make a \ndifference in the communities they call home.\n  As it celebrates its centennial, Lincoln's name gives a distinctive \ncharacter to its legacy.\n  As the next 100 years begin, there is much to celebrate for the \ncompany as it looks to build a future of opportunity, focused on its \nshared values.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/24/senate-section/article/S5843-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING THE CITY OF REDFIELD, SD\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and publicly \nrecognize the 125th anniversary of the founding of the city of \nRedfield, SD. As the 125th anniversary approaches, Redfield looks back \non a proud history and looks forward to a promising future.\n  Located in east central South Dakota, Redfield is the county seat for \nSpink County, the largest wheat-producing county in our State. First \nsettled in 1878 by Frank Meyers and a party of Chicago and Northwestern \nsurveyors, Redfield was originally known as ``Stennett Junction;'' \nnamed after an official with the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad. The \nterm ``Junction'' was added in anticipation of the railroad's \npopularity. Meyers established the first post office in 1880, thus \nmarking the town's official birth. In February of 1881, however, the \ntown's name was changed to Redfield, after Joseph Barlow Redfield, an \nauditor with the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad Company who \npurchased a great deal of the area's land for investors in Chicago.\n  Although Redfield now serves as the county seat for Spink County, \nprior to 1886, that was not the case. In fact, Redfield supporters \nfought a contentious and controversial county seat battle between Old \nAshton, Ashton, Frankfort and Redfield. Despite these efforts, old \nAshton retained its position as county seat. All that changed, however, \nin 1886, when Redfield honestly won the majority of the votes in Spink \nCounty and was awarded the seat it still proudly claims.\n  Among the city's many landmarks is the historic Carnegie Library. In \n1902, Redfield welcomed a grant from the Andrew Carnegie Foundation \nthat made the library possible. This contribution transformed a simple \nreading club into a majestic red brick building adorned with a tan \nsandstone foundation, a domed cupola and beautiful oak columns and \nwoodwork. In the library's early years, it housed the Redfield city \noffices, in addition to the collections; the City Auditor doubled as \nlibrarian. Recently, I had the pleasure of helping the community of \nRedfield secure $100,000 to renovate and expand this historic \nstructure, which is the oldest continuous-use Carnegie Library in South \nDakota.\n  The South Dakota Developmental Center, SDDC, is another notable \nRedfield landmark. Opened in 1902, the SDDC originally housed the staff \nand the patients in a single building, which is still used for office \nspace today. There are currently 175 disabled individuals receiving \nservices from SDDC today, ranging in age from 13 months to 78 years of \nage. Their disabilities range from moderate to profound.\n  Redfield also is home to one of the last surviving drive-in movie \ntheaters. Erected in 1952, Pheasant City Drive-in Theater still \nentertains more than 2,800 Redfield residents.\n  In the twelve and a half decades since its founding, Redfield has \nproven its ability to thrive and serve farmers and ranchers throughout \nthe region. Redfield's proud residents celebrate its 125th anniversary \nJuly 1-3, 2005, and it is with great honor that I share with my \ncolleagues the achievements made by this great community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/24/senate-section/article/S5843-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FRIENDS AND FOOD FOR FIFTY YEARS IN ST. ANTHONY, ID\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, there is a small town in Idaho that \ncelebrates a very special anniversary this year. Fifty years ago in \n1955, the St. Anthony, ID Chamber of Commerce paid for travelers to \nhave coffee and donuts at any of the local cafes to celebrate the \nopening day of fishing season. The effort, which encouraged fishermen \nand women to stop in St. Anthony for supplies, was so successful that \nthis tiny town decided to prepare and serve a full breakfast of \npancakes, sausage, hash browns and beverages for hungry travelers every \nyear. By 1966, 10,000 people were served over the course of one day, \nmore than three times the current population of the town. Today, about \n5,000 people a year get to enjoy the great food and super hospitality \nof this small town in southeast Idaho that serves as a gateway to the \nSnake River and some of the best fishing in the West.\n  I congratulate the St. Anthony Chamber of Commerce and all of the \nvolunteers who this year and in years past have come together to give \npeople a smile, laughter and a delicious hot breakfast.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/24/senate-section/article/S5843-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5843-S5844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CHILDREN'S HOSPICE INTERNATIONAL\n\n Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, on May 23 of this year, Children's \nHospice International celebrates its 22nd anniversary of helping \nchildren with life-threatening illnesses find comfort and care through \nhospice care programs around the country and the world.\n  Several members of this distinguished body, including former Senate \nMajority Leader Robert K. Dole of Kansas and former Senator Claiborne \nPell of Rhode Island, were among the organization's early supporters \nbecause they recognized the need to provide comprehensive hospice care \nfor children who are suffering from difficult medical conditions.\n  In 1977, when CHI was founded by Ann Armstrong-Dailey, there were no \nhospice care programs for children in the United States. In 1983, only \nfour of 1,400 hospice programs in the United States were willing to \naccept children. Now, close to 450 of 3,000 U.S. hospices include \nchild-specific services. And while that is good news, there is much \nmore to be done.\n  Of the 10 million children in America who are living with a serious \nchronic\n\n[[Page S5844]]\n\ncondition, each year about 54,000 will die; another 1.3 million will \nlive but could greatly benefit from hospice and palliative care.\n  Historically, hospice reimbursement guidelines, in Medicaid and most \nprivate plans, have required that patients forego all life-saving care \nbefore they can be admitted to hospice. They have also required the \npatient to be within the last 6 months of life. However, this does not \nwork with pediatric patients for whom aggressive treatment is sought \nand life-expectancy cannot be estimated.\n  Families should not be expected to give up on hope for a cure in \norder to receive that help. Because of the unpredictable course of many \nserious childhood illnesses, it is often very difficult for doctors to \nknow when a child is within 6 months of death. Parents should not have \nto choose between hospice care and the hope for a cure. Parents should \nnot have to keep their child in a hospital or other facility simply \nbecause insurance will not pay for the child to receive the same care, \nat a lower cost, at home.\n  The most critical time for children and family members is at the \npoint of diagnosis--when they need the intensive support and guidance \nthat hospice and palliative care programs can provide.\n  Since 1997, CHI has worked with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, CMS, to set up the Program for All-Inclusive Care for \nChildren and their Families, CHI PACC. CHI PACC programs provide a \ncontinuum of care for children and their families from time of \ndiagnosis, with hope for a cure, through bereavement, if needed.\n  With Congressional support, a total of 18 States are already \nbenefiting from this initiative through CHI PACC programs in six States \nand two regions. States currently implementing CHI PACC are Colorado, \nFlorida, Kentucky, New York, Virginia, and my home State of Utah, which \nwill be among the first to implement this model.\n  Utah has been one of the leaders in this effort. Utah's Department of \nHealth has spearheaded the effort in Utah, and the Primary Children's \nMedical Center in Salt Lake City, UT has been a central point of \ndeveloping these pediatric palliative services to assist families from \nthe point of diagnosis.\n  The New England Region is also preparing to implement CHI PACC to \nserve six States--Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, \nRhode Island and Vermont. The Colorado program extends to patients in \nsix additional States--Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, South \nDakota and Wyoming. In Pennsylvania, the Department of Defense is \nworking to adopt the CHI PACC model for its health care system. The \ngoal of all of these efforts is to prove the effectiveness of the CHI \nPACC model so that it can be adopted universally through Medicaid, S-\nSCHIP and private insurers.\n  As we approach Memorial Day, it should be noted that Children's \nHospice International is a living memorial to Ensign Alan H. Armstrong \nand his shipmates lost aboard the U.S.S. Frank E. Evans during the \nconflict in Vietnam. Armstrong is the brother of CHI Founder Ann \nArmstrong-Dailey. I deeply appreciate Ensign Armstrong's service to our \ncountry.\n  I commend Children's Hospice International on its 22nd anniversary as \nit seeks to remove the roadblocks in private and public insurance \nprograms that prevent these children and their families from receiving \nthe care and support they need.\n  I too believe in the vision that Ann Armstrong-Dailey, along with \noriginal honorary board members Barbara Bush, and Senators Claiborne \nPell and Robert Dole, put forth 22 years ago when they launched this \nvery important effort to provide dignified care and support to children \nwith life-threatening conditions and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/24/senate-section/article/S5844-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL HISTORY DAY 2005\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I wish to say a few words \nabout National History Day. For the past 25 years, National History Day \nhas provided students in grades 6-12 with opportunities to study \ndifferent periods or trends in American history. National History Day \nis a year-long educational opportunity for students to examine a period \nof American history closely through extensive research, development of \nexhibits and presentations, and multimedia documentaries. This year's \nnational competition topic is ``Communication in History,'' and the \ncompetition will be held on the campus of the University of Maryland in \nJune.\n  I am especially proud of the students from my State of North Dakota \nwho have been selected to participate in this program this year. These \nstudents participated in the North Dakota State competition and were \nselected to represent the State in the national competition. They \ninclude Edward Gallegos, Kelbi Clarke, Lyndsie Cossel, Sejal Parikh, \nSarak Shirek, Amirah Ahmed, Amber Guseman, Annah Klamm, Meghan Graham, \nKatie Sanner and Amanda Malm from Grand Forks. They also include Erin \nDroske, Aaron Christianson, Jessica King, Micah Gilleshammer and Sarah \nLunde of St. Thomas. These students represent the Schroeder Middle \nSchool and Red River High School in Grand Forks and the St. Thomas \nPublic School in St. Thomas, ND. I congratulate them and wish them much \nsuccess in the national competition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/24/senate-section/article/S5844-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:10 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced the the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 29.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio relative to the Energy Policy \n     Act of 1992; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n\n                         Senate Resolution 35s\n\n       Whereas the United States; increasing dependence on \n     imported oil and the relative instability of foreign oil-\n     producing countries prompted Congress to enact the Energy \n     Policy Act of 1992. The policy goals of the Act are to reduce \n     our nation's reliance on foreign petroleum and to improve air \n     quality; and\n       Whereas to achieve these goals, certain portions of the Act \n     establish provisions that are designed to encourage the use \n     of alternative fuels. One such provision, 42 U.S.C. 13257(o), \n     specifies that pursuant to rules adopted by the Department of \n     Energy, 75% of new light duty motor vehicles acquired \n     annually for state government fleets must be alternative \n     fueled vehicles; and\n       Whereas rules adopted by the Department of Energy, which \n     are codified at 10 C.F.R. Part 490 and are commonly known as \n     the Energy Policy Act State and Alternative Fuel Provider \n     Rules, exclude electric-hybrid vehicles that run in part on \n     gasoline from the definition of ``alternative fueled \n     vehicle,'' thus prohibiting states from receiving credit \n     toward the alternative fueled vehicle quota for the \n     acquisition of an electric-hybrid vehicle; and\n       Whereas this inability of states to use electric-hybrid \n     vehicles in order to receive credit toward the quota is \n     unfortunate and, in fact, does not make sense because these \n     vehicles exhibit excellent fuel efficiency that would serve \n     to accomplish the policy goals of the Energy Policy Act of \n     1992 by reducing dependence on petroleum products; now \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved, That we the members of the Senate of the 126th \n     General Assembly of Ohio, request Congress to amend the \n     Energy Policy Act of 1992 to specify that an electric-hybrid \n     vehicle must receive credit as being an alternative fueled \n     vehicle for purposes of the requirement that 75% of new light \n     duty motor vehicles acquired annually for state government \n     fleets be alternative fueled vehicles, and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit daily \n     authenticated copies of this resolution to the Speaker and \n     Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, to the \n     President Pro Tempore and Secretary of the United States \n     Senate, to the members of the Ohio Congressional delegation, \n     to the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the General \n     Assembly of Ohio, and to the news media of Ohio.\n\n       POM-62. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to highway funding; to the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation.\n\n                     House Concurrent Resolution 4\n\n       Whereas the sixth short-term extension of the federal road \n     and transit funding authorization act known as the \n     Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, or TEA 21, \n     expires on May 31, 2005. The uncertainty regarding long-term \n     federal funding hampers Michigan's ability to effectively \n     plan investments in infrastructure and may contribute to \n     delays in critical highway and transit projects; and\n       Whereas Michigan has long been a ``donor state,'' \n     contributing a greater share to the Federal Highway Trust \n     Fund and Mass Transit Account than the share of federal \n     transportation funds returned for use in Michigan; and\n       Whereas last session, the United States Senate passed \n     highway reauthorization legislation that would have provided \n     $318 billion for highways and transit systems nationwide over \n     six years and increased Michigan's rate of return on our \n     federal transportation taxes from 90.5 percent to 95 percent. \n     In addition, the bill would have provided up to $300 million \n     more for Michigan transportation systems each year, and could \n     have created several thousand new jobs. The House passed \n     reauthorizing legislation that would have provided $284 \n     billion for highways and transit systems and would have \n     reduced Michigan's rate of return below the current level of \n     90.5 percent. The Conference Committee narrowed the funding \n     difference to between $284 and $299 billion, but left \n     unRESOLVED the question of funding equity for donor states \n     such as Michigan; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring), That we memorialize Congress to enact highway \n     reauthorization legislation with a level of funding that \n     closes the gap between federal fuel tax dollars paid by \n     Michigan motorists and dollars received to address Michigan's \n     transportation needs; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-63.

A House Joint Memorial adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Idaho relative to a feasibility study by the \n     U.S. Corps of Engineers relating to the possibilities, \n     benefits, and costs of providing flood control above Bear \n     Lake; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                         House Joint Memorial 1\n\n       Whereas the ongoing drought in the state of Idaho has had a \n     profound impact throughout the state, including the area of \n     southeastern Idaho known as the Bear River Basin. Although \n     inadequate, during times of high water such as spring runoff, \n     Bear Lake is the major reservoir for containing flood waters \n     of the Bear River within the Bear River Basin. The effects of \n     drought in the Bear River Basin would be significantly \n     reduced in the event alternative storage sites were \n     available; and\n       Whereas the Bear River Basin encompasses 7,400 square miles \n     with 2,700 square miles in the state of Idaho. Originating in \n     Utah's Uintah Mountains, the Bear River crosses state \n     boundaries five times, has tributaries in Idaho, Utah and \n     Wyoming, and ultimately discharges into the Great Salt Lake; \n     and\n       Whereas the Bear River did not naturally divert into Bear \n     Lake. The Utah Sugar Company and the Telluride Power Company \n     first proposed diversion of the Bear River into Bear Lake for \n     water storage in 1898. That project was taken over by Utah \n     Power and Light Company for the purpose of producing \n     hydropower. The project, which included a diversion dam on \n     the Bear River, a canal, and a pumping station was completed \n     in 1918; and\n       Whereas a multistate compact between the states of Idaho, \n     Utah and Wyoming, known as the Bear River Compact, was \n     entered into in 1958 and amended in 1980. The Compact governs \n     the operation of the Bear River and, for management purposes, \n     the Compact divides the river into three segments. The three \n     segments are known as the Upper Division, located in Utah and \n     Wyoming, the Central Division, located in Wyoming and Idaho, \n     and the Lower Division, located in Idaho and Utah. The Bear \n     River Commission, made up of three members from each of the \n     Compact states, a chairman appointed by the President of the \n     United States, and an engineer/manager, manages the day-to-\n     day operation of the river; and\n       Whereas as a result of two lawsuits against Utah Power and \n     Light Company during the 1970's, which claimed damage to \n     crops due to flooding along the Bear River, the power company \n     is under court order to keep the Bear River within its banks. \n     Based on the court order, in the event the irrigation season \n     ends with Bear Lake above 5,918 feet in elevation, water is \n     released downstream to make room in Bear Lake for the spring \n     runoff; and\n       Whereas since the 1970's, millions of acre feet of water \n     have been released to provide capacity for flood control. \n     Releases carry the river as well as the surface water removed \n     from Bear Lake downstream to the Great Salt Lake where the \n     principal beneficiary is the Great Salt Lake ecosystem. The \n     most recent releases were in 1997, 1998 and 1999; and\n       Whereas lowering the elevation of Bear Lake in the Lower \n     Division for flood control also impacts water users in the \n     Upper and Central Divisions. Under the Compact, Woodruff \n     Narrows Reservoir located in the Upper Division is not \n     allowed to fill whenever the elevation of Bear Lake is below \n     5,911 feet above sea level, affecting both ground and surface \n     water in that area. In addition, when Woodruff Narrows \n     Reservoir is not full, no water is available for irrigation \n     in a ten mile stretch of river in the Central Division \n     leaving irrigators in that area without water for their \n     crops; and\n       Whereas dredging has been necessary to provide water for \n     irrigation due to low lake levels; and\n       Whereas studies to date have shown that use of Bear Lake \n     for flood control has resulted in tons of suspended sediment \n     solids to be deposited in the lake during the spring runoff. \n     This is highly detrimental to the ecosystem. Increases in \n     algae blooms on Bear Lake due to nitrates being carried in \n     have been documented; and\n       Whereas in the event the water had not been released in the \n     interest of flood control, it is likely that Bear Lake would \n     now be full or nearly full. In that event, it is probable \n     that there would be no need to pump water out of Bear Lake \n     for irrigation because there would be enough capacity to \n     allow the water to flow out by gravity, there would be no \n     need to dredge in Bear Lake in that the elevation of the lake \n     would be high enough to make dredging unnecessary, and an \n     elevation above 5,911 feet would allow upstream storage at \n     the Woodruff Narrows Reservoir; and\n       Whereas extremely low levels in Bear Lake could cause a \n     water emergency to be declared by the state of Utah. The \n     declaration would lead to closer scrutiny of the natural flow \n     rights administered under the interstate accounting system. \n     The lack of adequate storage water to supplement natural flow \n     could result in the curtailment of rights in Idaho; and\n       Whereas if alternate storage sites were available, several \n     hundred thousand acre feet of water would still be in Bear \n     Lake to mitigate the effects of the drought. Pursuant to the \n     Bear River Compact, Idaho is entitled to store approximately \n     125,000 acre feet of water annually and Utah about 390,000 \n     acre feet annually. Provided adequate storage, this water, \n     which is usually available during the spring runoff, could be \n     stored to prevent any flooding of the Bear River. The water \n     could then be used for irrigation, domestic and commercial \n     development and recreation. A reservoir above Bear Lake would \n     allow chemicals to be neutralized and suspended solids to \n     settle out that are now entering Bear Lake. Alternative \n     storage sites would provide for the conservation, \n     preservation and best utilization of the water to which the \n     state is entitled. This storage is desperately needed to \n     allow residential, commercial and municipal development in \n     the Bear River drainage without reducing irrigated \n     agricultural lands; and\n       Whereas flood control above Bear Lake would make possible a \n     policy that Bear Lake would be the first to fill and the last \n     to empty. This would provide more water for irrigation, \n     minimize fluctuations of lake levels, improve spawning \n     habitat for Bear Lake cutthroat trout, provide boat-launching \n     capability at Idaho state parks, and allow the filling of \n     Woodruff Narrows Reservoir. Flood control above Bear Lake \n     would greatly benefit the economy of all three states in the \n     Bear River drainage; and\n       Whereas the United States Army Corps of Engineers is the \n     federal agency responsible for flood control. The Corps has \n     indicated a willingness to conduct a feasibility study of \n     possible water storage sites upstream from Bear Lake which \n     could be used for flood control of the Bear River. Costs of \n     the study could range from $600,000 to $2,000,000 depending \n     on the areas the study would include. The study will require \n     an equal match of federal and nonfederal funds. However, with \n     congressional approval, past local expenditures may be used \n     as the local match; and\n       Whereas past local expenditures that have been made include \n     $174,000 by the state of Wyoming for the Cokeville Reservoir \n     project on Smith's Fork, $350,000 by the State of Wyoming for \n     the Bear River Plan and over $2,000,000 of state funds from \n     Idaho, Wyoming, and Utah through the Bear River Commission \n     for stream gaging; and\n       Whereas concerned citizens of the Bear River drainage, \n     including the Bear Lake County Commission, the Bear Lake \n     Regional Commission, Bear Lake Watch, Inc., and Love Bear \n     Lake, Inc., are asking for Congressional approval to \n     recognize past expenditures as the local match to make the \n     Corps of Engineers feasibility study possible: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the first Regular Session of the \n     Fifty-eighth Idaho Legislature, the House of Representatives \n     and the Senate concurring therein, That we respectfully urge \n     the Congress of the United States and our Idaho delegation, \n     as well as the Utah and Wyoming delegations in Congress, to \n     support, work to pass and vote for legislation that will \n     authorize and fund a feasibility study by the United States \n     Corps of Engineers relating to the possibilities, benefits \n     and cost of providing flood control above Bear Lake; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That we urge Congress to allow and approve past \n     local expenditures, equivalent to fifty percent of the total \n     cost of the study, as the required local match and that local \n     expenditures to be allowed and approved include $174,000 by \n     the state of Wyoming for the Cokeville Reservoir project on \n     Smith's Fork, $350,000 by the state of Wyoming for the Bear \n     River Plan and $2,000,000 of state funds from Idaho, Wyoming, \n     and Utah for stream gaging; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives be, and she is hereby authorized and directed \n     to forward a copy of this Memorial to the President of the \n     Senate\n\n[[Page S5849]]\n\n     and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of Congress, \n     and the congressional delegations representing the states of \n     Idaho, Utah and Wyoming in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-70.

These negotiations concluded in December 2003. \n     Negotiations with Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic were \n     subsequently completed and are now included in the agreement. \n     Congress must now decide whether to ratify the Central \n     America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA); and\n       Whereas the federal government is also negotiating the Free \n     Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) agreement; and\n       Whereas both CAFTA and the FTAA would allow these foreign \n     countries to export commodities to the United States, harming \n     Idaho agricultural industry in the process; and\n       Whereas the agricultural producers of the United States \n     cannot be expected to compete with these foreign countries \n     under the trade agreements due to the labor practices, lack \n     of environmental regulations and subsidized agricultural \n     production of these foreign countries; and\n       Whereas sugar is an import-sensitive commodity which will \n     be negatively impacted by CAFTA. Idaho is our nation's \n     second-largest producer of sugarbeets and a recent University \n     of Idaho study concludes that the demise of the sugar \n     industry in the state would also have a serious impact on \n     market prices relating to other Idaho crops such as potatoes \n     and onions which would be grown in place of sugarbeets; and\n       Whereas the CAFTA nations already enjoy preferential, duty-\n     free access into the United States market for 311,700 metric \n     tons of sugar. The United States is presently the world's \n     fourth-largest net importer of sugar under existing trade \n     agreements and its sugar market is already oversupplied, \n     resulting in our region's sugarbeet processing company \n     recently announcing the temporary closure of one of its \n     factories due to the existing low sugar marketing allocations \n     for United States producers; and\n       Whereas the United States International Trade Commission in \n     August 2004, concluded that the Central American Free Trade \n     Agreement would actually increase the U.S. trade deficit with \n     the region by $100 million a year to $24 billion a year; and\n       Whereas concerns over free trade agreements face the \n     agriculture industry at a time when the domestic consumption \n     of United States agricultural products is declining, forcing \n     domestic producers out of business; and\n       Whereas the state of Idaho stands to lose thousands of jobs \n     and millions of dollars if these free trade agreements are \n     implemented, potentially devastating the state's agricultural \n     industry, moving production into other supply-sensitive \n     crops, and severely harming the state's economy as a whole; \n     and\n       Whereas the economic impact of any trade agreement must be \n     recognized and considered to maintain viable economic health \n     of agricultural industries, as well as all industries, with \n     an emphasis on fair trade, rather than free trade; and\n       Whereas the provisions of CAFTA and FTAA should be \n     renegotiated to limit exports from foreign countries to a \n     needs-based access, allowing the United States agricultural \n     policy to properly function and fairly treat agricultural \n     producers in the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the First Regular Session of the \n     Fifty-eighth Idaho Legislature, the House of Representatives \n     and the Senate concurring therein, That in negotiating any \n     national trade agreements, the federal government is urged to \n     recognize the economic impact of such trade agreements on the \n     states and consider those impacts in order to maintain the \n     viable economic health of agricultural industries, as well as \n     all industries, with an emphasis on fair trade, rather than \n     free trade, and be it further\n       Resolved, That the federal government is urged to \n     renegotiate the provisions of CAFTA and the FTAA to limit \n     exports from the involved foreign countries to fairly protect \n     agricultural producers in the United States; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives be, and she is hereby authorized and directed \n     to forward a copy of this Memorial to the President of the \n     Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of \n     Congress, and the congressional delegation representing the \n     State of Idaho in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-71.

Komen Foundation, \n     and Families USA: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to enact the Breast Cancer \n     Patient Protection Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-72.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate of the Legislature of the \n     State of Hawaii relative to the No Child Left Behind Act of \n     2001; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions.\n\n                      House Concurrent Resolution\n\n       Whereas in 2002, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 was \n     enacted on a bipartisan basis and signed into law by \n     President George W. Bush; and\n       Whereas all states that accept federal Title I education \n     funds, including Hawaii, are subject to the requirements of \n     the Act; and\n       Whereas the purpose of the Act is to compel all public \n     schools to make adequate yearly progress toward the goal of \n     100 percent student proficiency in math and reading by 2013-\n     2014; and\n       Whereas these expectations are unreasonable for students \n     with limited English proficiency and students with \n     disabilities, making it impossible for many of Hawaii's\n\n[[Page S5850]]\n\n     schools, that have a high population of these students, to \n     comply with the law; and\n       Whereas the Act does not allow states that may already have \n     successful accountability systems in place to use their \n     system to comply with the spirit of the Act; and\n       Whereas states should be allowed to use a value-added or \n     student growth approach in their state accountability plan; \n     and\n       Whereas the Act is an under-funded mandate that causes \n     states and school districts to spend more money than the \n     amounts appropriated by Congress to implement the Act; and\n       Whereas the Act coerces participation by placing punitive \n     financial consequences on states that refuse to participate; \n     and\n       Whereas in 2004, the National Conference of State \n     Legislatures created a bipartisan task force to study the \n     Act, resulting in suggestions for specific changes to make \n     the Act more workable, more responsive to variations among \n     the states, and more effective in improving elementary \n     education; and\n       Whereas the recommendations of the task force's February \n     2005 Final Report include the following:\n       (1) Substantially increasing federal funding for the Act;\n       (2) Reexamining the financial consequences for states that \n     choose not to participate;\n       (3) Reevaluating the 100 percent proficiency goal \n     established by the Act;\n       (4) Conducting a Government Accountability Office study of \n     the compliance and proficiency costs associated with the Act;\n       (5) Giving the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n     primacy over the Act in cases where these laws may conflict; \n     and\n       (6) Providing states with much greater flexibility to meet \n     the objectives of the adequate yearly progress provisions of \n     the Act; and\n       Whereas although the Act aims to provide flexibility for \n     states to improve academic achievement and to close the \n     achievement gap, the task force found that little flexibility \n     has been granted to states to implement the Act: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2005, the Senate concurring, That the United States Congress \n     is respectfully requested to amend the No Child Left Behind \n     Act of 2001 according to the recommendations of the February \n     2005 Final Report of the National Conference of State \n     Legislatures' Task Force on No Child Left Behind; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the current law and any revisions thereof \n     recognize that under our federal system of government, \n     education is primarily a state and local responsibility; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That Congress is requested to allow states more \n     flexibility to continue to work toward the goal of closing \n     the achievement gap without the threat of losing federal \n     funds; and be it further\n       Resolved, That Congress is requested to appropriate federal \n     funding in amounts consistent with the levels authorized in \n     the Act for education programs and expanded information \n     systems needed to accurately reflect student, school, and \n     school district performance and to pay the costs of ensuring \n     student proficiency; and be it further\n       Resolved, That Congress is requested to authorize \n     appropriate assessment methods and an alternative methodology \n     for determining adequate yearly progress targets and progress \n     for students who are not yet proficient in English and who \n     have certain disabilities; and be it further\n       Resolved, That Congress is requested to amend the No Child \n     Left Behind Act's current provisions relating to adequate \n     yearly progress to apply sanctions only when the same groups \n     or subgroups within a grade level fail to meet adequate \n     yearly progress targets in the same subject area for two \n     consecutive years; and be it further\n       Resolved, That Congress is requested to amend the Act to \n     allow flexibility in:\n       (1) Determining adequate yearly progress using models that \n     measure individual student growth or growth in the same \n     cohort of students from year to year;\n       (2) Calculating adequate yearly progress for students \n     belonging to multiple groups and subgroups; and\n       (3) Determining whether certain categories of teachers, \n     such as special education teachers, are highly qualified; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That Congress is requested to modify the No Child \n     Left Behind Act's provisions relating to school choice by \n     limiting the option only to those students whose performance \n     is consistently below the proficiency level; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States, the President and Secretary of the United States \n     Senate, the Speaker and Clerk of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and members of Hawaii's congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-74.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Idaho relative to the Radiation Exposure \n     Compensation Act (RECA); to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n       Whereas on October 15, 1990, Congress passed the Radiation \n     Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), which provides for \n     compassionate payments to persons or to their\n\n[[Page S5851]]\n\n     beneficiaries who developed diseases as a result of exposure \n     to radiation from U.S. atmospheric nuclear weapons testing; \n     and\n       Whereas currently, a study is underway by the National \n     Academy of Sciences and a report will be filed with Congress \n     to address the adequacy of the initial geographic coverage \n     provided in RECA; and\n       Whereas compelling anecdotal evidence has been accumulated \n     at public meetings and in written reports, to indicate the \n     impact of atmospheric testing on the downwinder populations \n     in Idaho; and\n       Whereas preliminary evidence suggests that scientific \n     documentation being gathered and assessed for inclusion in \n     the report will find that risk factors present in Idaho equal \n     or exceed the factors present in areas previously included in \n     RECA coverage; and\n       Whereas members of Idaho's congressional delegation have \n     worked and will continue to press for responsible legislative \n     action to address the claims of Idahoans based upon radiation \n     exposure; and\n       Whereas it is appropriate that members of the Idaho \n     Legislature, speaking on behalf of the citizens of the state, \n     express support for the efforts of Idaho's congressional \n     delegation in their representation of downwinders in Idaho: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the First Regular Session of the \n     Fifty-eighth Idaho Legislature, the House of Representatives \n     and the Senate concurring therein, That we anticipate the \n     findings of the National Academy of Sciences will verify the \n     impact of testing on residents of Idaho, and we conclude that \n     it is appropriate to compensate these downwinders in the same \n     manner and to the same extent as those individuals previously \n     compensated for similar exposures.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nmake improvements to payments to ambulance providers in rural areas, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. Conrad. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Rural Access to \nEmergency Services (RAES) Act, which will improve access to emergency \nmedical services (EMS) in rural communities. This bill will take the \ncritical steps to help sustain rural emergency care in the future.\n  EMS is a vital component of the health care system, particularly in \nrural areas. Ambulance personnel are not only the first responders to \nan emergency, but also play a key role in the provision of life-saving \nmedical care. It is said that time is one of the most important factors \nrelating to patient outcomes in emergency situations. Rural EMS \nproviders often have the enormous strain of responding to emergencies \nmany miles away--sometimes nearly 50 minutes. However, current \nreimbursement levels are insufficient for the squads to bear the costs \nof responding to calls over these long distances. As rural EMS squads \nare forced\n\n[[Page S5853]]\n\nto close, rural residents--and others traveling through rural areas--\nare left without access to emergency services. Due to the inadequacy of \nMedicare reimbursement, rural ambulance providers are also finding it \ndifficult to maintain the heightened ``readiness requirement,'' \nexposing communities to the threat of being ill-prepared to respond to \na major public health emergency.\n  My legislation will take steps to improve the EMS system by \neliminating the 35-mile rule for ambulance services that provide care \nin communities served by Critical Access Hospitals. In addition, it \nwill establish an ambulance-specific definition of ``urban'' and \n``rural'' for Medicare reimbursement. Moreover, my legislation will \nprovide $15 million in funds to be used for a variety of activities \naimed at improving the rural EMS system. Finally, it will expand the \nUniversal Service Fund's definition of ``health care provider'' to \ninclude ``ambulance services.''\n  It is important to assure that rural Americans receive the best \nemergency medical services possible. This is especially important to me \nbecause 54 percent of North Dakotans live in rural communities, served \nlargely by unpaid volunteer emergency personnel. In fact, only 10 \npercent receive compensation for their services. In recent years, rural \nambulance services have found it difficult to recruit and retain EMS \npersonnel. Congress must take steps to ensure that every American has \naccess to quality emergency care. The RAES Act would do just that by \nimproving reimbursement, increasing collaboration among healthcare \nentities, and allowing EMS providers to collect quality data.\n  The EMS bill will provide improved healthcare and better access to \nEMS for the 49 million Americans living in rural areas, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this essential legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Bennett, and Mr. Allard):\n  S. 1111. A bill to promote oil shale and tar sand development, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Oil Shale and \nTar Sands Development Act of 2005. In doing so, I would like to thank \nSenator Robert Bennett and Senator Wayne Allard for cosponsoring this \nlegislation.\n  It could not be any more apparent to Americans when we pay to fill up \nour cars that this country is in need of a strong, comprehensive energy \nstrategy. Our citizens recognize that there is a shortage of petroleum, \nand that that shortage is driving up prices.\n  American consumers have increased their demand for oil by 12 percent \nin the last decade, but oil production has grown by less than one half \nof one percent. Is it any wonder we rely on foreign countries for more \nthan half our oil needs? We import 56 percent of our oil today, and \nit's projected to be 68 percent within 20 years.\n  On a larger scale, global demand for oil is growing at an \nunprecedented pace--about two and half million barrels per day in 2004 \nalone. However, while global oil production is increasing, the \ndiscovery of new oil reserves is falling dramatically. Moreover, trends \nindicate that the global thirst for petroleum will continue to grow, \nespecially in Asia.\n  Last month, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan stated, ``Markets \nfor oil and natural gas have been subject to a degree of strain over \nthe past year not experienced for a generation. Increased demand and \nlagging additions to productive capacity have combined to absorb a \nsignificant amount of the slack in energy markets that was essential in \ncontaining energy prices between 1985 and 2000.''\n  We are quickly heading into a global energy crunch, and our lack of \nsufficient oil supply at home will give us little or no buffer against \nit. Increasing our domestic oil reserve is imperative both from an \neconomic and a national security perspective.\n  I am pleased to report to my colleagues today that a solution is \navailable.\n  It is a little known fact that the largest hydrocarbon resource in \nthe world rests within the borders of Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming. I \nknow it may be hard to believe, but energy experts agree that there is \nmore recoverable oil in these three States than there is in all the \nMiddle East. In fact, the U.S. Department of Energy estimates that \nrecoverable oil shale in the western United States exceeds one trillion \nbarrels and is the richest and most geographically concentrated oil \nshale and tar sands resource in the world.\n  This gigantic resource of oil shale and tar sands is well known by \ngeologists and energy experts, but it has not been counted among our \nNation's oil reserve because it is not yet being developed \ncommercially. Companies have been waiting for the Federal Government to \nrecognize publicly the existence of this resource as a potential \nreserve and to allow industry access to it.\n  This bill would give them that chance.\n  Some might ask why we have not yet developed these resources if doing \nso could have such a profound economic potential?\n  I understand why we have been so hesitant to develop this resource in \nthe past. During the 1970s, we saw a very large and expensive effort \nbegin in western Colorado to develop oil shale there. When the price of \noil dropped dramatically, though, the market for oil shale went bust \nand the region suffered an economic disaster.\n  We should never forget that experience.\n  Much has changed since the 1970s, and it would be senseless to \ncontinue to ignore the huge potential of this resource. I think there \nhas been a mind set within the government and the local communities \nresulting from the Colorado boom and bust experience that developing \nthis resource would be risky. The fact is, developing this energy \nresource is no more risky than producing oil offshore or in the Arctic. \nIt is certainly less risky than continuing to rely on oil from the \nMiddle East or from other foreign competitors.\n  We need to remember that our past failure in this area was not \nnecessarily a failure of technology, but rather an inability to sustain \nthis technology economically because of a very large slump in gas \nprices. Today's economics and advances in technology combine to provide \nthe right scenario to begin the development of the world's largest \nuntapped oil resource.\n  Skeptics might ask how we know that the price of oil won't plummet, \ncausing the problems of the 1970s all over again? The world is now \nreaching peak oil production of conventional oil. With the tremendous \ngrowth in India and Asia, and the accompanying need for oil, experts \npredict there will be little economic incentive for prices to drop. \nThis is a new scenario for the world, and it forces us to shift our \nfocus to unconventional resources.\n  We have already seen this shift in focus by the government of \nAlberta, Canada. Alberta recognized the potential of its own tar sands \ndeposits and set forth a policy to promote their development. As a \nresult, Canada has increased its oil reserves by more than a factor of \n10, going from a reserve of about 14 billion barrels to its current \nreserve of 176 billion barrels in only a few years. And just think we \nare sitting on one trillion barrels, more than five times what Canada \nhas.\n  I think it's outrageous that Utah imports about one-fourth of its oil \nfrom Canadian tar sands, even though we have a very large resource of \nthose very same tar sands in our own State sitting undeveloped. The \ngovernment of Alberta, which owns the resource, has moved forward in \nleaps and bounds, while the United States has yet to take even a baby \nstep toward developing our untapped resource.\n  Our proposed legislation looks to the Alberta model to help the \nUnited States move toward greater energy independence. The Oil Shale \nand Tar Sands Development Act represents a necessary shift by our \ngovernment from an almost complete reliance on conventional sources of \noil to our vast unconventional resources, such as tar sands and oil \nshale.\n  In drafting this legislation, we have been mindful of the environment \nand of States' water rights. We live in a different world than when \nthese resources were first developed. Unlike 30 years ago, we now have \nthe Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and \nRecovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, \nand Liability Act, the\n\n[[Page S5854]]\n\nNational Environmental Policy Act, and the Mining Reclamation Act. \nAlso, new technologies make the effort much cleaner and require less \nwater than in the past. Industry understands that any water it needs \nwill have to be acquired according to State law and according to \nexisting water rights.\n  Let me talk, for a moment, about the specific provisions in our bill. \nS. 1111 would establish an Office of Strategic Fuels tasked with, among \nother things, the development of a five-year plan to determine the \nsafest and steadiest route to developing oil shale and tar sands. The \nbill would also establish a mineral leasing program in the Department \nof the Interior to provide access to this resource.\n  Recognizing the tremendous national interest in this resource, our \nlegislation provides a number of programs to encourage oil shale and \ntar sands development, including Federal royalty relief, Federal cost \nshares for demonstration projects, advanced procurement agreements by \nthe military, and tax relief through the expensing of new equipment and \ntechnologies related to oil shale and tar sands development.\n  The size of our nation's energy challenge is enormous, but in Utah, \nColorado, and Wyoming we have an answer that more than meets the \nchallenge. This bill moves us down that path. I urge my colleagues to \njoin us in our effort to help the United States open the door new \nfrontier for domestic energy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Smith, Mr. Wyden, \n        Mr. McConnell, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Lott, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Kerry, \n        Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Rockefeller, Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \n        Corzine, Mr. Talent, and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 1112. A bill to make permanent the enhanced educational savings \nprovisions for qualified tuition programs enacted as part of the \nEconomic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Grassley, and \nour other colleagues, in introducing legislation to make the Section \n529 enhancements enacted in 2001 permanent.\n  In 2001, it was the Senate, especially my good friend Chairman \nGrassley, that insisted on including education savings in the tax bill. \nI am proud of that fact. And I am proud that the Senate is again taking \nthe lead to make these important provisions permanent.\n  Higher education is critical to our children's future and our \nNation's economy. As a parent, or grandparent, you know that providing \nyour children with a college education means they are likely to earn \nsubstantially more than if they only have a high school degree. One \nstudy estimated a million dollars more in today's dollars.\n  College is a good investment, but a very expensive one. The cost of \ntuition is rising every year. Over the past ten years, expenses at \npublic universities have increased nearly 40 percent. The U.S. \nDepartment of Education says the average cost of a four-year education \nis currently $34,000 and almost $90,000 for private colleges.\n  In 1996, Congress created 529 plans to help families plan for this \nexpense. Since their inception, 529 plans have helped families' college \nsavings grow faster by not taxing investment income while it is \naccumulating in the account. In 2001, we saw a need to do more to help \nfamilies deal with skyrocketing costs, so we allowed tax-free \ndistributions from the account, as long as the money goes for its \nintended purpose--post-secondary education expenses. This income \nexclusion will expire after 2010 if we don't do something about it.\n  There are a lot of provisions that will expire in 2010--so why focus \non this one provision today? Because saving for college doesn't happen \nin five or six years. We want families to save today for college \nexpenses fifteen to twenty years from now. Without this legislation, we \nare asking families to make critical investment decisions without the \npromise of today's tax benefits. This is not a good way to encourage \nsavings. Making this tax benefit permanent will allow families to plan \nand finance their children's education beyond 2010.\n  Thousands of young people back home have 529 plan accounts. By the \nend of 2004, Montana families had over $128 million set aside through \nthe Montana Family Education Savings Program. Across the country there \nis about $68 billion invested in over 7 million accounts. The average \naccount balance is just over $9,000. Not enough to finance a college \neducation, but an important start.\n  One of the great things about 529 plans is that grandparents can save \nfor the future of their grandchildren. That is what Arlene Hannawalt \ndid--she saved through a 529 plan for her granddaughter Nicole's \neducation. Nicole dropped out of high school, but she is getting her \nGED. Later this year, with help from her 529 account, Nicole will be \ngoing to the University of Montana--Helena College of Technology to \nstudy accounting.\n  Nicole's father is in the Army National Guard, serving in Iraq. Our \nprayers are with him. I'm sure Nicole's family is very pleased that she \nwill soon be a college student.\n  Tax-favored treatment for college savings is good policy, but it is \nnot free. I assure my colleagues that we will be looking for \nappropriate offsets to cover the cost of this bill.\n  Education is one of my top priorities. And saving for education \nshould be one of a family's top priorities. I encourage my colleagues \nto join in making the tax status of 529 benefits permanent to help \nmillions of American families plan for their children's future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Santorum, and Mr. \n        Ensign):\n  S. 1113. A bill to provide that no Federal funds may be expended for \nthe payment or reimbursement of a drug that is prescribed for the \ntreatment of sexual or erectile dysfunction; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, over the past three decades, \nprescription medicines have assumed a central and critical role in \ntreating health care conditions. Every year, researchers make new \ndiscoveries that help patients cope with illnesses and improve their \nquality of life. Ensuring access to prescription drugs--to treatments \nthat can help people maintain their health and avoid costly \nhospitalizations, for example--is a fundamental responsibility of our \nFederal health programs. We would not have worked as hard as we did to \nestablish the first-ever Medicare prescription drug benefit if we did \nnot believe this to be true. At the same time, we have a tremendous \nresponsibility to be good stewards of taxpayers' dollars. I, for one, \ntake that responsibility very seriously.\n  In 2004, our nation spent $1.8 trillion on health care. Medicare \nspending accounted for 17 percent of that amount. In 2005, Medicaid \nspending is expected to reach $321 billion. The Federal government \noffers me and other Federal employees health coverage through the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). The Department of \nDefense has TRICARE for military personnel, and the Veterans' \nAdministration provides an important source of health care access to \nthose who proudly served our country. Year after year, the costs of \nthese and other Federal health care programs continue to rise. Year \nafter year, we are forced to make difficult decisions to find ways to \nsave money under these programs with the goal of sustaining them well \ninto the future.\n  In contrast to those decisions, the bill that I am introducing today \nwas not difficult for me at all. By eliminating all Federal payments \nfor certain ``lifestyle'' drugs, the legislation restores the \nfundamental concept of stewardship to prescription drug coverage under \nFederal programs. It is a pretty simple piece of legislation--no \npayment for drugs prescribed for sexual or erectile dysfunction under \nany Federal program, period. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \nestimated that Medicare and Medicaid alone will spend $2 billion on \nthese drugs between 2006 and 2015. In my opinion, those dollars could \nbe spent more wisely.\n  When we crafted the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, our \nbipartisan agreement sought to strike the most reasonable balance for \nMedicare beneficiaries and hard working taxpayers. We wanted to make \nsure that beneficiaries had access to life-saving and life-improving \nmedicines. Now some certainly may argue that these ``lifestyle'' drugs \ncan improve your life. I\n\n[[Page S5855]]\n\nappreciate that view. However, we live in a world of limited resources, \nand in that world of limited resources coverage of these ``lifestyle'' \ndrugs under Medicare--or any other Federal program, in my opinion--is \ninconsistent with that goal of balance. I am pleased to join with \nSenators Lott, Santorum, and Ensign in working to rectify that \nsituation today and urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 1114. A bill to establish minimum drug testing standards for major \nprofessional sports leagues; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senator Stevens in \nintroducing the Clean Sports Act of 2005. The chairman of the House \nGovernment Reform Committee, Congressman Davis, and the ranking member \nof that committee, Congressman Waxman, are introducing a companion bill \ntoday in the House.\n  The purpose of this bill is to protect the integrity of professional \nsports and, more importantly, the health and safety of our Nation's \nyouth, who, for better or for worse, see professional athletes as role \nmodels. The legislation would achieve that goal by establishing minimum \nstandards for the testing of steroids and other performance-enhancing \nsubstances by major professional sports leagues. By adhering to--and \nhopefully exceeding--these minimum standards, the Nation's major \nprofessional sports leagues would send a strong signal to the public \nthat performance-enhancing drugs have no legitimate role in American \nsports.\n  This bill would prohibit our country's major professional sports \nleagues--the National Football League, Major League Baseball, the \nNational Basketball Association, and the National Hockey League--from \noperating if they do not meet the minimum testing requirements set \nforth therein. Those standards would be comprised of five key \ncomponents: the independence of the entity or entities that perform the \nleagues' drug tests; testing for a comprehensive list of doping \nsubstances and methods; a strong system of unannounced testing; \nsignificant penalties that discourage the use of performance-enhancing \ndrugs; and a fair and effective adjudication process for athletes \naccused of doping. These elements are crucial components of any \ncredible performance-enhancing drug testing policy.\n  More specifically, the bill would require all major professional \nsports leagues to have an independent third party administer their \nperformance-enhancing drug tests. The legislation would further require \nthat samples provided by athletes be tested by laboratories approved by \nthe United States Anti-Doping Agency--USADA--and for substances banned \nby USADA. In addition, the bill would require not fewer than three \nunannounced tests during a league's season of play, and at least two \nunannounced tests during the off season. Under this legislation, if a \nplayer were to test positive for a banned performance-enhancing \nsubstance, that player would be suspended for 2 years for the first \nviolation and banned for life for a second violation. Finally, if any \nplayer were to test positive, the professional sports league would be \nobligated to ensure that the player would have substantial due process \nrights including the opportunity for a hearing and right to counsel.\n  To ensure that the major professional sports leagues meet the highest \nstandards of performance-enhancing drug testing, the bill would require \neach professional sports league to consult with USADA in developing its \ndrug testing standards and procedures, its protocols for tests in the \noff season, and its athlete adjudication program. For 5 years, USADA \nhas served as the official antidoping agency for Olympic sports in the \nUnited States. In that role, USADA has shown a tremendous dedication to \neliminating doping in sports through research, education, testing, and \nadjudication efforts. The expertise that it has developed over the past \nhalf-decade would serve this country's professional sports leagues \nwell.\n\n  A violation of this legislation would be treated as a violation of \nthe Federal Trade Commission Act. The Federal Trade Commission would \nhave the ability to either obtain an injunction against the league that \nis in violation of the bill or seek penalties of up to $1 million per \nviolation. Any enforcement mechanism that is not as strong as this \nwould simply not be effective to ensure that these multi-billion-dollar \nbusinesses adhere to the minimum standards set forth in the \nlegislation.\n  Finally, the bill would give the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy--ONDCP--the ability to add other professional sports leagues as \nwell as certain college sports if the ONDCP were to determine that such \nadditions would prevent the use of performance-enhancing substances by \nhigh school, college, or professional athletes. The bill would also \nrequire the United States Boxing Commission, upon its establishment, to \npromulgate steroids testing standards consistent with those contained \nin the bill.\n  The need for reforming the drug testing policies of professional \nsports is clear. However, I introduce this legislation reluctantly. \nOver a year ago, I stated publicly that the failure of professional \nsports--and in particular Major League Baseball--to commit to \naddressing the issue of doping straight on and immediately would \nmotivate Congress to search for legislative remedies. Despite my clear \nwarning and the significant attention that Congress has given to this \nstain on professional sports, baseball, and other professional leagues \nhave refused to do the right thing.\n  By introducing this bill, I am once again asking the leagues to shore \nup the integrity of professional sports. I am asking the leagues to \nrealize that what is at stake here is not the sanctity of collective \nbargaining agreements, but rather the health and safety of America's \nchildren. Like it or not, our Nation's kids look to professional \nathletes as role models and take cues from their actions, both good and \nbad.\n  I remain hopeful that professional sports will reform their drug \ntesting policies on their own--a modest proposal in the eyes of \nreasonable people. However, the introduction of this bill demonstrates \nthe continued seriousness with which Congress views this issue. It \nshould be seen as a renewed incentive for the leagues to clean up their \nsports on their own without Government interference.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 1115. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nIndian tribes to receive charitable contributions of inventory; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that will \nhelp increase the amount of food donations going to American Indians \nand Alaska Natives nationwide. I am pleased to have Mr. Johnson join me \nin introducing this important legislation.\n  Despite reports from the Census Bureau that show stable income levels \nfor many Americans, the poverty rate for the 4.4 million American \nIndians and Alaska Natives living throughout the United States remains \nnearly three times that of non-Hispanic whites. Not only do Natives \nface greater challenges in securing basic household necessities, but in \nsecuring food as well.\n  According to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report released in late \n2004, nearly 36 million Americans face challenges in getting enough \nfood to eat. This includes nearly 13 million children. Of these \nstatistics, Natives constitute a disproportionate number due to the \nhigher poverty rate among this group.\n  And yet, charitable organizations that provide hunger relief are \nunable to meet the basic needs of Natives due to an oversight in the \nFederal tax code. Section 170(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code allows \ncorporations to take an enhanced tax deduction for donations of food \ninventory; however, the food must be distributed to 501(c)(3) nonprofit \norganizations, such as food banks. Nonprofit organizations cannot then \ntransfer such donations to tribes. Although many donations to tribes \nare tax deductible under section 7871 of the Internal Revenue Code, \ntribes are not among the organizations listed under section 501(c)(3) \nof the Internal Revenue Code. To clarify, section 170(e)(3) does not \nallow tribes to be eligible recipients of corporate food donations to \nnonprofit organizations since they are not listed under section \n501(c)(3) as an eligible entity.\n\n[[Page S5856]]\n\n  With this legislation, we intend to make a simple correction to the \ntax code that clearly indicates that tribes are eligible recipients of \nfood donated under section 170(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. This \ncorrection is long overdue and would remedy an egregious inequity in \nthe Federal tax code that affects Natives nationwide.\n\n  Please allow me to provide a few examples of how this legislation \ncould foster positive change. In Alaska, approximately half of the food \ndonated to the Food Bank of Alaska from corporations could go to tribes \nthroughout Alaska. Much of this food would go to villages that are only \naccessible by air or water. In South Dakota, roughly 30 percent of the \nfood the Community Food Banks of South Dakota distributes would go to \nreservations. In North Dakota, the amount of food donated to the Great \nPlains Food Bank could double if this legislation were enacted. The \nMontana Food Bank Network projects that food donations could increase \nby 16 percent. A food bank based in Albuquerque, NM estimates that \ntheir food donations could triple in the first year alone.\n  It is imperative that we address this important issue expeditiously. \nThe health and well-being of low income American Indians and Alaska \nNatives across the Nation is at stake.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1115\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Tomorrow, following morning business, the Senate will \nresume consideration of Priscilla Owen to be U.S. circuit judge for the \nFifth Circuit. Under a previous agreement, at 12 noon tomorrow, we will \nproceed to the vote on the confirmation.\n  Following the vote on the Owen nomination, it is my expectation that \nwe will move forward with the nomination of John Bolton to be \nambassador to the United Nations. Our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle have indicated they would need a good deal of time to debate \nthe nomination. We plan to complete action on the Bolton nomination \nthis week, and I will work with the Democratic leader to lock in a time \nagreement on the nomination.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the distinguished majority leader will \nyield, I think it is appropriate that we have this vote at noon. We \nwould have been willing to have it earlier. This way the committees can \ngo about their business. I know I have a ranking members meeting at 12. \nSo this will work out perfect. Even though we are waiting for the vote, \nI think this will work out well for the schedule.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we have a good plan for the remainder of \nthe week with that vote and proceeding with the nomination of John \nBolton.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/24/senate-section/article/S5857-6", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
