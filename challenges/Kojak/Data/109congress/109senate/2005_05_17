Mr. President, for the past week, I have come to the \nSenate floor to briefly discuss my recent factfinding mission to the \nMiddle East, having had the opportunity to travel to Israel, the West \nBank, Egypt, Lebanon, and Jordan 2 weeks ago.\n  I will conclude these Mideast reports with a very brief discussion of \nmy time in Jordan.\n  We began the Jordan leg of our trip with a visit to King Abdullah. \nSon of the much admired King Hussein, King Abdullah has been a trusted \nand valuable friend to the United States and a steadfast partner in the \nwar on terrorism.\n\n  We discussed Jordan's progress toward economic reform. Jordan is \nembarking upon free market reforms and encouraging the growth of small \nbusiness and entrepreneurs. We know in the American experience that \nentrepreneurship is that engine of economic and job growth. I am \nencouraged by the progress that King Abdullah is making, and I am \nhopeful the Jordanian economy flourishes. As it does so, it will become \na model of reform throughout the Middle East.\n  We also talked about the importance of the U.S.-Jordanian partnership \nin the peace process. King Abdullah's father exhibited great courage \nand foresight as he led his nation to peace with Israel in the 1990s.\n  Because of Jordan's relations with Israel and its special ties to the \nPalestinians, Jordan can be a substantial contributor to the peace \nprocess. By coordinating our efforts, I believe Jordan and the United \nStates can help the parties build momentum toward a peaceful \nresolution.\n\n[[Page S5250]]\n\n  During a dinner meeting with King Abdullah, we were joined by Jim \nWolfenson, the former head of the World Bank. Dr. Wolfenson was \nrecently selected, as my colleagues know, by President Bush to handle \nthe upcoming Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, focusing on the \nquartet of partners and building the appropriate support. I applaud the \nPresident for his choice in this emissary. Not only is Dr. Wolfenson \neminently capable, but he knows many of the important players directly, \nprofessionally, and personally, and he appreciates the stakes and I am \nconfident he can get the job done.\n  Dr. Wolfenson understands the transition must go well. If it does \nnot, violent unrest and instability could destroy this, what I believe \nis a historic chance for peace. The Jordanians have been an invaluable \npartner in Operation Enduring Freedom. They have made tremendous \ncontributions to the Iraqi people's efforts to secure a free and \nprosperous Iraq.\n  We have witnessed the extraordinary bravery of the Iraqis at the \npolling booths and at the police recruitment centers. They have been \nwilling to defy the terrorists and assume an active role in securing \ndemocracy.\n  Many of those courageous Iraqis are acquiring the training and skills \nneeded to defend their country by completing a security course and \npolice training regimen in Jordan.\n  We had the opportunity, while in Jordan, to visit the Jordan-Iraq \nPolice Training Center, a truly unique effort where 16 countries have \ncome together, including the United States, Jordan, Britain, Canada, \nFinland, and others, to train the Iraqi security force--to train the \nIraqi police. The director of the facility is John Moseby, a highly \nqualified veteran of the U.S. Air Force.\n  The center's goal in Jordan is to train 32,000 Iraqi police by \nDecember 2005. Already, the center has graduated over 15,000 recruits, \nwho have gone back to Iraq to serve in security positions. There are \ncurrently 40 Iraqi trainers at the site in Jordan, and the center hopes \nto add another 60. It sits on about 450 acres and can train about 3,500 \ncadets per session.\n  I wanted to go to the Jordan-Iraq Police Training Center to see \nfirsthand how those exercises are conducted because there has been some \nquestion in the past as to the adequacy and the quality of that \ntraining. Having had the opportunity to meet the cadets, both an \nincoming class and classes that were leaving, viewing many of the \nexercises, viewing, with the leaders there, the commitment to a quality \ncurriculum, I am very reassured they are doing an outstanding job in \ntraining those Iraqi recruits to go back and keep their communities and \ntheir streets safe.\n  The Iraqi cadets told us of their hope and appreciation for America's \nhelp in building a new Iraq. I am confident that by their courage and \ntheir commitment, freedom will prevail in Iraq and the dark forces that \nnow threaten their country will be defeated.\n  The trip throughout the Middle East was fascinating and informative. \nWe met many vibrant and thoughtful people. Again and again, you hear, \nthroughout all the countries, this expressed hope, the universal dream \nof hope that the people of the Middle East will one day be truly free--\nfree from violence and oppression, free to express their will through \ndemocratically elected leaders, free to express themselves in the town \nsquare without fear of violence or terrorism.\n  I do applaud President Bush for his vision and for his unwavering \nbelief in the dignity and rights of all people. From Darfur to \nDamascus, from Baghdad to Beirut, liberty is the hope of mankind.\n  Here in the Senate, I encourage and urge my colleagues to continue to \ndo our part to ensure that these principles help shape the future of \nthe Middle East. I believe together, with our partners around the \nglobe, we can spread prosperity and peace. I believe it is the only \nway.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/17/senate-section/article/S5250-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I have listened to the leader's statements \nthese past days on his trip to the Middle East. It is a fascinating \nplace. I returned about a month ago myself. But the one thing that I \nalways see in the Middle East is this tiny, little State of Israel, \nsurrounded by these other countries that are about as undemocratic as a \ncountry could be.\n  Israel is a democracy. Every day we hear about what is going on in \nthe Middle East, we should realize that. Israel has risen above this. \nThey maintain their democratic principles in spite of the violence that \nis going on, on a daily basis, in that part of the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/17/senate-section/article/S5250-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5250-S5251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday afternoon the majority leader and \nI met one last time trying to reach a compromise that would avert the \nso-called nuclear option. The so-called nuclear option is nothing that \nwe named. I know for cosmetic purposes those in the majority now have \ntried to call it a ``constitutional option,'' which must be directly \nout of Orwell's book ``1984'' because it means everything but a \nconstitutional option. The name came from the Republican leadership \nlast year. So the ``nuclear option'' is a name from the majority, not \nus.\n  I do not know if they met with my friend, Frank Luntz, or with whom \nthey met to change the name from ``nuclear option'' to a softer \nsounding proposal, ``constitutional option.'' As I said, violating 217 \nyears of standard procedure in the Senate, changing the rules by \nbreaking the rules, is about as far as you could get from a \nconstitutional option.\n  But it appears that my distinguished friend, the majority leader, \ncannot accept any solution which does not guarantee all current and \nfuture judicial nominees an up-or-down vote. That result is \nunacceptable to me because it is inconsistent with constitutional \nchecks and balances. It would essentially eliminate the role of the \nSenate minority in confirming judicial nominations and turn the Senate \ninto a rubber stamp for the President's choices. In fact, the majority \nshould look carefully at what they are getting because not only would \nthis eliminate the role of the Senate's minority but also the majority \nin judicial confirmations. The majority would be eliminated, too. The \nSenate would no longer have a role.\n  I can only conclude that the true purpose of the nuclear option is \nnot to win confirmation of some or all of the small handful of nominees \nDemocrats filibustered last year. Remember, today it stands at 208 to \n10. And focusing on the number 10 is somewhat misleading because of the \n10, 3 have either withdrawn or retired. And we have said, time and time \nagain, that 2 of the remaining 7 we would agree to 10 minutes from \nnow--2 Michigan judges. So it is really 208 to 5--208 to 5.\n  So the goal, it appears to me, of the Republican leadership--and note \nI do not say of the mainstream Republicans in this country, I do not \nsay of the Republicans in the Senate--but, rather, the goal of the \nRepublican leadership in this body and their allies in the White House \nis to pave the way for the future, so that the Senate would basically \nbe eliminated from the confirmation process. They don't want consensus, \nthey want confrontation.\n  Yesterday, after rejecting our last attempt at a compromise, the \nmajority leader issued a statement. In this statement, the majority \nleader said there is going to be an upcoming debate over judicial \nnominations, and he said he hoped the upcoming debate is free from \n``procedural gimmicks like the filibuster.'' That is a quote: \n``procedural gimmicks like the filibuster,'' ``procedural gimmicks like \nthe filibuster.''\n  We had a freshman Senator go to the Middle East and tell the leader \nof Iraq that the United States was different than any other country in \nthe world because of the filibuster--a Republican Senator. A gimmick?\n  The filibuster is not a procedural gimmick. The filibuster is an \nimportant check on executive power and part of every Senator's right to \nfree speech in the Senate. Robert Byrd, on Thursday, from this desk \nright behind mine, talked about free speech.\n  Senator Robert Byrd has been in the Senate for approximately 25 \npercent of\n\n[[Page S5251]]\n\nthe time this country has existed. I should say in the Congress--47 \nyears in the Senate, 6 years in the House of Representatives--more than \n50 years, approximately 25 percent of the time that we have been a \ncountry. He should know something about free speech. He was here on the \nSenate floor when the great Margaret Chase Smith, a Republican Senator \nfrom Maine, talked about the value of free speech in the Senate. He was \nin the Senate when the Republican Howard Baker talked about the \nimportance of the filibuster in protecting our democracy. A gimmick? I \nthink not.\n  Senator Byrd was in the Senate when the debate over civil rights took \nplace. I heard Barack Obama upstairs with the press corps say: Isn't it \ninteresting, the filibuster was used against African Americans but they \nworked around it and prevailed in spite of it. They didn't move to \nchange the rules in the middle of the game.\n  Senator Robert Byrd was here when Dan Inouye, the Medal of Honor \nwinner from Hawaii, a new Senator, came to the floor, and as an Asian \nAmerican whose friends and family were put in internment camps during \nthe Second World War, spoke on the Senate floor about what it means to \nbe a minority and how the filibuster should be available to protect the \nminority. A gimmick? I think not.\n  Over the years, the filibuster has proven to be an important tool of \nmoderation and consensus, which partly explains why the Republican \nleadership is opposed to it. They aren't interested in moderation. They \nare only interested in advancing their right-wing, radical political \nagenda, an agenda being driven by the people who are saying we are \nfilibustering against people of faith.\n  Mr. President, every day--for 23 years--with rare exception, I go to \nthe House gym and work out. There I met Congressman Rush Holt. He is a \nnuclear scientist, a Congressman from New Jersey. Rush's father, also \nnamed Rush Holt, served in this Chamber in the late 1930s. As a \nfreshman United States Senator, he led a filibuster to preserve wage \nand hour protections for American workers. Rush Holt, Jr., is so proud \nof his father. He talked to me about the pride he had in his father \nbeing a United States Senator, and he told me this story about the \nfilibuster his father conducted alone to preserve wage and hour \nprotections that had come about as part of the New Deal. He wasn't \nusing a political gimmick. He was using something that was part of the \nvision of our Founding Fathers, something they wanted in this body to \nmake it unique and different--free speech. An important tool to stand \nup for working men and women in this country, that is what Senator Rush \nHolt, Sr., was using.\n  Of course, the filibuster has not always been used for good. I \nacknowledge that. Just as it has been used to bring about social \nchange, it was also used to stall progress--I have talked about that--\nthings this country needed to change, such as civil rights legislation.\n  But Senator Barack Obama speaks in favor of the filibuster. He \nunderstands, as an African American, why it is important. But at these \ntimes people have spoken and public opinion has spurred this Chamber \ninto action, as indicated, it brings about compromise. So you see the \nfilibuster is not a political gimmick. It is part of the fabric of this \ninstitution we call the Senate, the greatest debating society in the \nworld--or at least it has been so far. Is that going to be taken away \nfrom us?\n  While I was in the gym this morning, Mr. President, I was stopped by \na Republican House Member. I will not name him for fear the Republican \nleadership in the House will remove him from a subcommittee or whatever \nthey do to punish people over there, and we know that happens. But \neveryone within the sound of my voice should know that I am telling the \ntruth. A Republican House Member came to me this morning and said: I \nnever thought I would say this to the Democratic leader of the Senate, \nbut I am praying for you, that you prevail in this battle going on in \nthe Senate. A Republican House Member is praying for me and this \ninstitution to maintain the institution as it is.\n  So as the moment of truth draws near, I, too, am praying, Mr. \nPresident. I do not say that lightly. I pray that cooler heads will \nprevail and the responsible Republicans--and they are there, I know \nthey are there--such as this Congressman who spoke to me this morning, \nwill join Democrats in standing up against this abuse of power, to \nmaintain our checks and balances, to maintain the separation of powers \nthat has made this country the power that it is, one that the world \nlooks upon with awe, inspiration and admiration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/17/senate-section/article/S5251-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we awoke today to see news of a breakdown \nin negotiations to end the so-called nuclear confrontation that some \nRepublicans are driving this body toward.\n  I want to take a minute to thank our leader, Senator Reid, who I \nbelieve is really doing his best to preserve the tradition and the \nprecedent of the Senate through good-faith negotiations. He put forth a \ngood-faith compromise proposal only to see it rejected out of hand. \nThis breakdown really marks a sad day for this body.\n  More than 200 years ago, the Senate was created as part of the Great \nCompromise, and for the balance of those 200 years, compromise has been \ncentral to any and all of the great work that has been completed by the \nSenate. The rules are set up here to assure that the Senate serves as a \ncenter for Government compromise. We have a system of checks and \nbalances, with the Senate checking the President through advice and \nconsent and the President checking the Congress with the use of the \nveto. And all the while we have an independent judiciary that is \nempowered to balance out the system. Those checks and balances were put \nin place for a reason. They promote compromise, they promote \npreservation of minority rights, and they ensure that our system of \ngovernment works for all of the people. Unfortunately, the goal of some \nbecomes clearer each passing day in this body that they are not \ninterested in compromise on the so-called nuclear option. If this \nSenate does remove the last check in Washington against an abuse of \npower, the majority will be able to appoint to lifetime seats on the \nSupreme Court and the Federal bench anyone they want.\n  The American people have rejected court packing before and I believe \nthey will again. We are united against the abuse of power known as this \nnuclear option. We believe that Senators were sent here to serve all \nAmericans, not to promote political agendas of one faction. Mr. \nPresident, Democrats will join responsible Republicans to fight this \nabuse of power and get back to the real work of the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/17/senate-section/article/S5251-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5251-S5253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MOUNT ST. HELENS ERUPTION\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nWashington State to very proudly mark the 25th anniversary of the day \nthat Mount St. Helens erupted in my home State of Washington and will \nbe joining with her later to offer a resolution to commemorate this \nanniversary.\n  For anyone who lived in the Pacific Northwest at the time, May 18, \n1980, is a day we will never forget. It was a day that changed lives \nand it changed the landscape of Washington State forever. It was also a \nday that imposed a heavy toll in lost lives and lost habitat. Fifty-\nseven people were killed that day. More than 230 acres of forest were \nleveled in an instant.\n  Mr. President, the story of Mount St. Helens is a story of \ndestruction, but it is also a story of renewal, a story of science, and \na story of the importance of preparation. Today I rise to share that \nstory and the lessons that it holds for us now 25 years later.\n  Perhaps the best place to start really is the day before the \neruption, when Mount St. Helens was really a beautiful and striking \nfeature of landscape\n\n[[Page S5252]]\n\nin the State that I was born and raised in.\n  This photo behind me shows what the mountain looked like before the \neruption. As you can see, it had a nearly perfect dome, and it was \nrecognized as one of the most symmetrical mountains in the world. It \nwas surrounded by lush forests and beautiful streams and rivers and \nlakes and the area was filled with wildlife of all kinds. But danger \nlurked right beneath that tranquil landscape.\n  May 8, 1980, began as a beautiful, sunny morning in the Northwest. I \nremember it well, sitting at home with my two young children at the \ntime. Meanwhile, below the surface, Mount St. Helens was anything but \ncalm. At 8:32 a.m, a 5.1-magnitude earthquake occurred, and that \nsparked massive eruptions which would last for 9 hours. This photo \nshows some of what followed. Within minutes, this massive cloud of ash \nand toxic gas spouted 15 miles into the air. You could see it from many \nplaces in my State. A 300-mile-per-hour blast shot from the mountain, \nknocking down all of the evergreen stands as if they were matchsticks. \nThe entire north face of the mountain gave way to this massive mud \nslide, and that mud slide carried hot water and debris that it picked \nup over the surrounding landscape.\n\n  The eruption itself released 24 megatons of energy. It destroyed all \nforms of life within the 18-mile blast zone, including roughly 7,000 \nbear, elk, and deer. The scope of this devastation on that day was \nenormous. The hot ash from this eruption, combined with the melting \nsnow at the mountain top, created massive mud flows. This was not just \na local event. More than 500 million tons of that ash was blown \neastward across the United States 250 miles away in Spokane, WA. That \ntraveling ash turned day into night for everyone who was there, and by \nJune, a few months later, ash could be found from Mount St. Helens on \nthe other side of the world.\n  As we now mark the 25th anniversary, I wanted to come here to the \nfloor today with my colleague from Washington State, Senator Cantwell, \nto pay tribute to the 57 men and women who died on that day. Some of \nthem were there enjoying the area's beautiful scenery, some were drawn \nto the mountain for scientific study, and others were long-time \nresidents who lived there who refused to give up the only homes they \nhad ever known.\n  When that dust settled and the mountain quieted, nearly 150,000 acres \nof public and private land had been destroyed.\n  This photo behind me shows some of that destruction. That stand of \ntrees was blown down in an instant. The mountain's nearly perfect dome \nwas turned into a crater. The Toutle River, which had been vibrant and \ngreen before, a great place in my State, was now a dark, gray expanse.\n  Then President Jimmy Carter toured the site and later remarked:\n\n       Someone said this area looked like a moonscape. But the \n     Moon looks more like a golf course compared to what's up \n     there.\n\n  Everyone knew that wildlife restoration would be a major challenge. \nWithin weeks of the eruption, however, many dedicated foresters and \nbiologists returned to the area to assess the damages and help with the \nrecovery. One of the strongest leaders in this revitalization has been \nthe Weyerhaeuser Company. It lost nearly 68,000 acres of forest that \nday, making the company the largest private landowner impacted by this \neruption. The company was able to replant over 45,000 acres with over \n18 million seedlings. Weyerhaeuser has been committed to restoring the \narea through sustainable forestry. Now, 25 years later, many of those \ntrees they planted in the wake of the eruption are now amazingly ready \nfor thinning, and final harvesting will begin in another 20 years which \nwill pave the way for the forest cycle to recommence. The U.S. Forest \nService made similar efforts. On 14,000 acres of National Forest land, \nthe Forest Service has planted nearly 10 million trees since 1980. In \nAugust of 1982, Congress established the 110,000-acre Mount St. Helens \nNational Volcanic Monument.\n  The monument allows unhindered natural growth and serves as a \nresource for visitors and academics.\n  Within weeks of the eruption, signs of life literally sprouted \nthrough the layers of destruction.\n  As forests were replanted and vegetation again took root, the \nwildlife also began to return.\n  Roosevelt elk and Columbia black-tailed deer, for example, along with \nsmall birds and mammals, reestablished their habitats.\n  Today the area is a testament to the enduring circle of life, as \ngreen hills surround the crater, and blue waters flow through the \nvalley once again.\n  As the ecosystem rebuilds, we are constantly reminded of the wealth \nof knowledge available from the monument itself.\n  Thousands of people have been drawn to the mountain to see the \nevidence of this power and to learn from its effects.\n  For many, the eruption sparked a new interest in the earth sciences.\n  It has provided new insight on seismology and volcanology, helping \nstudents and scientists to better understand the earth's natural \nmovement.\n  Representatives of the U.S. Geological Survey have teamed with \nresearchers at local and national universities to process the data and \nto continue monitoring movement beneath the ground.\n  Teachers from across the country have brought hundreds of student \ngroups to the Forest Service's three visitor centers. There, students \nstudy the eruption and the reemerging wildlife.\n  Now what was once a bleak scene of destruction is now a living \nmonument and an educational resource.\n  Although 25 years have passed, there is still much we can learn from \nthe eruption of Mount St. Helens.\n  Just last fall, we were reminded that we haven't heard the last from \nthis mountain.\n  After 18 years of relative quiet, a series of small quakes have \noccurred in October.\n  And in March, just 2 months ago--the mountain released a 36,000 foot \nplume of steam.\n  Today, inside the crater, the lava dome continues to grow. That is a \nsure sign that there is far more activity to come.\n  The most important lesson we can learn from the eruption is the need \nto improve our warning and response systems.\n  While we may never be able to fully protect surrounding communities, \nwe can help reduce the risk.\n  For months before the 1980 blast, scientists from the USGS had \nmonitored Mount St. Helens and were able to predict that an eruption \nwas likely in the near future.\n  As a result, most people stayed away from the mountain. We must \ncontinue to support the efforts of the scientists and local officials \nwho keep us all safe.\n  Unfortunately, according to a recent USGS report, monitoring of high-\nrisk volcanoes in the U.S. leaves a lot to be desired. Of the 169 \nvolcanoes, 55 qualify as being a ``high risk'' for eruption.\n  After Kilauea in Hawaii, Mount St. Helens ranks second on the list of \nhigh-risk peaks.\n  Mount Rainier, also in Washington State, is ranked third, followed by \nMount Hood in Oregon and Mount Shasta in California.\n  Millions of people live near these mountains, making their monitoring \nand study a critical undertaking.\n  I want to personally commend the hundreds of dedicated scientists and \nlocal, state and federal officials who are keeping a close eye on these \nmountains in Washington State.\n  Their work is helping to ensure that the public is better prepared \nfor any future disaster.\n  We can honor those who died 25 years ago by learning from the \neruption and improving our ability to predict and respond to natural \ndisasters.\n  While we have been fortunate not to have a major eruption in the U.S. \nsince Mount St. Helens, the tsunami tragedy in Asia once again reminded \nus of the power of events beyond our control.\n  We know there is more to come, so together, I hope we make sure we \nare well-prepared, and our communities are well-protected.\n  My colleague from Washington State, Senator Cantwell, is on the \nfloor. I welcome her.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague in the \nresolution commemorating the 25th anniversary of the eruption of Mount \nSt. Helens. I thank my colleague for working on the resolution to \ncommemorate this historic event. Not only for Washington State and the \nNorthwest, but\n\n[[Page S5253]]\n\nfor our country, May 18 marks an incredible landmark in time for people \nin the Northwest and certainly marks a critical response by our Federal \nGovernment. It also allows us to reflect on the progress we have made \nas a nation to develop a greater understanding about the more than 160 \nactive volcanoes in the United States.\n  For over 100 years, Mount St. Helens stood in silence, a relatively \ndormant peak and serene part of the Pacific Northwest. But on the \nmorning of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens erupted releasing a plume of \nash that filled the sky, circling the Earth in just 15 days. The \ndestructive eruption eviscerated everything in its path and tore \nthrough miles of trees.\n  Today, 25 years later, the effect of the 1980 eruption remains \nevident, and the rumbling of Mount St. Helens over the past several \nmonths reminds many of us, particularly in Washington State, of those \nevents on May 18, 1980. The level of activity of Mount St. Helens, \ncombined with the unpredictability of it, makes it very special for \nWashingtonians. We embrace the mountain's beauty but remain in profound \nrespect of its power and weary of a repeat eruption similar to 1980.\n  What is important to understand is that Mount St. Helens, located 90 \nmiles south of Seattle and 65 miles north of Portland, OR, when it \nexploded, released such hot steam that it actually melted 70 percent of \nthe snow and ice on top of the mountain. To give you a sense of that \nenormity, Mount St. Helens was, prior to this, the ninth highest peak \nin the State of Washington. It has now been reduced about 1,300 feet. \nThe avalanche that was created by that explosion was close to two-\nthirds of a cubic mile of debris. The Geological Survey estimates that \nwould be enough to cover Washington, DC, in more than 14 feet of ash \nand mud. That is basically what the Northwest dealt with when this \nexplosion happened in 1980. We saw flows of rock and ice covering \nvarious parts of the north fork of the Toutle River, debris running \ndown those pathways wherever it could go. The eruption destroyed 27 \nbridges that were part of our highway structure, 200 hundred homes, 185 \nmiles of roadway, and 15 miles of railway.\n  What is unique about this is that Congress responded. We responded \nbecause of the devastation to the physical and environmental \ninfrastructure but also because of the loss of life. My colleague and I \nare here to commemorate those 57 Washingtonians who died in the \nincident, and one particular individual, David Johnston, who was with \nthe U.S. Geological Survey. What this anniversary marks is the great \nstrides we've made as a Nation to response to science in this area.\n  David Johnston, by comparison, in 1980 had been studying Mount St. \nHelens for many months. In fact, on the morning of the explosion, he \nwas 6 miles away on what is now called Johnston Ridge. Many of my \ncolleagues may, if they turned on the TV in the last several months to \nsee rumblings of Mount St. Helens, seen many observers, and many \nmembers of the media stationed on Johnston Ridge. When Mount St. Helens \nerupted on that day, David Johnston, who was our monitoring system at \nMount St. Helens only had an opportunity to say: Vancouver, this is it. \nAnd the eruption took his life.\n  Where we are today is that we have volcanologists, geologists, \nseismologists in what is a robust system of emergency response. The \nU.S. Geological Survey, the U.S. Forest Service, the Department of \nInterior, the National Guard and Federal Emergency Management Agency \nunder the Department of Homeland Security, and the Cascade Volcanic \nObservatory in Vancouver, WA, all provide us with a much greater sense \nof what is going on with Mount St. Helens and what the emergency \nresponse should be in the event of a similar explosion.\n  My colleague mentioned that we have seen a lot of rumblings lately on \nMount St. Helens, and certainly those eruptions have caused concern. \nBut I think today's anniversary reminds us that as a nation we \nresponded to this activity with a better warning system, and with a \nmuch better understanding of volcanic activity in the United States. \nWith the 162 active volcanoes in the United States, we in the Northwest \nwant to see good research on this. The fact that Mt. Rainier and other \nmountains are much closer to great population centers of Washington \nState is something for which we want to continue to have an investment \nin good science.\n  I join my colleague Senator Murray and thank her for commemorating \nthe events of May 18, 1980, as a particular point in time for \nWashingtonians and for our country. But as I stated this commemoration \nis also significant because it speaks to the advancements in science \nthat our country has achieved in better preparing to respond to this \ntype of emergency. When I think about the science we have applied as it \nrelates to volcano monitoring, I am confident that with similar \nactivity and research as it relates to tsunami activity--something that \nalso could greatly impact the Northwest--we can better prepare for an \nevent of that nature as well. It gives me a great deal of hope that we \nwill, through better mapping, through better geological information, \nbetter seismic information, provide Washingtonians with greater \nsecurity and safety.\n  As most of my State will be seeing many pictures of the eruption in \n1980, I thank my colleagues from past Congresses for their support in \ngiving us a Cascade Volcanic Observatory in the State of Washington and \nfor the work the men and women do in various Federal agencies that \nprovide us better scientific information and a better warning systems \nfor our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/17/senate-section/article/S5253-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5253-S5254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SURFACE TRANSPORTATION\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to comment \non the surface transportation act we are going to hopefully pass today \nand a particular provision that I was happy to work on with my \ncolleagues Senators Inouye, Stevens, and Lott, regarding giving \nconsumers better protection and accurate information about gasoline \nconsumption. Americans today are facing a painful reality at the gas \npump, so the least we can do is to make sure the mileage stickers on \ntheir cars match up with the reality of the road. That will help them \nand their families make better budget plans and make better choices \nwhen buying automobiles.\n  It is simply that we need to have truth in labeling for stickers on \nautomobiles. But today gas mileage stickers that appear on cars \nbasically inflate the true vehicle fuel economy performance by anywhere \nfrom 10 to 30 percent.\n  That is because the Federal Government laboratory tests, on which \nthis outdated procedures rely, are false assumptions. For example, they \nassume people drive 48 miles per hour on the freeway, and they never \nuse air conditioning. Obviously, a variety of other things that \nrepresent technology improvements have not been considered in this \ntest. When a family is on a tight budget--and right now there are many \nAmericans on a tight budget--getting accurate information about vehicle \nfuel efficiency is important.\n  The provisions of this bill that are included in the surface \ntransportation act would direct EPA to issue a proposed rulemaking no \nlater than the end of this year and complete the process within 18 \nmonths. What it would do is encourage the Government to take into \naccount real-life conditions such as speed limits, acceleration rates, \nbraking, variations of weather and temperature, vehicle load, and a \nvariety of other fuel-consuming features.\n  It is important that we pass this kind of legislation. I know the \nAmerican Automobile Association supports this legislation, as do many \nother residents throughout the country who are consumers making gas-\nconscious choices when they buy automobiles. We need to give them \naccurate information.\n  I am glad the truth in labeling amendment we offered will be included \nas part of the package of the surface transportation act and hopefully \npass today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Senate \nSAFETEA bill that is before us, the Transportation bill. I first want \nto thank my colleague from Washington State for her leadership on so \nmany different issues, including provisions in the Transportation bill. \nI thank Senators Inhofe and Jeffords for drafting\n\n[[Page S5254]]\n\na good bill for the country and a good bill for Michigan.\n  I am pleased the Senate is passing this critical bill today. \nUnfortunately, this has been delayed for over 20 months and Congress \nhas passed six TEA-21 extensions. It is my hope that we will not have \nto pass a seventh and this bill will be completed before the end of the \nmonth. We have already lost one spring construction season in Michigan, \nand we certainly don't want to lose another.\n  During the budget debate, I worked with Senator Talent on a \nsuccessful amendment to help the Senate produce a well-funded highway \nbill and keep all the funding options on the table. This amendment was \nincluded in the final budget resolution, and I am pleased to say it \nhelped pave the way for the additional $11 billion that was added to \nthe Senate bill.\n  As my colleagues know, this bill isn't just about improving our \nroads, transit systems, and buses, but it is also about creating jobs. \nThe Department of Transportation estimates that for every $1 billion of \nhighway spending, we are creating 47,500 new jobs, and this generates \nmore than $2 billion in economic activity.\n  Mr. President, we need this bill. Michigan needs this bill. Over the \nlast 4 years, Michigan has lost jobs. The SAFETEA bill will create \ngood-paying jobs and help thousands of Michigan families make ends \nmeet. So it is absolutely critical we pass this bill today.\n  We are not talking about minimum-wage jobs, we are talking about \nwell-paying jobs that help Michigan families pay their mortgages, save \nfor retirement, and pay for their children's education. The SAFETEA \nbill will create over 59,000 jobs in Michigan alone.\n  Mr. President, this delay has also cost Michigan additional highway \nfunding that we desperately need. Our communities are growing, \ncongestion is getting worse, and our roads are worn down through \nincreased wear and tear, but we are still working under funding \nformulas that are over 7 years old.\n  In fact, Detroit ranks ninth nationally for having the worst traffic \ncongestion. That is even worse than the delays in Boston and \nPhiladelphia.\n  The Senate bill would provide Michigan with over $6.65 billion in \nhighway funding and $600 million in transit investment to help address \nour congested roads and increase bus service throughout our State. This \nalso is desperately needed.\n  We cannot fix these problems without a well-funded highway bill. \nUnfortunately, the House TEA-LU doesn't provide the resources we need \nto address our aging roads and transit systems. This also would mean \nfewer jobs for Michigan and the country.\n  I also add that the Senate bill continues to move us forward for \nMichigan to get its fair share. We are not there in terms of dollar for \ndollar, and I will continue to fight in every Transportation bill until \nwe get there. But we need to move forward so Michigan gets a better \nshare in this bill and a better opportunity to have the resources and \njobs we need.\n  As this bill goes to conference with the House, I urge my colleagues \nto stand behind the Senate bill. Once again, this Senate will be \npassing a bill that is better than what has been passed in the House. \nIt is more fair. I am very hopeful we will stand together on a \nbipartisan basis and insist that the Senate version ultimately be the \nversion that is passed.\n  We also need for the bill to be fair and for it to meet the needs of \nour communities, and we need to make sure we are creating as many jobs \nas possible. It is time to invest in the best possible resources for \nour Nation's transportation needs. I am pleased that because of the \nbipartisan effort in the Senate we will be having a vote today on final \npassage of this desperately needed bill. Hopefully, we will see it \ngoing to the President in a form that is fair for Michigan, for all of \nour States, and that it is something that will address the future needs \nof our country.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a very important \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution pending before the Senate. This \nresolution expresses support for a historic meeting taking place in \nHavana, Cuba, this Friday, May 20. It is called the Assembly to Promote \nthe Civil Society in Cuba. This resolution expresses support for the \ncourageous individuals who continue to fight for and advance liberty \nand democracy for the Cuban people.\n  I thank my colleague from Florida, Senator Bill Nelson, for \npartnering with me on this important effort. I also thank and commend \nthe 23 other colleagues who have signed on to this bipartisan effort in \ncosponsoring this resolution.\n  For too long, the Cuban people have been starved of the precious \nfreedoms so dearly cherished in the United States and in democracies \naround the world. This year, May 20 provides us with a unique \nopportunity to highlight and support efforts to advance liberty and \ndemocracy in Cuba.\n  I stress to my colleagues the tremendous valor and bravery of these \nprodemocracy advocates who are risking their lives pursuing their \nnatural God-given freedoms that they continue to be denied.\n  Already there have been reports of disappearances, state security \nintimidation, and of infrastructure interruptions by the regime in \norder to stop this gathering. For someone to travel from one part of \nCuba to another, within their country, citizens must seek the \ngovernment's permission before doing so. Transportation is made more \ndifficult and the ever-present Committees for the Defense of \nRevolution, which stand as government watchdogs in every neighborhood \nand on every street corner, provide even more intimidation and fear to \nthose who seek to attend this gathering.\n  May 20 has long marked an important day for the Cuban people. It was \non this day in 1902 that the island first gained its independence. This \nis a particularly poignant moment in history, when the United States \nfought side by side with the Cuban people as they sought to throw off \nthe yoke of colonialism. After 4 years of building a governmental \nstructure and helping the Cuban people to gain its governance, in 1902 \nthe United States ceded independence to the people of Cuba. It was on \nMay 20, 1902, that took place. This is what we currently are looking \nfor, for the Cuban people to be allowed to celebrate. The current Cuban \nGovernment prefers to celebrate other dates more in\n\n[[Page S5255]]\n\nkeeping with the beginnings of the dictatorship. But this day ought to \nbe remembered because of the importance it carries.\n  This year's Cuban Independence Day is historic. The people of Cuba \nare on the road to transition. The historic gathering this week of \nprodemocracy advocates demonstrates that Cubans are increasingly losing \ntheir fear and vocalizing their desire to be architects of their own \ndestinies and of their own future. This peaceful demonstration, a \nsimple display of freedom of assembly and speech, represents an \nunprecedented partnership for over 360 prodemocracy and civil society \norganizations from all walks of life. Their focus will be on bringing \ndemocracy, liberty, and a respect for basic human rights to this island \nnation.\n  The fact is, the Cuban Government has one of the worst human rights \nrecords in the world. There is a complete lack of human rights \navailable to the Cuban people under the tyranny of this repressive \nregime. They continue to deny universally recognized civil liberties, \nincluding freedom of speech, association, movement, and of the press. \nFreedom of religion is also denied.\n  As the recently released State Department report, ``Supporting Human \nRights and Democracy, The U.S. Record 2004-2005,'' relates:\n\n       [T]he Cuban Government ignored or violated virtually all of \n     its citizens' rights, including the fundamental right to \n     change their government. Indeed, the Government has quashed \n     all efforts to initiate a public debate on how Cuba can \n     prepare for a peaceful transition.\n\n  Just last month the United Nations Human Rights Commission once again \ncondemned Cuba for its human rights record.\n  Let's begin with labor rights. The Cuban Government has been cited by \nthe International Labor Organization and scores of governmental and \nnongovernmental organizations worldwide for its gross violations of \nhuman rights. With a state-controlled economy, the Government is the \nonly source of jobs, and it exercises very strict control over labor \npolicies. Specifically, as the 2004 human rights report relates:\n\n       The foreign investment law denies all workers except those \n     with special government permission the right to contract with \n     foreign companies investing in the country.\n\n  Further:\n\n       [The] government required foreign investors and diplomatic \n     missions to contract workers through state employment \n     agencies, which were paid in foreign currency, but which in \n     turn pay workers very low wages--\n\n  In the local currency. Typically, these workers receive 5 percent of \nthe salary paid by the companies to the State, and the workers receive \nworthless pesos while the company pays the governor in dollars. In \n2003, average salaries, for those lucky enough to be employed, equal \nabout $10 a month. Yet within the last year these salaries have fallen \neven further. In an attempt to reassert stricter control, the Castro \nregime has outlawed use of the U.S. dollar, thereby diminishing the \nvalue of Cuban wages even further. New directives have also been issued \nregarding the tourism industry, so as to impose additional control over \nthe actions of tourism workers.\n  At the same time, the Cuban Government has steadfastly rejected \ninternational human rights monitoring. As the 2004 State Department \nhuman rights report says:\n\n       The Government steadfastly rejected the human rights \n     monitoring. Since 1992, the Government has refused to \n     recognize the mandated UNCHR on Cuba, and despite being a \n     UNCHR member, refused to acknowledge requests by Christine \n     Chanet, the Personal Representative of the Commissioner on \n     Human Rights to visit the country.\n\n  It is critical we offer our bipartisan support to the patriotic \nparticipants of the May 20 gathering on the island, as well as to the \nmany brave men, women, and children who continue to challenge tyranny \nand oppression.\n  They need and deserve our support. These past few weeks alone, the \nnews is reporting that the regime has begun rounding up young people \nfor preventive security measures. The median age is 18, and 95 percent \nare Afro-Cuban. Specifically, our resolution includes four principal \nmessages: First, that the Senate extend its support in solidarity to \nthe participants of this historic meeting in Havana; second, that the \nSenate urges the international community to support the assembly and \nits mission to bring democracy and human rights to Cuba; third, that \nthe Senate encourages the international community to oppose any \nattempts by the Cuban Government to repress, punish, or intimidate the \norganizers or participants of the assembly; and fourth, that the Senate \nshares the prodemocracy ideals of the assembly to promote civil society \nin Cuba and believes that the assembly and its mission will advance \nfreedom and democracy for the people of Cuba.\n\n  The international community plays a very large role in helping \nprodemocracy movements, much as it did in Eastern Europe.\n  As President Bush recently remarked in his Second Inaugural Address:\n\n       All who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know the \n     United States will not ignore your oppression or excuse your \n     oppressors. When you stand for liberty, we will stand with \n     you.\n\n  That is what this resolution is all about--standing with the \nparticipants of the May 20 assembly and standing with the brave men and \nwomen who continue to live in tyranny and hopelessness. When you stand \nfor your liberty, we will stand with you. Our country's history has \nallowed us to observe the struggle of impatient patriots such as \nFrederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, and Martin Luther King and the \nmission they undertook to bring us closer to our democratic ideals.\n  These prodemocracy advocates today, these Cuban heroes, are today's \npatriots, and I have faith in them and the important mission they have \nundertaken. I stress to my colleagues the tremendous valor of those \nfolks who are today struggling for the God-given freedoms they continue \nto be denied.\n  The new democracies around the world are standing for freedom and are \neager to be a voice in the struggle for transition in Cuba. Our eyes \nshould all be on Havana this Friday to witness this historic event. It \nis a hopeful time for the Cuban people. I am inspired by their efforts \nand their bravery. We applaud their strength and their unity as they \ngather to fight for freedom and basic human rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be \nallowed to speak for 5 minutes on the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I join my colleague from \nFlorida and a number of other colleagues who have sponsored this \nresolution. This is a historic time for Cuba. The U.S. Government is \nredoubling its commitment to freedom and democracy around the world. We \nare watching as people around the globe demand accountability from \ntheir leaders, and the ability to participate in free, fair, and open \nelections. The winds of freedom are not only blowing in the Middle East \nbut also closer to home, near to our blessed shores of Florida--in \nfact, only 90 miles away from Key West.\n  Despite the horrific crackdown in 2003, Cuban civil society and \npolitical dissidents continue to meet and to carry out small actions to \nexpress their views on a daily basis. This takes courage. The wives of \nimprisoned dissidents march silently every Sunday following church \nservices. They are known as the Ladies In White. They march largely \nunopposed, despite attempts to intimidate and to pressure them.\n  A counterprotest was organized. It was organized once, but that \ncounterprotest has not been repeated.\n  This is just one of many examples of the Cuban people organizing in \nsmall groups, showing that Fidel Castro does not have the full support \nof his people and that all people of the world, including Cubans, \ndesire to be free.\n\n  A few of the dissidents rounded up in that 2003 crackdown have since \nbeen released because of the severity of their medical condition. Their \ntime served in Cuban jails has not curtailed their desire to bring \nfreedom to the people of Cuba. One of those individuals, Martha Beatriz \nRoque, continues her struggles unfazed by the experiences of a summary \ntrial and then imprisonment. And despite the fact that she runs the \nrisk every day of being returned to jail, she continues to fight for \nbasic rights and she continues to organize dissidents working towards \nthe ultimate goal of freedom.\n\n[[Page S5256]]\n\n  In an effort to heighten the level of international attention--\nattention to those brave souls' efforts--and in an effort to continue \nto create greater common cause among the groups of people on the \nisland, the Cuban dissidents are organizing this assembly to promote \ncivil society in Cuba. Over 300 civil society groups are expected to be \nrepresented at the meeting. The goal of the assembly is to discuss how \nthey will play a role in the transition after the end of the Castro \nregime. This end is approaching. The clock is ticking. We must be \nready, both on the island and around the world, to ensure that Cubans \nhave the opportunity to freely and fairly choose their successor \ngovernment.\n  Senator Martinez, my colleague from Florida, and I, along with 20 \ncolleagues, are encouraging the Senate to support this resolution, and \nin supporting this resolution, therefore, to support this assembly, its \nparticipants, and all civil society on the island, and to do it in a \nbipartisan fashion.\n  This resolution is an effort to bring international attention to the \nassembly and to all members of civil society on the island of Cuba. \nThese are brave individuals who deserve our support every day, not only \non these memorable and momentous occasions but every day in respect for \nwhat they have endured as their liberty has been taken away from them.\n  We want that liberty to return. Our thoughts and prayers will be with \nall these individuals.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/17/senate-section/article/S5256-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration H.R. 3, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3) to authorize funds for Federal-aid \n     highways, highway safety programs, and transit programs, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Inhofe amendment No. 605, to provide a complete substitute.\n       Allen/Ensign amendment No. 611 (to amendment No. 605), to \n     modify the eligibility requirements for States to receive a \n     grant under section 405 of title 49, United States Code.\n       Sessions Modified amendment No. 646 (to amendment No. 605), \n     to reduce funding for certain programs.\n       Reid (for Lautenberg) amendment No. 619 (to amendment No. \n     605), to increase penalties for individuals who operate motor \n     vehicles while intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol \n     under aggravated circumstances.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am very happy we finally got to this \npoint. We are operating under unanimous consent at this time.\n  We will have for the next 45 minutes a discussion and then a vote on \nthe Allen amendment at 12 o'clock. We will have this 45-minute period \nof time to talk about the highway bill, and hopefully we can confine \narguments to that, with the exception of 5 minutes for Senator Landrieu \nright before the vote takes place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 611\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma. I am \nglad we are going to be voting on my amendment around noon. I had \nthought it was going to be 11:30, but it is now noon.\n  Let me share with my colleagues the rationale behind amendment No. \n611 to the underlying bill.\n  I first thank my colleague, Senator Ensign of Nevada, for \ncosponsoring this amendment. The purpose of my amendment is to make \nsure that safety belt incentive grants are awarded based on a State's \nseatbelt use rate, not based upon a prescriptive mandate from the \nFederal Government that would make the States enact a primary seatbelt \nlaw to receive their Federal funds.\n  The way this bill came out of committee, in effect, for the States to \nget their money, they have to enact a primary enforcement seatbelt law. \nSeatbelt laws generally, whether you have a law such as 29 States do, \nwhich is secondary enforcement, or in some cases not even secondary \nenforcement laws, or some States have primary enforcement laws, this is \nan issue under the purview of the people in the States.\n  This is not an issue for the Federal Government to get involved. This \nis not an issue of civil rights. It is not an issue of interstate \ncommerce. It is not in the Constitution. There is no way Thomas \nJefferson and James Madison would ever envision the Federal Government \nworrying about such matters. I know they did not have automobiles in \nthose days, but they were not coming up with worries about what kind of \nsaddles they had or making sure folks on horseback laced up their \nsaddles correctly with a buck and strap or whether there were seatbelts \non buggies.\n  The underlying bill clearly tramples on the jurisdiction that has \nlong been held by the people in the States. I don't believe ``nanny'' \nmandates such as this initiative should come from Government. But if \nthey must, the government should be that of the State legislature and \nnot the Congress. State legislators provide a much closer \nrepresentation of the views and beliefs of their respective \nconstituencies in our country.\n  I am a firm believer that the laws of a particular State reflect the \nphilosophy and principles under which the citizens of that State should \nbe governed. The people in the States do not need fancy Federales \ntelling them what to do. Moreover, I doubt a single Senator ran for \nthis office of Senator promising to enact primary seatbelt laws, \ntrampling on the laws of their States.\n  This chart shows a minority of States, 21 States, the States in red, \nhave primary safety belt laws; 29 States do not, the States in white on \nthe chart, and New Hampshire. I surmise this issue has been considered \nby every one of the State legislatures in all our 50 States. In 29 of \nthose States, primary enforcement of seatbelt laws was rejected.\n  Why were they rejected? Each State may have their own reasons. Some \nmay believe it is more important for law enforcement to worry about \ndrunk drivers or impaired drivers rather than craning their necks \ntrying to figure out what is in someone's lap as they are driving \notherwise safely down the road. There are others that may have concerns \nabout driving while black, a concern of racial profiling. Regardless of \nthe reasons, 29 States have rejected primary seatbelt laws.\n  Given that a majority of the States has declined such laws, it seems \ninappropriate for the Federal Government to devise a grant program that \nessentially compels the States to enact primary enforcement laws, and \nif they do not, they lose Federal gas tax dollars the people in these \nStates paid into the Federal highway trust fund.\n  My amendment revises the Occupant Protection Incentive Grant Program \nto grant awards on 85-percent belt use rate--the national average is \nabout 80 percent. Eighty-five percent would, of course, be a \nsignificant increase. People are safer wearing seatbelts. It is a good \nidea to wear seatbelts, but instead of compelling States to enact \nprimary seatbelt laws, the grants should be awarded solely on seatbelt \nuse attainment. The point is to get people to wear seatbelts, not to \nhave prescriptive micromanagement from the Federal Government.\n  For me, it is difficult to understand the logic of an incentive \nprogram that provides Virginia, with its high safety belt use, far less \nfunding than a State with far lower seatbelt use rate but with a \nprimary seatbelt law. Yet that is entirely possible under this bill if \nthe State with a lower seatbelt use rate has enacted a primary seatbelt \nlaw.\n  For example, a State could have 70-percent seatbelt usage and receive \nFederal funds under this grant program only because it has enacted a \nprimary seatbelt law. However, another State could have 89-percent \nseatbelt usage rate but not qualify for this grant funding because it \ndoes not have a primary seatbelt law. That makes absolutely no sense \nunless one is an officious meddler who wants to dictate and meddle in \nthe prerogatives of the people in the States.\n  If the goal is to attain higher safety belt usage rates, incentive \ngrants\n\n[[Page S5257]]\n\nshould be awarded based on a specific goal. In our amendment, it is 85 \npercent. This amendment is similar to one already included in the House \nversion of this highway bill legislation. My proposal is a much more \nequitable way to provide incentives and reward States for increasing \nseatbelt use rates. It makes the proposed program fair by making \nrequirements the same for all States, but does not compel States to \nenact primary seatbelt laws.\n  How do you get people to wear seatbelts if you do not have a law? As \nif everyone carries the code of their State around in the glove box or, \nfor that matter, carries around the United States Code. There are a \nvariety of ways. In some States with secondary enforcement, with higher \nusage rates than those with primary enforcement laws, there can be \nadvertising, there can be incentives. There are a variety of programs \ncreative people can devise as well as just common sense.\n  I wear a seatbelt. My kids wear seatbelts. Everyone ought to. But the \npoint is, Should this Senate be telling the States to pass primary \nenforcement laws?\n  I urge all my colleagues to consider the laws of your State. If you \nare in one of the 29 States that does not have a primary seatbelt law, \nwhat in effect Senators are saying is, we do not trust you in South \nCarolina, Florida, Arkansas, Missouri, Arizona, or Montana to make \nthese laws. I don't agree with this. Moreover, you are telling people \nfrom Alaska to Arizona to Florida and South Carolina, Virginia, and on \nup to New Hampshire and Maine, sure, you all are paying Federal gas tax \nrevenues into the Federal Government highway trust fund from your \ngasoline purchases, but you are not going to be able to get this \napproximately $500 million portion back unless you pass a primary \nenforcement seatbelt law.\n\n  The people in the States should determine whether this Federal \nGovernment incentive plan should reward States that have high usage \nrates or whether it should be used to promote a certain meddling nanny \nphilosophy.\n  I respectfully ask my colleagues to stand up for common sense, \nprincipled respect for the will of the people in the States. Stand up \nfor the principle that the law ought to be fair to those across the \ncountry. If any of those States can reach 85-percent attainment rate, \ndepending on how it gets calculated in the States, let them have access \nto these funds and grant them the broad authority, also, to use those \nfunds for roads and adding on to roads, as well. Finally, rather than \nofficial Federal nannyism, stand up for trusting free people. They can \nmake these decisions perfectly well, and have heated and vigorous \ndebate in their State legislatures if necessary. We should not trespass \non the will, desires, and views of the people of 29 States with this \nofficious nannyism and the federales planting their finite wisdom over \nthe will of the people in the States.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote in favor of the Allen amendment.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 761, as Modified\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, yesterday when we passed our substitute \namendment, which was No. 761, there were some technical inaccuracies in \nobligations and limitations for the 5 fiscal years. I ask unanimous \nconsent to make those technical corrections to the amendment 761. This \nhas been agreed to by both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 761) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       Strike section 3103(b) and insert the following:\n       (b) Mass Transit Category.--For the purpose of section \n     251(b) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control \n     Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 901(b)), the level of obligation \n     limitations for the mass transit category is--\n       (1) for fiscal year 2005, $7,646,336,000;\n       (2) for fiscal year 2006, $8,900,000,000;\n       (3) for fiscal year 2007, $9,267,464,000;\n       (4) for fiscal year 2008, $10,050,700,000; and\n       (5) for fiscal year 2009, $10,685,500,000.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I know there are a lot of Members \ninterested in the Allen amendment. We are close to final passage. We \nmay have a couple of amendments after we return at 2 o'clock, at which \ntime we will want to debate those. We will be limited to 2 minutes on \neach side for those amendments. I encourage Members who want to be \nheard on those amendments that we will be considering after 2 o'clock, \nthis is the time to do it. This is the only time Members will have.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as we stand on the verge of passing the \nhighway bill, I once again praise Chairman Inhofe for his leadership. \nWe would not be at this point without the chairman's persistence and \nhard work. And I personally thank you and Senators Baucus and Bond for \ntheir excellent efforts.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this has been an effort that has been \nbipartisan all the way around. It has been 3 years in the making. For \nall of us to get along this well for 3 years--I hope it does not end \nafter this is over.\n  I compliment you and Senator Baucus, along with Senator Bond, and the \nDemocrats and Republicans on the Environment and Public Works Committee \nwho are so cooperative.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. We have proved it can be done.\n  The highway bill before the Senate is important for the Nation.\n  It will authorize funds for Federal-aid highways, highway safety \nprograms, and transit programs through fiscal year 2009.\n  This bill will make our roads safer. This bill will reduce traffic \ncongestion. This bill supports mass transit.\n  This bill will create jobs. This bill will have an impact on every \ntown, every city, and every State.\n  The legislation includes a provision by Senators Grassley and Baucus \nthat boosts funding in this bill by $11.2 billion or about 4 percent \nover what the White House has requested.\n  That funding makes all the difference in allowing us to draft a \nfunding formula that ensures that all States benefit in this \nlegislation.\n  That funding helps level the playing field for many States that feel \nthey are being treated unfairly at the White House prescribed funding \nlevel of $284 billion.\n  I urge President Bush to reconsider his veto threat against this \nlegislation.\n  It is a good bill that helps every Sate and will impact every \nAmerican.\n  There are no differences between the House and Senate versions of \nthis bill that cannot be overcome with good, honest negotiation, and \ncompromise.\n  But we should not enter those negotiations with a proverbial ``gun at \nour head'' with the threat of a veto.\n  The White House should not enter the negotiations with a ``my way or \nthe highway'' approach.\n  There is a storm brewing in the Senate of mammoth proportions.\n  It is a storm I hope we can avoid for the sake of this great \ninstitution.\n  I urge the President and the Republican leadership in the Senate to \nchange the course of this storm.\n  This bill, and others like it, are too important to get caught in the \npolitical hurricane on the horizon.\n  Despite the gloomy forecast, I remain hopeful we can maintain the \nmomentum we have made on the highway bill and reach a final agreement \nquickly and fairly.\n\n\n                              Smart Growth\n\n  This highway bill, although not a perfect bill, is a step forward in \nthe smart growth arena.\n  We have included some modest provisions in this bill to encourage \nsmart growth, like safer routes for our children to get to school, \nencouraging more physical activity through walking and biking for all \nAmericans, measures to improve traffic congestion, funding for \nstormwater, and just plain smart planning.\n  The Safe Routes to Schools Program helps ensure our children are \nsafer as they walk to and from school.\n  By improving sidewalks and crosswalks for both pedestrians and \nbicyclists, we are providing a healthier alternative to riding the bus \nor using a car. We are encouraging students to get out there and walk \nor ride their bike to school.\n  In the 1960s, over 60 percent of our children walked or rode their \nbikes to school. Today, it is less than 10 percent.\n  According to the National Institutes of Health, the number of \nchildren who are overweight has doubled in the last two to three \ndecades; currently one child in five is overweight. Increasing the \nopportunities for children to walk or ride their bikes to school can \nhelp combat the obesity problem.\n  I would Iike to see more funding for this important program.\n\n[[Page S5258]]\n\n  Even we, as adults, need to increase our physical activity. The \nprovision for bicycle and pedestrian safety grants will promote the \nbenefits of walking and bicycling, and how to stay safe while doing so.\n  According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, \nbicycling and walking currently account for nearly 13 percent of \ntraffic fatalities, that is over 5,000 a year. Yet States are spending \nless than 2 percent of their Federal safety funds on bicycle or \npedestrian projects.\n  The biking and walking programs also help minimize traffic \ncongestion, a common problem of urban sprawl.\n  The increasing amount of time that Americans spend in their cars in \ntraffic has encouraged manufacturers to supply larger, more comfortable \ntrucks and cars. These huge, gas-guzzling cars and trucks are a symptom \nof a failure to make our homes and workplaces more accessible to other \nforms of transportation.\n  Other provisions that incorporate smart planning, multi-agency \ncoordination, and encourage public input early in the planning process, \nhelp ensure that the improvements meet the specific needs of the area. \nImproved planning also addresses local concerns and makes for more \nefficient enhancements to the community, without costly mistakes.\n  Even the Highway Stormwater Discharge Mitigation Program provides \nmuch needed assistance to our States and local communities by helping \nthem deal with the impacts of highway stormwater discharges.\n  This important legislation increases our investment in our regional \ntransportation agencies so they can consider the choices that will \nbuild stronger and more sustainable regions and local communities.\n  And, that is what smart growth is all about. Making smart, educated \ndecisions on how to handle the growth of our communities.\n  Such planning promotes growth that improves the economy, revitalizes \nneighborhoods, protects farmland and environmentally sensitive areas, \nand improves public health.\n  Smart growth offers a range of transportation options, provides parks \nand play areas for our children, and provides accessible options for \nthose with disabilities. All of these use energy more efficiently and \nare good for the environment.\n  Many of the provisions in this bill help ensure that we develop \ntransportation projects in smarter ways.\n  I hope the conference committee produces an agreement that respects \nthese important resources, be it our historic and cultural assets and \nparks and protected open spaces.\n  Since the 1960s, I have been involved in the smart growth debate. As \nVermont's attorney general, I drafted what became the first, and is \nstill today, the most comprehensive, State level environmental review \nregulation in the United States, known in Vermont as Act 250. In 1999, \nI established the Senate smart growth task force. Today, I serve as \ncochair, along with my colleague, Senator Levin, on the Senate's \nbipartisan, multiregional task force for smart growth.\n  A number of you also serve with us to ensure that we assist those at \nthe State and local levels with the growth of their communities. If you \nare not already a member, I encourage you to join our task force today \nto broaden the efforts in the Senate.\n  Land use and development affects each and every one us, regardless of \nparty affiliation. And with energy prices on the rise, transportation \nand land use planning are critical tools for conserving energy and \npromoting more fiscally sound development practices.\n  The task force needs your help to incorporate smart growth principles \ninto the budget and appropriation processes, to build better \nrelationships with our State and local partners, and work with the \nadministration to support State and local efforts to plan for growth.\n  Our Nation has only recently begun to recognize that sprawl is \nunhealthy--whether it is contributing to obesity in America or \nmultiplying the number of roads that are dangerous and unfriendly to \npedestrians or harming the habitat of endangered species.\n  Smart growth is about providing transportation choices, including \ntransit, pedestrian walkways, bicycle lanes and paths, and of course, \nhighways and roadways.\n  This highway bill is a move in the right direction. While funding is \nlimited for these programs, I am encouraged to see provisions like \nthese are moving forward.\n  In these times of high gasoline prices, Vermonters and all Americans \nwant to know what Congress is doing to reduce our dependence upon \nforeign oil.\n  Constituents who are paying steep prices at the pump want to know \nthat we are working to promote technologies that use gasoline more \nefficiently.\n  I would like to talk about some of the provisions of the highway bill \nand the managers' amendment that have the potential to do just that.\n  The bill provides additional incentives to use hybrid vehicles on our \nNation's highways and the managers' amendment builds on those \nprovisions.\n  While I think these provisions represent a good initial starting \npoint for important discussions to come in the conference on this bill, \nI think more can and should be done through this legislation to \nencourage hybrid use, and to expand their benefits for consumers and \nthe environment.\n  Some argue that we do not need to do any more to promote hybrid \npurchasing and use by consumers.\n  They suggest that the price of gasoline itself has been a strong \ndriver of hybrid purchases. Certainly, in part, that is the case.\n  At the end of April, the Associated Press reported that the hybrid \nmarket has grown by 960 percent since 2000.\n  New hybrid vehicle registrations totaled more than 8,300 in 2004, an \n81 percent increase over the year before.\n  Even though hybrids still represent less than 1 percent of the 17 \nmillion new vehicles sold in 2004, major automakers are planning to \nintroduce about a dozen new hybrids during the next 3 years.\n  I have personally joined the thousands of Americans, and several \nother members of this body, in becoming a hybrid owner.\n  I purchased a Ford Escape hybrid last year.\n  Simply allowing gas prices to increase is not the best way to promote \nhybrid use. That is a poor policy solution.\n  We should also provide significant non-financial incentives to \nstimulate demand for these vehicles.\n  One important incentive in the bill before us is to allow these \nvehicles access to the high occupancy vehicle lanes, or HOV lanes, on \nour highways.\n  We will be saving our commuters time, in addition to reducing \ngasoline use.\n  In doing so, we need to carefully consider and maintain the other \nsocietal benefits of HOV lanes.\n  Those benefits include: encouraging transit and shared car use, and \npromoting dedicated alternative fuel vehicles.\n  Mr. President, our last highway law, TEA-21, gave States the \nauthority to allow what is called a high occupancy vehicle lane, or HOV \nlane.\n  Many commuting Americans are familiar with these lanes, and thousands \ncommute into the District of Columbia every day using them.\n  I want to give my colleagues some of the history behind allowing less \npolluting vehicles in HOV lanes.\n  Under TEA-21, if a vehicle was certified under Federal regulations as \nan ``inherently low-emission vehicle'' it could be used in the HOV lane \nwith only one occupant.\n  The law authorized States to implement this policy through September \n30, 2003, and granted each State the right to revoke this policy if it \nincreased HOV lane congestion.\n  EPA established the low-emission vehicle standards.\n  They did so in order to recognize that certain types of fuel and \nvehicle technologies have low emissions and to encourage their use.\n  Only vehicles without evaporative fuel emissions meet EPA standards.\n  Consequently, a vehicle that bums any quantity of gasoline or diesel \ncannot meet the standards.\n  That includes hybrid vehicles that operate on a combination of \ngasoline or diesel and electric batteries.\n  Vehicles that operate entirely on alternative fuels with no \nevaporative emissions, such as compressed natural gas, liquified \nnatural gas, or purely\n\n[[Page S5259]]\n\nelectric vehicles, are the only ones that are able to meet the \nstandards.\n  We should promote the use of those vehicles.\n  However, such vehicles are a very small percentage of the on-road \nfleet, and, as a consequence, few motorists have been able to take \nadvantage of the HOV lane benefit provided in TEA-21.\n  Since the passage of TEA-21, there has been growing interest among \nmotorists, the vehicle industry, and some States in renewing the HOV \nlane benefit and expanding it to hybrid vehicles, which are more widely \navailable.\n  The bill before us includes provisions that would renew and expand \nthe HOV lane exemption for low-emission vehicles.\n  Specifically, the managers' amendment would allow ``low emission and \nenergy-efficient vehicles'' access to HOV lanes.\n  The bill would make that access permanent.\n  A vehicle would qualify as a ``low emission and energy-efficient \nvehicle'' if it meets EPA's ``Tier II'' emission standards that were \nphased in beginning in model year 2004.\n  In addition, EPA would have to certify that the vehicle gets at least \n50 percent better fuel economy than a gasoline vehicle in the city or \nthat it is a ``dedicated alternative-fueled vehicle'' as defined in the \nEnergy Policy Act of 1992.\n  Current hybrid vehicles are clean enough to comply with the new tier \nII standards. Some hybrids also meet the threshold for fuel economy \nratings in the bill.\n  This change would result in expanding access to HOV lanes to include \nhybrid vehicles.\n  I reassure my colleagues who may be concerned that congestion in HOV \nlanes might arise as a result of the policy change contained in this \nbill.\n  The bill before the Senate requires States that allow hybrids on HOV \nlanes to establish a program for qualifying and labeling such vehicles, \nand monitoring and evaluating their use in HOV lanes.\n  States also would be required to develop policies and procedures for \nlimiting the single-occupancy operation of hybrids if their use led to \nincreased traffic congestion.\n  While there are benefits to this language, I hope that my colleagues \nconsider strengthening the language.\n  We should be mindful when we allow single occupant vehicles in the \nHOV lanes, even if they are hybrids.\n  The managers' amendment simply implements the tier II emissions \nstandards that were effective last year.\n  Hybrids easily meet these standards today, so this language has no \npractical impact.\n  If it is the determination of Congress to allow hybrids to use the \nHOV lanes, we should be promoting the most fuel-efficient and cleanest \nhybrid vehicles on the road. I would like to go further.\n  This bill takes a good step toward promoting single occupant HOV \naccess for hybrid vehicles.\n  We make sure that there are only dedicated alternative fuel vehicles \nin HOV lanes, those that run on 100 percent alternative fuels.\n  But we need to make sure that we don't overburden our HOV lanes. And \nwe need to make sure that our goals of lowering pollution that we set \nin our last highway law are maintained.\n  It is my hope that we do so in the conference on this bill.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, shortly we will be voting on final passage \nof H.R. 3, the highway bill. Of course, we have talked about how long \nthis has been in the making. We are finally to that point. The product \nis a good product. There are some who still today are not happy with \nthe way the formula has treated their States.\n  There is nothing more difficult than dealing with a formula. This is \na formula that deals with so many different factors. We have donor \nStates, donee States, large States, small States, passthrough States, \nwe have States with unusually high delegate rates. All these things are \na consideration. During this debate we have discussed these at length \nthe last 3 years.\n  A lot of people think we are spending too much. I put my conservative \ncredentials up against any one of the 100 Members. I have been rated \nNo. 1 as most conservative Member in this Senate. Yet there are two \nareas where we need to spend money: One is the national defense and \ninfrastructure is the other one.\n  This is a life-and-death bill. We have to do something to save some \nlives. People who are saying we are spending too much on this, I think \nthey forget that we have had two very great Senators in the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus, who we went to and \nsaid: This is what we really need to have for America. Can you make \nsure it is paid for and make sure we can do it without a deficit? They \nassured us that we can.\n  I see Senator Baucus is here to speak. Of course, I repeat one more \ntime how much I appreciate him and Senator Grassley for the work they \nhave done so that this is a bill that is paid for, this is a bill that \nis not going to add to the deficit, and I want to make sure that people \nunderstand that.\n  By the way, the work they did has been ratified by the Joint Tax \nCommittee. That is the proper body. They have said yes, they can come \nup with--actually, the amendment is $11.2 billion more in contract \nauthority--they said they can do it and it is not going to add to the \ndeficit; it is not going to be deficit spending.\n  Before we run out of time, I do wish to thank some other people. I \nwill let Senator Jeffords and Senator Baucus thank their staff, but I \njust want to say I wish the American people really knew the hours that \nare put in on something like this. I am talking about all night long \nand many hours. I start with Ruth Van Mark, who has been with me for 17 \nyears now. I know there have been many sleepless nights working on this \nbill; Andrew Wheeler, James O'Keefe, Nathan Richmond, Greg Murrill, \nMarty Hall, Angie Giancarlo, John Shanahan, Rudy Kapichak, James \nGentry, Alex Herrgott, Dave Lungren, Alex Marx, and many more who put \nin countless hours.\n  But also on Senator Frist's staff, if you look back all during the \nconsideration of this bill, we have had the help of Libby Jarvis, who \nis always there; Dave Schiappa has been there on a daily basis, Eric \nUeland, Dan Dukes, Laura Dove; and the people from the Department of \nTransportation, who have been over here spending their hours on the \nSenate floor with us: Susan Binder, Edward Ross Crichton, who has done \nover 1,000 formula runs for us over the last 3 years. He will be glad \nwhen this thing is finally passed, I think; Dedra Goodman, Carolyn \nEdwards, Thomas Holian, Sue Anna Celini, and, of course, I thank the \nhard-working people of the legislative counsel because they have \nactually drafted this 1300-page bill and the hundreds of amendments. \nThey include Carcie Chan, Heather Arpin, Michelle Johnson-Weider, \nHeather Burnham, and Gary Endicott.\n  Anyway, this has taken a lot of hours, a lot of years working on \nthis. It is going to finally be a reality. I will just say we are going \nto have an amendment that will come up this afternoon, the Sessions \namendment. I would suggest it is very important for people to \nunderstand that it would only cut contract authority, it has nothing do \nwith spending more or less money. It is not going to have any effect on \nthe deficit, and it is very important people understand that.\n  So it is a good bill, and I appreciate working with so many people on \nthis so closely to make this come to the point where we are today.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I also join in thanking a lot of people \nwho have worked very hard on this bill. Certainly the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Inhofe, deserves primary credit. It has been a long \nroad, no fun. He has done a great job, and I commend him as well as the \nranking Democrat of the committee, Senator Jeffords from Vermont. They \nworked very closely together. And that is what makes good legislation. \nThis is not a partisan bill. This is a transportation bill. Of course, \nSenator Bond from Missouri has done yeoman's work, and I thank Senator \nGrassley, chairman of the Finance Committee.\n  I wish to make a few comments as we prepare to vote on final passage. \nI think that vote will occur in several hours. I start by \ncongratulating all those who have worked so hard on this\n\n[[Page S5260]]\n\nissue, and I thank some people back in my home State of Montana.\n  Jim Lynch is director of the Montana Department of Transportation. He \nis a terrific director, a very good man. I have known him for many \nyears. He has his heart and soul in this work. I also thank members of \nhis team: Sandy Straehl, Jim Currie, Jim Skinner, Dick Turner, and Mike \nTierney, just to name a few. They are terrific people, and many of them \nwere also helpful in TEA-21. They know highways. They know this bill. \nThey know the program. Believe me, they do a good job in helping us.\n  The bill we will vote on in a few hours is a good bill It is a solid \nbill. It is one that will move the country forward over the next 5 \nyears. Every State will benefit from this legislation, the so-called \ndonor States, donee States, urban, rural, large and small, every State.\n  In my state of Montana, this bill will provide $2.1 billion over the \nnext 5 years. This is an increase in highway funding over $500 million \nof historic levels of TEA-21. This means that more than 16,500 good-\npaying jobs will be sustained in Montana each and every year of this \nbill. In many respects, this is our economic development program, the \nhighway program. It provides so many good-paying jobs as well as \nexcellent transportation.\n  I am very proud of the funding levels we have achieved working \nalongside my good friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley. I believe we \ndeveloped a reasonable and fiscally responsible funding package. I am \npleased that the Senate voted strongly to approve our efforts to \nincrease the funding by $11 billion. The vote last week was 76 to 22 to \nwaive the budget point of order, that is, in favor of that $11 billion. \nI hope the administration will take a long serious look at this. I hope \nthey will reexamine their earlier opposition to increasing \ntransportation investments. It is a good solid effort. The Senate has \nagain publicly made its desires known with regard to funding levels. We \ndid not go over the top. We could have gone with more, to 318, but we \ndid not. We stayed under $300 billion--very responsible, very \nreasonable--and I hope the President will understand this is good \nlegislation for the country, it helps our infrastructure, it is all \npaid for, and it is necessary to help America be competitive.\n  In a moment, we will vote on an amendment to reduce the funding in \nthis bill by almost $11 billion. That is stripping away the funding \nthat we worked so hard to identify and that the Senate voted to \nsupport.\n  I have here with me a stack of letters from a diverse group of \norganizations that strongly oppose the amendment being offered by the \nSenator from Alabama. I will not go through all of them, but it is \nreally stunning, the number of organizations that have written us in \nopposition to the Sessions amendment. Every organization you can think \nof from the ACT--that is, the Association for Commuter Transportation--\nthe Transportation Construction Coalition, the Surface Transportation \nPolicy Project, signed by Anne Canby, who is the President; AASHTO, \nsigned by John Horsley, executive director, and many environmental \norganizations as well have written in opposing the Sessions amendment: \nNational Association of Counties, National League of Cities, United \nStates Conference of Mayors. It is just a representative sample of the \nlarge number of letters that have been written.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have some of them printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                     May 16, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the nation's local governments, \n     we urge you to maintain your support for the Senate-approved \n     $295 billion, six-year surface transportation bill by \n     rejecting the cuts contained in Amendment #646 offered by \n     Senator Jeff Sessions (AL) to H.R. 3.\n       The Sessions Amendment exacerbates state and local \n     governments struggle with increasing congestion, crumbling \n     and unsafe transportation infrastructure and federal clean \n     air mandates. This occurs through the reduction of the \n     Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program \n     (CMAQ) by $4 billion, Transit Formula Grants and Research by \n     $5 billion, Surface Transportation Enhancements by $1.1 \n     billion, Transportation and Community and System Preservation \n     Program by $100 million, Transportation Infrastructure \n     Finance and Innovation Act by $100 million, and Federal \n     Highway Administration by $400 million.\n       Under this amendment, the costs to meet the federal clean \n     air mandate will be borne largely by local property tax \n     payers. A $4 billion reduction in the CMAQ Program is an \n     unfunded mandate for state and local governments. CMAQ is \n     intended to help states and cities address the degraded air \n     quality from cars and trucks. The 1990 Clean Air Act \n     amendments require EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality \n     Standards for pollutants considered harmful to public health \n     and the environment. As a result, EPA has required that state \n     and local governments achieve attainment status for an 8-hour \n     ozone and a 2.5 micron Particulate Matter (PM 2.5) standard \n     by 2008-2015.\n       We believe $295 billion will help address the pressing \n     outstanding transportation infrastructure and federal clean \n     air mandates of state and local government. We also believe \n     this funding level will also expedite the passage of SAFETEA \n     so that the Senate-House conference committee can begin its \n     work as soon as possible. America's state and local elected \n     officials urge you to oppose amendment #646 offered by \n     Senator Jeff Sessions.\n       Thank you for your consideration to this matter.\n           Respectfully,\n     Tom Cochran,\n       Executive Director, U.S. Conference of Mayors.\n     Donald J. Borut,\n       Executive Director, National League of Cities.\n     Larry E. Naake,\n       Executive Director, National Association of Counties.\n     Robert O'Neil,\n       Executive Director, International City/County Management \n     Association.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    American Road & Transportation\n\n\n                                         Builders Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 16, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: The Senate may soon vote on an amendment by \n     Senator Jeff Sessions to the federal highway and transit \n     program reauthorization bill, H.R. 3, that seeks to reduce \n     the measure's total investment level by $10.1 billion. The \n     bipartisan leaders of the Senate transportation committees \n     have repeatedly said the investment levels in H.R. 3 are \n     necessary to write a reauthorization bill that does not pit \n     states or modes of transportation against one another. \n     Consequently the American Road & Transportation Builders \n     Association (ARTBA) urges you to oppose this amendment.\n       The funding reductions in the Sessions Amendment would come \n     from the following programs:\n       $5,000,000,000 transit formula grants and research\n       $4,000,000,000 Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality \n     Program\n       $1,100,000,000 Transportation Enhancement Program\n       $400,000,000 Federal Highway Administration expenses\n       $100,000,000 Transportation Infrastructure Finance and \n     Innovation Act Program\n       $100,000,000 Transportation and Community and System \n     Preservation Program\n       Some--but certainly not all--of the proposed investment \n     reductions under the Sessions Amendment would come from non-\n     infrastructure activities. Rather than reducing H.R. 3's \n     overall investment levels, it would be more appropriate to \n     transfer funds from the non-infrastructure expenditures to \n     core federal construction and maintenance programs to ensure \n     these funds are used to improve roadway safety and alleviate \n     traffic congestion.\n       Last week, 76 senators voted to support the deficit-neutral \n     financing proposal for H.R. 3. It's time to complete action \n     on the TEA-21 reauthorization measure. Please oppose the \n     Sessions Amendment and support final passage of H.R. 3.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   T. Peter Ruane,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  Sierra Club,\n\n                                                     May 16, 2005.\n     Re oppose Sessions Amendment #646 to SAFETEA (S. 732).\n\n       Dear Senator: The TEA-21 transportation reauthorization \n     bill (``SAFETEA,'' S. 732) that sets policy and funding for \n     highways and transit through the end of the decade contains \n     critical provisions to improve transportation planning and \n     development at the state and local level. We strongly urge \n     you to reject an amendment by Senator Sessions that would \n     substantialIy undermine these programs.\n       Specifically, the amendment would:\n       Cut $4 billion from Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality \n     (CMAQ) improvement programs--provides funding for projects to \n     reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality. Such a \n     funding cut would greatly harm the ability of municipalities \n     to comply with air quality requiremnts under the Clean Air \n     Act.\n       Cut $5 billion from formula grants and research for \n     transit--provides funding for security, planning, capital \n     purchase and maintenance, facility repair and construction, \n     and operating expenses where eligible. The program includes \n     grants specifically targeted to\n\n[[Page S5261]]\n\n     urbanized areas, to non-urbanized areas, and to \n     transportation providers that address the special \n     transportation needs of the elderly, low-income, and persons \n     with disabilities.\n       Cut $1.1 billion from Surface Transportation Enhancement \n     activities--provides funding for projects that add community \n     or environmental value to transportation projects. This \n     includes historic preservation, community development, and \n     water pollution mitigation due to highway runoff. This is a \n     crucial community building program widely acknowledged as the \n     most popular TEA-21 program.\n       Cut $100 million from transportation and community and \n     system preservation (TCSP) programs--provides funding for a \n     comprehensive initiative to improve the relationships and \n     synergy between transportation, community, and system \n     development, and to identify useful private sector \n     initiatives. This program has been a testing ground for many \n     key local innovations, underpinning new directions in local \n     and regional transportation planning.\n       Cut $100 million from projects being built under the \n     Transportation Infrastructure and Finance and Innovation Act \n     (TIFIA) of 1998--provides federal credit assistance to major \n     transportation investments of critical national importance. \n     The TIFIA credit program is designed to fill market gaps and \n     utilize private sector investment.\n       America's mobility is critical to our economy and our \n     national security. The transportation programs that would be \n     cut by this amendment have a long history of successful \n     implementation, and state and local transportation officials \n     have come to rely on them to effectively manage \n     transportation demand. We urge you to reject Senator \n     Sessions' shortsighted amendment that substantially \n     undermines the ability of local and state governments and \n     communities to effectively solve transportation problems.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Debbie Sease,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Association for\n\n\n                                      Commuter Transportation,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK),\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inhofe: I write to you today to ask your help \n     in defeating an amendment to SAFETEA that has been offered by \n     Senator Sessions (R-AL). The amendment, as I am sure you are \n     aware, would reduce SAFETEA by $11.1 billion, but perhaps \n     more importantly, would greatly reduce and in some cases \n     eliminate core highway programs. In essence, the Sessions \n     amendment undercuts the success of ISTEA and TEA-21 by \n     drastically altering the make up of Federal-Aid Highway \n     Assistance.\n       The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), in cooperation \n     with the Texas Transportation Institute (TTI), recently \n     released its annual report on congestion. While the report \n     paints a grim picture, it also provides proof that we can \n     reduce congestion by getting more out of our existing \n     transportation system.\n       The annual report indicates that congestion is growing \n     quicker than states and local governments are able to build \n     the roadways and transit needed to handle increases in travel \n     demand. The study finds that American's spent 3.7 billion \n     hours and 2.3 billion gallons of fuel stuck in traffic \n     congestion--producing a ``congestion invoice'' for the \n     national economy of $63.1 billion in 2003. Congestion is not \n     only a problem for those who live in the nation's largest \n     metropolitan areas, but also for those in small to medium \n     sized cities. No longer is congestion just a New York and Los \n     Angeles problem, now it is Savannah's and Birmingham's as \n     well.\n       The TTI report further quantifies the role efficient \n     operating roads can have in reducing congestion. The report \n     estimates that projects to improve the efficiency of existing \n     capacity provided 336 million hours of delay reduction and \n     $5.6 billion in congestion savings for the 85 urban areas \n     studied with 2003 data. If these treatments were deployed on \n     all the major roads in every area, an estimated 613 million \n     hours of delay and more than $10.2 billion would be saved.''. \n     The Sessions amendment would reduce, rather then enhance, a \n     States ability to deploy these treatments.\n       For your consideration we have attached the recommendations \n     that the TTI report makes. The Sessions amendment would cut \n     those programs that aim to increase the efficiency of the \n     transportation system. Thus we urge you to opppose the \n     Sessions amendment and protect those programs that help get \n     the most out of our transportation system.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Kevin Shannon,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 16, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: The 28 national associations and construction \n     unions of the Transportation Construction Coalition (TCC) \n     urge you to oppose an amendment to H.R. 3, the federal \n     highway and transit program reauthorization bill, to be \n     offered by Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL) that would cut as \n     much as $10.7 billion from the $295 billion authorized in the \n     bill through FY2009. The amendment would undermine the \n     Senate's overwhelming vote last week in support of an \n     additional $11 billion for highways and transit over the next \n     five years.\n       This additional funding is critical to help states maintain \n     and improve their aging and congested highway system and \n     improve safety. The additional funding is also necessary to \n     provide an equitable return on user fee revenue collected in \n     each state. Moreover, the proposed cut to the transit program \n     represents nearly a year's worth of funding which would \n     severely impact the ability of states and localities to \n     provide public transportation services to their citizens, \n     especially the elderly and disabled populations.\n       The Sessions amendment would cut the federal transit \n     program by $5 billion and the Congestion Mitigation and Air \n     Quality (CMAQ) program by $4 billion. In addition, under the \n     Sessions amendment your state would lose National Highway \n     System (NHS), Surface Transportation Program (STP), and \n     Metropolitan Planning funds.\n       Attached are charts prepared by the Federal Highway \n     Administration that illustrate how the Sessions amendment \n     would affect the amount of highway funding your state would \n     receive.\n       The TCC urges you to oppose the Sessions amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                The Transportation\n     Construction Coalition.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Surface Transportation\n\n\n                                               Policy Project,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 16, 2005.\n     Hon. James Inhofe,\n     Chairman, Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jim Jeffords\n     Ranking Minority Member, Senate Environment and Public Works \n         Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Kit Bond,\n     Chair, Senate Subcommittee on Transportation and \n         Infrastructure, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Ranking Minority Members, Senate Subcommittee on \n         Transportation and Infrastructure, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Inhofe and Senators Bond, Jeffords and \n     Baucus: On behalf of the STPP Coalition, I am writing to \n     express our strong opposition to amendment #646 by Senator \n     Jeff Sessions, proposing to reduce funding for many critical \n     elements in the SAFETEA legislation before you.\n       The amendment threatens the basic structure of the current \n     federal surface transportation program, disrupting program \n     elements and policies first established in the 1991 ISTEA \n     law. Among these is the effective reversal of a longstanding \n     commitment under the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality \n     Improvement (CMAQ) program to assist local compliance efforts \n     with applicable federal air quality standards. Now, with new \n     and more rigorous standards for ozone and particulate matter \n     coming on line, this amendment proposes dramatic reductions \n     in CMAQ funding--by a total of $4 billion or more than 37 \n     percent--that are certain to disrupt compliance air quality \n     efforts in local areas where about one-half of the nation's \n     population resides.\n       The amendment also threatens funding for transit programs, \n     specifically commitments to transit research and transit \n     formula grants. Ironically, this $5 billion reduction in \n     transit funding in these investments not only eliminates the \n     funding gains just approved by the full Senate last week but \n     withdraws another $2.7 billion from the transit account. \n     Undeniably, this amendment effectively reverses longstanding \n     federal commitments to balanced funding between highway and \n     transit programs. Importantly, the amendment also cuts the \n     very successful Transportation Enhancements program by $1.1 \n     billion and the TCSP program by $100 million, threatening \n     both programs which now generate substantial benefits for \n     taxpayers and their communities.\n       Taken together, this package represents an assault on \n     continuing state and local efforts to deliver better \n     transportation solutions and cheaper and more efficient \n     travel options for the public and businesses, threatening \n     public support for this transportation legislation. We urge \n     your strongest opposition to the Sessions amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Anne P. Canby,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Association of State Highway and Transportation \n           Officials,\n                                     Washington, DC, May 16, 2005.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Finance, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ranking Minority Member Baucus: On behalf of the \n     American Association of State Highway and Transportation \n     Officials (AASHTO), which represents the State transportation \n     agencies in the fifty States, the District of Columbia, and \n     Puerto Rico, I am writing to express opposition to an \n     amendment offered by Senator Jeff Sessions that\n\n[[Page S5262]]\n\n     would reduce funding for certain highway and transit programs \n     by $10.7 billion over the remaining five years of the bill.\n       The Sessions amendment would completely reverse the funding \n     increases, which were crafted by the Finance Committee and \n     contained in your substitute amendment, by severely reducing \n     funding for selected programs, including $5 billion from the \n     transit formula program, $4 billion from the congestion \n     mitigation and air quality program, $1.1 billion from the \n     Transportation Enhancements Program, $400 million from FHWA's \n     administrative expenses, $100 million from the Transportation \n     Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act Program; and $100 \n     million from the Transportation and Community and System \n     Preservation Program. We not only oppose the funding \n     reduction altogether, but also believe that these programs, \n     which enjoy broad support, should not be singled out in this \n     manner.\n       We applaud the 76 Senators who voted to support the \n     deficit-neutral financing proposal for H.R. 3. We urge you to \n     oppose the Sessions Amendment, complete action on the hill \n     and move to conference as quickly as possible.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                     John Horsley,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. These groups are many. There are at least 28 national \nassociations and construction unions that make up the Transportation \nConstruction Coalition. I mentioned AASHTO. I didn't mention the \nEnvironmental Defense Fund and Sierra Club, which are also in \nopposition to the Sessions amendment. You don't see that many groups \ntogether, construction groups, unions, environmental groups, local \ngovernments, all standing together on the same amendment; that is, in \nopposition to an amendment, in this case the Sessions amendment. This \nis one such occasion.\n  I have heard it said that we should not increase funding for this \nbill because the House will not agree to it. I ask my colleagues, are \nwe not a separate body? That can be turned around. The House should not \npass something because we might not agree to it. They are a body, we \nare a body. We have just as much right as they to indicate what we \nshould do.\n  As I have said in this Chamber many times, legislating is the art of \ncompromise. It is time for the administration and the House to \ndemonstrate a willingness to work with the Senate on this bill. We are \nnow ready to go to conference. We have less than 2 weeks until the \nexpiration of the current extension of these programs. We have to get \nmoving. The only chance we have to get this bill done is if we act \nquickly, reach an agreement soon on the funding levels in this bill, \nthat once we have reached an agreement on the funding levels, I think \nvirtually everything else will fall into place.\n  I urge my colleagues in the House and in the Senate, also in the \nexecutive branch, to work with us, find an agreeable funding level for \nthese programs. We cannot afford to argue for months about this issue. \nWe have tough decisions to make, and the time is now to make them. We \ncannot afford to govern by extensions. States and local governments and \nthe construction community are already feeling the pain from six \nextensions we have had to date. The time is now to roll up our sleeves, \nget to conference, and send a bill to the President. Then we can help \nthe American people in doing so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am pleased to be on the Senate floor today to talk about this long \noverdue Transportation reauthorization bill. We need to pass this bill, \nand we need to pass it this year. We have not had a transportation bill \nin more than 2 years for America. The delay has caused the State \ndepartments of transportation across America and in Colorado to operate \nunder a series of short-term extensions. That is unacceptable while we \ndeal with the major issues that are facing the country, including the \nissue of transportation. The delay in the passage of the new \ntransportation bill has cost the country about 100,000 jobs and created \nreal uncertainty for States that are trying to make construction \ndecisions at a time when they are also trying to recover from a \ndevastating fiscal crisis.\n  The passage of a new transportation bill is central. In fact, there \nis nothing like the passage of a new transportation bill to create \nthose jobs and provide the much needed funding to jump-start the \neconomic picture in Colorado and in many other places across our \ncountry. In fact, it is exactly the kind of business the American \npeople expect us to be conducting.\n  This important legislation will create thousands of jobs in Colorado \nas well as across the country and support important transportation \ninfrastructure needs on roads in our cities, in rural areas, on our \ntransit systems, and our bridges. The legislation will also lay the \ngroundwork to provide important high-priority projects across my State. \nThese are essential projects that will simply not get completed without \nthe passage of this legislation.\n  This legislation will reinvigorate our economy and make our Nation \nstronger. The first step toward this goal was with our vote to increase \nthe funding level to $295 billion. I highly commend my colleagues, \nSenator Grassley and Senator Baucus, for working to increase funding \nwithout adding to the national deficit. This additional funding will \ngive an increase to my State of Colorado of about $156 million more \nthan we receive under current law and about $26 million more than the \nHouse-passed transportation bill. That is $26 million more a year than \nthe House-passed transportation bill.\n  Here is what this additional $26 million will do for my State of \nColorado. It will allow the Colorado Department of Transportation to \ninvest in important projects across our State such as our new transit \ninitiative, TREX, as well as investments in U.S. Highway 160, \nInterstate 70, and Interstate 25. This is what the $26 million increase \nwill not do, however. It doesn't add to our Nation's deficit. The \nadditional funding is completely paid for. These are the types of \nchoices I am proud to make for Colorado, and these are the choices we \nshould all be making for America.\n  In Colorado, 30 percent of our major roads are congested, 43 percent \nof our roads are in poor or mediocre condition, and almost 20 percent \nof our bridges are structurally deficient. We need this increase in \ntransportation dollars, and I will continue to work with my colleagues \nto ensure that the highest level of funding for our transportation \ninfrastructure is maintained. Nonetheless, as many other States here, \nColorado is a donor State. That is Washington-speak about those States \nthat put more money into the highway user trust fund than what we get \nback.\n  There is a real issue of fairness I would like my colleagues to take \na hard look at over the years ahead, fairness for the people of \nColorado and all of the other States who pay the same gas tax as the \nrest of the country every time they fill up at the gas pump, and then \nat the end of the day we don't get back the same return when the \nFederal Government returns that money to the States. In Colorado today, \nfor every dollar a Coloradan puts into the highway trust fund, our \nState receives about 90 cents back. Under the Senate proposal, in 2009, \nColorado will receive 92 cents back. That is a move in the right \ndirection, but that is still much less than what is equitable for \nColorado and other donor States.\n  We need to pass this bill, and while the proposal being considered in \nthe Senate certainly is a step in the right direction, it does not \nprovide the level of investment that would address Colorado's growing \ntransportation needs as well as the needs of donor States.\n  To correct this unfairness, we need to take some important steps. \nFirst, I am proud to support the increase in the overall funding of \nthis bill without adding to the deficit. As I have said, this is a \nfirst step in the right direction. Secondly, we have to make sure we \nprotect that increase in conference with the House. The President has \nindicated he will veto this larger investment, leaving Colorado with a \nlevel of funding that will not support the needs of our State. We must \nconvince the President not to veto this additional money. Keep in mind \nthe rising cost of steel and oil have also driven up the cost of \nconstruction, and the President's own Department of Transportation said \nthe country needs a level of funding $100 billion more than the \nPresident has said he supports.\n  The third step we need to take is to correct the unfair formula that \ndisadvantages States such as ours. I hope my colleagues will help us \ncontinue to look for ways to provide adequate investment that will give \ndonor States\n\n[[Page S5263]]\n\nsuch as Colorado the rate of return we need and deserve.\n  Having a first-class transportation system is critical to the Nation \nand to Colorado. I look forward to the passage of this very important \nbill. I will continue to work to see that the most basic level of \ninfrastructure funding is not only maintained but improved so we can \nhave safe roadways and robust economic development throughout the \nState.\n  Finally, let me say this is the kind of legislation the Senate should \nbe working on. Because at the end of the day, this is about doing the \nwork the people of America care about. They want us to work on their \nbehalf every day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we are 12 minutes away from the vote that \nwill be taken and then recessing until 2 o'clock and coming back and \nfinishing probably two votes and then final passage. There won't be \ntime to debate the point. There will be a couple minutes equally \ndivided. The Senator from Arkansas wants to participate in that.\n  Since I will not be able to talk about the Sessions amendment, let me \nmake a couple of points. I don't have a better friend in this body than \nSenator Sessions. He and I are both very conservative, always ranked \nthat way. He has an amendment to cut the transportation bill by $10.7 \nbillion and the intent is for $5 billion of that amount to be taken \nfrom mass transit and $5.7 billion to be taken from the highway \nprogram.\n  The interesting thing about this is the amendment would only cut \ncontract authority, which is the upper limit of what may be spent on \nthe program. There is no reduction in guaranteed spending. Everybody \nknows last year in our bill, there was $318 billion in contract \nauthority and $303 billion in guaranteed spending. That is the figure \nyou are concerned with. There is no reduction in guaranteed spending on \nthe Sessions amendment. Guaranteed spending is the amount the bill \nrequires to be spent on the program. So there is no change in actual \nspending or the deficit.\n  The amendment also ignores the complexity of the formula. As a \nresult, the amendment drops the contract authority of some donor States \nbelow the minimum rates of return identified in the bill. For example, \nArizona's rate of return would drop below 90.3 percent in 2005 and 90.9 \npercent in 2006 as opposed to 92 percent. It is a huge difference. Keep \nin mind that is contract authority.\n  It is not just the donor States that are hurt by the amendment. \nPennsylvania, an older State, for example, would lose $258 million in \ncontract authority and drops from a 15-percent increase over TEA-21--\nthat would be 7 years ago--down to 11 percent, undoing the gains they \nreceived at that time.\n  Finally, I remind everybody that Senators Grassley and Baucus \nincreased the amount of money. The Sessions amendment is supposedly \ngoing to take back that $11.2 billion increase. But when we passed that \namendment, the Finance Committee--and it is their job; read the Senate \nrules, that is what the Finance Committee is supposed to be doing, go \nin there and find the money--they said: Yes, we know we can spend the \nadditional $11.2 billion. It is not going to increase the deficit. And \nthen they came along, and that fact was verified by the Joint Committee \non Taxation. They are the ones who said what the Finance Committee said \nis right.\n  Senator Sessions and I are always in the top three most conservative \nMembers when the ratings systems come out of all 100 Senators. I want \npeople to know my view on the amendment. I know the Senator is well \nmeaning, but it is one I will be opposing for those very reasons.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I understand there are 6 minutes \nremaining on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield myself 3 of the 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in very strong \nopposition to the Sessions amendment. It is a bad idea, both from the \nstandpoint of process and policy. First, it would undo the carefully \nbalanced package developed by the four committees of jurisdiction. Four \ncommittees have worked putting this package together: the Environment \nand Public Works Committee, the Finance Committee, the Banking \nCommittee, and the Commerce Committee. All have been involved in this \nprocess. They have spent literally years laying the groundwork for this \nbill, working ever since passage of the last bill. When we went through \nthe last session of congress, we could not get a bill passed. We have \nsince had interim extensions which were of concern.\n  The chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee and the \nranking member have spent countless hours trying to put together a \nsensible and reasonable package, making tough decisions regarding \nfunding allocations among the various programs. This amendment would \nbegin the process of unraveling those committee decisions, both as they \naffect highways and transit. I warn my colleagues at the outset, this \nis a bad way to proceed on a complicated and important piece of \nlegislation which is important to every single Member of this body--\nimportant to their Governors, important to their county officials, and \nright on down the line.\n  We know as a matter of policy there is tremendous stress on our \ntransportation system. The costs we pay in congestion have been \ndetailed by the Texas Transportation Institute. My own view is we need \neven more investment in our transportation system, and it is provided \nfor in this bill.\n  I understand the practicalities of the situation in which we find \nourselves. Failure to make the needed investment in transportation \nsystems would constrain our economic competitiveness and leave us at a \ndisadvantage in world competition.\n  There are very few bills that are so essential to the economic well-\nbeing of our country as this bill. This transportation infrastructure \nbill is critical to economic development and economic competitiveness \nin all 50 States. Failure to make the investment that is necessary will \nconstitute a setback to our efforts to build a better and stronger \neconomy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 2 more minutes to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator from Montana.\n  The transportation industry is strongly opposed to this amendment. \nFor example, to take one instance of a group we deal with, given the \njurisdiction of our Banking Committee over mass transit, the American \nPublic Transportation Association, which represents 1,500 transit \nagencies across the country, observes that the Sessions amendment would \nundo the bipartisan and widely supported efforts in the Senate in \nsupport of increased and balanced transportation infrastructure \ninvestment and should be strongly opposed.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter to Chairman Inhofe in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let me again underscore how vitally important the \nprograms authorized in the underlying bill are for the economic and \nsocial health of our Nation. As with any large and complex piece of \nlegislation, not everyone will be satisfied. I think this bill \nrepresents a reasonable approach to meeting our urgent transportation \nneeds. The pending amendment would begin the process of unraveling that \napproach to which so much effort has been devoted by so many people.\n  I particularly rticularly thank Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member \nJeffords and Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus for their \ninvolvement in trying to shape a good piece of legislation. I didn't \nagree with every decision that is in this package, but I see it as a \nsignificant forward step in dealing with a very important national \npriority. I hope my colleagues will reject the Sessions amendment and \nthat we will then go on to approve the Inhofe substitute amendment and \nfinal passage of this bill.\n\n[[Page S5264]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                    American Public Transportation\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 16, 2005.\n     Hon. James M. Inhofe,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Inhofe: On behalf of the American Public \n     Transportation Association (APTA) and its more than 1,500 \n     member organizations, I write to express our strong \n     opposition to the amendment Senator Sessions offered--#646--\n     to H.R. 3. That amendment would sharply reduce funding of a \n     number of programs in H.R. 3 by some $10.7 billion over six \n     years.\n       It is critically important that H.R. 3 be passed by the \n     Senate at the enhanced level of funding included in the \n     Inhofe substitute amendment. The Inhofe substitute amendment \n     is a balanced and carefully crafted measure that has strong \n     bipartisan support from the leadership of the Senate Banking, \n     Environment and Public Works, and Finance Committees. Transit \n     and highway needs are critical and have been documented by \n     the American Association of State Highway & Transportation \n     Officials and Cambridge Systematics, Inc. The Inhofe \n     substitute amendment addresses those needs in a balanced \n     approach supported by a broad range of affected groups and \n     coalitions. In contrast, the amendment offered by Senator \n     Sessions would dramatically cut a number of programs across \n     the board, including the transit formula program by $5 \n     billion, the congestion mitigation and air quality program by \n     $4 billion, and other programs that enjoy broad bipartisan \n     support.\n       In short, the Sessions amendment would undo the bipartisan \n     and widely supported efforts in the Senate in support of \n     increased and balanced transportation infrastructure \n     investment and should strongly be opposed.\n       If you have questions on this matter, please have your \n     staff contact Rob Healy of APTA's Government Affairs \n     Department at (202) 496-4811 or email rhealy@apta.com.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                William W. Millar,\n                                                        President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the Allen \namendment. We had this discussion last week, but we have a couple \nminutes each to sum up what is at stake.\n  The language in the Senate Commerce Committee bill guarantees funding \nif a State does one thing, and that is have or pass a primary seatbelt \nlaw. We need to give incentives for people to use their seatbelts. We \nneed to give incentives to the States if they do that. This is about \ndoing the thing that would have the greatest effect on saving lives of \nanything we could do in this legislation, and we should go forward with \nit.\n  Under the Allen amendment, a State has no certainty that any actions \nit takes to increase seatbelt use will result in an 85-percent or \nhigher use rate. So that is a worthy goal, but very few States have \nbeen able to do that. We are trying to encourage more States to do \nbetter than they are. My own State only has a 63-percent seatbelt use, \nand I think we need to encourage more activity in the States. Only \nthree States have ever reached the 85-percent use rate.\n  The language we have in the bill has near unanimous support \nnationwide among traffic safety organizations from USTA to the \nAutomobile Manufacturers Association to the American Automobile \nAssociation, the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n  One thing I was impressed with when we had the hearings in the \ncommittee was the National Highway Safety Transportation Safety \nAdministrator Jeff Runge, who is a doctor with expertise in this field. \nHe said the Commerce highway safety bill will ``save more lives, and do \nit faster and cheaper than any other highway safety proposal Congress \nis likely to consider this decade.''\n  It would be a huge mistake to take away this incentive but in effect \nset a goal most States can't achieve and, therefore, we would not be \nable to save an estimated 1,200 or more lives a year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, in these few moments before the vote, I \ncommend the chairman of our Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, Senator Inhofe, along with Senators Jeffords and Baucus, for \na job well done. We can't forget Senator Reid, whom we consider an \nemeritus member of the EPW Committee, who has helped a great deal.\n  Tremendous staff work has gone into this. I appreciate the great work \nof my staff: Allen Stein, John Stoody, Heideh Shahmoradi; Senator \nInhofe's staff, Ruth Van Mark, James O'Keeffe, Andrew Wheeler, Nathan \nRichmond, Greg Murrill, Alex Herrgott, John Shanahan, Angie Giancarlo, \nand Rudy Kapichak; Senator Jeffords' staff, JC Sandberg, Allison \nTaylor, Malia Somerville, JoEllen Darcy, and Chris Miller; and Kathy \nRuffalo with Senator Baucus. Kathy brings a great deal of expertise to \nthis effort.\n  We urge passage of this bill. It doesn't go as far as most of us \nwould like, but it certainly moves us in the right direction. We \nappreciate the great work of all who cooperated on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, after nearly 3 years and 6 temporary \nextensions, the Senate is on the verge of passing a monumental highway \nbill. We will provide over $295 billion that will create thousands of \njobs and keep our transportation infrastructure healthy.\n  This legislation did not happen by itself--it took hard work and \nperseverance. First, I want to thank Senator Inhofe and Senator \nJeffords, from the Environment and Public Works Committee, as well as \nSenator Bond, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure. They provided excellent leadership and I know their \nstaff stayed up many a sleepless night.\n  For Senator Inhofe's staff, I want to thank Ruth Van Mark, James \nO'Keeffe, Nathan Richmond, Angie Giancarlo, Andy Wheeler, Marty Hall, \nGreg Murrill, Alex Herrgott, Rudy Kapichak, John Shanahan, Frank Fannon \nand Michele Nellenbach.\n  For Senator Jeffords' staff, I want to thank JC Sandberg, Ken \nConnolly, Alison Taylor, Jo-Ellen Darcy, Chris Miller, Margaret \nWetherald, Mary Francis Repko, Malia Somerville, and Carolyn Dupree.\n  And for Senator Bond's staff, I want to thank Ellen Stein, John \nStoody, and Heideh Shamoradi.\n  Senator Shelby and Senator Sarbanes also deserve recognition. They \nplayed an important role developing the transit title in this bill. I \nalso want to thank my good friend Senator Grassley, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, for his commitment to the transportation program.\n  Let me take a moment and speak about the hard work of the Finance \nCommittee staff. The House bill simply did not provide enough money for \nour highway infrastructure. The Finance Committee faced a difficult \ntask. We needed to find additional revenue, but we also needed to pay \nfor it. As is the rule on the Finance Committee, we worked in a \nbipartisan spirit to find an extra $7.8 billion for the highway trust \nfund, and all of it is paid for.\n  I also want to thank some staff members in particular. I appreciate \nthe cooperation we received from the Republican staff, especially Kolan \nDavis, Mark Prater, Elizabeth Paris, Christy Mistr, Ed McClellan, Dean \nZerbe, John O'Neill, and Nick Wyatt.\n  I thank the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation and Senate \nLegislative Counsel for their service.\n  I also thank my staff for their tireless effort and dedication, \nincluding Russ Sullivan, Patrick Heck, Bill Dauster, Kathy Ruffalo-\nFarnsworth, Matt Jones, Jon Selib, Anita Horn Rizek, Judy Miller, \nMelissa Mueller, Ryan Abraham, and Wendy Carey. I also thank our \ndedicated fellows, Mary Baker, Jodie Cruz, Cuong Huynh, Richard Litsey, \nStuart Sirkin, and Brian Townsend.\n  Finally, I thank our hardworking interns: Rob Grayson, Emily Meeker \nand Waylon Mathern.\n  This legislation really was a team effort. I hope that we can keep \nworking together as we move to conference and hopefully get this \nlegislation done before the end of the month. \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 611\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes of debate evenly divided \non the Allen amendment.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, let me know when 1 minute is left, please.\n  My amendment sets a goal of 85 percent usage of seatbelts, and if a \nState achieves that, whichever way they may\n\n[[Page S5265]]\n\nachieve it, they would get these incentive grants.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is reminded that he only has 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Thank you.\n  The purpose of my amendment is to not have the Federal Government as \nan officious nanny telling the States how to achieve seatbelt usage \nrates. Twenty-nine States don't have primary enforcement of seatbelt \nlaws and 21 do. Seven States have 90 percent usage. Fifteen States have \nover 85 percent. The underlying proposal will actually reward States \nthat have lower seatbelt usage only because they have primary \nenforcement seatbelt laws, while others that do not have primary \nenforcement seatbelt laws have a higher use rate.\n  I don't think the people in the States who have paid into the highway \ntrust fund ought to be dictated to by officious Federal nannies; we \nshould trust the people in the States to make these decisions as \nopposed to trespassing on those prerogatives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I wish to make four points.\n  First, I voice my opposition to the Allen amendment. NHTSA, in every \nstudy I have found, says the best way to reduce fatalities on the \nhighways is for States to enact primary safety belt laws.\n  Secondly, this bill provides an incentive, not a penalty. That is \nsomething we need to remember and understand. This is maybe a departure \nfrom past policies, but the bill, as currently written, provides \nincentives, not penalties.\n  Third, years ago, the Department of Transportation set an attainment \ngoal of 90 percent. This amendment would move us back to 85 percent. We \nare moving backward instead of moving toward our goal; we are backing \noff of the goal.\n  Fourth, it is not so much about equity or fairness, but it is about \nsaving lives. When you look at the safety groups and listen to the \nstudies and look at the statistics--whatever measure you want to make--\nthis is about saving lives and States having primary safety belt laws.\n  I thank the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all time under rule \nXII is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 611 proposed by the \nSenator from Virginia, Mr. Allen.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding we are now going to \nthe Sessions amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I understand there is a unanimous \nconsent to have 2 minutes, 1 minute on each side. I prefer to have \nmore. I ask unanimous consent we have 3 minutes on each side.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I object. Two minutes on each side.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Two minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I offer Senator Lautenberg a moment to \nmake a statement. He has been working with us on his amendment. It has \nbeen withdrawn.\n  I certainly yield to Senator Lautenberg for no more than 5 minutes.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 619, as Modified\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I appreciate the recognition. I will \ntalk about my amendment No. 619 to crack down on our most dangerous, \nhighest risk drunk drivers--repeat-offender, high-blood-alcohol-content \ndrivers, drivers who have had so much to drink they have nearly double \nthe legal limit of alcohol in their system.\n  I am proud to have the Senator from Ohio, Mr. DeWine, as a cosponsor \nof this amendment. I ask unanimous consent Senator Corzine be added as \na cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Our amendment updates the current Federal repeat \noffender law so that it can be based on measures that have been proven \nto be effective in preventing drunk driving. It requires alcoholism \nassessments and treatment when necessary. It would require a 1-year \nlicense suspension with at least 45 days of no driving. The rest \nrequires the use of an ignition interlock, a device that only lets the \ncar operate when you blow into it and no alcohol is detected.\n  As for repeat offenders, it keeps current requirements for short-term \njail time, closes a loophole for community service. The National \nTransportation Safety Board states that from 1983 through 1998 at least \n137,000 people died in crashes nationwide involving higher risk drunk \ndrivers. The research funded by the alcohol industry itself showed that \n58 percent of alcohol-related deaths in 2000 involved drivers with BAC \nlevels of .15 or above. That is outrageous. That person is totally \nwithout ability to function properly. This is consistent with \ngovernment research that shows for drivers 35 and over, those with a \n.15 BAC or higher, they are 382 times more likely to be involved in a \nfatal crash than a sober driver.\n  It is important to note that our amendment does not create any new \npenalties for States. It merely updates the current program.\n  Our amendment does not affect a social drinker and is aimed squarely \nat higher risk drivers who are the core of the drunk-driving problem in \nthis country. The National Transportation Safety Board, the Mothers \nAgainst Drunk Driving, and even groups funded by the alcohol industry, \nall agree we need to do more when it comes to repeat offenders and \ndrivers with blood alcohol content levels twice the legal limit.\n  I understand the managers of the bill have agreed to accept the \namendment as modified. I am grateful. I thank the managers, Senator \nInhofe, Senator Jeffords, Senator Bond, and Senator Baucus, for working \nwith Senator DeWine and me. The amendment will make a meaningful \ndifference in the number of lives we save each year from the epidemic \nof drunk driving.\n  In my early days in the Senate when President Reagan was in office, \nwhen Senator Dole was then-Secretary of Transportation, we put in a \nrestriction on age and driving, age on alcohol and driving. We have \nsaved 1,000 young people from dying on the highways every year for more \nthan 20 years.\n  What a wonderful thing it is for a family not having to mourn the \nloss of a child, not having to see a policeman at the door in the dark \nof night.\n\n[[Page S5266]]\n\n  MADD has been a stalwart ally. Together we will continue to save \nlives. I am very grateful to Senator Inhofe, Senator Jeffords, and the \ncommittee for their support on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the distinguished junior Senator from \nAlabama, one of my closest friends, made a very reasonable request for \n6 minutes equally divided. If he wants to restate the request, it is \nwithout objection.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 6 minutes to \nbe equally divided for debate before this vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 646, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the distinguished chairman. He is one of my \nfavorite Senators. There is no one I respect more. He has worked hard, \nand so has the committee, to maximize what we can do to improve \ntransportation infrastructure in this country. I respect that.\n  The problem is, we have passed a budget. The facts are that in \npumping more money into highways--which all Members want to see, as \nthis bill does--we have created a $10.7 billion shortfall. The offsets \nare revenue enhancements or tax increases that have been proposed \neither are unlikely to reach that $10.7 billion and/or will not be \napproved by the House of Representatives. That is a pretty well-known \nfact.\n  In addition, the President has stated he is not going to sign the \nbill. He started out at $256 billion. He went to $283 billion, and that \nis where he is going to stay.\n  What can we do to improve funding for highways, which affect every \nState, every corner of this country, not just certain areas? I proposed \nan amendment that I believe does the right thing. It does what our \nconstituents pay us to do, and that is to make choices, make decisions.\n  I have proposed where the bill has a 31-percent increase in spending, \nwe alter that; that we reduce the increased level of spending for \nmatters not critical to our infrastructure; that we reduce the mass \ntransit part of the bill by about $5 billion, still leaving an increase \nin mass transit spending.\n  We can get there. We can be sure the money we spent for highways will \nbe sufficient, the President will sign the bill, and we will be \nfiscally responsible and be within our budget.\n  We are spending almost $300 billion. Can't we stay within the budget? \nCan't we be fiscally responsible and tight in how we spend this money?\n  My amendment reduces some of the increases in the other accounts, \nincluding mass transit. By the way, 46 percent of the mass transit \nfunds are spent on four States in this country alone, and that does not \ncount $8 billion in bureaucracy and overhead that goes with that in \nresearch. This would be the right approach.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Inhofe, for his work on the bill. I \nknow he has tried to do the impossible, which is to get more and more \nfor our highways without having to bust the budget. I am afraid that is \nwhat we are doing. If we do this, we will fund highways for every State \nin the country. We will put the money where we need to, in concrete, so \nthat every citizen can use for 100 years from now. The result is good \nfor our budget and our integrity as we go through this process.\n  This is the first big bill that deals with a budget conflict. We do \nnot need to fail a test on the first piece of legislation.\n  I thank Senator Inhofe for allowing me the additional time. I believe \nthis is an important amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote fiscally \nresponsibly, to affirm the budget, and pass legislation that will give \nus highway spending levels that we want and that the President will \nsign.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, several days ago, 76 Members of this \nbody voted to support additional investment in this Nation's surface \ntransportation program.\n  They did not vote for an extravagant increase, instead they voted for \na modest 4 percent increase over the President's request. With this \nmodest increase, we will barely be able to keep pace with the enormous \nmaintenance needs facing our surface transportation system with little \nleft over for improvement.\n  Now the junior Senator from Alabama asks to return to an inadequate \nlevel of investment.\n  He asks the American family to waste additional time and money stuck \nin traffic. He asks us to vote to let more of our Nation's roads and \nbridges fall into a state of disrepair--all over a modest 4 percent \nincrease.\n  I will vote against the Sessions amendment and I urge my colleagues \nto do the same.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have a unanimous consent request to make. I ask \nunanimous consent that Lautenberg amendment No. 619 be modified with \nthe changes at the desk and be accepted. Further, I ask that upon \ndisposition of the Sessions amendment, the Inhofe substitute amendment, \nas amended, be agreed to, all without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 619), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       Strike section 1403 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1403. INCREASED PENALTIES FOR HIGHER-RISK DRIVERS \n                   DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED OR DRIVING UNDER THE \n                   INFLUENCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 164 of title 23, United States \n     Code, is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 164.

Mr. President, in these 2 minutes, let me suggest two \nthings I don't want to happen. I don't want my good friends who are \nconservatives on the Republican side to vote for this Sessions \namendment with the idea that this is a conservative amendment. If you \nwant to prove yourself and your conservative credentials as this being \nthe way to do it, it is not.\n  I am looking at the current rating of the American Conservative \nUnion. I am very proud of Senator Sessions because he is the ninth most \nconservative Member of this Senate. But guess who the No. 1 most \nconservative is. It is me. I stand here opposing--though I hate to do \nit--this amendment for that one reason.\n  The second reason is, this is very important. Inadvertently, I know \nit was not the intent of the Senator from Alabama, they omitted the \nwrong sections. So the sections of title I they amended are section \n1101 and 1103 and nothing in title III. If you want to give guaranteed \nspending, you have to get to title III or section 102 of title I. That \nis where it is.\n  So all we have done with this amendment is attempt to reduce the \ncontract authority which does not make any difference in terms of how \nmuch money is going to be spent. It is very important for people to \nunderstand that because I would not want them to be thinking you will \nbe able to reduce something by doing it.\n  Second, the other point I want to make is, we have a Finance \nCommittee. It is headed by Senator Grassley, and the ranking minority \nis Senator Baucus. They have done a great job. We have gone to them \nwith this bill and said we need to be able to pay for this, but we need \na little bit more money. Can you find it? They found it.\n  The Joint Tax Committee validated what they said and, consequently, \nwe have something that will not add to the deficit. It will do a little \nbetter job of taking care of donor States that will not be taken care \nof if this amendment should pass.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Rail Crossing Safety Funding\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased that this bill that we are \nconsidering has provisions to address this Nation's problems of grade \ncrossings and the need for grade separations.\n  According to the Federal Railroad Administration, ``grade crossings \nare the site of the greatest number of collisions and injuries'' in the \nrailroad industry. In 2000, there were 3,502 incidents at grade \ncrossings.\n  This year in Glendale, CA, there was a tragic commuter train crash \nthat resulted in 11 deaths and more than 200 injured.\n  In addition, the large volume of freight train traffic from \nCalifornia's ports to the rest of the Nation is a public safety hazard \nin many communities in California where traffic--including emergency \nvehicles--is severely delayed at these grade crossings.\n  In Riverside, CA, from January 2001 to January 2003, trains delayed \nambulance and fire protection vehicles 88 times. This translates into \nmore people possibly dying from health emergencies such as heart \nattacks, and larger and more deadly fires. If there is another \nterrorist attack, imagine what would happen if emergency first \nresponders could not get across the tracks.\n  That is why I am pleased that this bill includes my language to \nrequire the Federal Railroad Administration to make recommendations to \nCongress on ways to fix this.\n  I am also pleased that this bill includes funding that States may use \nto separate railroad tracks and roads, and I am wondering whether the \nSenator from Missouri would enter into a colloquy on this matter.\n  Mr. BOND. I am happy to. And let me say that I agree with the Senator \nfrom California that there is a serious problem with grade crossings in \nthis country, and I commend her for her leadership on this issue.\n  Mrs. BOXER. As I understand it, the Freight Transportation Gateways \nprogram has a provision--the ``Freight Intermodal Connections on the \nNational Highway System''--that would allow States to use a portion of \ntheir highway funds to build bridges and tunnels for grade separations. \nCalifornia would receive $73 million each year.\n  Mr. BOND. Yes, this program would allow California--and all States--\nto use 2 percent of its National Highway System funding for three \npurposes, one of which is to eliminate grade crossings.\n  Mrs. BOXER. A second provision is the ``Elimination of Hazards \nRelating to Railway-Highway Crossings,'' which provides at least a $178 \nmillion set-aside from the Highway Safety Improvement Program each year \nfor the elimination of hazards at railway-highway crossings. Does this \ninclude projects on grade separations?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes, up to 50 percent of this funding could be used for \ngrants specifically for grade separations.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Finally, there is a third provision that authorizes \ngrants for rail line relocation projects. This would create a grant \nprogram that would allow States to receive funding to improve rail \nlines that pass through a municipality. This includes projects on grade \nseparation. As a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, I am\n\n[[Page S5268]]\n\npleased that Chairman Stevens and Ranking Member Inouye included this \nprovision.\n  These provisions are a good start. I hope to continue to work with my \ncolleague to ensure that Federal funding is available to help States \nand localities undertake grade separation projects so we can improve \nsafety and relieve congestion where railroads and highways meet.\n  Mr. BOND. I will be happy to continue working with the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                      Reinforced concrete decking\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I will discuss steel grid reinforced \nconcrete decking--a product that I understand to have significant \ntechnological benefits and the ability to accomplish the goals of \nbridge and highway officials across the country. I am told that the \nfollowing are benefits of steel grid: long service life; rapid and/or \nstaged installation; and reduced maintenance costs and closures. \nDespite these benefits, states are hesitant to use steel grid \nreinforced concrete decking because of the initial cost per square foot \nof steel grid. However, because of construction benefits and the fact \nthat steel grid weighs much less than the cast-in-place deck \nalternative, it is my understanding that using this product can reduce \nthe total cost of a project. Because this type of deck system is \nunderused, I urge your support for language in the conference report \nthat highlights the benefits of steel grid and encourages the further \ndevelopment and use of this product.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for \nhis attention to steel grid reinforced concrete decking and the \npotential it holds. I look forward to working with Senator Santorum on \nthis issue.\n\n\n                   direct deliveries of aviation fuel\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I would like to ask a question of the \nchairman of the Finance Committee.\n  I am concerned about the application of one of the fuel tax \nprovisions of the JOBS bill. Some people were cheating, by paying no \ntax on aviation fuel and then selling the fuel for highway use. To \nprevent this, we moved the collection point upstream, to the point at \nwhich fuel is removed from the rack.\n  At the same time, we created exceptions, for situations where there \nis little risk of evasion. One important exception is for fuel \ndelivered by pipeline to a secure airport that goes from a secure fuel \ntank at an airport terminal directly into a commercial aircraft.\n  Here is the problem. Fuel suppliers often enter into long-term \ncontracts to deliver fuel throughout an entire region. In some cases, \nthey don't have their own fuel tanks at a particular airport. So the \ncompany enters into a contract with a fuel supplier, referred to as a \n``position holder,'' who does have fuel available at that airport. In \nthese cases, when planes come in for refueling, the legal title to the \nfuel shifts from the position holder to the reseller, then to the \nairline when the fuel goes into the commercial aircraft.\n  The concern is that situations like this may be disqualified from the \nexception because some believe the passage of title means that the fuel \nis not considered to go ``directly'' from the position holder to the \ncommercial aircraft. As a result, the transaction could be subject to \nthe burdens of the new rules even though I believe there is absolutely \nno risk of evasion.\n  In the chairman's markup, I filed an amendment to address this \nconcern by clarifying that these so-called ``flash title'' transactions \nqualify for the exception, as long as they meet all of the other \napplicable requirements. I understand, however, that some believe my \namendment was unnecessary because the transactions could already \nqualify.\n  This is an important matter to me. It affects many companies, \nincluding a Salem, OR, company that employs more than 100 people and \nprovides an important service to airlines throughout my State.\n  I would like to get a clarification of this point. Is it the \nchairman's  understanding that a transaction that otherwise qualifies \nfor the exception in section 4081(a)(2)(C) and 4081(a)(3) and (4), \nwhich allows commercial aviation to self-assess fuel tax at the \ncommercial rate, when the commercial airline receives fuel at one of \nthe secure airports through the hydrant system exception, is not \ndisqualified merely because of the incidental transfer of title from \nthe original position holder to the reseller, and then to the \ncommercial airline?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, so long as the commercial airline fuel transaction \ntakes place on one of the secure airports listed by the Treasury, then, \nthat also is my understanding.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, with that understanding, I thank Chairman \nGrassley for his assistance in this matter. It is important in order to \navoid imposing unnecessary burdens on companies in Oregon and all \nacross the country that provide aviation fuel.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the surface transportation reauthorization \nbill that was reported out of the Environment and Public Works \ncommittee increased Michigan's rate of return on all highway funds \napportioned to States to 92 percent of our share of contributions to \nthe highway account of the highway trust fund. However, a significant \nchange in the funding formula was made through a substitute offered on \nthe Senate floor which resulted in over $8 billion in apportioned \nhighway funds being added to the bill to help certain States, including \nsome donor States. The rate of return for all States on that $8 billion \nranges from 37 percent to 550 percent. Under the substitute bill, \nMichigan receives the lowest rate of return of all States on the \ndistribution of that new money. Only 12 States have a rate of return on \nthis new money that is below 90 percent.\n  In recognition of Michigan's disproportionately low share of the new \nfunding, the mangers gave assurances that corrective measures would be \nconsidered before the bill was passed by the Senate.\n  While a solution has not been identified yet, I would appreciate the \nassurances of the managers that in conference they will make every \neffort to address and correct this disproportionate treatment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I understand and appreciate the Senator's concerns. While \nI cannot make any guarantees on a final outcome, I will continue to \nwork to see if there is a way to address the critical needs of his \nState.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I agree with the comments made by my colleague, the \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. I understand \nthe concerns raised by the Senator from Michigan. I appreciate his \nleadership and knowledge of transportation issues and I will continue \nto work with him as this bill progresses.\n\n\n                         household goods movers\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to discuss 2 amendments to the \nCommerce Committee's title of this bill addressing the regulation of \nthe household goods moving industry. The Subcommittee on Surface \nTransportation and Merchant Marine, which I chair, developed a strong \npackage to provide further protections to consumers that use movers to \nship their belongings. Principally, our provisions are designed to \naddress fraudulent and extortionary practices used by movers who take \nconsumers' goods ``hostage'' and request exorbitant fees in exchange \nfor releasing their worldly possessions.\n  Mr. INOUYE. These protections are needed because, while the Federal \nMotor Carrier Safety Administration, FMCSA, assumed the regulatory \nduties for the household goods moving industry previously entrusted to \nthe Interstate Commerce Commission, inadequate Federal statutory \nprotections and limited resources have meant that the interstate moving \nindustry has essentially gone without oversight. FMCSA has received \nnearly 20,000 consumer complaints since January 2001, and yet until \nrecently has had only one or two employees dedicated to household goods \nregulation and enforcement for the entire nation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Senators Bond and Pryor have filed amendments to this \nsection of the bill dealing with 2 important issues and I want to thank \nthem for their hard work and interest in this topic. Senator Inouye and \nI worked with Senator Bond to craft a version of his amendment which I \nhave offered and we are prepared to accept Senator Pryor's amendment \nwith the understanding that we will continue to work together to \nperfect these provisions through the conference process with the House.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Yes, we understand that both Senators have a very strong \ninterest in these provisions, and while I have concerns with the \nchanges that\n\n[[Page S5269]]\n\nSenator Bond is proposing which I believe could significantly limit the \nauthority of our State attorneys general in assisting the Federal \nGovernment in enforcing these new protections for moving company \nconsumers, we are prepared to accept this language and make a \ncommitment to work with both Senators to improve their provisions \nmoving forward.\n  Mr. LOTT. Similarly, I know that Senator Bond has concerns with the \nlanguage proposed by Senator Pryor that defines who ``household goods \ncarriers'' are, and therefore who is subject to the new consumer \nregulations we've proposed. In particular, the Senator is concerned \nthat this definition could impact traditional moving companies' entry \ninto new markets, such as the ``u-pack'' and ``pod'' moving and storage \nservices being offered today which might not be covered by this \ndefinition. We understand these concerns and will continue to work with \nSenator Bond to ensure that we craft a fair and workable definition of \na ``household goods carrier'' through the conference process.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank Senators Lott and Inouye for their commitments to \naddress this issue in conference. I also raise my concerns with the \namendment offered by Senator Pryor to define the term ``household goods \nmotor carrier.'' Definitions matter, and in this case, meeting the \ndefinition of a ``household goods carrier'' subjects the carrier to \ncertain existing and new regulations that others who do not meet that \ndefinition do not have to provide. At the same time, I support \nexcluding express delivery and parcel delivery carriers from the \ndefinition of ``household goods carrier.'' As currently drafted, \nhowever, I am concerned that the amendment would make it substantially \nmore difficult for an established moving company to enter one of these \nnew markets in which consumers are provided a trailer or container \nwhich they pack themselves and which the company then transports for \nthem. The definition, as now offered by Senator Pryor, would mean that \nan existing moving company would be subject to these new regulations \nwhile others who offer these services, but do not provide traditional \nmoving services, would not be. As this bill moves to conference with \nthe House, I am committed to working with the managers of this title to \nfind a definition that is accurate and fair and that covers the \nuniverse of services that are being offered to consumers who are \nplanning interstate moves of household goods.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I understand the Senator's concerns and the intent of my \namendment is not to restrict competition or new entrants into the \nmarketplace, but to ensure that we focus our resources on the problem \nas we now know it. I'll be glad to work with you to perfect this \ndefinition so that we can properly protect consumers while also \nensuring a fair and open market place for the many different services \nnow being offered.\n  Mr. BOND. I appreciate the Senator's commitment, and I also offer to \nwork with you and Senator Lott and Inouye in conference on the \namendment regarding procedures for allowing State attorneys general to \npursue enforcement actions against interstate household goods movers in \nfederal court. This amendment, which I have worked out with the \nmanagers and is being offered by Senator Lott, establishes an approval \nprocess for actions taken by State attorneys general by the Secretary \nof Transportation before the AGs proceed in court. The amendment is \ncritical because it establishes a responsible framework with a \ndelineation of responsibilities to the States. The efforts of State \ngovernments should be focused on investigating and prosecuting those \ncarriers that are too small or cases of fraud that are too isolated to \ncause a Federal response. At the same time, Federal agencies should be \npursuing complaints of fraudulent activities by large and established \ncarriers. By focusing our enforcement efforts along these lines, we \nwill leverage our resources which will improve the effectiveness of the \nresponse to fraud and abuse in the household goods moving industry and \nensure that no carrier slips through the cracks. The amendment also \nwill ensure that State cases are legitimate and properly prepared. In \naddition, the amendment provides intervention and substitution \nauthority for the Secretary if the Secretary believes that Federal \nGovernment would be in a better position to prosecute the case.\n  Mr. PRYOR. As a former State attorney general and the ranking member \nof the Commerce Committee's Consumer Affairs, Product Safety, and \nInsurance Subcommittee, I have significant concerns with this approach. \nI believe the amendment proposes a significant departure from precedent \nand establishes hurdles that could dissuade State attorneys general \nfrom proceeding with their cases, to the detriment of consumers. \nAllowing State attorneys general to enforce Federal laws and \nregulations with respect to the transportation of household goods in \ninterstate commerce is perhaps the most important aspect of these \nprovisions, since I believe that State attorneys general are much more \nlikely than the Federal Government to doggedly pursue justice for their \ncitizens in these cases.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I want to thank both Senators for their cooperation on \nthese matters. Senator Bond raises a good point regarding the \ndefinition and we understand that this is a complex issue which will \nrequire further work by all involved.\n  Mr. LOTT. Senator Pryor and Senator Bond, we understand your \nrespective concerns and will work with you on these two issues as we \nhopefully proceed with his bill in Conference.\n\n\n                              clean trucks\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. President, my amendment begins the process of putting all \ntrucks operating in the United States, including those from Mexico, on \nan equal footing for emission standards with American trucks. Beginning \nin 2007, all trucks, including foreign trucks, operating in the U.S., \nwill have to certify that they are meeting the performance emission \nstandards of the Clean Air Act--the type of standards that American \ntrucks have been required to meet for years. This provision will comply \nwith our trade laws and help improve our air quality by assuring that \nforeign trucks are meeting our emissions protections. I thank the \nSenators from Mississippi and Hawaii for working with me on this \namendment and for agreeing to accept it.\n  However, I believe it is only a start. I would have liked to include \na provision requiring rebuilt engines to meet the standards in effect \nat the time the engines were manufactured. Such a provision would have \ncovered more foreign trucks and ensured even cleaner air.\n  I understand the complications with including such a provision now, \nand I hope we can address this in Conference.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator from California for her leadership. I \nunderstand what she was trying to do with regard to rebuilt engines. \nHowever, such a provision would require additional regulations from the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, which is outside the jurisdiction of \nthe Commerce Committee. With all committees at the table during \nconference, we can look at ways to address this issue.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I agree with the chairman, and I say to the Senator from \nCalifornia that you have my commitment to look into this issue as we \nhopefully proceed with this bill through conference. That will be the \nappropriate time to bring this additional matter to the table.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I appreciate your help on this issue, and I thank both \nSenators for agreeing to continue to address this issue.\n\n\n                PM-10 and the CMAQ Apportionment Formula\n\n  Mr. KYL. The legislation before us amends the apportionment formula \nfor the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality, CMAQ, program to include \nnon-attainment and maintenance areas for fine particulate matter, so-\ncalled PM 2.5, and to make adjustments for the new 8-hour ozone \nstandard. It does not amend the formula, however, to include non-\nattainment and maintenance areas for PM-10 particulate matter. Would \nthe senior Senator from Oklahoma be willing to explore the question of \nwhether the CMAQ apportionment formula should include factors for this \nFederal air quality standard as well?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would.\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate the Senator's openness to exploring that \nquestion. PM-10 is the greatest air quality problem facing Arizona. \nThere are currently 8 PM-10 non-attainment areas in Arizona and the \nPhoenix metropolitan area is a serious non-attainment area for PM-10. \nOur CMAQ apportionment should reflect and help us address our\n\n[[Page S5270]]\n\nPM-10 air quality problem. Do I have the Senator's assurance that he \nand his colleagues are open to considering including PM-10 as part of \nthe CMAQ apportionment formula?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I assure the Senator that I am willing to discuss with my \nfellow conferees the idea of including in the conference agreement on \nthis legislation language adding PM-10 to the CMAQ apportionment \nformula.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator for his assurance and his consideration.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased that Congress has worked in a \nbipartisan manner to pass a long overdue full transportation \nreauthorization, which has unfortunately been extended on a temporary \nbasis six times and simply must be made permanent.\n  I congratulate Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Minority Member Jeffords \nfor their tireless efforts in moving forward one of the largest bills \nCongress will consider this year. I am sensitive to the fact that the \ncurrent spending extension expires at the end of this month. Clearing \nthis legislation through a House-Senate conference before the May 31 \ndeadline may be difficult, but I am hopeful we can move quickly. This \nis important because the bill will create approximately 47,500 jobs for \nevery $1 billion in highway spending. This bill will also provide \ndesperately needed funds for Utah roads and create jobs for many \nhardworking Utahns.\n  Transportation is an issue in which all Utahns have a stake. Without \na doubt, transportation plays a central role in the State's ability and \nopportunity to prosper economically. As Utah's population continues to \ngrow, its highways are becoming more congested, negatively affecting \nUtah's ability to compete economically, and ultimately decreasing the \nquality of life for many of us.\n  I am concerned that in 5 years, Utahns may be changing the term \n``rush hour'' to ``rough 2 hours'' because of the heavy congestion on \nour freeways. The Utah Department of Transportation--UDOT--estimates \nthat in 10 years, peak congestion along the Wasatch front will increase \nfrom 1 hour in the morning and in the evening to more than 3 hours. The \neffect congestion has had on our quality of life is undeniable.\n  Time after time I have visited with Utah officials who stress that \nour top priority must be transportation funding, because we simply do \nnot have the money to meet the tremendous demands on our roads. Last \nyear alone, the State of Utah received approximately $254 million in \nFederal transportation funding. In addition to the Federal funding \nreceived, the State of Utah spent over $520 million for transportation \nprojects in 2004. Yet, UDOT maintains the state is unable to increase \ncapacity or maintain existing infrastructure at this level of funding. \nResponding to Utah's serious transportation needs, I voted to increase \ntotal federal funding in the multi-year transportation bill by $11.2 \nbillion, which would raise Utah's portion from the $269 million \noriginally included in the bill to $282 million. Utah desperately needs \nthese funds to fight congestion.\n  I am encouraged by the transportation projects planned for fiscal \nyear 2006 for the State of Utah. This legislation may help us complete \nmany transportation projects throughout Utah, including: new I-15 \ninterchanges in Ogden, Layton and Provo; commuter rail service from \nOgden to Provo and light-rail lines to the airport and South Jordan; \nhighway projects on US-6 in Carbon County and State Road 92 in Utah \nCounty; a railroad overpass in Kaysville; and building the Northern \nCorridor in St. George.\n  This legislation also contains a provision that addresses an \nimportant competitive issue in the transportation sector. At my urging, \nChairman Inhofe has agreed to include compromise language that allows \nqualified companies the opportunity to compete for Intelligent \nTransportation Infrastructure Program--ITIP--funding. I consider this a \nsignificant victory for small companies, and hope that House-Senate \nconferees will recognize the importance of providing a fair and level \nplaying field for those wishing to access ITIP funds.\n  Our Nation's transportation infrastructure is in dire need of \nimprovement. I believe this legislation not only addresses these \ncritical needs, but it will create thousands of job opportunities, \nfight traffic congestion, and improve the safety of our roads and \nbridges.\n  As the bill moves to conference, it is my hope that we may come \ntogether with an adequately funded compromise. I pledge my efforts in \nthis cause and hope my colleagues will do the same.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are about to vote on the highway bill. I \nbelieve we have a strong bill, a bipartisan bill.\n  I thank Senator Inhofe, Senator Bond, Senator Grassley, Senator \nStevens, Senator Lott, and Senator Shelby for their hard work, \ndedication and leadership to get this bill passed. They have been \ninstrumental to the process and deserve great credit.\n  I also thank my colleagues Senator Jeffords, Senator Baucus, Senator \nInouye, and Senator Sarbanes for their willingness to work \ncooperatively on this critical legislation.\n  The highway bill is a result of a long, bipartisan process. It is \nbased on more than 3 years of work, over a dozen hearings, testimony \nfrom more than 100 witnesses, and countless hours of negotiation. It is \nsupported by a deep and broad coalition--from State and local highway \nauthorities to national safety advocates.\n  And in a few moments, we will finally deliver to the American people \nlegislation that will help build and improve our vast and sprawling \ninfrastructure.\n  America is interlaced by nearly 4 million miles of roads and \nhighways. The interstate highway system has often been called ``the \ngreatest public works project in history.''\n  Our roads, ports and railroads are vital to America's economic \nsuccess. We know this well in Tennessee where companies like Federal \nExpress, U.S. Express, and Averitt Express are located.\n  Unfortunately, America's transportation infrastructure has \ndeteriorated badly and our roads have become painfully overcrowded.\n  Just ask any American commuter. There is bumper-to-bumper traffic, \nnot just during rush hour, but all day long. In our Nation's urban \nareas, traffic delays have more than tripled over the last 20 years in \nsmall and big cities across the country.\n  In my home State of Tennessee, traffic congestion has increased in \nall of our major metropolitan areas. Nashville commuters drive an \naverage of 32 miles per person per day. Metropolitan planning \norganizations are struggling to meet demand.\n  Because of this congestion, Americans suffer more than 3.6 billion \nhours in delays, and waste 5.7 billion gallons of fuel, per year, \nsitting in traffic.\n  All the while creating more and more pollution. Cars caught in stop-\nand-go traffic emit far more pollution than cars on smoothly flowing \nroads.\n  The American Highway Users Alliance estimates that if we could free \nup America's worst bottlenecks, in 20 years, carbon dioxide emissions \nwould drop by over three-fourths and Americans would save 40 billion \ngallons of fuel.\n  The legislation before use seeks to alleviate these problems in a \nnumber of ways.\n  In addition to improving our roads, the highway bill provides \ngenerous provisions to improve the buses and rail systems that make our \nurban centers thrive.\n  For Tennessee, this legislation will dramatically increase Federal \nhighway and transit spending and support economic development \nthroughout the State.\n  Tennessee, which is a donor State, will receive more than $800 \nmillion on average each year to invest in its highway infrastructure. \nThis represents nearly $4 billion over the next 5 years.\n  The bill will also provide more than $296 million over the next 5 \nyears to improve transit for our rural and urban commuters, an increase \nof 166 percent over the last highway reauthorization bill.\n  Tennessee's highways have consistently been ranked among the best and \nsafest in the Nation, and these funds will help to reduce congestion, \nimprove safety, and create thousands of new jobs.\n  Our transportation infrastructure is estimated to be worth $1.75 \ntrillion. Every $1 billion we invest in transportation infrastructure \ngenerates more\n\n[[Page S5271]]\n\nthan $2 billion in economic activity and 47,500 new jobs.\n  I look forward to passing this critical legislation.\n  We will need to work to resolve our differences with the House of \nRepresentatives so that we can send the President a bill that he can \nsign into law as quickly as possible. I am confident this can be done.\n  The highway bill is a roads bill. It is a jobs bill. It promises to \nhelp improve every American driver's quality of life.\n  I thank my colleagues in advance for, literally, keeping America \nmoving forward.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I would like to briefly describe my \namendment No. 681, which includes modifications to section 1612 of the \nbill.\n  I want to thank Senator Inhofe for cosponsoring the amendment, and \nSenators Bond, Jeffords, and Baucus for working with me on this \nimportant issue and this amendment.\n  New air quality standards are driving a new round of air quality \nprograms in many of our States. This is good for public health, and I \nstrongly support these new standards. To meet these standards, I \nbelieve that new tools and strategies will be required.\n  I believe that one example of a new strategy that works was \ndemonstrated in my State of New York. Despite making great strides in \nreducing emissions from a variety of sources, New York City has not yet \nbeen able to meet the air quality standards in the Clean Air Act. We \nare getting there, but it is a tough job, and there is more to do.\n  After the tragedy of September 11, it was clear that a large number \nof diesel-powered fleets and other diesel equipment would be operating \naround ground zero for many months. New York received emergency Federal \nfunds to pay for those contractors. And, partly because they were being \npaid by Federal tax dollars, and partly because of New York's \ncontinuing struggle with air quality issues, diesel equipment operating \nat ground zero was required to be retrofitted with pollution control \nequipment, and some Federal funds were used to pay for the retrofits.\n  Communities across New York and the country face similar challenges, \nin that emissions from diesel equipment involved in highway \nconstruction projects can put a temporary--but significant--increase in \nemissions in communities struggling to meet air quality standards.\n  The amendment has three main provisions. First, it requires States to \ndevelop emission reduction strategies for fleets that are used in \nconstruction projects located in non-attainment and maintenance areas \nand are funded under this title. Second, it requires EPA to develop a \nnon-binding guidance for the States to use in developing their emission \nreduction strategies. The guidance will include technical information \non diesel retrofit technologies, suggestions on the methods for \ninclusion in the emission reductions strategies, and other information \nthat Administrator of EPA, in consultation with the Secretary, \ndetermine to be appropriate. Third, it clarifies that States may use \nCMAQ funding to finance the deployment of diesel retrofit technology \nand other cost-effective solutions as part of the emission reduction \nstrategies.\n  I first introduced this provision as an amendment during the debate \non the transportation bill last year. That original provision was \nincluded in the bill reported by the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee earlier this year. During committee consideration of the \nbill, it came to my attention that the Association of General \nContractors had concerns with the amendment. I am pleased to say that \nthe chairman and I have worked with them to accommodate their concerns, \nand the revised section 1612 that this amendment contains reflects \nthose negotiations. The Association of General Contractors now supports \nthis provision, and has agreed to actively support it during the \nconference. I will ask unanimous consent that their letter of support \nbe placed in the Record following my remarks.\n  This amendment will also result in the cost-effective use of CMAQ \nfunds. During the debate over the last reauthorization of the highway \nprograms, Congress asked the Transportation Research Board of the \nNational Academy of Sciences to assess the CMAQ programs. Specifically, \nCongress asked the board to report on whether CMAQ-funded projects are \ncost-effective relative to other strategies for reducing pollution and \ncongestion.\n  The Transportation Board reported its results in a 2002 Special \nReport 264, the CMAQ Improvement Program, Assessing 10 Years of \nExperience. The report concluded that `` strategies directly targeting \nemission reduction have generally been more cost-effective than \nattempts under CMAQ to change travel behavior.'' It recommended re-\nauthorization of the CMAQ Program with modifications to improve its \ncost-effectiveness and to enhance its performance in improving air \nquality. In addition, a recently completed report for the Emission \nControl Technology Association that builds on this report and other \ndata reaches similar conclusions about the cost-effectiveness of diesel \nretrofits. I will also ask unanimous consent that this report be \nprinted in the Record after my remarks.\n  This amendment achieves both goals. It improves CMAQ cost-\neffectiveness by authorizing states to use CMAQ to fund the deployment \nof diesel retrofits. These are new technologies that have been found by \nEPA, the Diesel Technologies Forum, and others to be very cost-\neffective relative to other CMAQ-funded projects to improve air \nquality.\n  The amendment will also enhance the performance of CMAQ in improving \nair quality by financing diesel retrofit technology that reduces \nemissions of fine particulate matter, the most serious airborne threat \nto human health today. This is a problem that everyone agrees is a top \nair pollution priority. It's why I feel so strongly about this \namendment and have worked to fund the EPA's Clean School Bus USA \nprogram. Recognizing the seriousness of the problem, the administration \nhas acted as well, promulgating the 2004 on-road heavy duty diesel \nregulations, the 2010 off-road diesel regulations, the Clean School Bus \nUSA Program, the National Clean Diesel Campaign, and the newly-proposed \nClean Diesel Initiative that is in the President's fiscal year 2006 \nbudget proposal.\n  I am pleased that the Senate will adopt this amendment because I \nbelieve it will provide States with additional tools to achieve our \nNation's air quality goals. Reducing diesel emissions from construction \nactivities is often the most cost-effective way to improve air quality. \nThis amendment will help make that happen do just that.\n  I want to again thank Senators Inhofe, Bond, Jeffords, and Baucus for \nworking with me.\n  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the material to which \nI referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 12, 2005.\n     Hon. James M. Inhofe,\n     Chairman, Environment and Public Works Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Senator Clinton: We appreciate your \n     leadership for including the diesel engine retrofit provision \n     (Section 1612) in the Senate's highway transportation bill \n     (S. 732). This provision is important to both the \n     construction and the mobile source emission control \n     technology industries that we represent.\n       At your urging, the Associated General Contractors of \n     America (``AGC'') and the Emissions Control Technology \n     Association (``ECTA'') have been working together to develop \n     ideas for improving on Section 1612 so that it better \n     conforms to the current marketplace. The amendment that you \n     filed today to rewrite a portion of section 1612 reflects the \n     principles that we have jointly developed, and we believe it \n     is a substantial improvement over the underlying provision. \n     Your new proposal will better accomplish the original goals \n     of the legislation--to reduce pollution by spurring more \n     cost-effective use of funds from the Congestion Mitigation \n     and Air Quality Improvement Program.\n       Both organizations strongly support your amendment and urge \n     that it be adopted during Senate consideration of the highway \n     bill. Should the Senate adopt the amendment as we hope, our \n     organizations are both committed to working with the \n     conferees to ensure that it is retained in the conference \n     report.\n       We appreciate your leadership on this important issue, and \n     look forward to working\n\n[[Page S5272]]\n\n     closely with you to ensure that this important provision is \n     included in the highway bill that is sent to the President.\n           Regards,\n     Jeffrey D. Shoaf,\n       Senior Executive Director, Government and Public Affairs, \n     The Associated General Contractors of America.\n     Timothy J. Regan,\n       President, Emissions Control Technology Association.\n                                  ____\n\n\nCleaning the Air: Comparing the Cost Effectiveness of Diesel Retrofits \n                       vs. Current CMAQ Projects\n\n\n  An Analysis Prepared for the Emission Control Technology Association\n\n                         (By Robert F. Wescott)\n\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       A key goal of U.S. air pollution programs, including the \n     Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) program created \n     in 1990, has been to clean the air in cities to improve \n     public health and lower medical costs. But while the CMAQ \n     program has emphasized reductions of carbon monoxide, \n     hydrocarbons, and ozone, recent research finds that the top \n     air pollution problem in urban areas today is fine \n     particulate matter, which is particles with a diameter of 2.5 \n     micrometers or less (PM 2.5).\n       This pollutant, PM 2.5, is a primary airborne \n     threat to human health today costing more than $100,000 per \n     ton in health costs. Researchers estimate that PM \n     2.5 is two to twenty times as harmful to human \n     health as nitrous oxide, more than one hundred times as \n     dangerous as ozone, and 2000 times as dangerous as carbon \n     monoxide on a per ton basis.\n       Diesel engine exhaust is a source of PM 2.5 \n     emissions in urban areas. Approximately one third of these \n     diesel emissions are due to on-road vehicles and about two \n     thirds are due to off-road equipment, such as construction \n     equipment.\n       Diesel retrofit technology is currently available that is \n     highly effective at reducing PM 2.5 emissions. \n     Diesel oxidation catalysts (DOCs) are well suited for \n     retrofitting older off-road vehicles and diesel particulate \n     filters (DPFs) are highly efficient at reducing these \n     pollutants where new low sulfur diesel fuels are available, \n     as is already the case in most urban areas.\n       From the point of view of cost effectiveness, diesel \n     retrofits are superior to almost all current CMAQ strategies, \n     including ride-share programs, van-pool arrangements, HOV \n     lanes, traffic signalization, bike paths, and all strategies \n     that attempt to modify behavior (like encouraging \n     telecommuting.) Most of these CMAQ strategies cost $20,000 to \n     $100,000 per ton equivalent of pollutant removed, and some \n     cost as much as $250,000 per ton removed.\n       Under conservative assumptions, diesel retrofits cost only \n     $5,340 per ton equivalent of pollutant removed, In fact, \n     among all CMAQ strategies, only emission inspection programs \n     appear to exceed the cost effectiveness of diesel retrofits.\n       Expanding the range of CMAQ projects to include diesel \n     retrofits for construction equipment and off-road machinery \n     in urban areas could be a highly effective way to spend \n     public monies. More than 100 million Americans live in areas \n     of the country where PM 2.5 levels exceed the \n     EPA's guidelines.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       Cleaning the air to improve human health and lower medical \n     costs has been an objective of U.S. government policy since \n     at least the Clean Air Act of 1970. Concerns about poor air \n     quality, especially in urban areas, led to the creation of \n     the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) Program in \n     1990, which has set aside a portion of transportation monies \n     for the past 15 years to fund innovative projects to reduce \n     carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrous oxides, and smog in \n     so-called non-attainment areas. Vehicle emission inspection \n     programs, high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) travel lanes, van pool \n     programs, park-and-ride lots, and bike paths are examples of \n     CMAQ projects.\n       There has been significant progress in the past 35 years in \n     reducing carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions and smog. \n     Scientists, however, have been able to identify new airborne \n     health risks whose costs are now becoming more fully \n     appreciated. Notably, particulate matter (PM) has been found \n     to have especially pernicious health effects in urban areas. \n     Increasingly it is becoming understood that diesel engine \n     emissions in urban areas, both from on-road trucks and buses \n     and from off-road construction and other equipment, are a \n     significant source of fine particulate matter pollution. This \n     leads to a number of questions:\n       What is the current assessment of the top health risks from \n     air pollution from mobile sources in urban areas?\n       What is the role of emissions from diesel engines?\n       How does diesel retrofit technology to clean engine \n     emissions after combustion compare with current CMAQ projects \n     in terms of cost effectiveness?\n       Are CMAQ funds currently being deployed in the most cost \n     effective manner possible?\n       This paper examines these questions by reviewing the recent \n     scientific, environmental, economic, and health policy \n     literature.\n\n\n                   The Health Costs of Air Pollution\n\n       In the 1960s and 1970s they key health risks from air \n     pollution were deemed to come from carbon monoxide, \n     hydrocarbons (or volatile organic compounds, VOCs), nitrous \n     oxides (NOX), and smog, and early clean air \n     legislation naturally targeted these pollutants. During the \n     past ten years or so, however, researchers have identified \n     new pollutants from mobile sources that have particularly \n     harmful health effects, especially in urban areas. Top \n     concern today centers around particulate matter, and \n     especially on fine particulate matter. Fine particulates, \n     with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers \n     (PM2.5), can get trapped in the lungs and can \n     cause a variety of respiratory ailments similar to those \n     caused by coal dust in coal miners. A significant portion \n     of PM2.5 emissions in urban areas come from \n     off-road diesel equipment. According to analysis by the \n     California Air Resources Board, on-road engines account \n     for about 27% of PM emissions in California and off-road \n     equipment is responsible for about 60% of PM emissions.\n       Analysis by Donald McCubbin and Mark Delucchi published in \n     the Journal of Transport Economics and Policy evaluates the \n     health costs of a kilogram of various air pollutants, \n     including CO, NOX PM2.5, sulfur oxides \n     (SOX), and VOCs. These researchers estimate health \n     costs from such factors as, hospitalization, chronic illness, \n     asthma attacks, and loss work days for the U.S. as a whole, \n     for urban areas, and for the Los Angeles basin. For urban \n     areas, they find the range of health costs per kilogram of CO \n     was from $0.01 to $0.10, NOX was from $1.59 to \n     $23.34, PM2.5 was from $14.81 to $225.36, \n     SOX was from $9.62 to $90.94, and VOCs was from \n     $0.13 to $1.45. Taking the mid-points of these estimates, a \n     kilogram of PM2.5 therefore was nearly 10 times \n     more costly from a health point of view than a kilogram of \n     NOX, more than 150 times more costly than a \n     kilogram of VOCs, and more than 2000 times more costly than a \n     kilogram of CO. On a per ton basis, a ton of PM2.5 \n     causes $109,000 of health costs, a ton of NOX \n     costs $11,332, a ton of VOCs costs $718, and a ton of CO \n     costs $50.\n\n\n                effectiveness of diesel retrofit filters\n\n       Given the high health costs of PM2.5, \n     significant effort has gone into the development of \n     technological solutions to deal with the problem. The best \n     technologies involve the use of post-combustion filters with \n     a catalyzing agent, which together trap and break down \n     dangerous pollutants before they are emitted into the air. \n     All new diesel trucks will be required to use these \n     technologies by 2007 according to U.S. EPA rules, and off-\n     road equipment will have to use these technologies by 2010. \n     (Rules require 95% reductions in emissions of several \n     pollutants, as well as a 97% cut in the sulfur levels in \n     diesel fuel.) However, given that the lifespan of a diesel \n     engine can be 20-30 years, it will take decades to completely \n     turn over America's diesel fleet. Therefore, by lowering \n     emissions from older diesels, retrofits are an effective path \n     to cleaner air over the next few decades.\n       Diesel retrofit filters are highly effective at their chief \n     function: preventing dangerous pollutants from ever entering \n     the air. Diesel oxidation catalysts (DOCs), at $1,000 to \n     $1,200 per retrofit, reduce PM by about 30% and can work with \n     current higher sulfur diesel fuels. This yields a large \n     benefit when installed on older, higher-polluting vehicles. \n     In addition to the PM reducing capabilities, these filters \n     can also cut the emission of carbon monoxide and volatile \n     hydrocarbons by more than 70%.\n       Diesel particulate filters (DPFs), which generally cost \n     $4,000-$7,000 per engine, are far more efficient. They are \n     specifically targeted at keeping more dangerous PM out of the \n     air than DOCs. In fact, they can reduce PM2.5 \n     pollution from each vehicle by more than 90%, yielding an \n     enormous cut in emissions over the life of the diesel engine, \n     even when installed on newer, cleaner diesel vehicles. An \n     additional requirement of DPFs, however, is that the vehicle \n     must run on newer very low sulfur fuels. High sulfur fuel \n     leads to sulfate emissions from the filter due to the very \n     active catalysts needed to make the filters function \n     properly. Thus, DPFs are most effective as a solution for \n     vehicles in urban areas--such as construction equipment and \n     urban fleets--where very low sulfur fuels are already \n     available.\n       These technologies are not new or experimental; they are \n     already in use around the world. There are 2 million of these \n     technologies already at work in heavy-duty diesel vehicles \n     worldwide. Further, there are 36 million DOCs and 2 million \n     DPFs in use on passenger vehicles in Europe alone, where \n     these technologies are currently being used, reaping cost-\n     effective health benefits over the long term.\n\n\n                            the cmaq program\n\n       The CMAQ program is the only federally funded \n     transportation program chiefly aimed at reducing air \n     pollution. Its historical purpose has been twofold: to reduce \n     traffic congestion and to fund programs that clean up the air \n     Americans breath. Within its air quality mission, it is \n     designed primarily to help non-attainment areas (mainly \n     polluted urban zones) reach attainment for air quality \n     standards under the Clean Air Act. Historically many CMAQ \n     projects have tried to change travel and traffic behavior \n     in order to achieve its goals. These transportation \n     control measures (TCMs) have been designed both to reduce \n     traffic congestion as well as improve air quality. An \n     example is a bicycle path. Designed to reduce the number \n     of drivers on the road, bike paths could, in theory,\n\n[[Page S5273]]\n\n     achieve both goals. Further examples are vanpools, \n     ridesharing and park and ride programs, and HOV lanes: all \n     current CMAQ projects. Other projects have addressed \n     emission reductions directly, as for example, through \n     funding for state automobile emission inspection programs.\n       As a condition for reauthorizing the CMAQ program in 1998, \n     the U.S. Congress required that a detailed 10-year assessment \n     of the program be conducted. This review was performed by the \n     Transportation Research Board of the National Research \n     Council and was completed in 2002. This review found that \n     CMAQ has been less than successful in reducing congestion and \n     suggested that the most beneficial way for CMAQ to use its \n     funds is to focus on air quality. It also found that TCMs \n     were less cost effective than measures to directly reduce \n     emissions, such as through inspection programs.\n       Furthermore, the study suggested that CMAQ's focus within \n     the domain of air quality is misplaced. CMAQ programs have \n     targeted the gases considered the most dangerous pollutants \n     for many years, like hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and \n     nitrous oxides. While these gases pose recognized health and \n     environmental risks, recent work has shown that the dangers \n     of these substances pale in comparison to the danger of fine \n     particulate matter. In the words of the study, ``Much remains \n     to be done to reduce diesel emissions, especially \n     particulates, and this could well become a more important \n     focus area for the CMAQ program.'' Further, discussing the \n     fact that diesel-related CMAQ programs could be the most \n     cost-effective, the study states, ``had data been available \n     on particulate reductions . . . the ranking of strategies \n     focused on particulate emissions . . . would likely have \n     shown more promising cost-effectiveness results.''\n\n\n Comparing the Cost Effectiveness of Diesel Retrofits with Other CMAQ \n                                Projects\n\n       Given that PM2.5 emissions from diesel engines \n     are a leading health concern, that effective technology \n     exists today to clean the emissions of off-road diesel \n     equipment used extensively in the middle of American cities \n     (non-attainment areas), and that the CMAQ 10-year review \n     highlights the possible use of CMAQ funds for diesel retrofit \n     projects, it is logical to compare the cost effectiveness of \n     these diesel retrofits with current CMAQ projects. The CMAQ \n     Program: Assessing 10 Years Experience (2002) estimates the \n     median cost per ton of pollutant removed for 19 different \n     CMAQ strategies and these estimates provide the comparison \n     base. Published estimates for diesel retrofits are \n     compared with these estimates.\n       As a first step in comparing the cost effectiveness of \n     pollution reduction strategies, it must be noted that the \n     CMAQ cost effectiveness estimates are presented as ``cost per \n     ton equivalent removed from air,'' with weights of 1 for \n     VOCs, 4 for NOX, but 0 for PM2.5. \n     Relying upon the McCubbin and Delucchi health cost estimates, \n     however, even weighted NOX should be considered \n     more damaging than VOCs. That is, even though 0.25 ton (the \n     1:4 ratio above) of NOX removed counts as the CMAQ \n     equivalent of one ton of pollution removed, it has a higher \n     health cost than a ton of VOCs ($11,332 / 4 = $2,883 for \n     NOX vs. $718 for VOCs). As a second step, \n     conservatively assume that all CMAQ projects remove the more \n     damaging pollutant (NOX). This still means that a \n     ton of PM2.5 reduction would be worth at least \n     9.45 tons of regular CMAQ reductions ($109,000 for \n     PM2.5 / $11,332 for NOX).\n       Diesel retrofits are estimated to cost $50,460 per ton of \n     PM2.5 removed by the California Air Resources \n     Board (CARB). This estimate is very conservative and \n     substantially higher than that cited by industry sources. \n     Using the CARB cost estimate, diesel retrofits cost $5,340 \n     per ton equivalent of air pollution removed ($50,460/9.45), \n     based upon the CMAQ definition of ton equivalent and on the \n     conservative assumption that CMAQ projects remove the most \n     damaging pollutant reviewed. If a less conservative and more \n     realistic assumption is used--that CMAQ projects remove a mix \n     of NOX and VOCs--then the cost-effectiveness of \n     diesel retrofits becomes substantially more favorable, and \n     could be as low as $332 per ton of CMAQ pollutant removed.\n       This analysis means that diesel retrofits for construction \n     equipment are highly cost effective when compared with \n     current CMAQ strategies. As shown in Table 1 and Chart 2, \n     some CMAQ strategies cost more than $250,000 per ton of \n     pollutant removed (teleworking), and many are in the $20,000 \n     to $100,000 per ton range (traffic signalization, park and \n     ride lots, bike paths, new vehicles, etc.). The only current \n     CMAQ project category that exceeds the cost effectiveness of \n     diesel retrofits is emission inspection programs.\n       Other studies also conclude that diesel retrofits are \n     highly cost effective compared with current CMAQ projects. \n     The Diesel Technology Forum compared the benefits and costs \n     of CMAQ projects with diesel retrofits for transit buses (for \n     NOX pollution reduction) and concluded that \n     retrofits are a better use for CMAQ funds than any other \n     typical CMAQ project, with the exception of inspection and \n     maintenance programs and speed limit enforcement. Also, the \n     California EPA's Air Resources Board has estimated that \n     diesel retrofits have a benefit of between $10 and $20 for \n     each $1 of cost. And the U.S. EPA, in its justification \n     for new on-road diesel rules in 2007 and off-road rules in \n     2010 estimates the benefits for diesel particulate filters \n     at roughly $24 for each $1 of cost.\n\n   TABLE 1.--COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF CURRENT CMAQ STRATEGIES AND DIESEL\n                                RETROFITS\n        [Median cost per ton equivalent of air pollution removed]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Median cost     Rank\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInspection and maintenance.....................          $1,900       1\nDiesel retrofits...............................           5,340       2\nRegional rideshares............................           7,400       3\nCharges and fees...............................          10,300       4\nVan pool programs..............................          10,500       5\nMisc. travel demand management.................          12,500       6\nConventional fuel bus replacement..............          16,100       7\nAlternative fuel vehicles......................          17,800       8\nTraffic signalization..........................          20,100       9\nEmployer trip reduction........................          22,700      10\nConventional service upgrades..................          24,600      11\nPark and ride lots.............................          43,000      12\nModal subsidies and vouchers...................          46,600      13\nNew transit capital systems/vehicles...........          66,400      14\nBike/pedestrian................................          84,100      15\nShuttles/feeders/paratransit...................          87,500      16\nFreeway management.............................         102,400      17\nAlternative fuel buses.........................         126,400      18\nHOV facilities.................................         176,200      19\nTelework.......................................         251,800      20\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: All costs from The CMAQ Improvement Program: Assessing 10 Years\n  of Experience, (2002), except diesel retrofit costs, which are from\n  author's calculations.\n\n                              Conclusions\n\n       The top air pollution problem in U.S. urban areas today is \n     almost certainly PM2.5, which is estimated to cost \n     more than $100,000 per ton in health costs. A major source of \n     PM2.5 emissions in urban areas is diesel engine \n     exhaust. Approximately one third of these diesel emissions \n     are due to on-road vehicles and about two thirds are due to \n     off-road equipment. Off-road equipment in urban areas is a \n     particular problem, because it gives off exhaust at ground \n     level, frequently near large groups of people.\n       Diesel retrofit technology is currently available that is \n     highly effective at reducing PM2.5 emissions. DOCs \n     are well suited for retrofitting older off-road vehicles and \n     DPFs are highly efficient at reducing these pollutants where \n     new low sulfur diesel fuels are available, as is already the \n     case in most urban areas.\n       From a cost effectiveness point of view, diesel retrofits \n     are superior to almost all current CMAQ strategies, including \n     ride-share programs, van-pool arrangements, HOV lanes, \n     traffic signalization, bike paths, and all strategies that \n     attempt to modify behavior (like encouraging teleworking.) \n     Only emission inspection programs exceed the cost \n     effectiveness of diesel retrofits based upon conservative \n     assumptions. Expanding the range of CMAQ projects to include \n     diesel retrofits for construction equipment and off-road \n     machinery in urban areas could be a highly effective way to \n     spend public monies.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the \ntransportation reauthorization legislation that is pending before the \nSenate, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation \nEquity Act of 2005 or SAFETEA. I commend the managers of this bill, \nSenators Inhofe and Jeffords for producing bipartisan legislation that \nwill help address the safety and congestion needs on our Nation's \nroads, rails and bridges. I thank the managers for their hard work.\n  Under SAFETEA, New Jersey will see a 56 percent increase in mass \ntransit formula funds from fiscal year 2005 to fiscal year 2009. It \nwill also see an increase its return on the highway dollar from the \ncurrent 90.5 cents on the dollar, which is the absolute minimum, to 92 \ncents on the dollar.\n  This money is sorely needed. New Jersey is the most densely populated \nState in the Nation. This is causing gridlock on our roads. According \nto the latest study by the New Jersey Institute of Technology, the \naverage New Jersey driver now spends 45 hours a year stuck in traffic. \nI repeat, 45 hours a year. All this time spent behind the wheel does \nmore than hurt New Jersey's quality of life. It also costs us an \naverage of $1,255 per driver in wasted gasoline and lost productivity--\nfor a total cost of $7.3 billion a year. That is a huge blow to New \nJersey's economy.\n  I have spent 25 years of my life commuting from northern New Jersey \ninto New York City. I have seen firsthand how tough the commute is \ngetting. People are getting caught in gridlock on roads and bridges \nthat are overcrowded and in need of repair. According to the New Jersey \nDepartment of Transportation, to fix New Jersey's 13 most seriously \ndeteriorating bridges will cost $2.03 billion. And we are facing $1 \nbillion in pavement and surfacing needs for our highways alone.\n  New Jersey is the most densely populated State. We need a greater \nshare of funding to repair our roads and bridges. Thanks to the \nleadership of Senator Inhofe and Senator Jeffords, we will begin to see \nsome of that funding under SAFETEA.\n  However, I must say that I was disappointed when the Senate last week \nrefused to pass the amendment Senator Lautenberg and I offered on \nprotecting States from corruption in transportation contracting, a \npractice commonly known as ``pay-to-play''. I\n\n[[Page S5274]]\n\nbelieve that this was due in large part to false statements that were \nmade by certain groups and repeated on the floor of the Senate. I would \nlike to take a moment to address both these comments and the continuing \nneed for this measure.\n  The criticisms fall into three areas: First, that this measure was \nnot needed to ensure fair and open competition for highway and mass \ntransit contracts. Second, that Senator Lautenberg and I were trying to \nimpose New Jersey's pay-to-play law on the rest of the Nation. The \nthird criticism was that New Jersey did not need a change in Federal \nlaw in order for its own pay-to-play measures to be implemented. All of \nthese points are wrong and I will address each in turn.\n  The first criticism was that our amendment was unnecessary. The U.S. \nChamber of Commerce and certain members of the Senate argued that \ncompetitive bidding rules already guarantee fair treatment for all \ncontractors, without any favoritism. That is not true. Governments can \nand do enact unfair conditions to restrict who may bid. Sometimes those \nconditions can be subtle, such as requiring a certain size for a \ncompany that receives a contract. Sometimes they can be more overt, \nsuch as overly burdensome licensing requirements. As a result, the \nplaying field is hardly level for those who would like to compete for \ncontracts.\n  The second criticism was that Senator Lautenberg and I were trying to \ncreate a national pay-to-play rule that would apply to every State in \nthe country. That is also not true. We were not establishing a Federal \npay-to-play rule in Federal highway contracting. We were merely asking \nthe Senate to respect the rights of states to establish and maintain \ntheir own state contracting practices. Further, this only impacts \ncontributions to state level candidates. Federal campaign finance laws \nare in no way affected.\n  Finally, opponents argued that New Jersey does not need a Federal fix \nfor its pay-to-play problems. That is not true as well. New Jersey \nenacted a statute that limits contributions from a corporation or \nindividual who does business with the state to no more than $300. While \nthis is a valuable tool in ensuring that contracts are awarded solely \non the basis of merit, a gaping loophole exists due to the fact that \nthe U.S. Department of Transportation will not allow this law to apply \nto highway and mass transit contracts that use Federal funds. As a \nresult, New Jersey faces a situation where nearly $900 million in the \ncontracts for Federal highway and mass transit projects that it awards \nannually are susceptible to corruption. This is a ``corruption tax'' \nthat New Jersey's citizens must continue to pay, thanks to the Senate's \nactions last week.\n  A number of States and cities have enacted pay-to-play statutes that \nare similar to New Jersey's. This includes South Carolina, Kentucky, \nOhio, West Virginia, and New Jersey, and now Hawaii. In addition, pay-\nto-play measures have been enacted in the cities of Los Angeles, San \nFrancisco, Oakland, Chicago, and 24 local jurisdictions in New Jersey. \nPay-to-Play bills are also pending in Illinois, Connecticut, and New \nYork City. Let me be clear, the Senate's actions have put all of these \nlaws in jeopardy.\n  It is time for the Senate to ensure that both highway and mass \ntransit contracts can be awarded without the taint of government \ncorruption. We owe the taxpayers nothing less.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I want to talk briefly about an amendment \nto this bill that I cosponsored with Senators Hutchison and Ben Nelson.\n  The amendment repealed, for the most part, an unpopular provision \nthat was included in TEA-21 that has never been utilized: the \nInterstate System Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Pilot Program. It \nis also known as the Interstate Tolling Program.\n  I understand the desire to find new ways to finance our ever-growing \ntransportation needs. Our roads and bridges are deteriorating; our \nfreight, truck, and passenger traffic is increasing. According to the \nAmerican Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, we \nneed an annual investment by all levels of government of $92 billion a \nyear just to maintain the current system. To improve it, we need $125.6 \nbillion a year. This bill addresses only a fraction of those needs, but \nthe increased funding compared to levels contained in TEA-21 is a \npositive step.\n  I think we can do better, and I think we have a duty to do better. If \nwe can find ways to provide more money for infrastructure without \nincreasing our Nation's deficit, I believe we should do it. I have \nvoted in the past to increase the level of funding in this bill because \nI believe it is warranted, it is reasonable, and it is the responsible \nthing to do.\n  I applaud efforts to try to find new and innovative ways to finance \nnew road building.\n  The bill creates a new commission to explore alternative sources of \nrevenue for transportation. I think that is a good idea.\n  However, I cannot agree that it is a good idea to put tolls on \ninterstate highways that have already been paid for with Federal gas \ntax dollars. That is what the Interstate System Reconstruction and \nRehabilitation Program does.\n  This pilot program allows tolling of existing lanes on the Interstate \nHighway. I think that is bad policy, and that is why I have joined \nSenator Hutchison, and Senator Nelson in sponsoring an amendment to \nstrip this program from this reauthorization bill.\n  My amendment does not affect States' ability to finance new \ninterstate construction using tolls. It does not affect States' ability \nto convert HOV lanes to High Occupancy Toll--HOT--add new voluntary use \ntolled lanes to their Interstates, or toll non-Interstate roads.\n  The amendment only prevents tolling on existing interstate lanes, \nwhich have already been paid for once by federal gas taxes.\n  I see this as an issue of double taxation.\n  We are talking about interstate highways that were built using \nFederal gas tax money. There are those who want to tax the use of these \nsame roads that have already been paid for.\n  I understand the desire to find new ways to finance road building. In \nArkansas, our State leaders have chosen to increase the State gas tax \nthroughout the years in order to meet its road construction needs.\n  In fact, Arkansas is in the top half of State gas taxes. Arkansas has \nacted responsibly, and now there is an effort to institute tolls on \nexisting interstate highways because some States don't want to raise \ntheir gas taxes. They would rather tax through tolling:) I think that \nis unfair.\n  This is an issue that affects poor, rural residents who have limited \ntransportation options the most. Over the past few years, EAS and Small \nCommunity Air Service funding has been cut to many rural communities, \nincluding those in my State of Arkansas. AMTRAK is in financial \nturmoil, and over the road buses such as Greyhound have dramatically \ncut service.\n  Tolls on existing roads, which have already been financed and paid \nfor by federal gas taxes increase the burden on these people. Again, I \nthink it is simply unfair. Not only am I concerned about the double \ntaxation issue, but I believe this is a safety Issue.\n  Tolls on existing Interstates will produce substantial diversion of \ntraffic to other roads. I believe greater volume of truck traffic on \nlocal roads is not something we should encourage by placing tolls on \nthe interstates.\n  There is also an economic downside to tolling the interstate. \nBusinesses along newly tolled roads which rely on highway travelers--\nsuch as truck stops, motels and restaurants--will be hurt economically \nif significant traffic avoids the toll road.\n  The bottom line is that I believe allowing tolls on interstate \nhighways that have already been paid for by Federal gas taxes is bad \ntax policy, is unsafe, and could have very detrimental economic \neffects. I am hopeful that you will agree with me that tolling existing \ninterstate lanes is a bad idea, and will support our amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today with renewed hope and \nconfidence that this Congress can pass a surface transportation \nreauthorization bill. As it has been stated before, we have been \noperating under continuing resolutions--six of them--to keep the \nDepartment of Transportation's highway, transit, and highway safety \nprograms running. We have been operating\n\n[[Page S5275]]\n\nfor 2 years on expired legislation and we are far past due on our \ncommitment to the American people to deliver an updated policy and \nexpanded funding.\n  Last year both the Senate and House passed bills and the conference \ncommittee met for months before we were forced to abandon hopes of \ncompleting a conference report as a result of the much discussed \ndisagreement over the size of the bill. This year we will still have a \ndisagreement over the size of the bill but I am optimistic that with \nthe narrowed gap, we will be able to resolve the differences quickly \nand amicably. I am pleased the Senate will adopt a bill funded at $295 \nbillion and am hopeful that this funding level can be retained in \nconference. Our transportation system is bursting at the seams and the \nCongress must adequately fund this bill to address this myriad of \nneeds. Almost 30 percent of ou Nation's bridges are structurally \ndeficient. Thirty two percent of our major roads are in poor or \nmediocre condition. Our urban centers and suburban communities need \nexpanded and updated transit infrastructure. Americans spend 3.7 \nbillion hours each year in congested traffic. Our State highway \ndepartments are forced to cancel or delay projects as costs continue to \nrise while the revenue does not come.\n  In addition, we have a responsibility to make our transportation \nsystem safer for the traveling public. The President recognizes this \nand has appropriately named his proposal, the Safe, Accountable, \nFlexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005, SAFETEA. \nThroughout my career in the Senate I have worked with many of my \ncolleagues to address critical safety measures on our Nation's \nhighways. The most effective way to increase safety on our roads is to \nget people to wear their seat belts. I am a firm believer that the \nindividual States must pass primary safety belt laws. The statistics \nare clear. More than 50 percent of the fatalities on our highways are \nindividuals who were not wearing their safety belts. My hope is that \nthe incentive grants included in this bill will prompt states to take \nactions to cut into the tens of thousands of deaths on our roadways \neach year.\n  The Committee substitute will increase funding in the bill from $284 \nbillion as passed by the Environment and Public Works and Finance \nCommittees to $295 billion. This means an additional $247.7 million for \nmy home State of Virginia for a total of $4.7 billion in highway \nconstruction over the next 5 years. This represents more than a 32 \npercent increase over the highway funding in TEA-21. The Virginia \nDepartment of Transportation will now be able to restore many projects \nthat had been cut from our transportation plan because of the lack of \nrevenue. We have made small steps in the right direction to address \ndonor States, increasing the rate of return to 92 percent by 2009.\n  We will also increase funding for transit programs across the \ncountry. While this has traditionally only meant our urban centers, \ntransit has evolved to enable Americans in suburban and even rural \nareas of our States increased mobility on subways, buses, light rail, \ncommuter railroads, ferries, and vans. More than 80 million Americans \ndo not drive or have access to a car and this robust investment in our \ntransit systems helps not only those Americans but also helps relieve \ncongestion on our Nation's roads.\n  I wish to thank the chairmen and ranking members of the committees \nand subcommittees working so diligently on this bill. They and their \nstaffs have been working together for several years toward the ultimate \ngoal and today we take one step closer to that end. Chairman Inhofe, \nSubcommittee Chairman Bond, Ranking Member Jeffords, and Subcommittee \nRanking Member Baucus have worked openly with the EPW Committee and \nevery Senator in this body to address our concerns and their work is \nvery much appreciated by this Senator. They have worked well with the \nFinance, Commerce, and Banking Committees to bring this bill together. \nI know how difficult this bill is to manage and it is my sincere hope \nthat the conference committee will soon be able to resolve differences \nbetween the House and Senate bills and send a strong bill to the \nPresident. The bill we vote on today increases the revenue for our \nstate highway departments, enhances the safety of our roadways, will \nhelp states address environmental pollution from our roadways, and will \nreduce the congestion millions of Americans deal with each day to help \nkeep our Nation the strongest economy in the world.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President I would like to explain my vote today against \nthis important legislation, the highway reauthorization bill. I want to \nexplain that my vote was against the unfair treatment of my State, and \nnot a 5-year reauthorization bill. I support consistent and adequate \nfunding of our transportation infrastructure) but I do not support a \nbill that cuts Wisconsin's rate of return unfairly.\n  A safe and efficient transportation system is critically important to \nmy State. In Wisconsin, the changing seasons require constant \nmaintenance of our roads and bridges. In addition, we have an aging \nfleet of buses that are in dire need of replacement. A five-year \nreauthorization is necessary for sustained transportation planning; it \nwill provide jobs, will ensure safer travel on our highways and roads, \nand will provide transit funding for millions of commuters. I have \nheard from the people of Wisconsin, and I know they support a 5-year \nauthorization bill.\n  I share their sentiments on the need for an authorization bill. I \nalso share their sentiments on the bill the Senate passed today. I have \nspoken to engineers, bus drivers, road builders and businesses \nthroughout my state and the message is the same--don't support \nlegislation that would drop Wisconsin's rate of return. My support for \nthis legislation would undermine Wisconsin taxpayers who deserve better \nthan 92 cents on the dollar. A vote in favor of this legislation would \nset a dangerous precedent for treating Wisconsin unfairly.\n  I recognize the arguments of my colleagues that the overall funding \nfor Wisconsin will increase and I support the addition of $11.2 billion \nthat the substitute amendment contains. The substitute amendment \nprovides Wisconsin with an additional $147 million in highway funding \nover the five year life of the bill. These dollars are absolutely \nnecessary in the State, and I urge the conferees to maintain the Senate \nlevel of funding.\n  What the substitute amendment does not do, however, is greatly change \nmy State's rate of return. Over the life of the bill, Wisconsin will \nstill drop from an average of $1.02 to an average of 96 cents on every \ndollar the taxpayers send to Washington. The so-called equity bonus \nprogram included in the bill is far from equitable. It includes \nexemptions based on random criteria; it is a formula stitched together \nto appease the highest number of Senators possible, not to give each \nState its fair rate of return.\n  I remain hopeful that Congress will pass a bill much different than \nthe one the Senate votes on today. I hope that my colleagues will, in \nconference, repair the damage that is done to Wisconsin under the \nSenate bill. I hope the final bill gives Wisconsin its fair share. \nGiven the great need for a 5 year authorization bill, I would like to \nsupport this legislation. Given its treatment of Wisconsin, I cannot. I \nhope that will be different when the Senate considers a final bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, it is critically important that we move \nforward with this reauthorization of the Nation's highway and transit \nprograms. Although the funding levels contained in this measure are \nlower than many of us believe are warranted or necessary to address our \npressing transportation infrastructure needs, given the budget \nconstraints within which we had to work, I think we have responded with \na reasoned and balanced package that will maintain and enhance our \ntransit, rail and highway systems.\n  There is a huge backlog of needed repairs, replacements, and upgrades \nto bring our transportation network--our roads, bridges, transit \nsystems and railroads--up to standards. The Department of \nTransportation's Conditions and Performance Report estimates that an \naverage of $127 billion per year is needed over the next two decades to \nmaintain and improve the condition of these systems. Other estimates \nshow an even greater need. This backlog constrains our Nation's \neconomic competitiveness, leaves more and more Americans stuck in \ntraffic, contributes to air pollution and results in unnecessary \nfatalities.\n\n[[Page S5276]]\n\n  Just last week, the Texas Transportation Institute released its \nannual ``Urban Mobility Report,'' which measures traffic congestion in \nthe Nation's 85 largest cities. The report found that congestion across \nthe country delayed travelers by 3.7 billion hours and wasted 2.3 \nbillion gallons of gasoline in 2003. That is nearly 80 million more \nhours and 70 million more gallons of fuel in 2003 than in 2002. Average \nhours spent in rush hour traffic jams jumped from 16 in 1982 to 47 in \n2003. The Washington Metropolitan area continues to suffer the third-\nworst traffic congestion in the country, costing area drivers an \nestimated $2.46 billion in lost time, fuel and productivity, or $577 \nper commuter. Equally important, the study found that this area would \nhave the worst congestion in the country if not for our public \ntransportation systems. As these figures show, congestion has a real \neconomic cost, in addition to the psychological and social costs of \nspending hours each day sitting in traffic. We cannot afford to let \nthese costs of congestion grow any further.\n  In my judgment, the report underscores the need to bolster investment \nin our transportation infrastructure and to put in place a sensible, \nbalanced transportation network. Over the past 2 years, we have been \nworking hard in the Congress to do just that: to reauthorize the \nNation's surface transportation program, and to bring our \ntransportation network up to standards. Last year, the Senate approved \na measure authorizing $318 billion in funding over the next six years--\nan increase of $100 billion over the previous measure--which, in my \nview, provided the kind of investment needed to not only prevent \nfurther deterioration of our transportation network, but to improve the \nsystem, relieve congestion and save lives. Unfortunately, SAFETEA did \nnot emerge from conference due in large part to the unwillingness of \nthe administration and the House leadership to support that level of \ninvestment. As a result, we have had to pass six short-term extensions \nof the previous transportation legislation, TEA-21. The uncertainty \ninherent in these short-term extensions hinders our State and local \npartners in their efforts to meet the daily challenges of maintaining \nour transportation infrastructure and planning for improvements.\n  The measure that is before the Senate this year provides $295 billion \nover the next 6 years in highway and transit funding. That is $11 \nbillion more than the level recently approved by the House and $39 \nbillion more than was originally recommended in the President's \nreauthorization proposal. For our Nation's roadways and bridges, this \nlegislation authorizes an average increase of nearly 31 percent in \nfunding to enable States and localities to make desperately needed \nrepairs and improvements. Maryland's share of highway funding will grow \nby more than $820 million over the next 6 years, from $2.66 billion to \n$3.49 billion, compared to the level provided in TEA-21, to help \nupgrade our highway infrastructure. This represents an average of more \nthan $142 million more each year than was provided under TEA-21.\n  In the next two decades, Maryland's driving age population is \nexpected to increase by nearly 20 percent, the number of licensed \ndrivers by 25 percent, and the number of registered vehicles by nearly \n30 percent--and this will mean significantly more traffic on our roads \nand pressures on our transit systems. Maryland's Department of \nTransportation is facing deficient roads and bridges as well as key \ngaps and bottlenecks within the State's transportation system that are \nknown to cause delay and congestion. Maryland has an estimated unfunded \ncapital need for more than $13 billion in highway maintenance, \nconstruction and reconstruction over the next ten years. Clearly, \nMaryland must have adequate funding to address these transportation \nchallenges and to facilitate overall mobility--and the funds made \navailable under this measure will be a significant help in this regard.\n  Importantly, the measure preserves the dedicated funding for the \nCongestion Mitigation and Air Quality--CMAQ--program which helps States \nand local governments improve air quality in nonattainment areas under \nthe Clean Air Act; the Transportation Enhancement set-aside provisions \nwhich support bicycle and pedestrian facilities and other community \nbased projects, as well as the other core TEA-21 programs--Interstate \nmaintenance, National Highway System, Bridge and the Surface \nTransportation Program. Likewise, TEA-21's basic principles of \nflexibility, intermodalism, strategic infrastructure investment, and \ncommitment to safety are retained.\n  I am especially pleased that the Senate rejected an amendment to \nstrike the stormwater runoff mitigation provision that is contained in \nthe measure, which sets aside 2 percent of a State's Surface \nTransportation Program for stormwater runoff mitigation. According to \nthe Environmental Protection Agency, polluted stormwater from \nimpervious surfaces such as roads is a leading cause of impairment for \nnearly 40 percent of U.S. waterways not meeting water quality \nstandards. In the Chesapeake Bay region, it is estimated that runoff \nfrom highways contributes nearly 7 million pounds of nitrogen, 1 \nmillion pounds of phosphorous and 167,000 tons of sediment annually to \nthe bay. In Maryland alone, the Center for Watershed Protection \nestimates that the 7500 miles of Federal-aid highways generate yearly \nloads of 1.2 million pounds of nitrogen, 127,000 pounds of phosphorous \nand 25,000 pounds of sediment into Maryland waterways and eventually \ninto Chesapeake Bay each year. A study by the Chesapeake Bay Commission \nestimates stormwater retrofit costs at more than $2.5 billion across \nthe watershed. The stormwater provision will provide more than $66 \nmillion for the bay States and local governments for stormwater \nabatement, of which approximately $12.75 million would be available for \nMaryland.\n  For our Nation's transit systems, the legislation authorizes $53.8 \nbillion--$12.3 billion more than provided in TEA-21--to modernize and \nexpand our transit facilities. These funds will go a long way to \nmeeting the growing demand for transit in cities, towns, rural areas, \nand suburban jurisdictions across the country. Maryland's formula share \nof transit funding will grow by nearly 52 percent over the next 6 \nyears--from $571 million to $870 million. These funds are absolutely \ncritical to Maryland's efforts to maintain and upgrade the Baltimore \nand Washington Metro systems, the MARC commuter rail system serving \nBaltimore, Washington, DC, Frederick, and Brunswick, and the Baltimore \nLight Rail system. Bus systems and paratransit systems for elderly and \ndisabled people throughout Maryland will also receive a big boost in \nfunding. The measure also includes a provision reauthorizing the \nNational Transportation Center--NTC--at Morgan State University. The \nNTC conducts important research, education and technology transfer \nactivities that support workforce development of minorities and women, \nand addresses urban transportation problems. In addition, it includes \nprovisions which would address a very important issue for employees of \nthe Food and Drug Administration who will be relocating to the new FDA \nheadquarters at White Oak, MD, enabling the agency to use its own \nvehicles to offer employees shuttle service to and from the metro \nsystem at Silver Spring and potentially other transit facilities. The \npotential impact of this provision on regional traffic is not \ninsignificant. When construction of the White Oak complex is completed, \nFDA will house more than 7,000 FDA researchers and administrators at \nthe new facility. By enabling this access from FDA's new campus to a \ntransit station, we can reduce congestion on area roadways, improve our \nenvironment and elevate the quality of life for FDA employees. The \nlegislation also includes a requirement for the Federal Transit \nAdministration to report to Congress on ways to promote improved access \nto and increased usage of tax-free transit benefits at Federal agencies \nin the National Capital Region. Increasing use of public transit by \nfederal employees has the potential to greatly aid our efforts to \ncombat congestion and pollution in the region.\n  I am particularly pleased that the legislation includes the Transit \nin Parks Act, or TRIP, which I introduced. This new Federal transit \ngrant initiative will support the development of alternative \ntransportation services--everything from rail or clean fuel bus \nprojects to pedestrian and bike paths,\n\n[[Page S5277]]\n\nor park waterway access, within or adjacent to national parks and other \npublic lands. It will give our Federal land management agencies \nimportant new tools to improve both preservation and access. Just as we \nhave found in metropolitan areas, transit is essential to moving large \nnumbers of people in our national parks--quickly, efficiently, at low \ncost, and without adverse impact.\n  Like any other complex and comprehensive piece of legislation, this \nbill has its share of imperfections. But if we are to ensure not only \nthe safe and efficient movement of people, goods and services, but also \nthe future competitiveness and productivity of our economy, we must \nmake these investments, and move forward with this legislation. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in approving this measure.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member Jeffords, the \nBanking Committee Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Sarbanes, Finance \nCommittee Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus, and \nTransportation Subcommittee Chairman Bond for all their hard work in \ndeveloping this bill and bringing it to the floor. We all know how \nimportant it is that we complete work on it and get it to the President \nas soon as possible.\n  We face many challenges in our transportation system. Traffic \ncongestion continues to worsen. In the Philadelphia area--which \nincludes Wilmington, DE--rush hour motorists spent 38 hours in traffic \nin 2003. The number of cities experiencing 20 hours of delay or more \nper year has increased from only 5 in 1982 to 51 in 2003. This kind of \ncongestion costs this country approximately $63 billion a year and \nwastes nearly 2.5 billion gallons of fuel. We can do better.\n  This bill would provide Delaware with $793 million over 5 years to \naddress our transportation needs. These needs include the replacement \nof the Indian River Inlet Bridge Replacement in Sussex County which \ncarries 16,000 to 18,000 vehicles daily, not including the summer beach \ntraffic. It also includes needed improvements to increase capacity at \nthe I-95/SR-1 interchange, the busiest interchange in New Castle \nCounty.\n  Transit would receive around $46.5 billion over 5 years, funding the \nincreasing demand for transportation choices, allowing people to get \naround without a car. This demonstrates our growing awareness that \nwhile roads and bridges and highways are important and we still love \nour cars in this country, more and more people are using transit.\n  With the congestion we have on our highways, with our increasing \ndependence on foreign oil, with our increasing problems with air \npollution, it certainly makes sense to provide reliable transit for \npeople to get to work, shop or attend a ball game. In the city of \nWilmington, nearly 27 percent of households have no car and 44 percent \nhave only one. This saves families money that can be better invested in \nhome-ownership and their children's education.\n  In Delaware, we are responding to the demand for more transportation \nchoices by making improvements to allow more SEPTA trains to serve \nWilmington and Newark, and we hope to extend rail service to Middletown \nin the near future. Also, the State is investing in the replacement of \nour buses to improve transit statewide.\n  The transit title will also help states fund welfare-to-work \ntransportation programs. In Delaware, our welfare-to-work program \nprovides approximately 3000 welfare recipients with access to jobs by \ncreating alternative transit services in cooperation with other social \nservice providers. This is the only way these participants could access \nemployment and training.\n  In this important legislation, we are also investing $5.8 billion in \nsafety programs. This includes an incentive program for states to pass \nprimary seatbelt laws like we now have in Delaware. Wearing a seatbelt \nis the most important step anyone can take to improve their chances of \nsurviving a car crash, and primary enforcement seatbelt laws are the \nmost effective way to increase seatbelt use. Since Delaware's primary \nseatbelt law became effective in 2003, seatbelt usage has increased \nfrom 75 percent in 2003 to 82 percent in 2004.\n  We are also creating in this bill a program to make it safer for \nchildren to walk to school. A recent national survey found that while \n70 percent of parents walked or bicycled to school as children, only 18 \npercent of their children do today. Parents often say that walking to \nschool is no longer possible because there are busy, fast-moving, \nmulti-lane streets between home and school and often no sidewalks at \nall.\n  As more and more children are driven to school, we see traffic jams \nin school parking lots and increasing pollution around schools. \nMeanwhile, children lose this simple way to get a little exercise at a \ntime when many American children are struggling with being overweight \nand 15 percent are now considered obese, putting them at risk of a \nnumber of chronic diseases. Through the Safe Routes to School program, \nstates will be able to slow cars around schools, add crossing walks, \nbuild sidewalks and organize walking school buses where members of the \ncommunity walk a school bus route to walk kids to school.\n  Unfortunately, this bill does not completely overcome the tradition \nof separating the different modes of travel and treating them as if \nthey are separate systems. The users of the transportation system--the \nAmerican people--don't use the system that way. The design of highways \naffects people's ability to access transit, walk to the store or go for \na jog. The way we design our transportation system affects people's \nquality of life, the amount of pollution in the air, the amount of oil \nwe need, and the amount of polluted runoff in our water.\n  In fact, when we develop our transportation network without proper \nconsideration of other neighborhood needs, we find ourselves having to \nspend more money to retrofit streets so that kids may safely walk to \nschool or to decrease the amount of pollution that runs off roads into \nour rivers and lakes. And when we keep roads separate from transit and \ntransit separate from intercity rail and rail separate from air travel, \nwe miss the opportunity to make the system work more efficiently.\n  Sadly, this bill, which is supposed to address the Nation's surface \ntransportation policy, barely even mentions it. But later in the year \nwe will have the opportunity to consider what kind of support the \nFederal Government should provide freight and passenger rail. This is \nan important area that we have neglected for too long.\n  I hope as we consider a national rail policy we look at what has \nworked for highways, transit and air and use it to develop a robust \nrail system. I also hope that we do not consider rail in a vacuum but \nrather look for opportunities to coordinate rail investment with other \nmodes of travel--connecting airports to cities through rail for more \nseamless travel and connecting ports to rail to highways for more \nefficient shipment of freight.\n  Finally, because of the need to schedule a vote at 5:30 last \nThursday, I was unable to make a statement in favor of Senator Harkin's \ncomplete streets amendment, an amendment that I cosponsored and \nstrongly supported. So I would like to do so now.\n  First I would like to thank my colleague, Senator Harkin, for \noffering this amendment. I am proud to be a cosponsor. The adoption of \nthe complete streets amendment would be an important step forward in \nproviding safe transportation options for Americans. It would support \nactive and healthy lifestyles and encourage people to get out of their \ncars. It would also reduce pollution and our reliance on foreign oil.\n  It simply requires State transportation departments and metropolitan \nplanning organizations to fully integrate the needs and safety of all \nroad users into the design and operation of federal-aid roads and \nhighways. In other words, as we design our roads, we must consider more \nthan just the needs of cars. We must consider bicyclists, pedestrians, \nand everyone who uses our roads.\n  There are deadly consequences when this does not occur. Recently, a \nyoung woman from Poland who was working for a year in Lewes, DE, was \nkilled while riding her bike. There are hundreds of young people from \nEurope who come to work near the beaches in Delaware. Many of them do \nnot have or\n\n[[Page S5278]]\n\ncannot afford a car and get around by bicycle.\n  This particularly young woman, named Katarzyna Reteruk, was leaving \nher place of employment--Anne Marie's Seafood and Italian Restaurant on \nRoute 1--and was about to turn onto Route 24, when she was hit by a \nwoman leaving her place of employment. Katarzyna was thrown from her \nbike, struck the hood and windshield of the car, and died a short while \nlater.\n  This tragic event took place in a rapidly growing area of the State \nand on a highway that has had increasing congestion over the years. \nThis is a challenge many areas of the country are facing. But we have \nto ensure that we learn from this tragedy and others like it. We must \nmake improvements to our roadways for motorists--but we must also \naddress the safety and mobility needs of bicyclists and pedestrians.\n  We often say that we want to encourage people to get out of their \ncars and be more active. But when there is no place for people to \nsafely walk or bike, we can't expect them to do so. In a time of \nincreasing obesity, especially in our children, the time has come to \nensure that opportunities to walk to school or to a friend's house or \njust for exercise are available in as many places as possible.\n  By considering the needs of non-motorists, we will improve mobility \nfor those who cannot afford a car--including young people just starting \nout--and allow a family of 5 to more easily get by with only 2 cars.\n  We have already included in this bill a program called Safe Routes to \nSchools to retrofit our roads to make them safer for children to walk \nto school. This amendment is an excellent addition to that provision in \nthat it would ensure that new road projects are built with pedestrians \nin mind, saving us from having to spend money to retrofit roads later.\n  Under the complete streets amendment, State departments of \ntransportation and metropolitan planning organizations would have to: \n1, fully integrate the needs of pedestrians and bike riders in the \ntransportation planning process; 2, promote pedestrian and bicycle \nsafety improvements, and 3, set goals for increasing non-motorized \ntransportation.\n  Metropolitan planning organizations serving 200,000 people or more, \nsuch as the one in Wilmington, DE, would have to designate a bicycle/\npedestrian coordinator and account for the safety needs of pedestrians \nand bicyclists in their long term plans.\n  Finally, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation would \nreport to Congress annually on the share of research funds allocated to \ndirectly benefit the planning, design, operation and maintenance of the \ntransportation system for non-motorized users.\n  This amendment would build expertise in how we can make our roads \nsafer for bicyclists and pedestrians, while improving our roads for \ndrivers as well. I hope that we are able to encourage its adoption in \nconference.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, funding for transportation infrastructure \nsuch as roads, bridges and border crossings is a sound investment that \nincreases the mobility of people and goods, enhances economic \ncompetitiveness, reduces traffic congestion, and improves air quality. \nThose improvements in transportation infrastructure are critical to our \nStates, and the Federal highway money that States receive is critical \nfor funding them. In addition, few Federal investments have as large \nand immediate an impact on job creation and economic growth as \ntransportation infrastructure. The Department of Transportation \nestimates that every $1 billion in new Federal investment creates more \nthan 47,500 jobs.\n  Unfortunately, the formula that distributes Federal highway funds to \nStates is antiquated and inequitable. Historically, about 20 States, \nincluding Michigan, have been ``donor'' States, sending more gas tax \ndollars to the highway trust fund in Washington than are returned in \ntransportation infrastructure spending. The remaining 30 States, known \nas ``donee'' States, have received more transportation funding than \nthey paid into the highway trust fund.\n  This unfair practice began in 1956 when small States and large \nWestern States banded together to develop a formula for distributing \nFederal highway dollars that advantaged themselves over the remaining \nStates. Once that formula was in place, they have tenaciously defended \nit.\n  At the beginning, there was some legitimacy to the concept that \nlarge, low-population, and predominately Western States need to get \nmore funds than they contributed to the system. It was the only way \nthat we could build a national interstate highway system. However, \nthere is no justification today for any State getting more than its \nfair share. With the national interstate system completed, the formulas \nused to determine how much a State will receive from the highway trust \nare simply unfair.\n  Each time the highway bill has been reauthorized, I, along with my \ncolleagues from the other donor States, have fought to correct this \ninequity in highway funding. Through these battles, some progress has \nbeen made. For instance, in 1978, Michigan was getting around 75 cents \nback on our Federal gas tax dollar. The 1991 bill brought us up to \napproximately 80 cents per dollar, and the 1998 bill guaranteed a 90.5-\ncent minimum return for each State.\n  Last year, we believed we had another significant victory when the \nSenate passed a bill that would have given donor States 95 cents on the \ndollar in the final year of the bill. Unfortunately, that bill died in \nconference due to the President's veto threat and his unwillingness to \naccept the funding levels in either the House or Senate bill.\n  This year's legislation, however, would give donor States just 92 \npercent of their highway trust fund contributions by 2009. Although \nthat is a small step in the right direction of closing the equity gap, \nwe still have a long way to go to achieve fairness for Michigan and \nother donor States.\n  This bill is also a setback from last year's bill because it provides \nfewer overall transportation dollars. Last year, the Senate wisely \npassed a bill that would have pumped $318 billion into our \ntransportation systems over 6 years. This year, the Senate has reduced \nthat funding down to $295 billion. That is more than the House-passed \nbill of $284 billion but still less than what is needed.\n  Michigan's rate of return would go from 90.5 percent to 92 percent \nimmediately and remain at 92 percent for the full 5 years of this bill. \nUnder this bill Michigan would get an annual average funding level of \n$1.134 billion which represents a 28-percent gain over TEA-21.\n  We have made progress in this bill compared to current law in the \nongoing fight for equity for donor States. I will continue to fight in \nthe future, as I have in the past, looking toward full equity for \nMichigan. I recognize, however, that we have reduced the inequity a \nlittle more in each previous reauthorization bill, and we do so in this \nbill as well. This bill will bring billions of desperately needed \ndollars to States across the country. It will improve our Nation's \ntransportation infrastructure and create millions of American jobs, and \ntherefore I will support it, although its steps toward equity and \nfairness are very tiny indeed.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on final \npassage on the Senate version of H.R. 3, the SAFETEA bill. As we all \nknow, the country has important transportation needs that Congress must \naddress and I commend the managers of the bill for working hard to \naddress highway construction, mass transit, highway safety and other \nimportant programs.\n  This is a very important bill and I am not taking my vote lightly. I \nhave heard from numerous individuals and groups across Wisconsin who \nare opposed to another temporary extension and eager to have the \ncertainty for planning purposes that comes with a full reauthorization. \nI understand their concerns and I share their desire that Congress \nprovide necessary transportation funding. That is why I voted in favor \nof the motion to proceed to the bill and the motion to invoke cloture \non the bill--because Congress needs to act on the country's \ntransportation priorities. I wish I could vote for the bill. I would \nhave voted for a bill that was equitable, even if it was not perfect. \nHowever, the current bill is far from equitable--in fact, it makes \nWisconsin a double loser, both under the funding formula's rate of \nreturn and in the level of overall funding relative to the last bill, \nTEA-21. The bill does not\n\n[[Page S5279]]\n\ndo nearly enough to help meet the transportation needs of my \nconstituents in Wisconsin and, for that reason, I will vote against the \nbill.\n  Let me take a little time to explain my concerns with the bill, \nstarting with the funding formula this bill would establish. Under that \nformula, certain States would continue to receive significantly more \nmoney than they pay into the highway trust fund, while other States \ncontinue to be denied their fair share. In fact, the number of donor \nStates--or those who receive less than their fair share--would actually \nincrease under this bill compared to the final year of TEA-21. In 2004 \nthere were 27 donor States, while by the end of the new bill in 2009 \nthere would be 31 States that pay more into the highway trust fund than \nthey receive back. Six States--Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, New Hampshire, \nOregon and Wisconsin--would become donors, while only Arkansas and \nNebraska would leave that category.\n  I worked hard with the rest of the Wisconsin delegation during the \nlast successful authorization to make sure that our State finally got a \nfair rate of return. Let me tell my colleagues, that change was long \noverdue. According to numbers from the Department of Transportation, \nfrom 1956 through 2000, Wisconsin got back just 90 cents on every \ndollar it paid into the trust fund.\n  In TEA-21, Wisconsin at last received a fair return. Unfortunately, \nthis bill will take us back to where we were for the previous four \ndecades--in the hole. Under the new formula, Wisconsin will once again \nbe a donor State in 2006 and receive the bare minimum rate of return of \n92 percent by the final year of the bill. I have spoken to other \nmembers of our State's delegation, and I think I can safely say we \nagree that Wisconsin deserves better.\n  It is bad enough that the bill would return Wisconsin to donor \nstatus. Adding insult to injury is the level of funding that this bill \nwould provide for my State. This bill provides almost flat funding for \nWisconsin, which we all know in real terms is a cut. In 2004 under TEA-\n21, Wisconsin received $635 million, while the average spending under \nthe current bill would only be $642.8 million per year. When these \nfigures are adjusted for inflation, in real terms the bill means a \nreduction of over $35 million each year for Wisconsin, reducing our \nability to meet our transportation needs--all while we become a donor \nState and again subsidize other States' transportation projects.\n  I cannot support a bill that treats Wisconsin so poorly with respect \nto both overall funding and the formula's rate of return. Fortunately, \ntoday's vote is not the final word on this bill. I will continue to \nwork hard with the senior Senator from Wisconsin and the rest of the \nState's delegation to do everything that we can to produce a final \ntransportation bill that is fair for our constituents.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the highway \nbill. I want to first applaud the bill manager, my good friend Senator \nInhofe for all of his hard work on this important legislation. I also \nwant to thank the ranking member of the EPW committee, Senator \nJeffords, for his work on the bill.\n  Mr. President, the highway bill is one of the most important pieces \nof legislation that the Senate undertakes. This bill makes it possible \nto construct and repair vital transportation arteries that crisscross \nthis great Nation. As our country grows we must be conscious of our \ntransportation needs. Accordingly, this bill increases funding for road \nconstruction that will substantially reduce traffic delays that plague \nthe country. Additionally, this bill substantially increases transit \nfunding further reducing congestion and pollution caused by over-\npopulated highways.\n  My home state of New Mexico is one of the most rural states in the \ncountry. However, our population is on the rise and it is vitally \nimportant to ensure New Mexicans have the transportation infrastructure \nthey need to be competitive with the rest of the country. This bill \nwill provide roughly $1.7 billion in funding for New Mexico specific \nprojects.\n  This bill also increases funding for the Indian roads program. I have \nadvocated for increased Indian roads funding for a number of years and \nwhile this increase only begins to address the need, it will help \nimmensely in addressing the economic development problems facing Indian \nCountry.\n  Once again, I would like to thank the chairman and ranking member of \nthe EPW Committee and their staff for doing a great job in getting this \nbill completed.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senate voted last Wednesday morning, \nMay 11, to waive the Budget Act point of order that applied against the \nInhofe substitute, Senate Amendment 606. The Budget Committee has since \nreceived a cost estimate of that substitute from the Congressional \nBudget Office. As I pointed out last week, CBO was not able to provide \na more timely estimate because the language was not provided to them \nuntil it became available on May 10, a day after the Inhofe substitute \nwas put before the Senate. Apparently none of the committees of \njurisdiction had asked CBO for an estimate of their combined amendment.\n  So for the information of my colleagues and the public, I would like \nto enter a table into the Record that summarizes the status of this \nhighway bill with regard to budgetary enforcement--showing why there \nwas a 302(f) point of order that I raised.\n  I would also like to place into the Record a table that addresses not \nthe contract authority, which is the relevant unit of analysis for \nbudgetary enforcement of this bill, but the deficit results of this \nbill. Last week the bill's proponents repeatedly asserted the bill is \n``paid for'' over the 2005-2009 window of the bill and reduces the \ndeficit by $14 billion over the 2005-2015 period. It is hard to know \nhow anyone could say this because the Budget Committee and the other \ncommittees did not receive until yesterday CBO's estimate of highway \ntrust fund outlays resulting from the Inhofe substitute. Combining \nthose outlay estimates with JCT's estimate of the new revenues that \nwould occur if the provisions of the substitute were actually enacted, \nwe know that the substitute would increase the deficit by $0.5 billion \nover the 2005-2009 period, and would reduce the deficit by only $3.5 \nbillion over the 2005-2015 period, not $14 billion as the proponents \nhave claimed.\n  But these budgetary effects come after other general-fund transfer \nprovisions--relating, for example, to the 2.5 cents deficit reduction \ntax on gasoline and 5.2 tax subsidy for ethanol were enacted in the \nJOBS bill, P.L. 108-35--last fall. By creating higher paper entries \ninto the highway trust fund, those enacted provisions will have the \nconsequence of increasing the spending possible from the highway trust \nfund by $31 billion over the 2005-2015 period without a corresponding \nincrease in new Federal revenues. This will have the effect of \nincreasing the deficit by $31 billion over that period.\n  It is true that both the President's budget request for 2006 and the \n2006 budget resolution now contemplate spending those shifted resources \non transportation programs. But combining those general-fund transfer \nprovisions enacted last fall with possible enactment of the additional \ngeneral-fund transfers and new revenues from general fund offsets in \nthis Inhofe substitute before the Senate still will have the effect of \nincreasing the deficit by $28 billion over the 2005-2015 period. \nCompared to the resources available for spending from the highway trust \nfund 7 months ago, if this Inhofe substitute is enacted, the increase \nin spending that will be enabled from the highway trust fund will \nincrease the deficit by $28 billion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 2 tables displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5280]]\n\n\n\n COMPARISON OF BUDGET AUTHORITY LEVELS IN INHOFE SUBSTITUTE (SA 605) TO\n             COMMITTEE ALLOCATIONS IN 2006 BUDGET RESOLUTION\n                              [$ billions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                       2005         2006       2006-10\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCommittee\nEnvironment and Public Works\nAmount over (+)/under (-)........         -1.5         -0.3         22.6\nBanking\nAmount over (+)/under (-)........          0.6          0.6          3.1\nCommerce\nAmount over (+)/under (-)........          0.0          0.1          0.2\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Source: Senate Budget Committee.\n\n\n                               DEFICIT EFFECT OF INHOFE SUBSTITUTE (SA 605) TO H.R. 3--TRANSPORTATION REAUTHORIZATION BILL\n                                                                      [$ billions]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                             2005    2006    2007    2008    2009    2010    2011    2012    2013    2014    2015   2005-2009  2005-2015\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOutlays a\nHighway Trust Fund Outlays under Inhofe       40.5    38.3    43.6    47.0    49.6    50.6    52.6    54.0    55.2    56.2    57.6     178.5      504.5\n Substitute (SA 605)......................\nHighway Trust Fund Outlays under reported     40.5    37.7    42.1    44.9    47.3    48.7    51.0    52.4    53.6    54.6    56.0     172.0      488.3\n version HR 3.............................\nIncrease in Outlays Resulting from Inhofe      0.0     0.6     1.5     2.1     2.3     1.9     1.6     1.6     1.6     1.6     1.6       6.5       16.2\n Substitute (SA 605)......................\nRevenues b\nNew Highway Trust Fund Revenues Resulting   ......     0.2     0.2     0.2     0.2     0.2     0.2     0.2     0.2     0.2     0.2       0.7        1.7\n from Inhofe Substitute (SA 605)--Fuel\n Fraud....................................\nNew General Fund Revenues Resulting from\n Inhofe Substitute (SA 605)\n    Economic Substance Doctrine...........  ......     0.6     0.8     1.1     1.3     1.4     1.6     1.9     2.2     2.4     2.6       3.8       16.0\n    Other Revenue Increases...............     0.1     0.5     0.5     0.5     0.5     0.4     0.3     0.3     0.3     0.3     0.3       2.0        3.9\n    Assorted Tax Breaks...................     0.0    -0.1    -0.1    -0.1    -0.1    -0.2    -0.2    -0.2    -0.2    -0.3    -0.3      -0.5       -1.8\nTotal Net New Federal Revenues Resulting       0.1     1.1     1.4     1.7     1.8     1.9     1.9     2.1     2.4     2.6     2.8       6.0       19.8\n from Inhofe Substitute (SA 605)..........\nAmount that Increase in Outlays Exceeds\n Increase in Revenues Resulting from\n Inhofe Substitute (SA 605)\nDeficit Increase(+)/Decrease(-)...........    -0.1    -0.6     0.1     0.5     0.5     0.0    -0.3    -0.5    -0.8    -1.1    -1.2       0.5      -3.5\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMEMO: DEFICIT INCREASE RESULTING FROM GENERAL FUND TRANSFERS INTO HIGHWAY TRUST FUND ENACTED IN P.L. 108-357 (does not include enacted fuel fraud\n  provisions) c: 31.3.\na.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my appreciation to \nthe managers of this legislation for including my amendment relating to \ncommercial driver training programs. The amendment authorizes $5 \nmillion to the Department of Transportation for a grant program for \ndriver training schools and for financial assistance for entry-level \ndrivers who need the training.\n  In my State of Montana, and around the country, the trucking industry \nis a critical component of the economy. In 2000, the trucking industry \nin Montana provided 1 out of every 13 jobs, paying nearly $900 million \nin wages each year. Currently, the trucking industry is experiencing a \nsevere shortage of drivers, and my amendment seeks to address that \nconcern by providing funds to get folks behind the wheel.\n  Industry research indicates the number of new truck drivers in the \nU.S. needs to increase by 320,000 jobs per year over the next 10 years \nto fill the projected economic growth for that time period. \nAdditionally, another 219,000 new truck drivers will have to be added \neach year to replace drivers who will be retiring over this period. \nThose are important jobs, and we need to get folks trained and ready to \nfill the growing demand for transportation services.\n  The average entry-level driving course can run as much as $4,000. \nThose tuition costs can serve as a barrier to drivers who need the \ntraining, and my amendment would allow training programs to use grant \nmoney to provide financial assistance to those who need it. When you \nare out of work and looking for a job, a $4,000 entry fee can seem a \nlittle steep--so this amendment will help folks out, and give them the \nresources they need to get trained and get trucking.\n  The highway bill before the Senate right now is a jobs bill, plain \nand simple. By authorizing critical funding for highway programs, we \nkeep people working on our Nation's infrastructure. Construction \nprojects that are currently stalled or deferred, waiting for final \npassage of a highway bill, can get underway again. My amendment \ncontributes to the job growth encouraged by the highway bill, and I am \npleased that it could be included. I commend the managers of this bill \nfor their hard work but know that much more remains to be done in \nconference. In a State as large as Montana, infrastructure development \nis essential to our economic growth. This legislation will allocate \nneeded funds to our roads and transit systems. The highway bill is a \npriority for our country, and I look forward to supporting its final \npassage here in the Senate.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, after great effort by many people, the \nSenate is ready to move us one step closer to enacting legislation with \nthe potential to impact all Americans in every state. Crumbling \ninfrastructure and poor transportation choices impede our ability to \nlive and do business, and the Senate clearly recognizes that fact. Our \ntransportation bill utilizes more than $295 billion to ensure all \nAmericans have access to efficient and reliable transportation as they \ngo about their professional and personal lives.\n  Among the many people whose hard work has made the difference, I must \nfirst thank the chairmen and ranking members of all the appropriating \ncommittees that have been involved in this process.\n  Credit must also go to all members of my staff, who spent many hours \nsifting through the nuts and bolts of this bill. Kolan Davis, Mark \nPrater, Elizabeth Paris, Christy Mistr, Ed McClellan, Dean Zerbe, John \nO'Neill, Sherry Kuntz, and Nick Wyatt showed great dedication to the \ntasks before them.\n  As is usually the case, the cooperation of Senator Baucus and his \nstaff was imperative. I particularly want to thank Russ Sullivan, \nPatrick Heck, Bill Dauster, Kathy Ruffalo-Farnsworth, Matt Jones, Jon \nSelib, Anita Horn Rizek, Judy Miller, Melissa Mueller, Ryan Abraham, \nMary Baker, and Wendy Carey.\n  I also want to mention George K. Yin, the chief of staff of the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation and his staff, especially the fuel fraud team of \nTom Barthold, Deirdre James, Roger Colinvaux, and Allen Littman, as \nwell as the always invaluable assistance of Mark Mathiesen, Jim Fransen \nand Mark McGunagle of Senate Legislative Counsel.\n  This bill is infused with the spirit of bipartisan cooperation. \nHopefully that spirit will survive the ongoing legislative process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the committee substitute is \nagreed to.\n  There will now be 2 minutes evenly divided before the final vote.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, once again I thank Senator Inhofe and \nall of the Senators and staff that have helped us reach this point.\n  This bill will make a difference in the life of every American by \nmaking it easier and safer to get from place to place.\n  In passing this bill, the Senate puts this Nation on the path to \nbetter roads, on the path to shorter and safer commutes, and on the \npath to more jobs. And this bill will not add a dime to the deficit.\n\n[[Page S5281]]\n\n  The additional $11 billion in this bill will allow all States and all \ncommunities to benefit under this legislation, and it is crucial that \nwe hold on to that funding as we move forward with this bill.\n  The President's veto threat against this bill is a mistake, it is \nmisguided and it is flat out wrong.\n  Let's get this bill done, and get it done right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield to Senator Bond.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, after working 2\\1/2\\ years on this bill, we \nhave a bill that brings the environmental considerations into the \nplanning early on so they can be dealt with without wasting money, \ntime, and resources.\n  No State gets as much as they would like, but thanks to the Finance \nCommittee, the donor States get up to 92 cents. All States go up by at \nleast 15 percent. Given the constraints under which we operated, I urge \nmy colleagues to adopt this bill.\n  I commend the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, Jim Inhofe, along with Senators Baucus and Jeffords for a \njob well done. It has been a pleasure working with them.\n  I also think it is appropriate to recognize the staff members that \nhave put in many countless hours of their time to assist in drafting \nthis legislation.\n  I want to especially recognize my staff: Ellen Stein, John Stoody and \nHeideh Shahmoradi.\n  Staff with Senator Inhofe: Ruth Van Mark, James Q'Keeffe, Andrew \nWheeler, Nathan Richmond, Greg Murrill, Alex Herrgott, John Shanahan, \nAngie Giancarlo, and Rudy Kapichak.\n  Senator Jefford's staff: JC Sandberg, Allison Taylor, Malia \nSomerville, JoEllen Darcy, and Chris Miller.\n  And Kathy Ruffalo with Senator Baucus.\n  This bill faced great challenges within these past 2\\1/2\\ years. The \ncommittee worked hard through many meetings, hearings, a failed \nconference, and all to repeat the process again this year in order to \nget where we are today.\n  Interestingly enough, while on the floor both last year and this \nyear, the Senate was sidetracked by ricin last year which had the \nSenate office buildings shut down for a couple of days. And just last \nweek, a general aviation aircraft entered our air space causing us all \nto run out of the Senate Chamber. I can honestly say, I will be \nrelieved when this bill is finally passed.\n  Some of the highlights that I am proud of in this bill include the \nemphasis on safety. Safety, for the first time in our recent \ntransportation legislation, is given a prominent position and elevated \nto a core program.\n  This bill mirrors the administration's proposal by continuing our \ncommitment to our motoring public's safety.\n  Nearly 43,000 lives are taken on our roads and highways each year. I \nam glad that the bill reflects the continued commitment to making not \nonly investments in our infrastructure, but also to the general safety \nand welfare of our constituents.\n  Another highlight of this bill moves to carefully balance the needs \nof the donor States while also recognizing the needs of donee States.\n  My home State of Missouri, like many of the donor States mentioned, \nhas some of the worst roads in the Nation. The condition of many of the \nroads and bridges in Missouri require immediate repair or \nreconstruction.\n  I am pleased to say that we did make progress in achieving a 92 cent \nrate of return by the end of the authorization. I am hopeful that donor \nStates will see a dollar for dollar rate of return in the future.\n  Further, I am proud to announce that all States will grow at not less \nthan 15 percent over TEA-21.\n  The bill also addresses several environmental issues that provide the \nnecessary tools to reduce or eliminate unnecessary delays during the \nenvironmental review process.\n  Transportation projects can be built more quickly by allowing \nenvironmental stakeholders to weigh in at the early stages.\n  Mr. President, we are facing an expiration of May 31. I am confident \nthat if conferees are named shortly, we will only require a short-term \nextension and can move this bill through conference quickly.\n  Our States need a multi-year bill. We cannot delay contracts anymore. \nThe economy needs this boost and people need the jobs that this bill \nwill provide.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues as we go to \nconference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the Senator from Missouri is accurate. We \nhave been talking about this for 3 years now. I do not think there is \nanything new that can be said, but I do renew my congratulations and \nthanks to all the staff who worked on this bill, certainly Senator \nJeffords, Senator Baucus, and Senator Bond.\n  I agree it would be nice if we had something with which everyone \nagreed. It is impossible to do. The only way to do that is in a way \nthat is not desirable. We did a formula, and we took into consideration \nall the factors--donee, donor States, size of the States, passthrough, \nfatalities--and I think we have a good bill.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time. Have the yeas and nays been \nrequested?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been requested.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I withhold my request for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 13 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Thirteen. I will be brief.\n  Mr. President, I thank all my colleagues. This was a consequence of \nboth sides working together--big States, small States. It is now time \nto get to conference. It is also a good example of what we can do if we \ndo not have this filibuster issue hanging over our heads. We can work \ntogether. We can get things done. I very much hope Senators recognize \nthis because afterwards, it may not always be this way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on the engrossment of the amendment and third reading \nof the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read a third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass? The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 89, nays 11, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 125 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--89\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--11\n\n     Brownback\n     Cornyn\n     DeMint\n     Feingold\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Hutchison\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     McCain\n     Sununu\n  The bill (H.R. 3), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today the Senate has overwhelmingly \napproved the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation \nEquity Act of 2005, SAFETEA, H.R. 3. I supported this important \nlegislation, as I did last year when the Senate passed a\n\n[[Page S5282]]\n\nsimilar measure, S. 1072. I believe it is a critical step toward \nfunding our Nation's transportation infrastructure and creating much \nneeded jobs.\n  Now the real work begins. The Senate funding level is $295 billion. \nThe House has passed its version, TEA-LU, at $284 billion over 6 years. \nAnd the President unfortunately supports the lower House number. In \nfact, he has threatened to veto any transportation bill that exceeds \nthe $284 billion funding level.\n  I was proud to join 83 of my Senate colleagues in standing firm on \nthe Senate level of $295 billion. The White House should take note that \nat least 84 Senators--a supermajority--support a higher number.\n  Reauthorization of TEA-21 is one of the most important job and \neconomic stimuli that the 109th Congress can pass. We must work quickly \nto deliver the best conference report at the highest possible funding \nlevel. We should not let further delay stand in the way of real \ntransportation infrastructure improvement, economic development, and \njob creation.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the benefits of this \nlegislation for my home State of Illinois.\n  H.R. 3, as amended by the Senate, would make the largest investment \nto date in our Nation's aging infrastructure, $295 billion over the \nlife of the bill. In short, SAFETEA would increase the State of \nIllinois' total Federal transportation dollars and provide greater \nflexibility. It would help improve the condition of Illinois' roads and \nbridges, properly fund mass transit in Chicago and downstate, alleviate \ntraffic congestion, and address highway safety and the environment.\n  The bill would provide $184.5 billion over the next 5 years for \nhighways and other surface transportation programs. Illinois has the \nthird largest Interstate System in the country; however, its roads and \nbridges are rated among the worst in the Nation. The State can expect \nto receive more than $6.1 billion over the next 5 years from the \nhighway formula contained in the Senate bill. That is a 33-percent \nincrease over the last transportation bill, TEA-21.\n  With these additional funds, the Illinois Department of \nTransportation will be able to move forward on major reconstruction and \nrehabilitation projects throughout the State.\n  Mass transit funding is vitally important to the Chicago metropolitan \narea as well as to many downstate communities. It helps alleviate \ntraffic congestion, lessen air emissions, and provides access for \nthousands of Illinoisans every day. H.R. 3, as amended by the Senate, \nincludes $46.53 billion over the next 5 years for mass transit. \nIllinois would receive about $2.22 billion over the next 5 years under \nthe Senate bill, a $286 million or nearly 15-percent increase from TEA-\n21.\n  This legislation also preserves some important environmental and \nenhancement programs, including the Congestion Mitigation and Air \nQuality, CMAQ, program. CMAQ's goal is to help States meet their air \nquality conformity requirements as prescribed by the Clean Air Act. The \nSenate bill would increase funding for CMAQ from $8 billion to $10.8 \nbillion--an increase of 35 percent. Illinois received more than $460 \nmillion in CMAQ funds in TEA-21. The State is expected to receive an \nincrease in CMAQ funds under the Senate bill.\n  With regard to highway safety, Illinois is 1 of 20 States that has \nenacted a primary seatbelt law. H.R. 3 would enable the State of \nIllinois and other States who have passed primary seatbelt laws to \nobtain Federal funds to implement this program and further improve \nhighway safety.\n  I know this legislation is not perfect. Illinois' highway formula \nshould be higher. Amtrak reauthorization and rail freight \ntransportation funding are noticeably absent. And important road and \ntransit projects from around my home State have not yet been included. \nI will work with Senator Barack Obama, a member of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, and my Illinois colleagues in the House to \nensure that Illinois receives a fair share of transportation funds--\nhighway, transit, and highway safety--in the final conference report.\n  I know my colleagues on the other side of the Capitol understand the \nimportance of this legislation and I am hopeful that Congress can \nexpeditiously work through the differences between the House and Senate \nbills in a conference committee. One of every five jobs in Illinois is \nrelated to transportation, including construction jobs. Unless Congress \nmoves quickly, we will lose another construction season and the \nimportant jobs that are created by public investment in transportation.\n  Mr. President, with the passage of this legislation, the Senate has \nupheld its obligation to reauthorize and improve our Nation's important \ntransportation programs. I am pleased to support SAFETEA.\n\n\n                          MISSED SENATE VOTES\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, on May 11, 2005, I was necessarily absent \nfrom the Senate to attend the funeral of St. Paul, MN police officer, \nSergeant Gerald Vick, who tragically lost his life in the line of duty \non Friday, May 6, 2005. I joined over 2,000 Minnesotans in paying our \nfinal respects to this heroic peace officer, community leader, and \ndevoted husband and father.\n  Had I been present to vote on the amendments to the Transportation \nEquity Act, I would have voted as follows:\n  On the motion to waive the Congressional Budget Act, in relation to \namendment No. 605 and H.R. 3, I would have voted ``yea.''\n  On the motion to table Corzine amendment No. 606, I would have voted \n``nay.''\n  On the Lautenberg amendment No. 625, I would have voted ``nay.''\n  On the Harkin amendment No. 618, as modified, I would have voted \n``yea.''\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, did my friend wish to make some comments \non the floor at this time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, no. I am not going to make \nany additional remarks. I was going to put us into morning business. I \nunderstand the Senator had some things she wanted to talk about.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If you could do that, if you could ask unanimous consent \nI be recognized first in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/17/senate-section/article/S5282-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, before my colleague, Senator Inhofe, \nleaves the floor, I truly wish to say to him, as my chairman, how much \nI have enjoyed working with him on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. What an important bill we have done, all of us together, \nacross party lines. I am very hopeful we can see this bill move forward \nso the American people can move forward with their lives. They need the \nhighways. They need the transit. They need the jobs this bill promises.\n  I wished to thank him before he left the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/17/senate-section/article/S5282-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5282-S5287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have asked for this time so I could talk \nabout the issue that is really hanging over the head of the Senate, as \nSenator Baucus said when he gave his support to the highway and transit \nbill: What we can do when we work together. What we can do when we set \naside the partisanship. What we can do when we work for our people, \nrather than make up a phony crisis about the courts and threaten to \nchange more than 200 years of tradition and threaten a nuclear option--\nwhich was named by the Republicans, by the way, when they thought about \nit because it is so vicious, it hurts so hard, it has such fallout that \nit will change the very nature of the Senate. But more importantly, it \nwill change the way we now can protect the people of the United States \nof America.\n  This is a very simple chart. It shows the numbers 208 to 10; 208 \nrepresents\n\n[[Page S5283]]\n\nthe number of judges President Bush has been able to get voted into \noffice as a result of actions of this Congress since he got into power. \nTwo hundred eight of his judges have gone through. This Senate has \nstopped 10, 10 of his nominees. Actually, some of my colleagues remind \nme now it is really only five because some of them are no longer up for \njudgeships or we have relented on a couple of them, but I am going to \nbe fair to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and paint the \nworst possible picture in terms of the number we have stopped--10.\n  This is a 95-percent success rate. I ask the people of this country \nto think about what it would mean in their lives if they got 95 percent \nof what they wanted. If their child came home on a regular basis with \n95 percent from school? That is an A+. If their spouse said, ``Honey, I \nagree with you,'' 95 percent of the time and you got your way 95 \npercent of the time, you would be smiling.\n  When you went to work and you had a pretty tough boss, and your boss \ncalled you into the office and he said, ``You know, you are a fine \nworker, Barbara. You are a great worker. As a matter of fact, I have \nlooked over your work, and I have agreed with you 95 percent of the \ntime,'' I think that is the moment I would ask for a raise.\n  If you get what you want 95 percent of the time, you should have a \nbroad smile on your face. You should feel good about yourself. You \nshould feel great about yourself.\n  But you know what, if you wanted 100 percent all the time, if you \nnever wanted to give 1 inch of space, if you demanded that your child \nget 100 percent every time, you would not be happy. I call it the \narrogance of power.\n  What we are seeing in the United States of America is an arrogance of \npower. My colleagues--and particularly the White House--are not happy \ngetting 208 of their judges but not getting 10 of their judges; they \nare not happy with 95 percent results. What do they do? They say: We \nwant to change the rules of the Senate. All right, what are the rules \nof the Senate? The rules of the Senate say on a nomination as important \nas a judge, which is very key, following the Constitution, which says a \nPresident must take the advice and get the consent of the Senate, there \ncan be extended debate on that judge. To stop that extended debate, it \nrequires not 51 votes; it is 60 votes. That is how we have operated for \na very long time.\n  By the way, it is important to note, it was even harder to get a \nnomination through. For a while, it was 67 votes. Before that, there \nwas endless debate. You could never stop debate, ever. We have eased \nthat rule.\n  We believe it is important for a lifetime appointment to the courts--\nand these are very important positions. They are paid a lot of money. \nThey get a great retirement, not like United Airlines, they will get \ntheir retirement. We believe they ought to be terrific--mainstream, at \nleast. And to stop extended debate, they have to pass a little bit of a \nhigher threshold: 60 votes. Some of these nominees are so outside the \nmainstream they cannot get 60 votes. So the Republicans said: We will \njust change the rules. They looked in their little rule book, and they \nfound it takes 67 votes to change the rules of the Senate, and they \nsaid: My goodness, we do not have that. Maybe we have 51 with the Vice \nPresident voting with us--he votes on a tie vote--but we do not have 67 \nvotes. So let's go about it in a way that no one would ever expect. We \nwill raise what we call a point of order, have a ruling of the Chair, \nand the Chair will rule--and it will be Dick Cheney--that the Senate \ncan no longer filibuster judges. Then we will have a little \ndisagreement over that. They are getting 51 votes, they think. Maybe \nnot. We do not know.\n  That is the nuclear option. A lot of my colleagues on the Republican \nside are nervous about it, and they will wind up, if they get 51 votes, \nchanging the rules of the Senate without the 67 votes.\n  Imagine what would happen at a baseball game if in the middle of the \ngame someone said there is no such thing as a home run, or it is an out \nif the ball bounces first and you throw the person out at first base. \nPeople would go nuts. You do not change the rules in the middle of the \ngame. That is not the American way. And you do not do it in a backdoor \neffort. I have voted to change the rules, but I do not try a sneaky \nway. I said you have to get 67 votes to do it. If you do not get the 67 \nvotes, the rules are the same.\n  I take my time on this because it is important the American people \nunderstand what the Republican leadership is trying to do. They tried \nto change the rules in the House because they did not want to \ninvestigate Tom DeLay, who is the leader over there. They changed the \nrules. It was so shocking, they backtracked after months of the \nAmerican people saying: That is not the American way. The people of the \nUnited States of America are saying it today. They are saying it by 60 \nto 70 percent of the vote: Do not change the way the Senate has done \nits business.\n  Anyone who saw the movie ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' knows that \nJimmy Smith in that film was able to stand on his feet and be heard for \na righteous and just cause. A little bit later, I will show an example \nof a judge we stopped and why it was important to stop her.\n  Let the American people and my colleagues understand. Here is what is \nimportant. This should not be about political parties, folks. When \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt was President--as we all know, a Democrat, \nconsidered one of the greatest Presidents ever--he made a huge mistake \nin his Presidency. He wanted to pack the Supreme Court. He did not like \ntheir decisions.\n  At the time, the Democrat party had 74 seats in the Senate. They \ncould have done it in a heartbeat. All they needed was just a few to \npeel off, they had it. What did they do? Democrats in those days, \ncolleagues, stood up to the most popular President in history. He had \ngotten more than 60 percent of the vote. They said: Mr. President, we \nthink you are great, but we are not going to pack the courts just \nbecause you feel they are not upholding all of your New Deal. It is not \nfair. We need a check and balance.\n  I know young people watching or listening to this debate understand \nwhat we are talking about. The checks and balances built into our \nConstitution--the courts check the legislature and the courts check the \nexecutive branch. What my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \nsave a few, want to do is take away that check and balance, have one \nparty rule. And, oh my goodness, they did not get enough of what they \nwant--208 to 10--and they are throwing a fit and trying to change the \nrules of the Senate. That is wrong and doing it in a way that is \nabsolutely contrary to what we say has to be done to change the rules, \nwhich is 67 votes.\n  Now, the next thing they will say is there have never been any judge \nfilibusters until the Democrats. We have never done that, say the \nRepublicans, we are so good we have never done it.\n  Let me tell the truth, the facts. Who started the filibuster in \nrecent times? The Republicans. In 1968, Abe Fortas, to be Chief Justice \nof the Supreme Court--Democrats' choice--he did not get the required \ntwo-thirds at that time. They need 67 votes of Members supporting Abe \nFortas. Republicans started it.\n  Then we had a filibuster for a while against William Rehnquist, but \nit was dropped; Stephen Breyer to be judge on the First Circuit Court \nof Appeals in 1980; Harvie Wilkinson to be judge on the Fourth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals in 1984; in 1986, Sydney Fitzwater to be a judge; in \n1992, Edward Earl Carnes; in 1994, Lee Sarokin; and in 1999, Brian \nTheodore Stewart. In 2000, two Californians were filibustered by my \nRepublican friends: Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon. When we hear the \nRepublicans say, we have not been, ever, for a filibuster, just say, \nyou are making it up. They are making it up. Here they admit to a \nfilibuster. Here is Bob Smith, Republican Senator, March 7, 2000:\n\n     . . . it is no secret that I have been the person who has \n     filibustered these two nominations, Judge Berzon and Judge \n     Paez.\n\n  So when the Republicans say there has never been a Republican \nfilibuster, they are making it up. Of course there has been.\n  By the way, that was their right.\n  Orrin Hatch:\n\n       Indeed, I must confess to being somewhat baffled that, \n     after a filibuster is cut off by cloture, the Senate could \n     still delay a final vote on the nomination.\n\n\n[[Page S5284]]\n\n\n  Senator Orrin Hatch at that time, I believe, was the chairman of the \ncommittee.\n  Again, Senator Bob Smith:\n\n       So don't tell me we haven't filibustered judges and that we \n     don't have the right to filibuster judges on the floor of the \n     Senate. Of course we do. That is our constitutional role.\n\n  Here we have a Republican Senator leading a filibuster against two of \nPresident Clinton's nominees and saying the filibuster is the \nconstitutional role, and now we have Republicans saying: We have never, \never been involved in a filibuster.\n  I will talk about one of the nominees the Democrats have \nfilibustered. I need to explain to my colleagues, and hopefully to \nothers, how out of the mainstream some of these folks are who George \nBush has nominated. Remember, we stopped 10. This is one of the 10.\n  Janice Rogers Brown--way outside of the mainstream to the extreme. \nThis is one of her comments:\n\n       Where government moves in, community retreats, civil \n     society disintegrates, and our ability to control our own \n     destiny atrophies. The result is: Families under siege; war \n     in the streets; unapologetic expropriation of property; the \n     precipitous decline of the rule of law; the rapid rise of \n     corruption; the loss of civility and the triumph of deceit.\n\n  This is what she thinks of our great Nation because we have a \nGovernment that does build the roads, that does help people out when \nthey are in a bad situation, that may come in and say, yes, it is not a \ngood idea to sell cigarettes to a kid who is 13. This is terrible. This \nis awful.\n  The ``precipitous decline of the rule of law; the rapid rise of \ncorruption.''\n\n       The result is a debased, debauched culture which finds \n     moral depravity . . . A virtue.\n\n  Now, I don't know about you, but I think the minimum wage is a part \nof America. Colleagues could decide they do not want to raise it for a \ncouple of years. Right now, sadly, it hasn't been raised for a very \nlong time, but I think most Americans think we are protected by the \nminimum wage.\n  This is what she said about the minimum wage, Janice Rogers Brown. I \ntake a minute to say Janice Rogers Brown has served in the California \nSupreme Court since 1996. Her life story is amazing. It is remarkable. \nWhat I don't like is what she is doing to other people's lives. Her \nstory is amazing, but for whatever reason, she is hurting the people of \nthis country, particularly, right now, in my State. Of course, the \nPresident wants to move her over to Washington, DC, court.\n\n  She calls Supreme Court decisions upholding protections like the \nminimum wage and the 40-hour workweek ``the triumph of our own \nsocialist revolution.'' I don't know or understand how anybody could \nthink the 40-hour workweek or the minimum wage is socialism. She \nobviously does. She obviously would overturn it.\n  She accuses senior citizens of--and I hope everyone over the age of \n55 will listen to what Janice Rogers Browns thinks of people over 55--\nshe accuses senior citizens of ``blithely cannibalizing their \ngrandchildren because they have a right to get as much free stuff'' as \nthe political system permits them to extract. Free stuff? Is she \ntalking about Social Security? That is not free. People pay into Social \nSecurity, and they deserve to get their monthly check. Free stuff. \nSenior citizens ``blithely cannibalize their grandchildren.'' I resent \nthose comments as a grandmother. I would walk off a bridge for my \ngrandson--and he knows it. I resent her painting of senior citizens.\n  That is why we held her up. That is why she is not sitting on the \ncourt today. Now, she may get there if my colleagues have their way. \nLet them explain why she would rule to overturn the minimum wage and \nthe 40-hour workweek and overturn Social Security. It will be on their \nbacks. We have stopped this woman from going further because of her \ndecisions.\n  She declares:\n\n       Big government is . . . The drug of choice for \n     multinational corporations and single moms, for . . . rugged \n     Midwestern farmers and militants senior citizens.\n\n  She is back to that again. What is she afraid of--that some senior \ncitizen will attack her? The crime rate among senior citizens is pretty \nlow. Militant senior citizens? Give me a break. And we get accused of \nholding up decent people? This goes on.\n  I will go on with the story of Janice Rogers Brown--way outside the \nmainstream to the extreme. She argued a law that provided housing \nassistance to displaced elderly, disabled, and low-income people was \nunconstitutional. Her dissent said, because the city of San Francisco \nhad a law that helped these disabled, elderly people, she said that \n``private property . . . is now entirely extinct in San Francisco.''\n  What world does she live in? Has she tried to buy a house in San \nFrancisco? It is the hottest real estate market in the country. But she \nsays private property is entirely extinct. Let her go try to find some \nprivate property to buy in San Francisco. This woman is living on \nanother planet, and we were right to stop her from getting on the \nbench. Whether it takes 60 votes or 51 votes to stop her, we are going \nto try to stop her.\n  Let's go on with more of her record. How about this? She said that a \nmanager could use racial slurs against his Latino employees. Now, I say \nto every human being out there: What do we know about the workplace? We \nknow people should feel OK about themselves in the workplace, that we \nwork better together when we respect each other. Janice Rogers Brown \nsaid a manager could use racial slurs against his Latino employees--\nextreme in the main.\n  She argued that a message sent by an employee to coworkers \ncriticizing a company's employment practices was not protected by the \nfirst amendment. In other words, you can't use your e-mail to write \nanything about your employer to other employees, although she said the \ncorporations can say whatever they want any time of the day.\n  You know now why we have stopped Janice Rogers Brown. But we have \nmore reasons, if you are not convinced.\n  Even when it comes to protecting shareholders, she is not fair. \nAnyone who owns a share of stock, listen to this one. She argued that a \ncompany could not be held liable for stock fraud by its employees who \nwere offered a stock purchase plan since the stock was traded between \nthird parties on the open market. So she comes out against the \nshareholders and protecting the companies.\n  Here is the amazing thing. Let me reiterate about Janice Rogers \nBrown. She serves on the California Supreme Court. There are six \nRepublicans on the court--she is a Republican--and one Democrat. She \ndissented more than a third of the time. You would think she would have \nbeen happy to be with colleagues of her own party. She stood alone 31 \ntimes. And when you hear these cases, you will be amazed at where she \nstood. In other words, she went against five Republicans and one \nDemocrat 31 times, and stood alone.\n  Let's check those cases out. How about this one: Rape victims; she \nwas the only member of the court to vote to overturn the conviction of \na rapist of a 17-year-old girl because she believed the victim gave \nmixed messages to the rapist. She stood alone on the side of a rapist, \nalone as a woman on a court that has six Republicans and one Democrat. \nHere is another case where she voted alone, the only member of the \ncourt to oppose an effort to stop the sale of cigarettes to children. \nIt was a case where the supermarkets didn't want to be responsible. If \nsomebody came up, maybe 13, maybe 12, maybe 11, maybe 14, I want a pack \nof cigarettes, she ruled against an effort to stop the sale of \ncigarettes to children. What planet is she living on now? If it was in \nthe 1800s and we didn't know about cigarettes and what they do to you \nis one thing. But now is another thing. She stood alone.\n  I talked about senior citizens. I told you she is afraid of militant \nsenior citizens. That is what she calls them. I told you that she said \nthey cannibalize their grandchildren. Well, she was the only member of \nthe court to find that a 60-year-old woman who was fired from her \nhospital job could not sue. This is the amazing thing she said, as she \nstood alone in this decision. A 60-year-old woman was fired from her \nhospital job. She said she has no right to sue based on age \ndiscrimination. This is her comment:\n\n       [D]iscrimination based on age does not mark its victims \n     with a stigma of inferiority and second class citizenship.\n\n  Really? How do you think you would feel if you were fired because you \nwere too old and suddenly that stigma was\n\n[[Page S5285]]\n\nattached to you and you lost your livelihood because maybe you had to \nwork at age 60, as you waited for your Social Security check, which is \na whole other issue. We hope we win that battle, too. But let me tell \nyou, it makes it hard to win the battle of Social Security if you have \non the court someone who calls senior citizens militant. It is going to \nbe tough. That is why we have held her up.\n  By the way, her position in this case is contrary to both State and \nFederal law. This is one of the people we have stopped.\n  Just think about what we have been trying to protect the American \npeople from. How about this? This is a woman who not only voted with a \nrapist against a 17-year-old girl, she was the only member of the court \nwho voted to strike down a State antidiscrimination law that provided a \ncontraceptive drug benefit to women. She was the only one. The State of \nCalifornia had required an equal health benefit to women and said: Your \ninsurance will cover contraception because--guess what they decided. \nThey decided it was better to avoid abortion, to cut down abortion, to \nmake abortion rare. So they said they would give a benefit of \ncontraception. She stood alone and tried to strike that down. Imagine.\n  She has been bad for workers. She was the only member of the court \nwho voted to bar an employee from suing for sexual harassment because \nshe signed a standard worker's compensation release form. Now, all of \nyou probably know what that means. If you go for a job, you are usually \ncovered by workman's compensation. But this woman had signed a waiver \nand said: I won't file a worker's comp claim. She didn't file a \nworker's comp claim, but she did file a sexual harassment claim because \nshe was being sexually harassed. Every member of the court stood with \nthe woman who was sexually harassed but Janice Rogers Brown. Six \nRepublicans, one Democrat, and she stood alone again against a worker \nwho was facing sexual harassment. The whole rest of the court agreed \nwith the worker.\n  She was the only member of the court to find that a disabled worker \nwho was the victim of employment discrimination did not have the right \nto raise past instances of discrimination that occurred. In other \nwords, there was a disabled worker who filed a lawsuit, had a big story \nto tell about the past. She was the only judge to say: I don't agree \nwith the worker; I agree with the company.\n  Here is another one. Janice Rogers Brown, bad on discrimination, the \nonly member of the court to find that a State fair housing commission \ncould not award certain damages to housing discrimination victims. She \nstood alone again.\n  Domestic violence: The Republicans want to put on the court a woman \nwho stood alone 31 times against her fellow Republicans in cases like \nthis--the only member of the court to find that a jury should not hear \nexpert testimony in a domestic violence case about battered women's \nsyndrome. We all know about battered women's syndrome, where a woman is \nbeaten senseless by a boyfriend--in this case, probably a spouse--and \nlater minimizes what he did to her. And the law in our State says it is \nvalid evidence. If she reached out and she did something to prosecute \nthis attacker, an explanation about battered women's syndrome will help \nher.\n  She was the only one who stood alone and said: I don't want to hear \nany expert testimony on this. She stood alone.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Here is one. I want us all to remember the Enron case, a \ncase where counties and cities and individuals were ripped off and went \ninto debt--in our State, billions of dollars--by Enron, Enron who said \nthey would deliver electricity and then made believe there was a \nshortage and jacked up the price billions of dollars. People went \nbankrupt and counties went bankrupt and the State went in the hole $9 \nbillion. She was the only member of the court to find that a county \ncould not sue a utility company for illegal price fixing that had \nsubstantially increased the county's costs for natural gas.\n  So here she is again hurting consumers, hurting local government, and \nstanding alone in the process.\n  Here she is on a right to a fair trial. This is interesting. The \ncourts have ruled over and over that when a criminal defendant comes \ninto court before there is a verdict of guilt, you can't bring that \ncriminal defendant in in shackles and in a prison uniform because you \nput in the jury's mind that the person is guilty. So you give the \nchance to the person to come in dressed as a civilian, then you find \nout the details and you find them guilty or innocent.\n  In this case, she was the only member of the court to find nothing \nimproper about requiring a criminal defendant to wear a 50,000-volt \nstun belt while testifying, the only member of the court. That is how \noutside the mainstream she is.\n  If we could put back up the 208-to-10 number while I give the rest of \nmy remarks, that would be fine.\n  What do we have here? We have a circumstance that 10 times out of \n218, Democrats believed the President's choices were really harmful to \nthe American people, would really be harmful to them, whether it is \ntheir minimum wage, whether it is their 40-hour workweek, whether it is \nthe ability of all of us to protect our kids from cigarettes, whether \nit is to protect victims of violence, it goes on and on. You have seen \njust a handful of the cases.\n  So when somebody says to you: Well, those Democrats, they are \nblocking everybody--and if you listen to my Republican colleagues, that \nis what you would think--no, we have blocked 10. We have approved 208. \nIn reality, now the number is 5, but circumstances have changed. I will \nlean over backwards to be fair and say it is 10. That is 95 percent. In \neach case of these 10 you will find out why we have done it. It is \nbecause these nominees are so outside the mainstream that they will \nhurt the people we represent.\n  Why is it important to say that a judge needs to have a 60-vote \nthreshold to end extended debate? It is because it is a lifetime \nappointment. The President is supposed to work with the Senate before \nchoosing a nominee, which he has not done, not on our side of the \naisle. I tried hard with Mr. Gonzales when he was White House counsel. \nI met with him on numerous occasions, and he said: Senator Boxer, give \nme some names of Republicans. I gave him so many names of good \nRepublicans for the Ninth Circuit.\n  I said: Look, these people are mainstream Republicans. They will fly \nright through here.\n  No, they couldn't be bothered with that. I know Senator Feinstein has \ndone the same, given them the names of people who would be quite \nacceptable. Who do they send us? People such as Janice Rogers \nBrown, people who are so outside the mainstream that we don't deserve \nto be here if we don't raise the arguments.\n\n  Now, what you are also going to hear is the Republicans have called \nthis the nuclear option. They have renamed it the constitutional \noption. That is humorous--if you want to find humor in any of this. \nThat is like saying that clock over there is a table. I suppose if I \ntold you that often enough, maybe you would believe me that once upon a \ntime that clock was a table. But the clock is a clock and the nuclear \noption is the nuclear option. It was named by the Republicans. But it \nis not popular out there because of the connotation, so they are trying \nto change it.\n  The ``constitutional option'' is the reverse of the truth. In the \nConstitution, it says nothing about guaranteeing a vote. It says the \nSenate shall write its own rules. Well, the Senate wrote its own rules \nand the Senate said it takes 67 votes to change our rules. Our \ncolleagues don't have 67 votes to change the rules, so they are trying \nto do this sneaky parliamentary move to change the rules. What a way to \ngovern because you didn't get 100 percent of what you want; you got 95 \npercent. I don't feel sorry for any President who gets 95 percent of \nwhat he wants.\n  I am telling you, Democratic or Republican Presidents have to work \nwith the Senate and the House and they have to compromise. So it is \nvery important to note that when you hear the Republicans saying all we \nwant is the constitutional option, you say, where in the Constitution \ndoes it give you this right? Nowhere.\n\n[[Page S5286]]\n\n  Then they will say this: Everybody deserves an up-or-down vote. \nEverybody. I don't know how many times we have given Janice Rogers \nBrown a vote. We gave Janice Rogers Brown a vote here once, and \nPriscilla Owen got a vote four times. Yes, the vote required 60 as the \nthreshold to end extended debate, but they got their vote. Now, when \nyou go back to Bill Clinton, 61 times his nominees got stuck in \ncommittee; 61 of Bill Clinton's nominees never got to have a cloture \nvote. They never got a vote. They were pocket-filibustered in \ncommittee. We have never done that. Every single Bush nominee who has \ncome to the floor has had their vote. I know of none who have not had a \nvote. They just didn't meet the 60-vote threshold.\n  That is the second thing you are going to hear: All we are asking for \nis an up-or-down vote. They had that, but they had to meet the 60-vote \nthreshold to end extended debate. Why? Because they are lifetime \nappointments, we are checking and balancing the power of the executive \nby saying don't send us people such as Janice Rogers Brown, who is so \nout of the mainstream. She sees a military uniform on every senior \ncitizen and says senior citizens want to cannibalize their \ngrandchildren. Excuse me? She says there is no private property left in \nthis country. That is outside the mainstream to the extreme.\n  If we Democrats have the courage of our convictions to say no 10 \ntimes, give us a little respect; don't try to change the rules in the \nmiddle of the night. Do what the Democrats did in the 1930s. Think how \ngood you would feel if you stood up to the President of your own party \nand said: Mr. President, we will follow you anywhere; we think you are \nterrific, and we support you in Iraq and on privatizing Social \nSecurity, and we support you in your huge deficits; we support you in \nthese trade agreements, we support you this way and that way; but we \ndon't think packing the courts is a good idea. Therefore, we are going \nto join with the Democrats and say no to this plan. It is very \ndangerous.\n  I want people to understand. The point of my discussion here today is \nto put a human face on these judges. This isn't about just numbers, \nalthough the numbers tell a heck of a story. The Republicans get 208 \nand not 10 and they are crying and doing this in a sneaky way, without \ngetting 67 votes to do it. That alone is wrong. It is not playing fair, \nit is not the American way, it is not playing by the rules. The \nAmerican people want to know it. If you want to fight with us, we will \nhave a debate, but stick with the rules. Get your 67 votes so you can \nhave the arrogance of power. Get your 67 votes so you can tread all \nover us. But don't do it in this sneak attack, challenging the \nParliamentarian, and then having the Senator in the chair say, you know \nwhat, it is over; no more filibusters on judges.\n  If you do that, you are hurting the American people. Some people say \nit is about the traditions of our country, the right to unlimited \nfaith, freedom of speech, ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' I will \nstand on my feet, that is my God-given right for my State to do that, \nand that is all true. But for me personally, as a Senator from the \nlargest State in the Union, with 36 million people, I want to protect \nthem. I want to protect the 17-year-old who got raped and not have her \ncome before Janice Rogers Brown and have her stand alone and rule \nagainst her. I want to protect the worker who wrote a little e-mail to \nanother worker and said I don't think the boss is being so fair, what \ndo you think? They said we had 2 weeks vacation and now they are \ncounting that day off as one of those days and it is not right, and \nhave to be before Janice Rogers Brown who says the corporation can \nwrite anything they want, but you are too lowly. I don't want to have \nthe American people subjected to a judge such as Janice Rogers Brown, \nwho said any city that helps a disabled elderly person get housing is \nwrong and is destroying private property. I don't want to have my kids \nin a circumstance where they have to see their grandmother called a \n``cannibal.'' I don't want to have a judge who overturns Social \nSecurity, who overturns the minimum wage, who overturns the 40-hour \nworkweek.\n  The point is, I want to protect the people I represent. So if I don't \nstand up strongly against a judge such as her, I don't deserve to be \nhere. The people of my State would be upset with me.\n\n  The right I have in this magnificent Senate today is the right of the \nminority. We have 45 Democrats here and 55 Republicans. I am counting \nJim Jeffords as a Democrat for the purpose of discussion because he \nvotes with us. So it is 55-45. Jim Jeffords is an Independent, but he \nvotes with us. By the way, in the recent polls, the Independent voters \nare for the filibuster; 54 percent are for the filibuster. I want to \nprotect the people I represent, because Janice Rogers Brown has been \nnominated for the DC Circuit Court, meaning one step below the U.S. \nSupreme Court. So she is going from the California Supreme Court, where \nshe has dissented in a third of the cases, in a court that has--and you \nmay be interested in this--six Republicans and one Democrat. Janice \nRogers Brown has dissented 31 times. This is how out of the mainstream \nshe is. I think it is important to note.\n  In the DC Circuit, there is a whole other area of the law that was \nprotested--your right to breathe clean air, your right to drink clean \nwater. This is important for us because environmental laws protect our \nhealth, and if we have someone in the court there who doesn't think \nGovernment has any right--and she obviously doesn't--to do anything \nbecause--what is it she said about Government? If you could put that \nchart up again. Whenever Government gets involved, this is what she \npredicts happens. We will show you the quote. Obviously, she doesn't \nthink there is anyplace for Government because she says: ``Where \ngovernment moves in''--I would say in a circumstance such as the Clean \nAir Act, where we tell folks you have to make sure the air is kept \nclean--``community retreats, civil society disintegrates, and our \nability to control our own destiny atrophies . . . families are under \nsiege.''\n  I don't know what country she is living in. She says: `` . . . \nunapologetic expropriation of property; the precipitous decline of the \nrule of law; the rapid rise of corruption, the loss of civility and the \ntriumph of deceit.''\n  What an optimist. Why are we promoting someone who has this negative \nview of America? Doesn't she know this is a government of, by, and for \nthe people? That is what we are about. Do we make mistakes sometimes? \nYes. Do we have to make sure we fix our laws so they work better? Yes. \nBut to say whenever Government moves in, community retreats, I wonder \nwhat she thought of the highway bill we just passed. She probably \nthinks it is awful because we take the gas taxes and we build highways, \nand we build transit systems because we think it is important for \neconomic growth. But she says when Government moves in, community \nretreats, civil society disintegrates, and the result is families are \nunder siege and there is war in the streets.\n  So, yes, I am here to say I did stand up against Janice Rogers Brown, \nand whether she has to meet a 60-vote threshold, which she has been \nunable to get, or a 51-vote threshold, I will be fighting against this \nnominee because she is way out of the mainstream. She walked away from \njudges in her own political party and stood alone 31 times. That is why \nwe have said to the President: Why don't you talk to us about these \nnominees? We could have told you this one would have trouble. We would \nhave given you the names of some fine conservative Republicans. But not \nsomeone who has this wonderful life story, but has a view of America \nthat is amazing.\n  Here is what she once said in a speech:\n\n       Most of us no longer find slavery abhorrent. We embrace it. \n     We demand more. Big Government is not just the opiate of the \n     masses; it is the opiate.\n\n  Her point is we are slaves to our Government. Well, again, I don't \nknow what country she is living in. We are not slaves to our \nGovernment. We run the Government. We get to vote the people we want in \nand we get to vote them out. If we don't like what they do, we will let \nthem know. She is out of step, calling senior citizens militant, saying \nthey are taking all of the goodies and free stuff. She doesn't like the \nminimum wage, doesn't like the 40-hour workweek, doesn't like senior \ncitizens. She never protected women. She doesn't protect our children. \nShe doesn't protect our consumers. She\n\n[[Page S5287]]\n\ndoesn't protect our workers. Why do we want someone such as that to get \na promotion?\n  Therefore, the Democrats have said to the President, through our \nvoice in the Senate: Send us someone else and we will be delighted to \nwork with you. We have worked with you 208 times, Mr. President, and 10 \ntimes we said no.\n  We said you are out of the mainstream, and the response of a 95-\npercent success record by the Republicans--and a few are not going \nalong with it, and bless them for that--is: We will take away your \nright, Democrats, to stand up for the things you think are important. \nWe will take away your rights by changing the rules in the middle of \nthe game, by skirting a 67-vote requirement for changing the rules. We \nwill do it.\n  There is politics being played. The majority leader talked about this \nin a speech in a political way, which was wrong. He has not agreed to a \ncompromise. Senator Reid has offered several. The fact is, people have \nto know what is at stake.\n  I hope everyone within the sound of my voice will know the reason why \nDemocrats have stood so firmly against the nomination of Janice Rogers \nBrown. It is because we care about the people we represent, and we care \nabout mainstream judges, and we do not want to see such a radical \nindividual get this position and begin to whittle away at the rights \nour people have won, at the fairness our people have won.\n  This is very important. This vote is going to change the Senate \nforever. But more than that, it will impact the lives of the people. \nChanging the Senate, changing tradition, changing the role of the \nminority to make a difference, to be heard, freedom of speech--these \nare all important. But at the end of the day, it is about our kids, our \ngrandkids, our seniors, our families, our workers, the air we breathe \nand the water we drink, and this is all connected to the judges. This \nis not disconnected. This is the brilliance of our Founders who said \nthe judicial branch, the judges, shall make sure that everything we do \nin the legislative branch and in the executive branch is \nconstitutional, is right, is reasoned.\n  If we have people on the bench who believe that anything we do \ndisintegrates our family; that anything we do, such as the highway \nbill, for example, turns into an expropriation of property and the \nrapid rise of corruption and the loss of civility and the triumph of \ndeceit--this belongs somewhere else, not in the courts.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your patience. I thank my staff who \nhas done an extraordinary job for me in analyzing these decisions. This \nis not easy to do because you have to go line by line. I know the \nPresiding Officer knows these cases can be very long and confusing. My \nstaff are attorneys. They are also very smart attorneys, and they were \nable to get to the point of these cases and bring home this message to \npeople that when we fight against 10 judges out of 218, it is for a \nreason. It is not because we want to be difficult. It is because we \nbelieve when the Constitution says the Senate has the right to advise \nand consent on judges, it does not mean when the President feels like \nit. It does not mean between the hours of 11 and 1 on Wednesday. It \nmeans every time he sends a nomination to us, he should have, in fact, \nsought the advice and consent of the Senate.\n  We have a big debate coming up tomorrow. I just wanted to give a \nlittle reality check so people understand for what we have been \nfighting.\n  I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask consent I be recognized as in morning business and \nbe allowed to speak as long as necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/17/senate-section/article/S5287-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5287-S5292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL FILIBUSTERS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 51 years ago today the Supreme Court, just \nacross the street from the Senate Chamber, issued one of its most \nfamous rulings in the history of the United States of America. The \nruling was Brown v. Board of Education. It may have been one of the \nmost courageous decisions ever issued by the Court. It rejected the \ncruel legal fiction of separate but equal and said that in the United \nStates of America there would be no second-class citizens.\n  What an amazing victory for justice. But for some time, in some \nStates, the Brown decision remained a victory on paper only. In much of \nthe United States, in the Deep South, the Brown decision was met with \nmassive resistance. Governors refused to obey the court ruling. Three \nyears after that court decision, 48 years ago today, on May 17, 1957, \n36,000 people gathered in Washington, DC, for the first march on \nWashington.\n  This is a photo of that march. We all know about the famous 1963 \nmarch, but the 1957 gathering was really the forerunner to that 1963 \nmarch. In those days, in 1957, it was known as a Prayer Pilgrimage for \nFreedom in Washington, DC.\n  Take a look at some of the people who gathered on that day 48 years \nago. Dr. Martin Luther King, 29 years of age, was among those who \ngathered to speak. His leadership had been tested by the crucible of \nthe Montgomery bus boycott. His remarks at the 1957 gathering were not \nnearly as well known as his immortal ``I Have a Dream'' speech in 1963, \nbut they are powerful and worth repeating on this the 40th anniversary \nof the day he first delivered them. Here is how Dr. Martin Luther King \nopened his remarks on that day. He said:\n\n       Three years ago the Supreme Court of this nation rendered \n     in simple, eloquent, and unequivocal language a decision \n     which will long be stenciled on the mental sheets of \n     succeeding generations. For all men of goodwill, this May \n     17th decision came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night \n     of human captivity. It came as a great beacon light of hope \n     to millions of disinherited people throughout the world who \n     had dared only to dream of freedom.\n\n  Dr. King went on to say:\n\n       Unfortunately, this noble and sublime decision has not gone \n     without opposition. This opposition has often risen to \n     ominous proportions. Many states have risen up in open \n     defiance. The legislative halls of the South ring loud with \n     such words as `interposition' and `nullification.'\n       But even more, all types of conniving methods are still \n     being used to prevent Negroes from becoming registered \n     voters. The denial of this sacred right--\n\n  Dr. King said--\n\n       is a tragic betrayal of the highest mandates of our \n     Democratic tradition.\n\n  But Dr. King did not stop with this sad commentary on what he saw in \nAmerica. He delivered his prescription for progress when he said:\n\n       And so our most urgent request to the president of the \n     United States and every member of Congress is . . . Give us \n     the ballot, and we will no longer have to worry the federal \n     government about our basic rights.\n       Give us the ballot and we will no longer plead to the \n     federal government for passage of an anti-lynching law; we \n     will by the power of our vote write the law on the statute \n     books of the Southland bring an end to the dastardly acts of \n     the hooded perpetrators of violence.\n       Give us the ballot, and we will transform the salient \n     misdeeds of bloodthirsty mobs into the calculated good deeds \n     of orderly citizens.\n\n  What a speech. Not nearly as heralded as his speech a few years \nlater, but certainly what Dr. King said that day still touches the \nhearts of every American who dreams of the ideals of this great Nation.\n  Now, 51 years later, it is hard to imagine the way Brown v. Board of \nEducation was received. Most Americans look back with pride to the end \nof segregation in our public schools. We regard it as a great \nachievement that 182 years after our Nation was founded, a new \ngeneration of Americans had the courage and conscience to confront the \nbitter legacy of slavery, the challenge that our Founding Fathers could \nnot resolve with all their wisdom. These people had the courage to \nconfront segregation and voting discrimination.\n  Many Americans didn't support Brown v. Board of Education, not in \n1954, not in 1967. That is why 36,000 people gathered on the Mall 38 \nyears ago today. Many southern States flatly refused to obey the Brown \ndecision. The same ruling that Martin Luther King praised as a joyous \ndaybreak, others denounced as judicial activism. Judicial activism--\nthat is what they said\n\n[[Page S5288]]\n\nabout a decision to integrate America's schools. The courts had gone \ntoo far. Many argued: Leave it to the States to decide; this is not a \ndecision to be made at the Federal level; certainly it is not a \ndecision to be made in that Court across the street; those judges went \ntoo far, they argued in Brown v. Board of Education.\n\n  Does this sound familiar? That is exactly what we are hearing today. \nThe words in opposition to Brown v. Board of Education echo through \nthis Senate Chamber and the Halls of Congress even today.\n  Sadly, we may be on the verge of a constitutional confrontation over \nthe Senate's constitutional advise and consent responsibilities \nregarding Federal judges. To listen to many on the far right, you would \nthink it was events only in the last few years that have pushed us to \nthe brink, but that is not the case.\n  Earl Warren of California was Chief Justice of the Supreme Court \nduring the momentous Brown decision. The John Birch Society began \nputting up ``Impeach Earl Warren'' billboards in 1961. Later they tried \nto impeach William O. Douglas, one of the most outspoken and eloquent \nJustices on the Court. The far right tried to impeach Frank Johnson. \nWho is Frank Johnson? An interesting story.\n  Just a few years ago I joined John Lewis--he is a Congressman from \nAtlanta, GA, and what he does each year is invite Members of Congress, \nDemocrats and Republicans, to come back down south and visit Montgomery \nand Birmingham and Selma. John Lewis is the perfect guide for these \nvisits because John Lewis was there on that bridge in Selma, marching \ntoward the capitol so that African-American people would have the right \nto vote. Because this young man had this idealism to participate in \nthat march and the freedom rides, he had his skull cracked at the Selma \nbridge. It almost killed him.\n  I asked John Lewis, tell me about the Federal judge, Frank Johnson, \nthat judge in Alabama.\n  He said: We wouldn't have had a civil rights movement, we certainly \nwould not have had that parade, demonstration in Selma, without the \ncourage of that man, Frank Johnson. Frank Johnson, a Republican \nappointee to the Federal bench, stood up and said: Yes, these Americans \nhave the right to march and speak.\n  It was really unpopular. A lot of people hated Judge Johnson because \nof it. He was persona non grata in his whole community. His family was \nharassed. He did courageous things that permitted the Montgomery bus \nboycott and the freedom marches across Edmund Pettis Bridge. For that, \nthe far right, who accused him of judicial activism, wanted him \nimpeached. They didn't agree with his decision. They said he went too \nfar.\n  Since 1961, 8 of the 12 Federal impeachments or near impeachments in \nWashington have involved our judges. The far right has been demanding \nthat the Senate rein in what they call ``activist judges'' for decades. \nWhat is different now is what used to be extreme, discordant voices \njust heard in muted tones, now own great microphones in this democracy. \nThey have called on their followers in Congress to follow their agenda.\n  Sadly, they have many allies in high places--allies in the Senate who \nare willing to break the rules of the Senate to change the rules of the \nSenate so that the far right can pack the Federal courts with judges \nmore of their liking, judges who are not activist by their definition.\n  Today their allies in the Senate are willing to use the nuclear \noption to destroy the filibuster and to really destroy our system of \nchecks and balances.\n  The obvious question is, in a body of 100 men and women where \ncounting votes is the most important thing: Do they have enough allies? \nFor the sake of our democracy, I pray they do not. We hope there will \nstill be a majority of Senators who love this country, love this \nConstitution, and love this Senate enough to preserve the Federal \ncourts as a fair and independent branch of Government. This should not \nbe an exercise of power by the extreme part of any political party.\n  One of the men I respected most in the world, probably the man who is \nresponsible for my standing here today more than any others, was a man \nnamed Paul Douglas, who was a Senator from Illinois from 1948 to 1966. \nI will never forget that day in February of 1966 when he agreed to hire \nme as a college student to work in his office across the street in what \nis now the Russell Senate Building. It was one of the most exciting \nthings I had ever done, a student from Georgetown University from East \nSt. Louis, IL, was going to work in the office of a Senator.\n  I would have done anything they asked me to do, and they asked me to \ndo a lot of things. But the most exciting thing I did was each night \nSenator Douglas, who had been gravely wounded in World War II as a \nmarine in the South Pacific, insisted on signing all letters. With one \narm, he needed help, and that's where I came in. I would sit next to \nhim on a chair next to the conference table with a big stack of letters \nSenator Douglas was sending back to Illinois, and as he signed them, I \nwould pull each letter away. That was my job as an intern.\n  It was an exciting job. It sounds boring, I'm sure. But this man who \nhad done so much with his life would sit there as he signed the letters \nand answer my questions, and I had plenty of them, and talk about his \nlife and the things that he had done.\n  He talked about the 1948 Democratic Convention, when civil rights \nreally became the focal point of a national debate, when he grabbed the \nstandard of the Illinois delegation at that convention and paraded \naround the hall leading a demonstration in favor of a mayor from \nMinneapolis named Hubert Humphrey, who said that we had to come out of \nthe shadow of States rights into the bright sunshine of human rights.\n  Paul Douglas was as committed to civil rights as any man I ever knew. \nHe helped lead the fight in the Senate in the 1950s and much of the \n1960s to pass much of that historic legislation. He ran smack dab into \nthe filibuster, the filibuster that was used by some Senators, \nprimarily from the South, to stop the civil rights legislation. It was \nalmost unbreakable. It took 67 votes in that day to stop it. You \nremember the filibuster? That is the procedure in the Senate where any \nSenator can stand at the desk here and speak as long as their voice and \nbladder will allow, stand up there and argue for all the principles and \nvalues they believe in. You saw it, Jimmy Stewart, ``Mr. Smith Goes to \nWashington.'' It is still in the Senate books. It is still the rule. It \nhas been here for over 200 years.\n  Some people say that is crazy. In this age of technology, why would \nwe want this body to be dragged down by one Senator who wants to talk?\n  But that is what the Senate is all about. That is why we are \ndifferent than the House of Representatives. I served over there with \npride for 14 years. I love the House of Representatives. But they are a \ndifferent institution, under our Constitution. If you have a large \nState with many people, you will have more Congressmen. We have quite a \nfew people in Illinois, 12.5 million; 19 Congressmen. Think of all the \nCongressmen from California. But then come across the Rotunda, how many \nSenators from California? Two. How many from South Dakota? Two. How \nmany from Illinois? Two. How many from Rhode Island? Two. Because the \nFounders of our Nation said we will have one branch of the legislature \nwhich represents the population of America, but the Senate is \ndifferent.\n  The Senate will give every State a chance. The Senate will allow the \nsmallest States the same number of votes as the largest States, and \nwithin the Senate we will recognize and respect the right of any \nSenator from any State, large or small, to engage in debate. We will \nprotect that Senator's right, even if many people think that is not a \nwise position the Senator is taking, because we want to protect the \nrights of the minority. That is why the Senate is different.\n  So Paul Douglas, when he argued the civil rights bill, ran smack dab \ninto the filibuster. One would think, as much as he hated segregation \nand as much as he hated Jim Crow laws, that Senator Douglas and many \nother progressives, Democrats and Republicans, would have tried to \neliminate the filibuster which held up the civil rights bill. But they \ndid not. Why? Because that procedure is critical to what this \ninstitution\n\n[[Page S5289]]\n\nis all about. Doing away with the filibuster does away with the \nprotection of minority rights. It changes the dynamic.\n  What happens when we have a filibuster? In order to stop the \nfilibuster, an extraordinary majority of the Senate must come forward. \nNow it is 60 votes. So if a Senator stands and says, this is unfair and \nunjust and I am going to speak at length to tell you why, what does it \nmean? Not only that he is a person of conviction, but it means to \nresolve that difference, to try to move on from the filibuster, people \nof good will have to meet and talk and come to an agreement. The \nfilibuster forces compromise, the filibuster forces bipartisanship, \nwhich the Senate is all about.\n  That is what has happened over the years. Those who were engaged in \nthe civil rights debates played by the rules and sometimes lost by \nthose same rules, but they won in time. Four months after the prayer \npilgrimage that I mentioned in 1957, 4 months after 36,000 people \ngathered at the Lincoln Memorial to protest what they considered the \nslow progress in America to deal with segregation, 4 years after that \nday, Congress passed the 1957 Civil Rights Act, the first Federal Civil \nRights Act since the days after the Civil War. After that came a 1960 \nvoting rights bill, the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting \nRights Act of 1965.\n  Those advances were not won by impatient Senators breaking the rules. \nThey were won by courageous Americans who persevered, who marched on \nWashington, who marched on Selma, AL, who dared to register and vote \nwhen that basic act of citizenry could cost you your life.\n  Near the end of his speech 48 years ago today, Martin Luther King \ntold the thousands of people gathered at the prayer pilgrimage at the \nLincoln Memorial:\n\n       We must work passionately and unrelentingly for the goal of \n     freedom but we must be sure that our hands are clean in the \n     struggle.\n\n  What Dr. Martin Luther King was saying in the dark hours of Brown v. \nBoard of Education, when it appeared there was little chance that the \nCongress would respond, ``your hands must be clean in the struggle.''\n  That, my friends, is the debate we will face when it comes to \nchanging the Senate rules. It isn't just a matter of achieving our \ngoals; it is how we achieve our goals. The ends do not justify the \nmeans. Think of it: Dr. King, at the age of 29, having lived through \nthe rank discrimination that was prevalent in many parts of America, \nstill reminded those who were listening, play by the rules, keep your \nhands clean in the struggle. What he was telling us was that no matter \nhow passionately we believe something, we are not entitled to rig the \nrules to achieve the outcome we want. That is not how it works in \nsociety. It is not how it works in families. It certainly is not how it \nworks when you follow the rule of law.\n  There always will be some who reject court decisions they do not \nagree with as ``judicial activism.'' There will always be some who want \nto restrict the independence of judges and put their own stamp on the \njudiciary. There will always be impatient people who want to rig and \nchange the rules or short circuit the rules of democracy. As Senators, \nwe have taken an oath to defend our Constitution. It is our sacred \nresponsibility to tell them no.\n  This is not the first time in our Nation's history that a President \nof the United States wants more power. It is a natural thing in \ngovernment, and the Founding Fathers who wrote this Constitution \nunderstood it. They knew that if there was no check on the judiciary, \njudges would be too powerful. They knew if there was no check on the \nCongress, the Congress would take too much power. And they certainly \nknew that an Executive like a President would always want to increase \nhis power over the people. That is what led them so many times to \ncreate the checks and balances which have resulted in what we enjoy--\nthe longest lived democracy in the history of the world.\n  President Thomas Jefferson, 16 years after the Constitution was \nwritten creating an independent judiciary, Thomas Jefferson, the man \nwho wrote the Bill of Rights, was reelected as President of the United \nStates in 1805, said to the Senate, which met on the first floor of \nthis building not far from where we gather, said to the Senate: You are \na majority of my party. You know that Supreme Court--which is in the \nsame building--is a court which has ruled against us and sees the world \nquite differently. Thomas Jefferson said to the Senate: Join me in \nimpeaching Samuel Chase. Take this Justice off the Supreme Court and \nlet all of these judges know if they do not see the world in the terms \nthat we believe it should be in, they will be removed from office.\n\n  Understandably, Jefferson was frustrated by the judges who were not \nlistening to him and following his beliefs. So he came to his party in \nthe Senate and said: Join me. And they said: No, Mr. Jefferson. We are \nloyal to you and your party, but we are more loyal to the Constitution, \nand the Constitution insists the judiciary must be fair and independent \nand balanced. And they said no.\n  In more recent times, many can recall that Franklin Delano Roosevelt, \none of our greatest Presidents, reelected to a second term, frustrated \nby the Supreme Court across the street which had killed his New Deal \nlegislation, said: It is time to do something about the old men on the \nCourt. He came to this Chamber, this Senate, and said to the Democrats \nof his own party: Help me change the judiciary. We need to put more \nJustices on the Supreme Court to overcome those old men. The Democrats \nand Republicans in the Senate said: No, Mr. President. We respect you. \nWe support your goals and your programs. But the Constitution is more \nimportant than increasing your power as a President over the judiciary.\n  And here we are today in the year 2005, coincidentally at the \nbeginning of President George W. Bush's second term. And what do we \nhear from this President? He comes to this Chamber, to the Senate, and \nsays to Democrats and Republicans alike: I want more power over the \njudiciary. I want to do something about those activist judges. And I \nresent the fact the Senate has not approved every judicial nominee \nwhich I have sent for approval.\n  Which takes me to my last chart. For those following debate, for \nthose who want to know what the score is, it is 208 to 5 or maybe 208 \nto 10, depending on your count. But more than 95 percent of the \nnominees sent by President Bush to the Senate Chamber for approval have \nbeen approved. Mr. President, 208 to 5, and we are facing a \nconstitutional crisis and confrontation because this President cannot \nget 5 judicial candidates he insists on?\n  One wonders if this President, coming to this Senate, would hear the \nechos of what Thomas Jefferson heard or Franklin Roosevelt heard where \nhis own political party would stand up and say: Mr. President, we \nrespect you, but we respect the Constitution more. We respect the \nSenate more. Sadly, few of those voices have been raised.\n  Within a matter of hours or days, we will face this historic \nconstitutional crisis. I believe it comes down to some very fundamental \nprinciples. Neither this President nor any President should be allowed \nto change the rules in the middle of the game, to take away the right \nof extended debate on judicial nominees. Neither this President nor any \nPresident should be allowed to change the checks and balances which \nhave given us our lifeblood as a nation for over 200 years. Neither \nthis President nor any President should make a lifetime appointment of \nsomeone to a Federal court who is not prepared to take on that awesome \ntask and to dispatch it with the kind of integrity and skill and \ncommitment to the values of America we must insist on.\n  So in a short period of time, there will be a test in this Senate the \nlikes of which it has never seen. We almost have to go back to the \nCivil War to recall a debate of this proportion. I sincerely hope my \ncolleagues will rise to this challenge. I sincerely hope they will \nunderstand there is more at stake than whether a President has a good \npress release one day, whether some supporters cheer them on for \nstanding up for 5 or 10 nominees, who understand that what we are \ndebating is, sadly, going to be viewed for generations as a test of \nwhether we are truly committed to preserving and defending the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  I still have great hope. I still have great hope that enough \nRepublican\n\n[[Page S5290]]\n\nSenators will stand up to this President as Thomas Jefferson's party \nstood up to him, as Franklin Roosevelt's party stood up to him and \nsaid: Mr. President, we respect you, we believe in your program, we \nwill support you, but first we have to be guided by our Constitution, \nand we cannot increase your power in this Government at the expense of \nthe balance that was created by the wisdom of our Founding Fathers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak such \ntime as I may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I further ask that following my remarks, \nthe Senator from Louisiana be recognized for her remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is not uncommon for Senators to stand \nin the Senate and tell their colleagues and the American people that an \nupcoming vote is one of the most important the Senate will ever take. \nWe are the masters of hyperbole in this body, forever standing on the \nprecipices and poised on the brink of momentous decisions.\n  But today, I think most will agree with me: We truly are at such a \nmoment. The Senate is on the verge of making a decision with \npotentially enormous consequences for this institution and for the \ncountry and the people we serve. At stake is not just the fate of a \nhandful of judicial nominations or of a future Supreme Court \nnomination, as important as they may be. No, the decisions made this \nweek will resonate far beyond this Chamber and far beyond the current \ncontroversy.\n  I will speak today about how we arrived at this moment of great peril \nand how we might step back from the brink. I will speak about the \nconsequences of the question that will apparently be put before the \nSenate prior to our next recess. I will speak today about principle and \nabout power.\n  While they do not always attract a lot of public attention, \ntraditional nominations are very important. We all know that. The \njudicial branch is a coequal branch of Government. The interpretation \nand enforcement of the laws we pass in Congress depend greatly on the \nmen and women who serve as judges, and, of course, Federal judges serve \nlifetime appointments. Decisions made by the President and the Senate \non judicial nominations have a long-term and long-lasting impact on the \nNation.\n  Disputes over how the Senate should exercise its constitutional power \nof advice and consent on such nominations are as old as the Republic \nitself. Nominations have led to some of the most historic and divisive \ndebates in this body, dating back to efforts to pack the courts with \nFederalist judges in the waning days of John Adams' Presidency. More \nrecently, we had debates about Franklin Delano Roosevelt's court-\npacking plan in the late 1930s, the Abe Fortas nomination in the late \n1960s, and Robert Bork in the late 1980s, to give a few examples.\n  Debate, even bitter partisan debate, over judicial nominations is \nnothing new. What is new is that the Senate is now poised to break with \nits rules and traditions. For the first time, the desire of one side to \nwin nomination battles has become so intense and so unyielding that it \nthreatens the very rules by which this Senate has operated for \ncenturies.\n  In all of the previous controversies I have mentioned, which I think \nmost serious students of Congress and the courts would agree were more \nsignificant than the current debate over a handful of circuit court \njudges, the rules of the Senate have allowed the battles to be fought \nfairly.\n  Only today, apparently, must those rules give way so one side can \nhave its way. The majority leader and those who support his \nextraordinary plan to change the Senate rules by fiat seek to cloak \ntheir grab for power in the source of our Nation's loftiest principles, \nand that source is the Constitution.\n  This is not just a silly public relations effort to change the name \nof their plan from the nuclear option--the term coined by the majority \nleader's predecessor--because that term obviously fares rather poorly \nin the public opinion polls. It is actually a cynical effort to \ndistract the public from the extraconstitutional nature of the plan by \ninvoking the Constitution itself.\n  In the last Congress, as in this one, I served as the ranking member \nof the Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution. The subcommittee held a \nhearing in May 2003 with the grandiose title: ``Judicial Nominations, \nFilibusters, and the Constitution, When a Majority is Denied Its Right \nto Consent.'' The hearing was certainly interesting and provocative. I \nwas there the whole time. No one made a convincing case that there is \nany such right in the Constitution anywhere.\n  Article II, section 2 spells out the Senate's role in nominations. It \nstates, in relevant part, that the President ``shall nominate, and by \nand with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . \nJudges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United \nStates.'' That is it. That is all it says. Some have managed to find in \nthose few words a requirement that the Senate give all judicial \nnominees up-or-down votes. Even if someone isn't a strict \nconstructionist, I can't for the life of me understand where they get \nthat from. Where is it? Where is it in the language? Where is it in the \nConstitution?\n  It may be the policy they prefer, but it is not a constitutional \nargument. It is not a constitutional requirement. In fact, the only \nlanguage in the Constitution that directly addresses the issue we are \nfaced with today is the following from Article I, clause 5:\n\n       Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings . . .\n\n  The Senate has determined its rules, and its rules also provide the \nmeans for changing the rules, of course. The Senate is now being asked \nto change the rules by breaking the rules. There is no principle \ninvolved here. There is just power.\n  It is a shame that those who support the President's nominees have \ninflated what is essentially a political dispute to a constitutional \ndebate. For those of us who take the Constitution seriously, it is \njarring to hear colleagues suggesting that one is violating one's oath \nof office by voting not to end debate on a nomination.\n  As my colleagues know, I spent 7 years in this body fighting to pass \na campaign finance reform bill. We had a majority here on that bill \nafter a couple of years. That wasn't the issue. For years that effort \nhad the support of a bipartisan majority of Senators, but it was \nstymied by filibusters. Senators who supported reform had many \nspirited, sometimes even bitter, debates with Senators who opposed our \nbill. But never did we contend our opponents on campaign finance reform \nwere violating their oath of office by using every tool available to \noppose a bill with which they strongly disagreed.\n  The Constitution does not prohibit opponents of a judicial nominee--\nor any nominee, for that matter--from using a filibuster to block a \nfinal vote on the nominee. The majority does not have a constitutional \nright to confirm a nominee, and the nominee has no constitutional right \nto a vote. As the senior Senator from West Virginia said the other day: \nThe Senate has often denied consent to a nominee in the past by simply \nrefusing to schedule a final vote.\n  I have not always supported those actions, but I have not pretended \nthey are unconstitutional.\n  If the arguments being advanced today by the Republican majority are \ncorrect, then the Republicans acted unconstitutionally in 1995 when \nthey defeated the nomination of Henry Foster to be Surgeon General by \nusing a filibuster. They violated the Constitution when they required \ncloture votes before ultimately confirming Stephen Breyer, Rosemary \nBurkett, H. Lee Sarokin, Richard Paez, and Marsha Berzon to circuit \ncourt judgeships, David Sacher to the Surgeon General's office, and \nRicki Tigert to the FDIC, Walter Dellinger to the DOJ's Office of Legal \nCounsel, and the current Governor of Arizona, Janet Napolitano, to be \nU.S. Attorney. If the arguments being advanced today are correct, they \nviolated their oaths of office when they forced the ambassadorial \nnomination of Sam Brown to be withdrawn because they refused to end \ndebate on his nomination.\n\n[[Page S5291]]\n\n  These are just the cases where a cloture vote was required to get a \nnomination through. I won't even start on the list of nominees who \nnever even got a hearing or a vote in the Judiciary Committee or any \nkind of debate on the floor if they cleared committee. But there are \ndozens of them. Wasn't the majority denied its right to consent just as \nmuch in those cases? Is there any meaningful constitutional difference \nbetween a filibuster on the one hand and on the other hand a hold on \nthe Senate floor or a wink and a nod between a committee chairman and a \nMember who just doesn't like a nominee? One could certainly argue the \ndenial of consent by failing to schedule a hearing or a vote in \ncommittee is on even less firm constitutional ground than a filibuster \nbecause it allows just one Senator, the chairman of Judiciary \nCommittee, to make the decision that the Senate's consent on a nominee \nwill be withheld, whereas if all the Senators vote, a filibuster can be \nsustained only with 41 or more votes.\n\n  But there is no real argument that filibusters of judicial \nnominations are unconstitutional, just as blocking nominations in \ncommittee is not unconstitutional. There is no principle here that \njustifies eliminating the filibuster for judicial nominees who have \nlifetime appointments but leaves it intact for nominees to the \nexecutive branch who can only serve until the term of the appointing \nPresident ends at the latest.\n  There is no principle that can distinguish judicial nominations from \nlegislation, which may also be passed by a majority, but can be amended \nor revoked by a majority in the same or later Congress as well. Again, \nthe effort we are facing here is not based on principle, it is based on \npower. The lack of a constitutional basis for it is made even more \nclear by the specific plan that the majority leader spelled out in his \npress release last week.\n  He intends, according to that release, to ``seek a ruling from the \nPresiding Officer regarding the appropriate length of time for debate \non such nominees.'' Seeking a ruling on how long we should debate? \nSurely the Presiding Officer cannot make that ruling on constitutional \ngrounds, the idea of a constitutional time limit. What is the \nconstitutional basis for ruling that the Senate can debate a nomination \nonly for a particular length of time? Is the Presiding Officer going to \nopine that it is constitutional to debate a nomination for 100 hours, \nbut unconstitutional for us to have 101 hours of debate? That would be \nabsurd.\n  No, it appears that instead of following the existing precedents of \nthe Senate, which state there is no dilatory rule except after cloture \nhas been invoked, the Presiding Officer will just announce a new rule \nand the Senate will then debate and vote on an appeal of that ruling. \nIf this happens, the rules of the Senate will be changed by fiat, by \nbreaking the rules--not principle, power, the power of majority rule.\n  The Constitution did not set up the Senate to be a majoritarian body. \nThat is why renaming the nuclear option as the constitutional option is \nso wrong. The Constitution allows citizens from smaller States who \ncould be easily outvoted in a majoritarian legislature such as the \nHouse to have the same power in the Senate as citizens of larger \nStates. This is not a minor provision, as the Presiding Officer knows. \nThe Founders clearly didn't think so because--this is amazing--they \nmade it the only provision in the Constitution that cannot be amended. \nNo State can give up its equal representation in the Senate without its \nconsent. You can't do a constitutional amendment to change that. They \ndesigned the Senate to be an important bulwark against majoritarian \npressure.\n  The Senate rules from the very beginning, of course, have granted \nprotections for the minority. There was no cloture rule at all until \nthis century. The rule didn't cover nominations until 1949. While the \ncloture rule has changed over time--sometimes offering more protection \nto the minority and sometimes less--those rule changes have always been \naccomplished in accordance with the Senate rules until now, until the \ndemand for power trumped principle.\n  The Framers intended the Senate to act as a check on the whims of the \nmajority, not to facilitate them. I will not pretend the Senate has \nalways been on the right side of history. At times, most notably during \nthe great civil rights debates of the 1950s and 1960s, Senators used \nthe powers given them to block vital, majority-supported legislation. \nBut notwithstanding those dark moments, the Senate has also served \nthroughout the history of this Republic as a place where individuals \nwith different beliefs and goals were forced to come together to work \nfor the common good.\n  By empowering the minority, the Framers created a body that has \nserved this country well. To continue down the road we are on now will \nbe to irretrievably change the very character of the Senate and \nirretrievably weaken the institution. Without the unique feature of \nextended debate, the Senate will be much less able to stand up to the \nPresident or to cool the passions of the explicitly majoritarian House.\n  I know my colleagues see themselves as guardians of this remarkable \ninstitution, as I do. When we leave the Senate--and some day, somehow \nor another, all of us will--it is our responsibility to ensure we do \nnot leave this institution weakened. As Senators, we tend to see \nourselves as pretty important, but none of us--and certainly no \njudicial nomination--is more important than the institution of the U.S. \nSenate itself.\n  Why is this extreme course necessary? Why are so many of our \ncolleagues prepared to sacrifice the Senate's character and its special \npower? Why are they bent on giving up their own power as Senators?\n  Let me take a minute to respond to some of the charges made about the \nbehavior of the minority that supposedly has given the majority no \nchoice but to use this nuclear option. First, we are told using the \nfilibuster to block a judicial nomination is unprecedented. As anyone \nwho has studied the record knows, that is nonsense.\n  Most famously, the Fortas nomination was filibustered. The Senator \nwho led that filibuster, Robert Griffin of Michigan, has tried to claim \nin recent days that it really wasn't a filibuster at all. But he said \nat the time:\n\n       It is important to realize that it has not been unusual for \n     the Senate to indicate its lack of approval for a nomination \n     by just making sure that it never came to a vote on the \n     merits. As I said, 21 nominations to the court have failed to \n     win Senate approval. But only nine of that number were \n     rejected on a direct, up-and-down vote.\n\n  We are told, however, that the Fortas nomination was different \nbecause there were Southern Democrats opposed to the nomination as well \nas Republicans. But what difference does that make? This debate is not \nabout the rights of the minority party; it is about the rights of a \nminority of Senators. Does anyone really think that if one or a few of \nour Republican colleagues joined a filibuster against one of the \nhandful of circuit court nominees that have been blocked, it would make \na difference to the Senators who support the nominations and want to \nchange the rules?\n  Fortas, of course, was a Supreme Court nominee, while the handful of \nnominees that have been blocked so far have been nominated to circuit \ncourts. But there have been filibusters of circuit court nominees in \nthe past as well, indeed in the very recent past. In 2000, cloture \nvotes were held on two Clinton nominees to the Ninth Circuit, Marsha \nBerzo, and Richard Paez. The current majority leader himself voted \nagainst cloture on Judge Paez's nomination on March 8, 2000.\n  Apparently, these filibusters were different because they were \nunsuccessful. The handful of Democratic filibusters of President Bush's \nnominees are unprecedented, we are told, because the Republican \nfilibusters of Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon didn't prevent them from \nbeing confirmed. Does anyone really think that if the current majority \nleader and the others who voted--against ending debate on the Paez \nnomination had convinced their colleagues to join them they would have \nthen changed their votes the next time around to make sure that the \nprinciple of an up or down vote was maintained?\n  This is what now passes for debate and argument on the issue of so-\ncalled ``obstruction'' of President Bush's nominees. ``The filibusters \nare unprecedented,'' they say. Never mind that Republicans, including \nthe majority leader, used the same tactic against nominees they \nopposed. ``Democratic obstruction of the President's nominations is \nunprecedented,'' we hear.\n\n[[Page S5292]]\n\nNever mind that the Senate approved 204 out of 214 nominations that \ncame to the floor in President Bush's first term, but in the last 4 \nyears of President Clinton's presidency, only 175 nominees were \nconfirmed and 55 were blocked, including 20 circuit court nominees. \nMany of those nominees never even got a hearing in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee on which I sit.\n  Well, that was different, we are told, because President Bush's \nnominees have a majority of support in the Senate. But that distinction \nis nonsense as well. President Clinton's nominees had majority support, \nobviously. That is why they were held up in committee and never reached \nthe floor, even for a cloture vote. Judge Paez, for example, was first \nnominated in January 1996. We finally confirmed him in March 2000. The \nvote on cloture was 85 to 14. The vote to confirm him was 59 to 39.\n  But one of the most foolish arguments we hear in support of the \nnuclear option is that there is a crisis in the courts because of the \nnumber of vacancies caused by Democratic filibusters. As of the end of \nPresident Bush's first term, during which the Senate confirmed 204 \njudges, there were only 27 vacancies on the Federal bench. The courts \nhad their lowest vacancy rate since 1990. Five months into his second \nterm, there are now 45 vacancies, but the President has made \nnominations for only 15 of them, one-third. For 30 vacancies there are \nno nominees. The vacancy rate is still very low historically. If there \nis a crisis now, which there isn't, it surely is not the Senate's \nfault.\n  There is no vacancy crisis. But we are about to be thrown into a \nconstitutional crisis by a majority that is drunk with power. While \nthere is plenty of blame to go around, the President precipitated this \ncrisis. When he took office in 2001, he had an opportunity to end the \nbitterness that plagued judicial nominations over the previous decade \nby recognizing that an injustice had been done to a large number of \nClinton nominees. Not an unconstitutional injustice, but an injustice \nnonetheless There were enough vacancies on the Federal appellate courts \nfor him to name most of the judges but give a few seats to Clinton \nnominees who had been blocked, or to other nominees suggested by \nDemocrats in those States. In his first group of nominations, which \nwere almost all to the appellate courts, he made a nod in that \ndirection by nominating Roger Gregory to the Fourth Circuit. President \nClinton's nomination of Gregory, the first African-American to sit on \nthat circuit, had been blocked in the Judiciary Committee. He was \neventually confirmed by a 99-1 vote.\n  The hopes that the President would make good on his campaign promise \nto change the tone in Washington were short lived. He ignored pleas for \nconsultation and conciliation on judicial nominations. Time after time, \nhe has filled appellate court seats that had been kept vacant during \nthe Clinton years with extremely conservative and often controversial \nnominees. Yet Democrats certainly didn't block all or even nearly a \nmajority of those choices. Much to the displeasure of many of the \ngroups on the left that work on nominations, Jeffrey Sutton and Deborah \nCook now sit on the Sixth Circuit, Jay Bybee, who we later learned was \nthe author of the infamous DOJ torture memo, is on the Ninth Circuit. \nMichael McConnell and Timothy Tymkovich are on the Tenth Circuit. In \nall, 35 of President Bush's nominations to the circuit courts have been \nconfirmed, even though 9 of those seats became vacant during the \nClinton years and were kept vacant by denying Clinton nominees an up or \ndown vote.\n  Only seven judges were blocked because of their views or records. \nThree others were held up because of the particularly egregious tactics \nused to block Michigan nominees to the Sixth Circuit during the Clinton \nadministration. The President has succeeded in reshaping the Federal \ncourts to his liking. He may soon have one or even two Supreme Court \nnominations to make. He ought to be proud of and pleased with his \naccomplishments, but winning almost all the time apparently isn't \nenough. And in order to win every time, he is willing to push the \nSenate to upend over 200 years of tradition and precedent and perhaps \npermanently damage the comity on which this institution functions.\n  In the end, the seemingly insurmountable differences we have on \njudicial nominees can only be resolved the way that seemingly \ninsurmountable differences are resolved on almost all other hotly \ncontested issues in the Senate--through negotiation and compromise. Of \ncourse, for there to be compromise, both sides have to be willing to \nengage in that effort. The offers made by the majority leader thus far \ndo not retain the unique and crucial feature of the current Senate \nrules--the right to unlimited debate. They amount to a slow motion \nnuclear option.\n  It may be that a confrontation cannot be avoided. The groups that \nsupport the President's nominees are clamoring for the nuclear trigger \nto be pulled. The only hope for the Senate is the Senate itself. In the \nend, this decision will be made by the 100 men and women given the \nhonor and responsibility of serving in this body at this point in our \nNation's history. The stakes could hardly be higher, or the \nconsequences to this body more significant. I can only hope that my \ncolleagues vote to let the Senate continue to be the Senate.\n  The checks and balances that the Framers created are at great risk \ntoday. The American people will suffer a great loss if we step over \nthis precipice. My fervent plea and hope is that the Senate will choose \nprinciple over power.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nLouisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President. I understand we are in \nmorning business. I ask unanimous consent that I may extend my remarks \nto consume about 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/17/senate-section/article/S5292-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5292-S5295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this is shaping up to be an auspicious \ntime for an Energy Bill, as we begin a year long celebration of \nBenjamin Franklin's 300th birthday. Benjamin Franklin was the \nembodiment of a ``renaissance man.'' He was a small business owner, a \ndiplomat, an accomplished author, a scientist, and one of our Nation's \ngreatest Founding Fathers. It is his role as a scientist that I want to \nfocus on today and suggest that the best birthday present we could give \nhim would be to honor his work and pass a balanced, forward-looking and \nscientifically-based Energy bill this year.\n  Americans learn from childhood the story of Franklin and his \nbreakthrough experiment with a kite and lightening. In today's world, \nit is hard to imagine that a politician as accomplished as Benjamin \nFranklin would also make such a profound contribution to science. But, \nhe did. Franklin's contribution to science was profound because his \nexperiment with a kite and lightning proved that electricity was a \nnaturally occurring phenomenon.\n  Before that, superstition governed man's interaction with \nelectricity. It used to be that people believed the devil hurled \nelectric bolts from the sky. So when a lightening storm was brewing, \nchurches sent people to ring the bells to ward them off. Tragically, \nthis same superstition seems to often guide our policies today.\n  Franklin's pioneering work with electricity is so instructive because \nit reminds us that we need to put reason and science before \nsuperstition and myth. Electricity was once a dangerous force in the \nworld that, thanks to Franklin and Edison, we have now harnessed to \nprovide power and light, life and hope, and the greatest prosperity the \nworld has ever known. This remains our challenge today. If we want to \ncontinue to generate power for future generations, we must harness \npowerful forces--solar rays, geothermal steam, nuclear fusion, wave \nenergy and new generations of fossil fuel technology.\n  To do so, we must abandon superstition, misinformation and fear.\n  The area of sharpest interest to the People of Louisiana in this \nbill, is also surely one of the areas most in need of reason over \nsuperstition--oil and gas production, both on shore and on the Outer \nContinental Shelf. As we are all aware, the United States has an \nabundant demand for fossil fuels, but also a great need to use them \nwisely.\n\n[[Page S5293]]\n\n  We comprise about 5 percent of the world's population, but we consume \nmore than 25 percent of the world's oil production--roughly 20 million \nbarrels per day. Some projections have the country's oil consumption \nhitting 29 million barrels a day by 2025--nearly a 30 percent increase. \nWith the price of oil hovering around $50 a barrel, this is a chilling \nproposition.\n  And for our own purposes today, it should also be a motivating \nproposition.\n  The global picture is even more difficult. China, with its rapidly \ngrowing economy, 1.3 billion people, and millions of new cars, has just \npassed Japan to become the second largest consumer of oil after the \nU.S. In 2003, China consumed more than 5 million barrels per day, of \nwhich more than 35 percent was imported. By 2030 it is estimated that \nChina will need 12 million barrels per day. India, with its 1 billion \npeople and surging economy, also has a growing need for a reliable \nenergy supply.\n  Despite this impending crisis, is the United States trying to secure \nits future by maximizing its own domestic production of natural sources \nof renewable energy? Absolutely not. Instead, like medieval villagers, \nwe are running up to the bell towers when lightening is striking.\n  We have young American soldiers securing Iraq. I support democracy \nfor Iraq; I support democracy for all people of the world. But what \nseparates Iraq from brutal dictatorships in other places? The answer is \nobvious--the second largest oil reserve in the world.\n  So young American men and women are sacrificing their lives every day \nto cover for our superstitions and political gridlock in Washington.\n  We have lost 1,622 Americans in Iraq--that's more than 2 American \nsoldiers per day of occupation. We have to play the cards that we are \ndealt, but just because we got a tough hand doesn't mean that we \nshould, in good conscience, pass an energy bill that does not diminish \nour dependence on Middle Eastern oil.\n  That is why it is so important that we write an energy bill that \nprovides smart, efficient incentives for the United States to maximize \nits own domestic energy production, using all the avenues that are \navailable to us to diversify our supply and to encourage competition \nthat would drive down and stabilize prices.\n  Vitally for my State, this must include a recognition of the \ncontribution that coastal states, particularly states along the Gulf \nCoast, make to energy production now.\n  The coast of Louisiana is not a regular coast. In supporting the \nproduction and transportation of 80 percent of our Nation's offshore \noil supply, it is truly America's Wetland--and with its loss, America \nfaces a national emergency. In the past 50 years alone, Louisiana's \nsize has been reduced by an area larger than that of Rhode Island, and \ncontinues to wear away at the rate of one football field every half \nhour.\n  If the Rocky Mountains were to shrink by 10 feet every year, we would \nact. If a foreign army were to advance a hundred yards up our shore \nevery 38 minutes, we would act.\n  Because of the vast array of energy resources Louisiana and other \ncoastal States supply and protect, coastal erosion in our States \npresents a direct threat to our national security and the global \neconomy.\n  We must act--and while the waves eat away our shores, the solution \nmay lie just beneath their surface.\n  In the early days of this Nation, Benjamin Franklin and his \ncolleagues looked to the western frontier for its rich resources and \nthe promise of new economic and military security, just as their \nancestors had looked to the seas with the same thoughts in mind.\n  Today, our oceans have reemerged as a great frontier capable of \nhelping build a stronger, more secure and more economically stable \nNation. We have learned that through new technologies, when managed \nwell and wisely, the ocean frontier holds tremendous resources that may \nbe put to work for America.\n  Harnessed beneath the surface of this great frontier lies the energy \nto light our homes, power our public infrastructure and give birth to \neven greater achievements.\n  Little more than a century ago, what we'd call ``Ocean Energy \nIndustry'' was simply one of whaling ships and harpoons. But today, the \nOuter Continental Shelf, or OCS, provides American consumers with 25 \npercent of the natural gas, and 30 percent of the oil, produced in the \ncountry each year.\n  It also rewards the U.S. Treasury with more than $5 billion \nannually--$145 billion since production began in 1953. That is the \nsecond biggest contributor of revenue to our Federal Treasury after \ntaxes.\n  But it has costs, and it is perfectly reasonable for States to want \nassistance with those costs.\n  The Mineral Lands Leasing Act shares with interior States 50 percent \nof the revenues generated on Federal land within their borders. In \nserving as the platforms that support a vital component of our national \nenergy supply, coastal States deserve the same treatment. And so, last \nweek, I introduced the Stewardship for our Coasts and Opportunities for \nReliable Energy Act--or SCORE--which does just that . . . It gives \ncoastal States the same 50 percent share of the oil and gas revenues \nfor their work that interior States receive for their efforts to \nsupport production.\n  This is more than just sound economic and energy policy--it is a \nsimple demonstration of fairness.\n  The OCS supplies more oil to our Nation than any foreign power--\nincluding Saudi Arabia--and it is estimated that 60 percent of our \nNation's undiscovered oil and gas will be found on the shelf. And so, \nas we take to the seas again, we are not hunting the elusive Moby Dick \nof lore. . . We know where the bulk of this oil may be found.\n  But just as the Western frontier once represented a great unknown to \nour Nation's policymakers, the impact and reality of the OCS seems lost \nin a time warp. We exist on outdated policies, and while our production \nhas increased somewhat, we haven't even built a new refinery in a \ndecade.\n  We also have yet to adequately answer the question, ``Why should a \nState contribute to our energy independence?'' and have failed to take \nthe necessary steps to encourage them to do so.\n  Last year, we commemorated the 200th Anniversary of Lewis and Clark's \nadventure into the frontier. It is a prominent historical event for \nLouisiana, because it marks the culmination of the promise of the \nLouisiana purchase. Thirty-eight soldiers and scouts set out with Lewis \nand Clark, and they called themselves the Corps of Discovery.\n  Hopefully, our body can take up their mantle and emulate their \nexploring spirit in the passing of this bill.\n  Today, we are exploring only 43 million of the 1.67 billion acres of \nthe Outer Continental Shelf--less than 2.6 percent! If Lewis and Clark \nhad taken this same timid tactic, they would have stopped just short of \nCincinnati, and the history of our country would have been vastly \ndifferent. Instead, Lewis and Clark ventured on for another 8,000 miles \nand helped to open our western frontier. Let us do the same!\n  Thomas Jefferson, who commissioned the adventure, was eager to have a \nfull understanding of the economic potential of his great bargain. This \nwas an act of political will--for no sooner did the trip commence, than \nCongress began complaining about its expense. Thus, even Lewis and \nClark's voyages were seemingly subject to the mindless penny pinching \nof ``302(b)'' allocations.\n  What they were trying to discover was the economic potential and \nnatural resources of this great country. It was a fundamental exercise \nof reason over myth. Jefferson sought new trading relationships with \nthe native tribes, sought an overland route to the Pacific for nascent \ntrade with China, and wanted to know of the quality of land for \nagriculture.\n  What he did not do was let ignorance and fear govern policy.\n  Yet when it comes to the Outer Continental Shelf, we are doing just \nthat. Not only do we not know the full riches that lie off our coasts, \npolicymakers around here don't want to go, don't want to see, and don't \nwant to know.\n  While the OCS contains more than 60 percent of the Nation's remaining \nundiscovered oil and natural gas resources, 85 percent of the OCS in \nthe lower 48 States remains untouchable . . . blocked by Congressional \nmoratoria and administrative withdrawal.\n\n  While 98 percent of our current OCS production comes from a very \nconcentrated area--the western half of the\n\n[[Page S5294]]\n\nGulf of Mexico, offshore Louisiana and Texas--most of the Pacific Coast \nremains off limits. Most of the Eastern Gulf of Mexico . . . off \nlimits. And the entire Atlantic seaboard . . . off limits.\n  At the same time, our demand for, and supply of, oil and gas are \nmoving in opposite directions. Over the next 20 years, our consumption \nis expected to increase by 50 percent, but production is only expected \nto increase by less than half that amount.\n  Imagine explaining that circumstance to someone like Jefferson or \nFranklin, Lewis or Clark. They understood the essential fact of \nprogress--you can't discover if you don't look.\n  It is time for a full accounting of the resources of the OCS. \nTechnology has provided us with a modern Corps of Discovery that will \nbe no more intrusive than the 40 men in the wilderness 200 years ago. \nWith scientific data in hand, then we can have a meaningful argument \nabout the efficacy of what to do with our natural resources.\n  For example, through the effective use of technology, we have \nproduced three times as many resources as we thought existed 30 years \nago--and have produced them in an environmentally friendly way . . . \nThe Minerals Management Service estimates that from 1985 to 2001, OCS \noffshore facilities and pipelines accounted for only 2 percent of the \noil released into U.S. waters. In fact, 97 percent of OCS spills are \none barrel or less in volume. Obviously, just a little technology can \ngo a long way.\n  What is disappointing to me is that the mythology around oil and gas \nproduction--its potential hazards and challenges--stems from stories \nnearly 50 years old. We live in an information driven economy, but many \nin the environmental community have a very industrial age approach to \nthese challenges.\n  We ban; we prohibit; we restrict. Instead we should research, \ninnovate and improve.\n  Several nights ago, I was up late watching an odd documentary. It was \nabout the history of bringing hot water to our homes at the turn of the \ncentury. It's something we all take for granted now, but if you \ncontemplate it, it was a difficult engineering problem years ago. Like \nall new technologies, water heaters were once a lot less reliable than \nthey are now. In fact, when they first started to be installed in \npeople's homes, they frequently blew sky high. That was tragic, and we \nare all relieved that we've moved beyond that stage in technology.\n  But, the lesson is that even though tragic injuries occurred, when \nthere was great societal benefit to be had, technology kept on leading \nthe way. That is what has already occurred in oil and gas. There is \nclearly more that can be done.\n  I invite any Member of the Senate to join me on an offshore platform. \nYou will see something that looks a lot less like an industrial plant \nand more like a spaceship . . . A spaceship for which our coastal \nproducing States provide the launch pads.\n  More can be done, but you will be amazed at what has already been \naccomplished.\n  The SCORE Act helps motivate States to consider the potential that \nlies on the frontier off their coasts, and hopes to inspire a new era \nof technological advancement and energy invention. As we begin to \ncomprehend the Ocean Frontier, we need to partner with industry to \ndevelop the necessary science.\n  Safety and environmental sensitivity should be the watchwords of our \nstewardship. It is a lesson that we take with us from our collective \nexperience. To ensure this remains a priority for industry, we need to \nreinvest some of the resources that we are collecting. That is the way \nforward--not ignorance and fear, but reason and stewardship.\n  No one understood the importance of stewardship more than Theodore \nRoosevelt, whose memorial I visited yesterday with the Senator from \nTennessee, Mr. Alexander. Two of Roosevelt's greatest legacies--the \nPelican Island National Wildlife Refuge and Breton Island National \nWildlife Refuge--lie just off Louisiana's coast. They were the first \nrefuges he created, but as we know, they were not the last . . . and \nthe lives of generations of Americans continue to be enriched by these \ngifts to us.\n  In his only trip to one of the refuges he created, Roosevelt visited \nLouisiana's barrier islands in 1915 . . . but much of the landscape he \nvisited no longer exists, having been washed away by coastal erosion. \nReflecting on the visit, he wrote in his autobiography, A Book Lover's \nHolidays in the Open:\n\n       To lose the chance to see frigate-birds soaring in circles \n     above the storm, or a file of pelicans winging their way \n     homeward across the crimson afterglow of the sunset, or \n     myriad terns flashing in the bright light of midday as they \n     hover in a shifting maze above the beach--why, the loss is \n     like the loss of a gallery of the masterpieces of the artists \n     of old time.\n\n  Unfortunately, even with the efforts of conservation visionaries like \nRoosevelt, the story of the past 100 years has been one of continued \ncoastal and wildlife losses. Consider that Battledore Island, the \n`gallery of masterpiece' of which he wrote, is no more. Today, \nfishermen know it as Battledore Reef.\n  It is too late for Battledore Island, but it is not too late to save \ncountless other natural treasures around our Nation. While President \nRoosevelt's vision is still alive, there is much work left to be done . \n. . and today we have an opportunity to carry on his legacy of \nconservation and write a different ending to the story he began so long \nago.\n  The Americans Outdoors Act, which I have introduced with Senator \nAlexander, is a significant start. In our Government today, you will be \nhard pressed to find a closer embodiment of Roosevelt's legacy than in \nSenator Alexander, and I am so very proud to be working with him in \nthis effort.\n  AOA would mark our Government's greatest commitment of resources to \nconservation ever, and would directly benefit all 50 States and \nhundreds of local communities through its landmark, multiyear \ncommitment to coastal restoration and other conservation programs like \nthe state side of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. It, like SCORE, \nwould also set forward a crucial first step to restoring America's \nvital wetlands and the billions of dollars in energy investments they \nprotect.\n  When Hurricane Ivan struck back in September, it should have been a \nwake-up call to us all. Although the storm did not hit Louisiana \ndirectly, its impact on the price and supply of oil and gas in this \ncountry could still be felt 4 months later. One can only imagine what \nthe impact would have been had Ivan cut a more western path in the \ngulf. How many more hurricane seasons are we going to spend playing \nRussian roulette with our oil and gas supply?\n  But the diversity of our energy supply is just as important as the \nincreased production of it. And our atmosphere protects us much in the \nsame way as our coasts. We have an obligation to serve as responsible \nstewards of both.\n  Mr. President, it will come as no surprise to you that fear, rather \nthan science, also seems to dominate our policy with respect to nuclear \nenergy. There are some startling facts that most Americans probably do \nnot know today. Nuclear energy--today--despite not having licensed a \nnew plant in 27 years--provides 20 percent of America's electricity. \nMost importantly, it does so without any emissions.\n  This is a resource that is produced 100 percent domestically. No one \nhas to bring in a new LNG plant for nuclear energy, no one has to \ndefend critical supply lines for nuclear energy, no one has to cap and \ntrade emissions for nuclear energy. Yet a policy driven by fear and \nsuperstition keep the United States in a technological backwater. \nBetween our fear of oil and gas production, our near hysteria toward \nnuclear power, and our rejection of clean coal options, the United \nStates is living in a kind of energy technology dark ages.\n  Rather than harnessing powerful forces that could bring light and \nenergy to this Nation. We are being ruled by superstition and fear, and \nwe have to bring these attitudes to an end. The alternative is even \nmore bleak. While the U.S. ignores nuclear power, our economic rivals \nin Japan and France are pulling away from us. More menacing still, the \nChinese are threatening to leap-frog U.S. technology in this arena. \nSpencer Reiss wrote in a recent article entitled Let a Thousand \nReactors Bloom:\n\n       The Future of Nuclear Power, a 2003 study by a blue-ribbon \n     commission headed by\n\n[[Page S5295]]\n\n     former CIA director John Deutch, concludes that by 2050 the \n     PRC could require the equivalent of 200 full-scale nuke \n     plants. A team of Chinese scientists advising the Beijing \n     leadership puts the figure even higher: 300 gigawatts of \n     nuclear output, not much less than the 350 gigawatts produced \n     worldwide today.\n       To meet that growing demand, China's leaders are pursuing \n     two strategies. They're turning to established nuke plant \n     makers like AECL, Framatome, Mitsubishi, and Westinghouse, \n     which supplied key technology for China's nine existing \n     atomic power facilities. But they're also pursuing a second, \n     more audacious course. Physicists and engineers at Beijing's \n     Tsinghua University have made the first great leap forward in \n     a quarter century, building a new nuclear power facility that \n     promises to be a better way to harness the atom: a pebble-bed \n     reactor. A reactor small enough to be assembled from mass-\n     produced parts and cheap enough for customers without \n     billion-dollar bank accounts. A reactor whose safety is a \n     matter of physics, not operator skill or reinforced concrete. \n     And, for a bona fide fairy-tale ending, the pot of gold at \n     the end of the rainbow is labeled hydrogen.\n\n  With this sort of news, one begins to wonder if there is any set of \ncircumstances that will dissuade the Congress from its wrong-headed \npolicies. We cannot afford to keep waiting. I call on my colleagues to \nresolve once and for all the issues of where to store the byproducts of \nour nuclear generation.\n  Technology also harbors other exciting new promises for clean energy. \nCoal provides 50 percent of our Nation's electrical supply, and now we \ncan use it in a better way. Coal gasification plants--or ``clean coal'' \nstrip out the pollutants that would otherwise be released into the air, \nallowing us to continue to draw on this abundant natural resource while \nalso respecting our roles as stewards of the environment.\n  Liquified natural gas also has a significant role in satisfying our \nclean energy goals while helping to solve our Nation's supply and \ndemand imbalance. But we cannot allow the Gulf of Mexico to simply \nbecome a ``thruway'' for LNG without recognizing the role of coastal \nStates that host the terminals and sustain its importation. To this \nend, terminal siting is not only a Federal concern but a local one as \nwell.\n  And finally, we simply cannot ignore the promise of hydrogen \ntechnology. Senator Dorgan has been one of the Senate's foremost \nleaders in this regard. I was proud to support his efforts throughout \nall of the iterations of the Senate Energy bill, and am very pleased to \nunderstand that many of them have been incorporated into the Energy \nchairman's mark.\n\n  Beyond these, there are countless alternative resources we have yet \nto fully explore--resources such as wind, solar and even wave energy--\nall of which can also be produced on the OCS with the encouragement \nSCORE provides.\n  Let me make clear: Increased domestic production and supply diversity \nare of paramount importance to our energy needs and national security, \nbut no serious energy policy can ignore the equally important need for \nenergy conservation.\n  Benjamin Franklin was eminently quotable, but one of his more \nrelevant quips is ``When a well's dry, we know the worth of water.'' So \nit is with America's environment. The cost of global warming will be \ntruly staggering when compared to conservation measures today.\n  There are a number of points to be raised in that regard.\n  First, I believe that the U.S. Government should use its power of \neconomies of scale, and large purchasing power to set the best example. \nEnergy efficiency should be a consideration in the design and \nretrofitting of U.S. Government buildings. Energy savings should be a \nfactor in the enormous fleet of government vehicles.\n  I have also supported a provision, now included in the Energy \nchairman's mark, which would call for a reduction in our Nation's oil \nconsumption by 1 million barrels per day over the next 10 years. We \ncurrently consume 20 million barrels. With research and technology, \nthese are very attainable goals.\n  Similarly, the Senate will be best off with a smart Renewable \nPortfolio Standard--RPS--that it can pass. RPS is a lynchpin that will \nmake alternative technologies commercially viable. It is a vital and \nlogical step in our efforts toward energy independence.\n  And even as we address the production side of the equation, we need \nto make sure the energy we produce reaches consumers affordably and \nreliably. In our handling of OCS revenues, we ask our coastal producing \nStates to give and give with little in return. Equally unfair are our \nNation's electrical transmission policies, which expect Louisiana \nconsumers to foot the bill for electricity consumed in other States.\n  For these reasons, Senator Burr and I earlier this year introduced \nthe Interstate Transmission Act, which seeks to protect local rate \npayers and make electric reliability standards mandatory.\n  Today we make new history. It may not be as exciting as Franklin's \ndiscoveries about electricity, or require the endurance of the Corps of \nDiscovery. But it may hold the key to America's economic future.\n  My Ocean Energy Initiative, which includes the Americans Outdoors and \nSCORE Acts, as well as a series of technology proposals still to come, \ncreates a strong four-step framework for protecting our national \neconomic, military and energy security by increasing, diversifying, and \ncleaning up our energy production and supply.\n  We must look for new ideas and new frontiers to support increased, \ndiverse, and clean energy. The Ocean Frontier today presents the most \nimmediate opportunities, but who knows what lies on the next horizon? \nSpace, perhaps?\n  We must explore these new frontiers and develop the innovative new \ntechnologies to do so more effectively and responsibly.\n  We must share the shelf and other frontiers, so our states aren't \nleft shouldering the burden.\n  And we must invest in our environment and return to our coasts, \nforests and green-spaces the respect and recognition befitting what \nthey have given us by way of natural resources. We give back some of \nwhat we take.\n  Through a responsible balance of conservation and innovation, this \nOcean Energy Initiative recognizes that the goals of energy security \nand environmental stewardship need not be mutually exclusive.\n  Mr. President, we follow in the footsteps of great pioneers: Benjamin \nFranklin, who put science before superstition; Thomas Jefferson, who \nopened the American frontier; Lewis and Clark, who journeyed into this \nfrontier and found its rich promise; and Theodore Roosevelt, who saw \nthat a great nation bears a responsibility of stewardship to the ground \nit is built upon.\n  If we follow their example, and continue down the path these pioneers \nblazed to the new frontier, we will have a bill that we can all look \nback on with pride.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/17/senate-section/article/S5295-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5295-S5296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. RICHARD GAMELLI\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the important \nwork of the president of the American Burn Association, Dr. Richard \nGamelli of the Loyola University Medical Center in Chicago, as he \napproaches the end of his distinguished service in that position. Under \nDr. Gamelli's leadership, the American Burn Association has worked \ntirelessly to improve the first line of defense: the prevention of burn \ninjuries.\n  The ABA encourages and supports burn-related research, education, \ncare, rehabilitation, and prevention through a variety of programs and \npublications, including the production of the leading peer-reviewed, \nscientific journal in the burn field, the Journal of Burn Care & \nRehabilitation. During Dr. Gamelli's tenure, the ABA has worked to \nimprove emergency response systems and to incorporate burn care into \nour Nation's disaster preparedness systems in light of new threats to \nthe United States. Under Dr. Gamelli's guidance, the ABA has expanded \nits reach and established its position at the forefront of its field. \nMany physicians, nurses, and health care workers who are members of the \nABA are currently on the front lines, serving in Iraq and Afghanistan \nand treating America's injured soldiers.\n  As professor and chair of the Department of Surgery at the Loyola \nUniversity Medical Center, Dr. Gamelli has dedicated his life to \nadvancing clinical treatment of burn victims, accident and trauma \nvictims and others whose medical needs are among the most difficult and \ndire a doctor ever sees. As a teacher he has provided guidance to high \nschool students, college students,\n\n[[Page S5296]]\n\nmedical students, residents, graduate students, colleagues and others, \nencouraging them always to strive for excellence and look for new \nanswers. As a researcher he has helped his department secure funding \nfor more than 20 years from the National Institutes of Health. He is \nnationally and internationally recognized for his research and has \nauthored more than 150 scientific articles, 23 book chapters, and 8 \nbooks.\n  In 1997 and 2000 Dr. Gamelli was named by Chicago Magazine as one of \n``Chicago's Top Doctors,'' and in 1982, 1985, 1986, 1988, 1989 and \n1990, he was named Professor of the Year by the medical students at \nLoyola. He was selected by the faculty council of Loyola University \nChicago as the 2002 member of the year for his excellence in teaching, \nresearch, patient care and service. In light of his extraordinary \nrecord of achievement, his alma mater, Saint Michael's College, \ninducted Dr. Gamelli into the inaugural class of its Alumni Academic \nHall of Fame in 2002.\n  Having served the ABA admirably, Dr. Gamelli recently stepped down as \nABA president at this year's annual meeting. I want to take this \nopportunity to acknowledge and thank Dr. Gamelli for his distinguished \nservice and for his ongoing contributions to the American people and \nthe medical community, and I wish him all the best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/17/senate-section/article/S5296-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          REPORTING OF S. 1053\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I rise today to mourn the passing of \nformer Congressman Peter Rodino and also to celebrate his life.\n  The son of hard-working Italian immigrants, Peter Rodino grew up on \nthe streets of Newark, NJ, and rose to become a prominent and respected \nfigure during a defining moment in our Nation's history.\n  Serving as the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Mr. Rodino \nwas charged with managing the impeachment hearings of President Richard \nNixon. He had chaired the committee for less than a year when the \nhearings began, and those who did not know him wondered how he would \nrespond to such a monumental challenge.\n  He soon put all doubts to rest. He conducted the hearings patiently, \nthoroughly, and fairly, and in doing so he helped guide our Nation \nthrough a difficult test of our Constitution.\n  By the time the committee had heard all of the evidence about the \nWatergate break-in and coverup, its members approved several articles \nof impeachment by overwhelming bipartisan margins. By this action, they \nproved that our system of government is greater than any one person or \npolitical party.\n  Most of the Nation got to know Congressman Rodino during the \nWatergate hearings, but I had known him for years through his tireless \nwork on behalf of the people of his district and New Jersey. He loved \nthe city of Newark and the people of Newark, and he always had their \ninterests at heart.\n  Whether he was helping to pass the 1966 civil rights bill, extending \nthe Voting Rights Act, or leading the effort to make Martin Luther \nKing's birthday a national holiday, Peter Rodino worked tirelessly to \nmake this Nation as great as it can possibly be.\n  After I came to the Senate, I had the privilege of working with him \nto help the people of New Jersey. We served together for 6 years, and I \nwas always amazed by the energy and determination he brought to his \njob.\n  He had tackled every challenge with that same energy and \ndetermination, from his service in World War II with the 1st Armored \nDivision to his work at Seton Hall law school, where he shared his love \nof the law with students.\n  Every now and then, someone comes along who is an inspiration for us \nall, regardless of political party, religious faith, or ethnic \nbackground. Peter Rodino was just such a fellow. While I will miss him \nvery much, I will always treasure his friendship with me and remember \nall the good he did for New Jersey and its people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/17/senate-section/article/S5296-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5296-S5297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n VOLUNTARY PUBLIC ACCESS AND WILDLIFE HABITAT INCENTIVE PROGRAM ACT OF \n                                  2005\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, in March Senator Roberts joined me in \nintroducing S. 548, the Voluntary Public Access and Wildlife Habitat \nIncentive Program Act of 2005.\n  This legislation is enthusiastically supported not only by America's \nhunters and anglers, but also by agricultural producers, private \nlandowners and those interested in rural development. Open Fields, as \nthis bipartisan legislation is commonly known, addresses hunting, \nfishing and other recreational access on private land. The legislation \nalso tackles rural development issues head on.\n  Dwindling access to quality hunting, angling and other wildlife-\ndependent opportunities is a trend that slowly is pulling apart the \nAmerican sporting tradition. At the same time, farmers, ranchers, and \nsmall town businesses are desperately looking for the means and \nopportunities to revitalize and stimulate their local economies. These \ntwo needs, the need for better access for sportsmen who can not afford \nto lease land, and the need for economic stimulation in rural America \nhave intersected and spurred the creation of highly effective state \npublic access programs.\n  Walk-in or access programs are not a new concept. In fact they have \nvery successfully begun to reverse the trend of diminishing numbers of \nhunters and anglers in States with these programs. At the same time, \nthese programs generate cash and economic activity in rural economies \nby encouraging increased numbers of hunters, anglers, and others who \nenjoy wildlife-related activities to spend more of their outdoor \nrecreation dollars in rural America.\n  Eighteen States are already using their own limited funding resources \nto finance very successful access programs. These programs have set the \nstage for even greater success in the future, but only if additional \nfunding becomes available. When enacted into law, Open Fields will \nprovide $20 million per year in Commodity Credit Corporation funds over \nthe next five years. These funds will be used to provide U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture grants for States with recreational walk-in \nor access programs. It is our intent that access to all the land that \nproperty owners voluntarily enroll under this legislation will be \navailable for, but not limited to, hunting and fishing activities.\n  I remind our colleagues that the Open Fields legislation offers \nbenefits to many of their constituents, regardless of their State or \ndistrict, or whether they represent urban or rural Americans. We all \nknow that millions of city dwellers hunt and fish. Access to quality \nareas to hunt, fish, and enjoy other wildlife related activities within \nreasonable distances from urban areas is becoming dramatically reduced.\n  As we travel the rural areas of our States, Senator Roberts and I \nexperience firsthand the tremendous need to bring additional income \ninto small towns and communities in Kansas, North Dakota, and across \nrural America. As members of the Committee on Agriculture, we are \nconstantly looking for alternatives to supplement \ntraditional agricultural programs and improve the economic safety net \nfor our farmers and ranchers that are not considered trade distorting. \nOpen Fields is a program that can help achieve those objectives.\n\n  The positive impact of making private lands available to the hunting \npublic is highly visible in Mr. Roberts' home State of Kansas and in my \nown State of North Dakota. According to data obtained from a 2001 U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service study, Kansas and North Dakota have a total \nof 1,750,000 acres currently enrolled in state-run access programs. \nFurthermore, this study notes that hunting licenses sold in the State \nof Kansas increased from 175,000 in 1996 to 205,000 in 2001, a 22.9 \npercent increase. In North Dakota, hunting license sales increased from \n118,000 in 1996 to 133,000 in 2001, a 12.7 percent increase.\n  During this same time period, the number of hunters nationwide \ndecreased from 14 million to 13 million.\n\n[[Page S5297]]\n\nThis is a disturbing trend that has resulted in lost jobs, reduced \nrevenues for local communities, and fewer Americans enjoying our rich \nhunting heritage. State-run access programs are proof that opening \nadditional acres of private land to hunting increases the numbers of \nhunters and provides a significant boost to the economies of small \ntowns and rural areas.\n  I cannot emphasize enough what a tremendous opportunity Open Fields \nprovides our colleagues to invest in America and to help preserve our \nhunting and fishing heritage. Currently, access programs are being \nsuccessfully administered in states all across America, from Arizona \nwith 2 million acres to Pennsylvania with 4.3 million acres. In 18 \nStates, more than 23 million acres are enrolled. Administrative and \nincentive payments total just over $23 million per year, an average of \nabout $1 per acre.\n  According to a recently completed cost-benefit analysis, states with \nactive access programs encouraged more than 276,000 hunters to continue \nto hunt who otherwise would have quit. This translates into about \n$512.6 million these hunters spend annually in these States. With this \nin mind, I remind our colleagues that the $20 million per year \ninvestment called for under this legislation will potentially return \nmany times its initial cost. States with access programs are currently \nspending about $23 million per year while generating more than $512 \nmillion in additional economic activity. Through our legislation, this \nreturn on investment can become a reality for many more states and \ncommunities.\n  Part of our responsibility as policymakers is to seek opportunities \nthat will improve the quality of life of our constituents. We have \nintroduced the Open Fields legislation as a means to encourage the \nStates to partner with the outdoor recreation community and private \nlandowners to preserve our hunting and fishing heritage and provide \neconomic growth opportunities for rural America.\n  I urge my colleagues to support and cosponsor Open Fields.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/17/senate-section/article/S5297-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               PAUL PECK\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to praise an \nextraordinary man, Paul Peck. I had the honor of meeting Mr. Peck \nthrough our mutual interest in the Smithsonian Institution.\n  Mr. Peck has been an effective proponent of the civic process. In \n2002, Mr. Peck generously donated $2 million to enhance the National \nPortrait Gallery's presidential programs, allowing for educational \nresources related to the presidency. In the same year, the Portrait \nGallery founded The Paul Peck Presidential Awards, the only awards in \nthe United States to honor achievement in presidential service and \nportrayal. Last year, at the Third Annual Paul Peck Presidential Awards \nCeremony, Mr. Peck gave a heartfelt and thought-provoking speech about \nthe need for an increased awareness of American history and an \nincreased level of civil participation in our country. Mr. President, I \nask unanimous consent that Mr. Peck's remarks be printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  The Smithsonian is truly fortunate to have benefited from the \ndedication and intelligence of Mr. Peck.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Summary of Paul Peck's Remarks, Third Annual Paul Peck Presidential \n                                 Awards\n\n       Hi folks.\n       It's great to be here with you to honor two great \n     Americans: George Elsey and Brian Lamb.\n       I have been asked many times why I joined with the National \n     Portrait Gallery to focus attention on the presidency.\n       My answer is: I believe that ``Freedom is life and freedom \n     is rooted in democracy.''\n       I believe that Americans are blessed,\n       And we owe it to our children and grandchildren to pass on \n     this love of freedom and the means to preserve it.\n       The founding fathers believed that freedom requires voters \n     who are knowledgeable, involved, and vigilant.\n       Today, however, Fewer people vote, Fewer people seem \n     concerned about civic issues, and Fewer people are involved \n     in the civic, governing, and political process.\n       Furthermore, we've cut back on teaching Civics and \n     according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, \n     fewer than 25 percent of Americans have even a basic \n     knowledge of American History.\n       If we allow this trend to continue, what will it mean to be \n     an American; and what happens to democracy because democracy \n     can't survive as a spectator sport.\n       We can't continue this way. It's a roadmap to disaster and \n     I worry about the direction we're taking.\n       I believe every citizen has an obligation to make things \n     better and I believe every citizen can make a difference.\n       Here's how we're going to fix the problem.\n       The presidency symbolizes the United States and represents \n     government to most people. Americans are fascinated with the \n     presidency and we're going to build on this fixation to \n     foster civic action, civic understanding, and reasoned \n     voting.\n       Our civic action goal is to get everybody involved in \n     democracy whether through public service, governing, \n     politics, non- governmental organizations, or civic volunteer \n     activities. America was built on people coming together to \n     achieve great and honorable goals and we're going to re-\n     create this sense of community, caring, and co-operation.\n       As many of you know, I believe that our children are our \n     future. If they don't know what it means to be an American, \n     how do we preserve freedom, democracy, and the American way \n     of life?\n       In 1954, Brown vs. The Board of Education made America \n     better; and voting and the right to vote grabbed children's \n     attention and led to lifelong civic involvement. What are we \n     doing today to spark a similar interest in freedom and \n     democracy in our children?\n       As a first step in increasing civic action and \n     understanding, I intend to request that next Tuesday's \n     presidential election winner set aside one school day every \n     year to discuss American principles and encourage civic \n     engagement. It is my hope that government, industry, and \n     academia will encourage participation and provide time to \n     their employees to get involved and help us come together as \n     a nation.\n       Please help me make this proposal a reality.\n       In summary, you are our opinion makers. It's vital that \n     you: Strengthen our society, Promote civility, and Inspire \n     people to discuss issues and participate in the civic \n     process;\n       Thereby promoting Lincoln's ideal of ``government of the \n     people, by the people, and for the people.''\n       Thank you for coming.--Paul L. Peck, October 28, 2004\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/17/senate-section/article/S5297-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               DOBSON STUDENTS RECEIVE HONORABLE MENTION\n\n Mr. KYL.

I have sent the enclosed notice to the Federal \nRegister for publication, which states that the Burma emergency is to \ncontinue beyond May 20, 2005. The most recent notice continuing this \nemergency was published in the Federal Register on May 19, 2004 (69 FR \n29041).\n  The crisis between the United States and Burma arising from the \nactions and policies of the Government of Burma that led to the \ndeclaration of a national emergency on May 20, 1997, has not been \nresolved. These actions and policies, including its policies of \ncommitting large-scale repression of the democratic opposition in \nBurma, are hostile to U.S. interests and pose a continuing unusual and \nextraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the \nUnited States. For this reason, I have determined that it is necessary \nto continue the national emergency with respect to Burma and maintain \nin force the sanctions against Burma to respond to this threat.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to \nprovide grants to promote innovative outreach and enrollment under the \nmedicaid and State children's health insurance programs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today, Senator Bingaman and I introduced \nthe ``Covering Kids Act of 2005.'' This legislation provides $100 \nmillion in funding to a host of entities including the States, local \ncommunities, schools, faith-based organizations, Indian tribes, safety \nnet providers. The goal is to increase enrollment of eligible children \nin Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).\n  I believe that all Americans should have the security of lifelong, \naffordable access to health care, especially America's children. \nPrograms like SCHIP help provide a critical safety net.\n  But, unfortunately, there are still too many families who are not \naware of the coverage available to them, or face barriers to \nenrollment. In fact, over 5.6 million kids are eligible for Medicaid \nand SCHIP, but are not enrolled. The Covering Kids Act will help close \nthat gap.\n  The legislation will fund innovative outreach and enrollment efforts \nto expand coverage among minority and underserved children, and to \nthose living in rural areas. It will also give states additional \nflexibility to streamline enrollment in these programs, reducing \nadministrative costs for the government and eliminating paperwork and \nhassles for families.\n  Covering children is the right thing to do. And by ensuring that \nchildren have access to preventive care, it is also one of the best \nways of reducing long-term strain on America's health care system.\n  Since arriving in the Senate in 1995, I have advanced worked hard to \nexpand\n\n[[Page S5303]]\n\ncoverage to uninsured Americans and improve health care for those in \nneed. I have sponsored numerous pieces of bipartisan legislation \nincluding: the ``Closing the Health Care Gap Act of 2004,'' the \n``Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003,'' the ``Birth Defects and \nDevelopmental Disabilities Prevention Act of 2003,'' and the \n``Children's Health Act of 2000.'' Last Congress, we took a critical \nstep forward in expanding affordable health coverage to millions more \nAmericans by authorizing tax-free, portable Health Savings Accounts as \npart of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003.\n  Today, we build on that record of progress.\n  I first proposed expanding outreach efforts to help lower income \nchildren in July of last year. Today, I join with Senator Jeff Bingaman \nand other cosponsors in taking a critical step toward fulfilling that \ngoal.\n  I also want to applaud the President for his leadership on this \nissue. President Bush has made the expansion of Medicaid and SCHIP \ncoverage a cornerstone of his agenda. I am confident that with his \nleadership, and the efforts of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, we can help millions of kids who need coverage by passing this \ncommon sense legislation. All of our children should have access to the \naffordable quality health care.\n  I'm proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation with Senators \nBingaman, Lugar, Cantwell, Santorum, Collins, Cochran, and Murray. I \nlook forward to working with them, and with all of my colleagues, to \nstrengthen our Nation's health care system and expand affordable health \ncoverage. \n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1049\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Over half of these children live in families \nwith incomes below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level and are \neligible for coverage under either the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program (S-CHIP) or Medicaid, but are not enrolled in those \nsafety net programs. Studies have shown that the families of many \neligible children are not familiar with the availability of safety net \ncoverage or face other barriers that prevent enrollment.\n  One Tuesday, May 17, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and Senator \nJeff Bingaman will introduce bipartisan legislation to help close this \ncoverage gap. The ``Covering Kids Act of 2005'' seeks to increase \nhealth coverage among uninsured, low-income children by providing \ngrants to States, faith-based organizations, safety net providers, \nschools, and other community and non-profit organizations to conduct \ninnovative Medicaid and SCHIP outreach and enrollment efforts. Grants \nmay also be used to promote the understanding of the important role \nthat health insurance coverage plays in ensuring quality health care \nfor pregnant women and children.\n  The legislation appropriates $50 million dollars in fiscal year 2006 \nand an additional $50 million in fiscal year 2007 in addition to \nalready appropriated SCHIP funds for these additional outreach and \nenrollment efforts. Ten percent of grant funding would be set aside for \ngrants to the Indian Health Service, tribal organizations, and urban \nIndian programs for outreach and enrollment to Native American \nchildren. Outreach funds may be carried over into subsequent fiscal \nyears until the entire $100 million is awarded to grantees.\n  In making grants, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, HHS, \nmust give priority to grantees that propose to target geographic areas \nwith high numbers of children who are eligible but not enrolled in \nMedicaid and SCHIP, including those who live in rural areas and those \nareas with large numbers of racial and ethnic minorities and other \nhealth disparity populations.\n  The Secretary is required to disseminate to eligible grantees as well \nas to the public enrollment data and other measurements of the \neffectiveness of these outreach programs. The Secretary also is \nrequired to submit an annual report to Congress describing the impact \nof these efforts on expanding access to uninsured children.\n  Further, the legislation also allows States additional flexibility to \nstreamline Medicaid and SCHIP enrollment processes. Because two-thirds \nof uninsured children live in families that receive benefits through \nother federal programs, the legislation gives states the option of \nusing income and resource eligibility determinations made under other \ngovernment programs to fast-track enrollment under Medicaid and SCHIP. \nThis reform would simplify state administrative processes, reduce \npaperwork burdens for families and the government, help increase \ninsurance coverage, and potentially reduce costs across a number of \nfederal programs.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing \nbipartisan legislation today with Senators Frist, Cantwell, Lugar, \nSantorum, Collins, Cochran, Murray, and Feinstein named the ``Covering \nKids Act of 2005.'' This legislation is intended to improve outreach \nand enrollment efforts targeted toward children and pregnant women and \nis very similar to language included in legislation I introduced in the \n107th Congress entitled the ``Children's Health Coverage Improvement \nAct'' and earlier this year with Senator Lugar entitled ``Children's \nExpress Lane to Health Coverage Act.''\n  The legislation provides $100 million in grants over the next two \nyears to community and faith-based organizations, safety net \norganizations such as community health centers, disproportionate share \nhospitals, tribal providers or organizations, schools, or State or \nlocal governments for the purposes of conducting innovative outreach \nand enrollment efforts.\n  The bill includes language from legislation introduced by Senator \nLugar and me that would promote what is called ``Express Lane \nEligibility.'' This approach uses two strategies to find and enroll \neligible but uninsured children by: 1. targeting large numbers of \neligible children in other public benefit programs like school lunch \nand food stamps; 2. expediting their enrollment in health coverage by \nusing income-eligibility information already submitted by parents when \nthey enrolled their children in these other public programs.\n  In combination, these two common-sense ideas could have a dramatic \nimpact on reducing the uninsured rate among our Nation's children, \nwhich we must do.\n  According to the American College of Physicians, uninsured children, \nwhen compared to insured children, are: up to 6 times more likely to \nhave gone without needed medical, dental, or other health care; 2 times \nmore likely to have gone without a physician visit during the previous \nyear; up to 4 times more likely to have delayed seeking medical care; \nup to 10 times less likely to have a regular source of medical care; \n1.7 times less likely to receive medical treatment for asthma; and, up \nto 30 percent less likely to receive medical attention for any injury.\n  Another study estimated that the 15 percent rise in the number of \nchildren eligible for Medicaid between 1984 and 1992 decreased child \nmortality by 5 percent. I would add that the expansion period occurred \nduring the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations with strong \nDemocratic congressional support, so this is clearly a bipartisan issue \nthat deserves further bipartisan action once again.\n  In fact, during the last presidential campaign, President Bush made \nvery few promises when it came to reducing the number of uninsured in \nthis country. However, he did make the promise to reduce the number of \nuninsured by conducting additional efforts in outreach and enrollment. \nAs he said in a speech in Pennsylvania on October 21, 2004, ``We'll \nkeep our commitment to America's children by helping them get a healthy \nstart in life. I'll work with governors and community leaders and \nreligious leaders to make sure every eligible child is enrolled in our \ngovernment's low-income health insurance program. We will not allow a \nlack of attention, or information, to stand between millions of \nchildren and the health care they need.''\n  I agree and hope that with the support of the Administration and the \nMajority Leader in his introduction of this bipartisan legislation \ntoday that we can secure passage of it this year.\n  Despite the passage of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, \nor SCHIP, which has, in combination with Medicaid, caused a reduction \nin the rate of uninsured children in recent years, it is estimated that \n5-6 million of the remaining 9.2 million uninsured children are \neligible for but unenrolled in either Medicaid or SCHIP. In New Mexico, \nthere are an estimated 80,000,\n\n[[Page S5305]]\n\nor 15.2 percent, of the children in my State without health insurance \ndespite the fact that Medicaid and SCHIP cover children all the way up \nto 235 percent of the poverty level.\n  Thus, ineligibility for coverage is no longer a barrier for the vast \nmajority of uninsured children. As the Urban Institute has said, ``A \nmajor challenge today is how to reach and enroll the millions of \nchildren who are eligible but who remain uninsured.''\n  The biggest problems are knowledge gaps, confusion about program \nrules, and problems created by bureaucratic barriers to coverage. The \nState of California has taken some important strides to eliminate some \nof these barriers through what they call their Express Lane \nEligibility, or ELE, initiative, which allowed the sharing of income-\neligibility information across public programs. Unfortunately, Down \nHorner, Beth Marrow, and Wendy Lazarus of the Children's Partnership in \nCalifornia found in their report entitled ``Building an On-Ramp to \nChildren's Health Coverage: A Report on California's Express Lane \nEligibility Program\": ``A clear lesson from California's experience is \nthat there is only so far a state can go in putting an ELE system in \nplace. In the end, existing Federal rules tend to thwart efforts to \ncreate a truly efficient process. In California, instead of allowing \nMedi-Cal to use a school lunch program's income determination, both \nschool lunch and Medi-Cal have to recount a family's income based on \ntheir own rules.''\n  If we can engage in innovative enrollment and outreach activities and \npromote ELE types of activities in the states, it clearly could have a \nprofound impact on reducing the uninsured rate among our nation's \nchildren.\n  I would like to express my thanks to the Majority Leader and his \nstaff for working through a number of issues with me prior to the \nintroduction of this legislation. I think the bill is stronger, as a \nresult, and look forward to working with him on trying to get the bill \nenacted in this Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 1051. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize \nand extend certain programs to provide coordinated services and \nresearch with respect to children and families with HIV/AIDS; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Children and \nFamily HIV/AIDS Research and Care Act of 2005. This bipartisan \nlegislation is similar to a bill that was introduced last year. This \nlegislation will address the special needs of children and youth with \nHIV/AIDS--needs that are too often overlooked, both domestically and \ninternationally. It recognizes the, simple fact that when it comes to \nHIV prevention, research, care, and treatment, children and youth are \nnot just small adults. To give them a chance for a healthy future, we \nmust ensure that their unique needs are met. I want to thank my good \nfriend Senator Bond of Missouri for joining me in introducing this \nimportant legislation. I am very pleased to work with him to move this \nbill forward.\n  Children's growing bodies are especially susceptible to the rapid \nadvancement of HIV infection. Because their immune systems are still \nimmature, the disease typically progresses more rapidly and differently \nin children than in adults. For example, children with HIV infection \nare more prone to neurological abnormalities and certain opportunistic \ninfections than adults. In addition, because children's bodies are \ngrowing and developing, HIV/AIDS can have profound effects on \nchildren's physical growth and ability to reach developmental \nmilestones such as crawling, walking and learning to talk.\n  While research has definitively shown that initiating drug treatment \nin children in a timely manner promotes normal growth and development, \nand prolongs life, treating children with HIV/AIDS presents particular \nchallenges. Appropriately formulated and dosed HIV/AIDS drugs are \nurgently needed to ensure that children receive optimal care. \nCurrently, liquid formulations that young children can swallow are not \nalways readily available. In addition, pediatric dosing and safety \ninformation for these powerful drugs is often lacking, particularly for \nyounger children. This lack of information puts children at risk; too \nmuch medication can be toxic and too little will not effectively \nsuppress the virus. Over time, under-dosing can lead to drug \nresistance, a particularly serious concern for children who will need \nto use these medications for years, if not decades.\n  Appropriate HIV/AIDS care and treatment for children and youth also \nrequires that special attention be paid to their social development \nneeds. Children and youth have unique concerns regarding disclosure and \nstigma that may be exacerbated by frequent absences from school and \nsocial activities, and the onset of sexual maturity. Working with \nschools and other social and community institutions is imperative to \npromoting a sense of normalcy. Because children are not typically \nmedical decision-makers, developing long-term care partnerships with \nparents and other caregivers is also crucial to successful care and \ntreatment. At the same time, maximizing each child's own ability to \ntake active participation in different aspects of his or her own care \ncan increase a child's sense of ownership over treatment, improving \nadherence and overall health.\n  By reauthorizing and expanding Title IV of the Ryan White CARE Act \nthis legislation will help to ensure that the unique care and treatment \nneeds of children are addressed. This program is a lifeline for more \nthan 53,000 women, children, and youth affected by HIV/AIDS served \nannually by Title IV-funded projects. Through 91 grants in 35 states, \nthe District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, Title IV \nprojects provide medical care, case management, support services, \nmental health, transportation, child care, and other crucial services \nto families affected by HIV/AIDS. Title IV is the smallest of the four \nmain titles of the Ryan White CARE Act, yet reaches the highest \nproportion of minorities.\n  Key to the success of Title IV projects is the model of ``family-\ncentered care.'' This model of care treats the whole family as the \nclient, whether several family members are infected by HIV, or just a \nparent or child. The family-centered care model is crucial to \ndeveloping strong partnerships between consumers and providers, leading \nto better health outcomes for women, children, and youth. By allowing \naffected family members to receive services, as well as the infected \nindividuals, Title IV projects promote health at the family level, \nthereby prolonging life, improving quality of life, and saving money by \nkeeping people out of the hospital.\n  I would like to take a moment to recognize the work done by the \nChildren, Youth and Family AIDS Network of Connecticut, which provides \nTitle IV services to more than 500 children, youth, women, and families \naffected by HIV/AIDS in my home state. Just earlier today, I had an \nopportunity to meet with some of these individuals. They made it clear \njust how important these services are to their quality of life.\n  While recommitting the Health Resources and Services Administration \n(HRSA) to family-centered care and the unique work of Title IV, this \nlegislation will also expand the innovative strategies Title IV \nprojects have used to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission. Since \n1994, when the administration of preventive drug interventions was \nshown to significantly reduce perinatal HIV transmission, the number of \nnewborns infected with HIV has decreased dramatically. Yet mother-to-\nchildren transmission does continue to occur, largely due to missed \nopportunities for identifying HIV-positive pregnant women and providing \nthe supportive services needed to ensure adherence to recommended \ntreatment regimens. We propose to fund demonstration grants to assess \nthe effectiveness of two strategies in reducing mother-to-children \ntransmission: (1) increasing routine, voluntary HIV testing of pregnant \nwomen and (2) increasing access to prenatal care, intensive case \nmanagement, and supportive services for HIV-positive pregnant women.\n  In addition, this bill will encourage research into key care and \ntreatment questions affecting the pediatric populations. These include: \nthe long-term health effects of preventive drug regimens on HIV-exposed \nchildren; the\n\n[[Page S5306]]\n\nlong-term health, psycho-social, and prevention needs for children and \nadolescents perinatally HIV-infected; the transition to adulthood for \nHIV-infected children; and safer and more effective treatment options \nfor infants, children, and adolescents with HIV disease.\n  Since history suggests that a vaccine may prove to be the most \neffective, affordable, long-term approach to stopping the spread of \nHIV, this legislation will also ensure that children are not an \nafterthought when it comes to the development of an HIV vaccine. \nCurrently, some of the populations hardest hit by the pandemic--infants \nand youth--are at risk of being left behind in the search for an \neffective vaccine. Because we cannot assume that a vaccine tested in \nadults will also be safe and effective when used in pediatric \npopulations, it will be important to ensure that promising vaccines are \ntested in infants and youth as early as is medically and ethically \nappropriate. Failure to begin planning for the inclusion of these \ngroups in clinical trials could mean significant delays in the \navailability of a pediatric HIV vaccine, at the cost of countless \nthousands of lives. This legislation will ensure that we begin now to \naddress the logistical, regulatory, medical, and ethical issues \npresented by pediatric testing of HIV vaccines so that children can \nshare in the benefits of any advances in vaccines research.\n  I want to thank several organizations for lending their expertise to \nthe development of this legislation, in particular the Elizabeth Glaser \nPediatric AIDS Foundation, the AIDS Alliance for Children, Youth and \nFamilies, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, all of whom endorse \nthis bill.\n  HIV/AIDS is the single greatest health care catastrophe facing the \nworld today. We need to do much more to seek effective treatments and, \neventually, a cure for this horrible illness. This legislation is by no \nmeans sufficient to reach that goal, but it is a step towards ensuring \nthat children are not left behind as we make progress, and then when we \ndo finally eradicate HIV/AIDS once and for all, children and youth are \nable to benefit immediately. I urge all of my colleagues to join us in \nsupport of this legislation.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, currently, more than 3,700 children and \nyouth under the age of 13 are living with HIV or AIDS in the United \nStates and of the more than 40,000 Americans newly infected with HIV \neach year, half are young people under the age of 25 years old. When we \nthink about this devastating virus we do not often associate it with \nchildren, especially infants or newborn babies, but the fact is this \ndisease does not discriminate on the basis of age. It affects children \nin very specific and very different ways than adults.\n  For instance, the medical experience of children with HIV/AIDS can \ndiffer significantly from that of adults. Because children's immune \nsystems are still immature, the disease typically progresses more \nrapidly in children than in adults and can have different \nmanifestations. For example, the majorities of children with HIV have \nneurological abnormalities and are more susceptible to certain \nopportunistic infections than adults. In addition, because children's \nbodies are growing and developing, HIV/AIDS can have profound effects \non children's physical growth and ability to reach developmental \nmilestones such as crawling, walking and learning to walk.\n  Medication for young children living with HIV/AIDS can also be very \ndifferent than that of an adult living with HIV/AIDS. For example, \nchildren of certain ages cannot swallow pills and require liquid \nformulations of life-saving HIV/AIDS drugs that are not always readily \navailable. In addition, dosing and safety information for these \npowerful drugs are often strikingly different for children and adults, \nand for younger children, this information is typically completely \nmissing. This lack of information puts children at risk by requiring \nhealth care providers to estimate correct dosing. Too much medication \ncan be toxic, and too little will not effectively suppress the virus. \nOver time, underdosing can lead to drug resistance.\n  Children are not just small adults and their growing bodies are \nespecially susceptible to the rapid advancement of HIV infection. Early \nawareness that a child has HIV infection, combined with good care and \nsupport, can enhance survival and quality of life, which is why I am \nintroducing, with my colleague Senator Dodd, The Children and Family \nHIV/AIDS Research and Care Act.\n  This legislation will address those needs of children and adolescents \nliving with HIV/AIDS by reauthorizing Title IV of the Ryan White CARE \nAct and expanding its focus on reaching and caring for adolescents with \nHIV/AIDS. Moreover, this legislation will continue to work to reduce \nmother-to-child transmission of HIV, by promoting routine, voluntary \nprenatal HIV testing and intensive care management for HIV-positive \npregnant women. In addition, because children are at risk of being left \nbehind in the search for an effective HIV vaccine, the bill will \nrequire federal agencies funding and regulating HIV vaccine research to \ndevelop plans and guidelines for including pediatric populations in \nclinical trials as quickly as is medically and ethically appropriate. \nThis legislation will also encourage research on key remaining \npediatric research questions, including how to provide safer and more \neffective treatment options for children with HIV/AIDS.\n  For a young person living with HIV or AIDS there is no cure and there \nis no remission. It is with them at home, on the playground, in the \nclassroom, and at a Friday night sleepover. It will be with them as \nthey enter high school, go to college and get their first job. For a \nperson born with this virus it is a permanent part of their life. This \nbill will help to ensure that the needs of infants, children, and \nadolescents living with HIV/AIDS are not overlooked.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \n        Dorgan, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Lautenberg, \n        Mr. Pryor, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 1052. A bill to improve transportation security, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend, \nSenator Inouye, Co-Chairman of the Commerce Committee, and several of \nour colleagues, today in introducing the ``Transportation Security \nImprovement Act of 2005.'' The Commerce Committee is committed to \nfulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the security \nof all major modes of transportation.\n  It has been four years since Congress enacted landmark aviation and \nmaritime transportation security laws after the September 11 attacks. \nWe must remain diligent in carrying out our responsibility to secure \nthe Nation's domestic transportation system so as to ensure consumer \ntrust and the uninterrupted flow of commerce. Recent reorganizations \nand budgetary decisions affecting the Transportation Security \nAdministration (TSA) have effectively marginalized maritime and surface \ntransportation security, suggested re-privatization of aviation \nsecurity, and offered inadequate funding for the security of all modes.\n  The bill that we introduce today recognizes transportation security \nas a national security function and an economic necessity. The \nlegislation would address security vulnerabilities that exist within \nour aviation, maritime, rail, and surface transportation systems. More \nspecifically, the bill would, among other things: make notable changes \nto aviation security policy, including prohibiting the Administration \nfrom increasing passenger fees without the approval of Congress; \neliminate the existing cap of 45,000 full time equivalent aviation \nsecurity screening employees; enhance maritime cargo security by \nimproving the examination of shipments before they reach U.S. shores; \nrequire TSA to conduct a railroad sector threat assessment and submit \nprioritized recommended solutions for improving rail security; make \nimprovements to bus and motor carrier security by subjecting foreign \ncommercial drivers transporting hazardous materials into the U.S. to \nsubmit to security background checks; and encourage the deployment of \nrail car tracking equipment for high-hazard materials rail shipments.\n  This is an important first step toward bolstering our nation's \nsecurity with respect to transportation and I\n\n[[Page S5307]]\n\nlook forward to working with Senator Inouye, as well as the Department \nof Homeland Security, DOT, and private industry, on this legislation in \ncommittee and on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise as a leading co-sponsor of the \nTransportation Security Improvement Act of 2005 introduced today by my \ncolleague and Chairman, Ted Stevens, along with Senators Jay \nRockefeller, Olympia Snowe, Frank Lautenberg, Byron Dorgan, Barbara \nBoxer, Maria Cantwell, Mark Pryor, Hillary Clinton, and Chuck Schumer.\n  Nearly 4 years after the enactment of landmark aviation and maritime \nsecurity laws, it is time to build upon that foundation, make needed \nimprovements and enhancements to our transportation security efforts \nacross all modes, and reestablish the requisite funding levels. Most \nimportantly, we must restore the sense of urgency that is essential if \nwe are to keep our transportation systems, and our economy, strong, \nvibrant, and secure. We have worked hard to develop this legislation, \nand we will continue to improve it with the assistance of committee \nmembers and the Department of Homeland Security as we move forward \nthrough the legislative process.\n  Over the past 3\\1/2\\ years, the administration and Congress have \nslowly lost the sense of immediacy that once allowed us to recognize \nthat transportation security is a matter of national security. The \nadministration's budget and priorities indicate that they are \noverlooking glaring security vulnerabilities, disregarding the \ncontinuing threats and risks that are reported almost daily, and \nunderestimating the economic consequences that would undoubtedly result \nfrom another attack on our transportation systems. I am hopeful that \nthe new leadership will reinvigorate transportation security.\n  The economic importance of those systems can hardly be overstated: 95 \npercent of the Nation's cargo comes through the ports; our rail system \nand our motor carriers move all of those goods from our coasts and \nborders throughout the interior U.S. to retail outlets and \nmanufacturers that rely on on-time delivery; our aviation system \ncarried 629.7 million domestic passengers during 2004 and averaged 1.5 \nmillion enplanements per day in January this year; approximately 24 \nmillion passengers ride Amtrak annually, and there are nearly 3.4 \nbillion passenger and commuter rail trips in this country each year. \nThe loss of our aviation system for just 4 days after the September \n11th attacks sent shockwaves through the economy that are still being \nfelt today. The al Qaida attack on the passenger trains in Madrid, \nSpain, killing nearly 200 people and injuring 1,800, unfortunately \nproved that railroads are vulnerable targets for terrorists. If there \nis an incident at any one seaport, the whole system for moving cargo \ninto and out of the country would screech to a halt, as we scramble to \nensure security at other ports. In addition to the horrible loss of \nlife, the resulting economic damage would be widespread, catastrophic \nand possibly irreversible. We cannot afford to risk this kind of damage \ndue to a lack of preparedness and forethought.\n  The terrorists that seek to do us harm are cunning, dynamic, and most \nof all, patient. While they have not successfully struck our homeland \nsince September 11, 2001, it does not mean that they are not preparing \nto do so. They work 24 hours a day, studying what we do and how we do \nit. It is imperative that we stay ahead of them. That means we must \nconstantly anticipate, innovate, and plan. We must continually research \nand implement the most effective technologies. We must recruit, train \nand deploy the most skilled security force. Simply put, our entire \neconomy relies on a well-functioning, secure, transportation system. It \nis in our greatest economic interest to ensure that this system, and \nthe passengers and cargo that use it, are well protected. And, in \nkeeping with transportation security's impact on the nation's physical \nand economic security, it is the responsibility of the federal \ngovernment to properly finance that protection.\n  Following passage of our new aviation security laws, the \nTransportation Security Administration, TSA, was assembled quickly, \npresented with an enormous task, and expected to produce immediate \nresults. It has performed admirably, despite the administration's near-\nconstant reorganization of the agency with little to no input from \nCongress. While we take seriously recent reports about financial \nmismanagement and the limits of the human capacity to detect security \nbreaches, we cannot and must not use these inadequacies as \njustification to cast aside the critical work of this agency. There are \nsome in Congress that have never been comfortable with the new Federal \nrole in transportation security, and they look to every negative report \nto help usher in a return to private security screening companies. We \ncontend, however, that transportation security must not be judged only \nby the bottom-line commercial pressures of the private sector. \nTransportation security is a unique national security function and an \neconomic necessity, and like our national defense, it must remain a \nprimary responsibility of the federal government.\n  The need for Congressional action to secure all forms of \ntransportation infrastructure across the country remains essential, and \nI, along with many of my colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee, \nhave expressed great reservations about the direction our Nation is now \nheaded on matters of transportation security.\n  As I noted during the Senate's consideration of the nomination of \nMichael Chertoff to be the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, the administration's budget demonstrates the lost sense of \nurgency. It shifts critical work away from the TSA. It erodes the \nAgency's limited focus and accountability. It undermines the \neffectiveness of our maritime and land security efforts. It underfunds \nefforts across all modes, but particularly port and rail.\n  The legislation we are introducing today renews the importance and \ncommitment transportation security deserves. It identifies the \nnumerous, lingering shortcomings that currently exist, re-dedicates our \nefforts on maritime and surface transportation security, and provides \nthe guidance necessary to adequately defend the nation's \ninfrastructure.\n  The TSA should not focus almost exclusively on aviation, nor should \nit be transformed into a glorified, security screener training and \nplacement agency. The TSA is essential, and it possesses critical \nexpertise that must be cultivated and put to proper use. We believe \nthat the TSA, as outlined by our bill, can and will be the difference \nbetween a flourishing economy fueled by smooth-running \ntransportation systems and an economy crippled by transportation \nsystems that could fall victim to terrorist attacks.\n\n  As such, the Transportation Security Improvement Act of 2005 will \nauthorize the TSA for the next 3 fiscal years and re-dedicate the \nagency to its mission of providing specialized security for all modes \nof transportation. It provides further direction to the agency's cargo \nsecurity functions, strengthens aviation, maritime, rail, hazardous \nmaterials, and pipeline security efforts, and enhances interagency \ncooperation. While the proposal incorporates several Commerce Committee \nand Senate-passed bills or initiatives from the prior Congress, it also \nputs forth new ideas to enhance transportation security across all \nmodes.\n  We recognize that Secretary Chertoff has had only a short time to \nmake changes and that his comprehensive review is pending. Our \nlegislation provides the flexibility necessary to address his findings \nand prerogatives. However, it is incumbent upon Congress to provide \nguidance and clarify the expectations.\n  On the matter of port security, our legislation seeks to improve \ninteragency cooperation with the further development of joint operation \ncommand centers. It clarifies the roles and responsibilities for cargo \nsecurity programs, while establishing criteria for contingency response \nplans to resume the flow of commerce in the event of a seaport attack. \nBy setting a minimum floor for research and development funding related \nto maritime and land security, the bill further encourages the \ndevelopment of effective technologies that detect terrorist threats. \nConversely, the administration has\n\n[[Page S5308]]\n\ncontinued to consolidate critical infrastructure grant programs, which \nwe believe will effectively decrease funding for port security and \neliminate the appropriate expertise necessary to review grant proposals \nand distribute the funds accordingly.\n  In addressing aviation security, we continue to be concerned that \ncurrent budget proposals diminish the TSA's authority and squander its \nexpertise. Airport directors are still struggling to receive the \ntechnological and capital improvements that would increase the \nefficiency and effectiveness of the current security system and lower \ncosts considerably. Instead of addressing these shortcomings with \naggressive support, the administration has chosen to place a greater \nburden on the airlines through increased security fees at the same \nmoment that the carriers are facing the most difficult financial period \nin their history. Not only has the industry lost more than $30 billion \ncumulatively since 2000, the Federal government has had to bail out the \ncarriers twice. Increasing the carriers' financial burden is ill \nconceived and counterproductive.\n  Quietly but consistently, we also hear of some of our colleagues' \ndesire to return to the same privatized security apparatus that proved \ndisastrously inadequate on September 11, 2001. These efforts are short-\nsighted, defy our experience, and will reverse much of the progress we \nhave made since September 11. Those seeking to return to the old \nsystem, at times, claim that the system is no better than pre-September \n11. We all know that is not the case. We also know that with new \ntechnology, we can improve screener performance. There is no doubt that \nhuman factors limit the capabilities of screeners, but as we fund and \ndeploy new equipment, the security system will continue to improve. Our \nbill seeks to enhance the current screener workforce by directing a \nmore appropriate use of the TSA's resources and through improved \ntraining. It would also stimulate efforts to streamline and improve \ncollections of existing airline and passenger security fees to promote \na more efficient and healthy aviation industry.\n  On rail security, our legislation will incorporate an updated version \nof the Rail Security Act of 2004, which the Senate passed by unanimous \nconsent last year. It features new efforts to ensure the security of \nhazardous materials that are shipped by rail and improves security \ntraining and awareness for our railroad workers and the public. The \ntragic events in Madrid, Spain, demonstrated to all of us the clear \nthreats to our rail system. We have already been warned publicly twice \nby the FBI that al Qaida may be directly targeting U.S. passenger \ntrains and that their operatives may try to destroy key rail bridges \nand sections of track to cause derailments. The rail threat assessment \nrequired by our legislation and the grant programs and other measures \ndesigned to respond to those threats will strengthen our ability to \naddress them. Until we pass a rail security package, this body is \nfailing its responsibility to try to secure our national transportation \nsystem. We owe it to the American people to strengthen the security of \nour passenger and freight railroads.\n  To address the security needs of our other surface transportation \nmodes, the proposal will include funding to improve intercity bus \nsecurity, strengthen hazardous material transportation security \nefforts, establish new security guidelines for truck rental and leasing \noperations, and develop pipeline security incident recovery plans. Such \naction is long overdue as the administration has consistently failed to \ndevelop dedicated programs, much less financial support, for rail and \nother surface transportation security efforts.\n  We have reached a critical juncture for transportation security in \nthe United States and the steps that we take in the coming months will \nimpact our safety, security and one of our most essential freedoms--\nmovement--for years to come. We must commit ourselves to ensuring that \nour transportation security remains a priority and is as strong and \neffective as possible. I believe the Transportation Security \nImprovement Act of 2005 will continue to move us in that direction.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is my honor today to join the \ndistinguished cochairmen of the Senate Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee, Senators Ted Stevens and Daniel Inouye, along \nwith our colleagues Senators Byron Dorgan, Frank Lautenberg, Mark \nPryor, Barbara Boxer, Maria Cantwell, Hillary Clinton, and Chuck \nSchumer, to introduce the Transportation Security Improvements Act of \n2005. This is a vitally important contribution to the security of all \nAmericans, and I commend it to my colleagues for their consideration.\n  The Transportation Security Improvements Act will increase \nauthorizations for the Transportation Security Administration, TSA, by \nmore than $19 billion through fiscal year 2008, and will forthrightly \naddress continuing vulnerabilities in the security of our various \ntransportation modes that Congress and the administration have as yet \nvirtually ignored.\n  Americans were shocked to learn just how lax our aviation security \nwas on September 11. Even those terrorists on official Government watch \nlists, who should have been barred from entering the United States, \nwere able to board planes that they then turned into weapons without \nany significant interference from airport security staffs. As a wounded \nNation tried to overcome the horrors of that day, Congress immediately \nwent about fixing what was so obviously wrong with our aviation \nsecurity.\n  Now, as we approach the fourth anniversary of that fateful day, \nAmericans are regaining their confidence about aviation security. There \nis still work to be done, and my colleagues and I endeavor in this bill \nto further secure air travel. Still, we have done much to improve \ndomestic aviation security by improving the security procedures we \ndemand of airlines and airport personnel both here and abroad. We need \nto remain vigilant and avoid the inexcusable error of believing we have \ndone all that needs to be done. We must act with the knowledge that our \nenemies will continue to probe the system they so successfully breached \nin 2001 to find new and additional opportunities to kill and terrorize \nAmericans.\n  What my colleagues and I also have realized for some time is that in \ndevoting our energy and resources to aviation security we have been, in \na manner of speaking, ``fighting the last war.'' While the aviation \nsector is prepared for today's threats, congressional action regarding \nthe level of security of our other transportation modes is not much \nchanged from the blissfully naive standards of September 10.\n  To be fair, industries in the other transportation modes have worked \nhard to improve the security of their respective sectors. The \nrelatively little money Congress and the administration have dedicated \nto improving transportation security has been put to good use. Industry \nand Government working together, even given the overwhelming scope of \nthe threat, have improved transportation security and protected the \nlives and property of Americans. We just have not done enough.\n  The Transportation Security Improvements Act seeks to make overdue \nimprovements to the overall security of this Nation's vast \ntransportation infrastructure. Our bill addresses the security \npractices and requirements of our Nation's freight and passenger rail \nnetwork, as well as those of our ocean-going and inland ports, the \ntrucking industry, intercity buses, and the special risks of hazardous \nmaterials transportation, regardless of the mode of transportation. It \nmakes the TSA responsible for coordinating international and domestic \ncargo security. It calls on TSA to work cooperatively with stakeholders \nin the various transportation modes on preparedness and incident \nresponse, and establishes new maritime and land security command \nprocedures. Perhaps most importantly, we acknowledge the need of TSA \nmanagement to deploy such human resources as it sees fit to protect \nAmericans' lives and property, and it removes the current statutory cap \non the agency of 45,000 full-time employees.\n  To continue the TSA's efforts to improve aviation security, our bill \nauthorizes $15.75 billion over the next 3 fiscal years to fully fund \nkey security programs to defend our Nation's air transportation system. \nIn lieu of recent reports regarding the performance of the airport \nscreening workforce, our bill could not be more timely. We have\n\n[[Page S5309]]\n\nincluded provisions to provide TSA greater flexibility in meeting the \nstaffing needs of screening checkpoints through elimination of an \narbitrary staffing cap that was put in place shortly after the agency \nwas created, while also requiring TSA to review the adequacy of \nrecurrent training for these employees. With the difficult economic \nenvironment currently faced by the airline industry, the bill takes \nsteps to relieve the carriers of some of the burden that they face \nthrough collection of these fees. We would prohibit increasing aviation \nsecurity fees without Congressional review and approval, while \nrequiring TSA to consider alternative means of collecting such fees. \nFinally, the bill prohibits the certification of any foreign repair \nstations until TSA and FAA strengthen the oversight of such facilities \nby reviewing, auditing and developing regulations to ensure an adequate \nlevel of safety and security.\n  To dramatically improve maritime and land security, we increase \nfunding by $1.099 billion to develop and implement cargo screening and \ninspection standards, with special attention given to high-risk \ncargoes. We authorize 10 additional Joint Operation Command Centers to \nsupplement the current positive interagency and public-private \ncooperation at our ports. We streamline procedures for foreign vessels \nand those with Coast Guard-certified security plans, require funding \nfor port security technology improvements, and impose a January 2006 \ndeadline for development of a comprehensive Transportation Worker \nIdentification Credentialing Program.\n  We assist our railroads and hazardous materials shippers in \nmaintaining and improving security along the Nation's nearly 150,000 \nmiles of freight and passenger rail infrastructure. We increase rail \nsecurity funding by nearly $800 million over 3 years, and with those \nfunds require the TSA to conduct a comprehensive security threat \nassessment that I first advocated in October 2001. We authorize grants \nto Amtrak and our freight railroads for overall security improvements, \nand establish a revamped security training program for railroad \nemployees. Our legislation would allow Amtrak to make specific and \nlong-overdue security improvements along its well-traveled Northeast \ncorridor, and it authorizes development of baggage, passenger, and \ncargo screening programs, as well as reviews of procedures used by \nforeign railroads and research into additional improvements.\n  We seek in this legislation to improve the security of the highway \nsystem that is the envy of the world. Our bill makes it a priority to \nbetter protect and address the unique security vulnerabilities of \nintercity buses and their passengers. This is a topic first brought to \nthe attention of Congress by our former colleague Max Cleland, and \nwhich I hope we can now see enacted into law as a rightful part of his \nlegacy of service to this country. We further seek to improve highway \nsecurity by imposing the same level of background checks on foreign \ndrivers transporting hazardous materials as we already require of \nAmerican drivers. We require vehicles carrying hazardous materials to \nbe equipped with wireless communications equipment, and that their \ndrivers have established plans for the use of alternate routes. We \nprovide funding for the TSA to conduct security inspections of our \npipeline network, to develop a pipeline incident response plan, and to \nanalyze the security plans in place for hazmat carriers. We create a \npublic sector response center, and provide for the distribution of \nemergency wireless communications equipment to first responders, hazmat \ncarriers, and TSA personnel.\n  Our constituents have sent us here, first and foremost, to protect \nthem. The ruthless attacks of September 11, 2001, exposed inexcusable \ngaps in our efforts in that regard. At a time when the air in this city \nis acrid with accusation and acrimony, I ask my colleagues to consider \nthis legislation a priority for quick passage, and an example of the \ngood work this institution can do when we remember why Americans \nelected us. I ask my colleagues to join us in this effort, and I ask \nthe majority leader to find time on the Senate Calendar for its \nexpeditious consideration by the full Senate.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1052\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to specify the purposes for which funds provided under part A \nof title I may be used; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I rise today with Senator Ensign to \nintroduce a bill to ensure that Title I funds are directed towards \ninstructional services to teach our neediest students.\n  Title I provides assistance to virtually every school district in the \ncountry to serve children attending schools with high concentrations of \nlow-income students, from preschool to high school.\n  It has been the ``anchor'' of Federal assistance to schools, since \nits inception in 1965. Although it has always\n\n[[Page S5324]]\n\nbeen the intent of Congress for Title I funds to be used for \ninstruction and instructional services, the Federal Government has \nnever provided a clear definition of what instructional services should \nentail.\n  This lack of federal guidance has become especially clear now, as \nStates scramble to comply with the Title I accountability standards \nestablished in ``No Child Left Behind.''\n  While State Administrators of Title I are directed by law to meet \nthese specific requirements, they have been given little guidance as to \nhow to ensure that they are in compliance with the law.\n  I believe that the Federal Government is responsible for making this \nprocess as clear to States as possible.\n  In my view, as it relates to Title I, we have not lived up to our end \nof the bargain.\n  During consideration of ``No Child Left Behind,'' I worked hard to \nget my bill defining appropriate Title I uses included in the Senate \nversion of the bill.\n  Unfortunately, during conference consideration, my bill was stripped \nout and in its place language directing the General Accounting Office \n(GAO) to report on how states use their Title I funds was inserted.\n  In April 2003, GAO released the report that Congress directed them to \nsubmit on Title I Administrative Expenditures.\n  What GAO found is that while districts spent a relatively small \namount, no more than 13 percent, of Title I funds on administrative \nservices, these findings were based on their own definition ``because \nthere is no common definition on what constitutes administrative \nexpenditures.''\n  Therefore, the accounting office could not precisely measure how much \nof schools' Title I funds were used for administration.\n  Because Title I funds are not defined consistently throughout the \nstates, the accounting office created their own definition by compiling \naspects of state priorities to complete the report.\n  You see, the very reason I worked to define how Title I funds should \nbe used--to create consistency and distribution priority nationwide--\nbecame the definitive aspect preventing GAO from effectively drawing \nconclusions to their report.\n  The report highlights two concerns that I have with the absence of \nuniversal definitions in the Title I program: the lack of Federal \nguidance on effective uses of Title I funds. The government's inability \nto accurately measure whether the academic needs of low-income students \nare being met.\n  My bill takes some strong steps by balancing the needs for states to \nretain Title I flexibility and providing them with the guidance needed \nto administer the program uniformly throughout the country.\n  Current law on Title I is much too vague.\n  It says, ``a State or local educational agency shall use funds \nreceived under this part only to supplement the amount of funds that \nwould, in the absence of such Federal funds, be made available from \nnon-Federal sources for the education of pupils participating in \nprograms assisted under this part, and not to supplant such funds.''\n  Basically, it says that Title I funds are to be used for the \n``education of pupils.'' This is too nebulous.\n  The U.S. Department of Education has given states a guidance document \nthat explains how Title I funds can be used.\n  Under this guidance document, only two uses are specifically \nprohibited: 1. construction or acquisition of real property; and 2. \npayment to parents to attend a meeting or training session or to \nreimburse a parent for a salary lost due to attendance at a ``parental \ninvolvement'' meeting.\n  I believe we should give the Department, states and districts a \nclearer guidance in law.\n  This legislation does the following: defines Title I direct and \nindirect instructional services. Sets a standard for the amount of \nTitle I funds that can be used to achieve the academic and \nadministrative objectives of this program. Ensures that the majority of \nTitle I funds are used to improve academic achievement by stipulating \nthat a local educational agency may use not more than 10 percent of \nTitle I funds received for indirect instructional services.\n  By limiting the amount of funds that schools can spend on \nadministrative or indirect services, school districts are restricted \nfrom shuffling the majority of Title I to pay for non-academic \nservices, but it also gives the districts flexibility to use the \nremaining funds for the indirect costs administering Title I \ndistribution.\n  Furthermore, by defining direct and indirect services, all states can \napply the same standards for how Title I funds are used nationwide.\n  Examples of permissible Direct Services are: employing teachers and \nother instructional personnel, including employee benefits. Intervening \nand taking corrective actions to improve student achievement. Extending \nacademic instruction beyond the normal school day and year, including \nsummer school. Providing instructional services to pre-kindergarten \nchildren for the transition to kindergarten. Purchasing instructional \nresources such as books, materials, computers, and other instructional \nequipment. Professional development. Developing and administering \ncurriculum, educational materials and assessments.\n  Examples of Indirect Services limited to no more than 10 percent of \nTitle I expenditures are: business services relating to administering \nthe program. Purchasing or providing facilities maintenance, \njanitorial, gardening, or landscaping services or the payment of \nutility costs. Buying food. Paying for travel to and attendance at \nconferences or meetings, except if necessary for professional \ndevelopment.\n  My reasons for introducing this bill are two-fold: First, I believe \nthat states must use their limited federal dollars for the fundamental \npurpose of providing academic instruction to help students learn.\n  Secondly, I believe that it is nearly impossible to do so without \nproviding a clear definition of what is considered an instructional \nservice.\n  I am not suggesting that it is the fault of the school districts for \nnot focusing their Title I funds on academic instruction. They are \nsimply exercising the flexibility that Congress has given them.\n  If Congress also intended for those funds to educate our neediest \nchildren, Federal guidance must be given to ensure that it happens.\n  It is my view that Title I cannot do everything. Federal funding is \nonly 8 percent of the total funding for elementary and secondary \neducation and Title I is even a smaller percentage of total support for \npublic schools.\n  That is why it is imperative to better focus Title I funds on \nacademic instruction, teaching the fundamentals and helping \ndisadvantaged children achieve.\n  Schools must focus their general administrative budget to pay for \nexpenses that fall outside of the realm of direct educational services \nand retain the majority of Federal funds to improve academic \nachievement.\n  It is time to better direct Title I funds to the true goal of \neducation: to help students learn. This is one step towards that \nimportant goal.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the legislation directly \nfollow this statement in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1054\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey to \nthe City of Henderson, Nevada, certain Federal land located in the \nCity, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today for myself and Senator Ensign \nto introduce the Southern Nevada Limited Transition Area Act, which \nwill enhance the ability of a rapidly growing community to diversify \nits economy, gainfully employ its residents, and achieve fiscal \nsustainability.\n  In addition to creating a vital economic center in Henderson with \nthis legislation, we hope at a future date to add another title to this \nbill that will allow Clark County to convey a small parcel of land to \nthe Nevada National Guard for no consideration so that a new armory can \nbe developed. Conversations are currently taking place at the State and \ncounty levels that may impact this conveyance, so we are awaiting more \ninformation.\n  The bill I am introducing today would convey approximately 547 acres \nof land from the Bureau of Land Management to the city of Henderson, \nNV, for development as an employment and business center.\n  The Bureau of Land Management has designated this parcel for disposal \nbecause of its urban surroundings and its isolation from other public \nland, which renders it difficult for the agency to manage.\n  The parcel is located in a rapidly growing area of the city, but is \nimpacted by aircraft noise and overflights from the nearby Henderson \nExecutive Airport, making it unsuitable for residential use.\n  Rather than shying away from this property because of the limitations \non its use, the city of Henderson has put together a forward looking \nplan that will turn the area into a bustling business center. In \naddition to productively diversifying the land use pattern in the Las \nVegas Valley, the proposed development of this land will encourage a \nbroad range of employment opportunities for the region, while also \nhelping to pay for public infrastructure in nearby residential areas.\n  The way that the land privatization would work is as follows. The \nbill would convey the land to the city by patent. The city would then \nsubdivide and sell lots at fair market value. As in previous \nconveyances of Federal land designated in the Southern Nevada Public \nLands Management Act for disposal, 85 percent of the proceeds from \nsales would return to the BLM's Special Account for a variety of \nconservation purposes in Nevada. Five percent of the proceeds would \nfund the State of Nevada's general education program. And the city of \nHenderson could use the remaining 10 percent to cover expenses \nassociated with subdividing the property and providing infrastructure.\n  Henderson is a rapidly growing city. Its leaders are dedicated to \nmaking the city a national model of logical development, diversified \nemployment, and fiscal sustainability. This bill helps establish the \nconditions needed to realize that vision.\n  This bill provides key assistance to southern Nevada by enabling the \nCity of Henderson to move forward with an important economic \ndevelopment project. This is a simple, but an important effort that \nthis body can make to further strengthen our Nation's economy. I look \nforward working with the Energy Committee and the Senate to pass this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1056\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to \nrevise and extend that Act; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President today I am pleased to introduce the Indian \nHealth Care Improvement Act Amendments of 2005 to revise and extend the \nAct.\n  Six years ago a steering committee of Tribal leaders, with extensive \nconsultation by the Indian Health Service, developed a broad consensus \nin Indian Country about what needs to be done to improve and update \nhealth services for Indian people. In the 108th Congress significant \nprogress was made in crafting a bill that was acceptable to all parties \nbut still did not pass the full Senate. In the legislation introduced \ntoday, I have tried to address concerns raised last year, but \nunderstand that there may still be some differences. I look forward to \ncontinuing discussions on these differences, but am introducing the \nbill to get the process moving because we want to get this legislation \nenacted.\n  Over the years, Indian health care delivery has greatly expanded and \ntribes are taking over more health care services on the local level. \nNearly 30 years ago, Congress enacted the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act to meet the fundamental trust obligation of the United \nStates to ensure that comprehensive health care would be provided to \nAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives. The health status of Indian people \nremains much worse than that of other Americans.\n  The Indian Health Care Improvement Act is the statutory framework for \nthe Indian health system and covers just about every aspect of health \ncare. It provides grants and scholarships to recruit Indians into \nhealth professions serving native communities and funds to expand the \nhealth care infrastructure. It lifted the prohibition against Medicare \nand Medicaid reimbursement for health services provided by the Indian \nHealth Service or the Indian tribes, and established health services \nfor Indians in urban areas.\n  Reauthorization of this Act is a high legislative priority.

I thank Chairman McCain for his leadership in introducing \nthe Indian Health Care Improvement Act Amendments of 2005. I have been \npleased to work with him in constructing this legislation. He and I are \nunited in our agreement that getting the Indian Health Care Improvement \nAct reauthorized this year is the Indian Affairs Committee's top \npriority.\n  This legislation was last reauthorized in 1992. Since 1999, the \ndirector of the Indian Health Service and his staff have worked with a \nnational steering committee of tribal leaders and representatives of \nIndian health organizations, as well as with the congressional \nauthorizing committees, on reauthorization of and amendments to the \nIndian Health Care Improvement Act.\n  The bill that we introduce today reflects many elements of these \ndiscussions and negotiations over recent years, as well as testimony \nreceived at a number of hearings held by the Senate Indian Affairs \nCommittee and House Resources Committee. It is important that we begin \nas soon as possible to receive the views of Indian Country, the \nadministration and others on this legislation.\n  I am sure that in the course of this Congress, there will be changes \nto the bill that is being proposed today. As Chairman McCain knows, I \nam committed to addressing the serious issue of teen suicide that is \nepidemic on several Indian reservations, in North Dakota and other \nareas of the country. I hope that the recommendations of Indian \nparents, students, tribal officials and health professionals may lead \nto additional provisions in the Act to deal with this very serious \nproblem.\n  I look forward to the comments of the administration, especially the \nIndian Health Services, as well as other committees of the Congress, \ntribes and tribal organizations, urban Indian entities, and others to \nhelp us craft legislation that will provide creative and effective \nsolutions to address the health care needs of American Indian and \nAlaska Native communities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. SANTORUM (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 1058. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \nliability protections for volunteer practitioners at health centers \nunder section 330 of\n\n[[Page S5366]]\n\nsuch Act; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Community \nHealth Center Volunteer Physician Protection Act of 2005 along with \nSenator Ron Wyden. Representative Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania introduced \nidentical bipartisan legislation in the House of Representatives, H.R. \n1313.\n  Community health centers offer primary and preventive health care \nservices to everyone, including low-income, underinsured and uninsured \nfamilies. Community health centers are typically located in high-need \nareas identified by the Federal Government as having elevated poverty, \nhigher than average infant mortality, and where few physicians \npractice. They tailor their services to fit the special needs and \npriorities of their communities, and offer services that help their \npatients access health care such as health education, transportation \nand home visitation.\n  While low-income individuals have access to Medicaid and the elderly \nand the disabled have access to Medicare, uninsured and underinsured \nfamilies often delay seeing a doctor or turn to emergency departments \nwhere treatment is several times more expensive.\n  Community health centers, however, provide comprehensive and \npreventive care that adjusts charges for patient care according to \nfamily income. The Federal Government spends over $23 billion a year to \noffset losses incurred by hospitals for patients unable to pay their \nbills, and the Department of Health and Human Services note that \nmedical care at community health centers cost only about $1.30 per day \nper patient served. In fact, medical care at community health centers \nis around $250 less per patient served than the average annual \nexpenditure for an office-based medical provider.\n  Community health centers offer an affordable source of quality health \ncare, but we need more of them. The President has proposed a $304 \nmillion increase for community health center programs to create 1,200 \nnew or expanded sites to serve an additional 6.1 million people by next \nyear. In order to meet that goal, the centers must double their \nworkforce by adding double the clinicians by 2006. Hiring this many \ndoctors would be costly, but encouraging more to volunteer would help \nto meet this need. While many physicians are willing to volunteer their \nservices at these centers, they often hesitate due to the high cost of \nmedical liability insurance. As a result, there are too few volunteer \nphysicians to meet our health care needs.\n  By comparison, volunteer physicians at free health clinics and paid \nphysicians at community health centers already receive comprehensive \nmedical liability coverage under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA).\n  Accordingly, the Community Health Center Volunteer Physician \nProtection Act of 2005 would extend the medical liability protections \nof FTCA to volunteer physicians at community health centers. These \nprotections are necessary to ensure that the centers can continue to \nplay an important role in lowering our Nation's health care costs and \nmeeting the needs for affordable and access quality health care. The \nCommunity Health Center Volunteer Physician Protection Act of 2005 is \nsupported by the National Association of Community Health Centers, the \nAmerican Medical Association and the American Osteopathic Association.\n  The impact that community health centers have on the citizens of the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania is significant. Pennsylvania is the home \nto twenty-nine Federal grantees, including 11 of which are rural, and \n151 different service delivery sites. These services are crucial in my \nhome state which also faces a severe medical liability crisis.\n  We must continue to encourage the spirit of giving and volunteerism, \nparticularly in the healthcare arena. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe Community Health Center Volunteer Physician Protection Act of 2005.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Smith, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. \n        Dodd, Mr. Feingold, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S.J. Res. 19. A joint resolution calling upon the President to issue \na proclamation recognizing the 30th anniversary of the Helsinki Final \nAct; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Commission on \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe I am pleased to submit a bipartisan \nresolution in support of the vital work of the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in conjunction with the 30th \nanniversary of the signing of the Helsinki Final Act on August 1. I am \npleased that Senate Commissioners Smith of Oregon, Chambliss, Dodd, \nFeingold, and Clinton are included as original cosponsors of this \nresolution.\n  For three decades the OSCE has provided an important framework for \nadvancing democracy, human rights and the rule of law in an expansive \nregion encompassing the U.S. and Canada, Europe and the countries of \nCentral Asia. Over the years, the OSCE participating States have \nhammered out an extensive body of commitments agreed on the basis of \nconsensus. Our Commission was established by Congress to monitor and \nencourage the OSCE participating States--now numbering 55--to implement \nthe commitments they have accepted. The Commission's mission can be \ndistilled to a single word, accountability. As President Ford remarked \nwhen signing the Final Act on behalf of the United States, ``History \nwill judge this Conference . . . not only by the promises we make, but \nby the promises we keep.''\n  The Final Act inspired courageous individuals in the Soviet Union and \nEastern Europe to form monitoring groups to assess how their respective \ngovernments lived up to the commitments they had endorsed on paper. For \ntheir temerity in seeking accountability most activists were \nimprisoned, banished or exiled. Many endured years of suffering in the \ngulag. Some paid the price with their very lives. Ultimately, their \nsacrifice and the work of countless others began to bear fruit, \nushering in the dramatic changes of the late 1980's and early 90's.\n  A catalyst for change, the Helsinki Final Act and the process it \nbegan provided an important backdrop against which President Ronald \nReagan, standing in front of Berlin's Brandenburg Gate, could boldly \ndeclare, ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.'' Bold leadership led to \nconcrete results with the resolution of hundreds of cases of political \nprisoners and prisoners of conscience as well as the reunification of \ntens of thousands of families. Progress in implementing existing \ncommitments paved the way for the participating States to address the \nneed for systemic change to ensure sustained respect for human rights. \nIn 1990, as the Iron Curtain began to fall, the leaders of the then--35 \nparticipating States declared, ``We undertake to build, consolidate and \nstrengthen democracy as the only system of government of our nations.'' \nThe following year they categorically and irrevocably declared that \nhuman rights commitments ``are matters of direct and legitimate concern \nto all participating States and do not belong exclusively to the \ninternal affairs of the State concerned.'' In a step designed to \npreserve the unity of the Helsinki process, each country that joined \nthe OSCE after 1975 submitted a letter in which the accepted in their \nentirety all commitments and responsibilities contained in the Helsinki \nFinal Act, and all subsequent documents adopted prior to their \nmembership. To underscore this continuity, the leaders of each of these \ncountries signed the actual original 1975 Final Act document.\n  With the break up of the Soviet Union, many observers believed--or \nhoped--that the fall of communism would usher in a new era and the \nrelatively speedy emergence of states that treat their citizens and \nneighbors with respect. Regrettably, the gap between commitment and the \nsituation on the ground in a number of OSCE participating States \nremains wide, and in at least a couple of countries is growing \nalarmingly wider.\n  Elsewhere, the OSCE has played an important role in the aftermath of \nconflicts that ravaged much of the Balkans region. The atrocities \ncommitted during these conflicts, in particular during the Bosnian \nconflict from 1992 to 1995, represent the most egregious violations of \nHelsinki principles in Europe since the Final Act was signed, indeed \nsince World War II. By placing field missions throughout that region, \nthe OSCE has helped heal the wounds, in particular by facilitating the \nreturn\n\n[[Page S5367]]\n\nof those displaced from their homes, by improving conditions for \nelections, by training local police and by monitoring borders used by \ncriminal gangs who profit from the chaos of conflict. There have been \nimprovements in recent years, but there is still plenty of work to do \nto build the democratic institutions and respect for the rule of law.\n  Freedom is on the march in places some had written off as unsuited \nfor democracy. Kyrgyzstan's Tulip Revolution, Ukraine's Orange \nRevolution, Georgia's Rose Revolution, and Serbia's Democratic \nRevolution testify to the enduring power of the ideas reflected in the \nHelsinki Final Act and other OSCE documents. As we approach the 30th \nanniversary of the Final Act, a number of signatory states--most \nnotably Russia and Belarus--seem determined to diminish the democratic \ncontent of the OSCE and rewrite related commitments they accepted when \nthey joined the OSCE. It is imperative that the United States hold firm \nto the values that have inspired democratic change in much of the OSCE \nregion, even as we redouble our efforts to encourage all participating \nStates to implement their freely accepted commitments.\n  In recent years the OSCE has made significant inroads in confronting \nand combating the rise in anti-Semitism and related violence in the \nOSCE region, including the United States. I would point out that the \nOSCE was the first multilateral institution to speak out against anti-\nSemitism. While many OSCE states have responded appropriately, \nvigorously investigating the perpetrators and pursuing criminal \nprosecution, we must remain vigilant in addressing manifestations of \nanti-Semitism. The OSCE conference on anti-Semitism and other forms of \nintolerance to be held in June in Cordoba will provide a timely \nopportunity for countries to report on measures they are taking to \naddress these concerns.\n  The OSCE is also playing an important role in promoting the right of \nindividuals to freely profess and practice their faith. A number of \ncountries in the OSCE region have adopted or are considering laws on \nreligion that would severely restrict or otherwise regulate this \nfundamental right. Similarly, the OSCE has given priority attention to \nefforts to combat trafficking in human beings, encouraging a number of \nparticipating States to adopt measures to prevent trafficking, \nprosecute perpetrators, and protect victims.\n  In her confirmation testimony, Secretary of State Rice referred to \nthe potential role that multilateral institutions can play in \nmultiplying the strength of freedom-loving nations. Indeed, the OSCE \nhas tremendous potential to play an even greater role in promoting \ndemocracy, human rights, and rule of law in a region of strategic \nimportance to the United States.\n  Over the past three decades the OSCE has served as an important \ncatalyst for change. An important aspect of the success of the Helsinki \nProcess has been the strong partnership forged with human rights \nadvocates, including non-governmental organizations. As we look toward \nthe work ahead, we would do well to recall the insightful observation \nof renowned physicist, humanitarian, and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, \nAndrei Sakharov, ``The whole point of the Helsinki Accords is mutual \nmonitoring, not mutual evasion of difficult problems.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/17/senate-section/article/S5367-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 144--RECOGNIZING TIM NELSON AND HUGH SIMS FOR THEIR \n   BRAVERY AND THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS IN HELPING THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF \n                INVESTIGATION DETAIN ZACARIAS MOUSSAOUI\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN (for himself and Mr. Dayton) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 34\n\n       Whereas the United States maintains strong and friendly \n     relations with the Republic of Albania and appreciates the \n     ongoing support of the people of Albania;\n       Whereas the President of Albania has called for elections \n     to Albania's parliament, known as the People's Assembly, to \n     be held on July 3, 2005;\n       Whereas Albania is one of 55 participating States in the \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), \n     all of which have adopted the 1990 Copenhagen Document \n     containing specific commitments relating to the conduct of \n     elections;\n       Whereas these commitments, which encourage transparency, \n     balance, and impartiality in an election process, have become \n     the standard by which observers determine whether elections \n     have been conducted freely and fairly;\n       Whereas, though improvements over time have been noted, the \n     five multiparty parliamentary elections held in Albania \n     between 1991 and 2001, as well as elections for local offices \n     held between and after those years, fell short of the \n     standards in the Copenhagen Document to varying degrees, \n     according to OSCE and other observers;\n       Whereas with OSCE and other international assistance, the \n     Government of Albania has improved the country's electoral \n     and legal framework and enhanced the capacity to conduct free \n     and fair elections;\n       Whereas subsequent to the calling of elections, Albania's \n     political parties have accepted a code of conduct regarding \n     their campaign activities, undertaking to act in accordance \n     with the law, to refrain from inciting violence or hatred in \n     the election campaign, and to be transparent in disclosing \n     campaign funding; and\n       Whereas meeting the standards in the Copenhagen Document \n     for free and fair elections is absolutely essential to \n     Albania's desired integration into European and Euro-Atlantic \n     institutions, including full membership in the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization (NATO), as well as to Albania's progress \n     in addressing official corruption and combatting organized \n     crime: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) welcomes the opportunity for the Republic of Albania to \n     demonstrate its willingness and preparedness to take the next \n     steps in European and Euro-Atlantic integration by holding \n     parliamentary elections on July 3, 2005, that meet the \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) \n     standards for free and fair elections as defined in the 1990 \n     Copenhagen Document;\n       (2) firmly believes that the citizens of Albania, like all \n     people, should be able to choose their own representatives in \n     parliament and government in free and fair elections, and to \n     hold these representatives accountable through elections at \n     reasonable intervals;\n       (3) supports commitments by Albanian political parties to \n     adhere to a basic code of conduct for campaigning and urges \n     such parties and all election officials in Albania to adhere \n     to laws relating to the elections, and to conduct their \n     activities in an impartial and transparent manner, by \n     allowing international and domestic observers to have \n     unobstructed access to all aspects of the election process, \n     including public campaign events, candidates, news media, \n     voting, and post-election tabulation of results and \n     processing of election challenges and complaints;\n       (4) supports assistance by the United States to help the \n     people of Albania establish a fully free and open democratic \n     system, a prosperous free market economy, and the rightful \n     place of Albania in European and Euro-Atlantic institutions, \n     including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO); and\n       (5) encourages the President to communicate to the \n     Government of Albania, to all political parties and \n     candidates in Albania,\n\n[[Page S5368]]\n\n     and to the people of Albania the high importance attached by \n     the United States Government to this parliamentary election \n     as a central factor in determining the future relationship \n     between the United States and Albania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/17/senate-section/article/S5368-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n            committee on banking, housing, and urban affairs\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, the matter of giving the President an \nup-or-down vote on his judicial nominees or, more accurately, giving \nthe country an opportunity for any President to have what every \nPresident has always had, a chance for the full Senate to have an up-\nor-down vote on his nominees, is a matter of great importance to our \ncountry. It is not the only business before the Senate. I would like to \nspeak for a few minutes about natural gas prices and prices at the pump \nand how, at a time when China and India are buying up oil reserves \naround the world, we make sure that we have plenty of energy.\n  We spend, in this country, about $2,500 per person on energy per \nyear. We are about to have a big debate and discussion in the Senate \nabout how much we spend on energy in the future. The Senator from \nLouisiana was here a few minutes ago. She made an excellent address. \nShe summed up some of what happened today in the Senate Energy \nCommittee. It was a very good meeting. At one time, virtually every \nmember of the Senate Energy Committee was present, even though the \npurpose of the meeting was simply for us to make opening statements and \nto take initial action on a few relatively noncontroversial matters. \nThat is because all of us understand how important it is.\n  It is also because Chairman Domenici and Ranking Member Bingaman, who \nare from New Mexico, have worked unusually hard in creating a framework \nso that we could have a significant piece of legislation. To those \noutside the Senate, that may sound like a lot of ``inside baseball,'' \nbut it is not. It is crucially important for the Republican majority to \nhave listened, as Senator Domenici and the rest of us have over the \nlast several months, to the views and attitudes of the Democratic \nminority and vice versa.\n  What is happening in the Energy Committee is no accident. Senator \nDomenici, at the beginning of the year, told the Republican members of \nthe committee that as he looked back over the last session of Congress \nand saw our failure as a Congress to grapple with this question of high \nprices at the gas pump, high prices for natural gas, which are driving \nmanufacturing jobs overseas, which are raising costs for farmers, which \nare making it hard to heat and cool our homes, he decided he wanted to \noperate in a little bit different way. So we have. In a way, it is a \ngood thing that we didn't pass an energy bill last year because this \none ought to be a lot better, a lot more aggressive, and a lot bolder.\n  The situation is more urgent. We have a better bipartisan framework, \nand we have learned a lot in the last year. Senator Domenici and \nSenator Bingaman have cochaired large conferences on coal and natural \ngas, so Senators themselves and key staff members could learn about the \nnewest technologies and could understand the facts about what are a \nvery complex set of considerations so we are better prepared.\n  I especially compliment the Senator from Louisiana. She mentioned the \nAmericans Outdoors Act that she and I introduced together again \nyesterday. We introduced it in the last session of Congress. She has \nworked on major parts of it for the last 6 years. But basically it \npicks up a principle that was a part of President Reagan's Commission \non Americans Outdoors which I chaired 20 years ago. It sought to create \na steady stream of reliable funding for conservation purposes, \nspecifically the Land and Water Conservation Fund, for city parks, for \nwildlife, for enjoyment by soccer players, by duck hunters, by walkers, \nby most Americans.\n  The idea is, if we are going to drill for gas and oil and use up some \nof our assets, we ought to take a part of that and use it and put it \nback as an asset. If there is an environmental burden, there ought to \nbe an environmental benefit. That is a very simple idea.\n  She and I call it a ``conservation royalty,'' and it is our hope to \npersuade a majority of the Senate, which we believe is conservation \nminded, that a majority of Americans--and we know there is a \nconservation majority in the United States--want us to help them have \nmore places to enjoy themselves outdoors.\n  I look forward to working with her on that and the conservation \nroyalty.\n  Mr. President, let me put the meeting Senator Domenici chaired in the \nEnergy Committee in this context. A couple weeks ago, I had a private \nletter from GEN Carl Steiner. He is a real American hero. He was head \nof the special forces, a very brave man. He wrote to remind me that \nSeptember 11 was a big surprise, but it should not have been. During \nthe 1980s and 1990s, there were terrorist attacks on American interests \naround the world and in our country itself. If we had paid attention, \nGeneral Steiner reminded me, we would not have been surprised on 9/11.\n  The next big surprise in this country will be to our pocketbooks. But \nit doesn't have to happen. If we pay attention, we already know we have \nthe highest natural gas prices in the industrialized world. Three or 4 \nyears ago, we had the lowest natural gas prices in the industrialized \nworld. Today we have the highest. We know gas at the pump is at record \nlevels for our country. We know China and India are increasing their \ndemand for energy. We know that because of high prices, manufacturing \njobs are moving overseas, farmers are taking a pay cut, and consumers \nare paying too much to heat and cool their homes.\n\n[[Page S5370]]\n\n  We can avoid this next big surprise--the one to our pocketbooks--by \npassing an energy bill in the next few weeks that lowers prices, cleans \nthe air, and reduces dependence upon foreign oil. To keep our standard \nof living, our goal must be to aggressively conserve and to \naggressively produce an adequate, reliable supply of low-cost, \nAmerican-produced, clean energy.\n  Some may say, why the emphasis on clean energy? Isn't that over in \nthe clean air debate in the Environment and Public Works Committee? \nWell, yes, it is, jurisdictionwise. They may have jurisdiction on clean \nair. That is the problem. But the Energy bill has the solution to the \nclean air problem. We are not going to have clean air just by passing a \nbunch of caps on things. We are going to have it by transforming the \nway we produce energy in this country.\n  Senator Bingaman and Senator Domenici, as I mentioned earlier, have \nworked hard to produce a bipartisan framework to accomplish the goal I \njust described. But the danger is still that we will be too timid and \nwe will compromise our differences and produce a bill that doesn't do \nmuch. That is why Senator Johnson and I introduced the bipartisan \nNatural Gas Price Reduction Act of 2005 a few weeks ago. According to a \npreliminary analysis by the American Council for an Energy Efficient \nEconomy, our act would yield four times the natural gas savings or \nproduction of last year's energy bill. In other words, our bill would \nmake up seven of the eight TFC of America's projected shortfall in \nnatural gas by 2020. That is one way to lower natural gas prices.\n  I suggested this morning--and some members of the committee seemed to \nrespond well to the idea--that we think of this legislation we are \nbeginning to work on in the Senate as the ``clean energy act of 2005.'' \nAlong with some of my colleagues, I support legislation to reduce \ncarbon and other pollutants in our air. But none of these caps on \npollution will do the job. None will produce an adequate supply of low-\ncost, reliable, American-produced, clean energy. The only way to do \nthat is, first, aggressive conservation and, secondly, to aggressively \ntransform the way we produce energy.\n  In writing our bill, we have to keep in mind what the Finance \nCommittee of the Senate will do with the tax part of this bill. Some of \nthis Energy bill will be in the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nsome of it is in our Energy Committee, and some of it is in the Finance \nCommittee--the tax part. So it all eventually will come together to the \nfloor, where I am sure there will be even more amendments.\n  But the reason--in our deliberations this week and next week in the \nEnergy Committee we have to keep in mind what the Finance Committee is \ndoing--is we have limited resources. This is not going to be a $30 \nbillion bill. Our Budget Committee says the Energy bill will be an $11 \nbillion bill over the next 5 years. That is what it will cost in direct \nspending and tax credits. The administration hopes it will be even \nsmaller--an $8 billion bill. We won't lower prices if we spend our \nmoney on more tax credits to oil companies, and we will not lower \nprices if we continue current policies and spend $3.7 billion over the \nnext 5 years, or nearly one-third of what the administration wants us \nto spend, on building giant windmills that produce puny amounts of \nhigh-cost, unreliable power, and destroy the landscape. We don't need a \nnational windmill policy; we need a national clean energy policy.\n  It is important for us to know what the tax committee is doing \nbecause it is important for us to know, as I mentioned, that, for \nexample, if the tax committee continues its production tax credit for \nso-called renewable energy--$3.7 billion over the next 5 years of the \n$8 billion or $11 billion we have is gone, and we don't have it to \nbuild clean coal gas plants, for credits for hybrid cars, for credits \nfor new nuclear--the things that will make a difference for us. Of that \n$3.7 billion, 70 percent of it will be spent on windmills. So current \npolicies would say, if we have $8 billion or $11 billion to spend--the \ntotal we have to spend on energy--we would spend a large part on these \ngiant windmills, which raise prices, only work 20, 25, or 30 percent of \nthe time, are being abandoned in many countries that started using \nthem, and absolutely destroy the American landscape, because they are \n100 yards tall, wider than jumbo jets, make noise up to a half a mile \naway.\n  Here are some of the specific steps I believe we should take to \nconserve and transform production. Many of these proposals are in the \nAlexander-Johnson legislation we introduced a few weeks ago. Several \nhave been incorporated in Chairman Domenici's draft before our \ncommittee. Here are a few examples in the areas of conservation, first, \nand in the area of transforming production:\n  In conservation, consumer education. A 4-year national consumer \neducation program to reduce the demand for energy, tailored after the \nsuccessful California program, could avoid energy consumption of about \n20 powerplants over 4 years.\n  Efficiency standards. Higher appliance and equipment standards for \nnatural gas efficiency could save the equivalent of 24 1,000-megawatt \npowerplants by 2020.\n  Cogeneration. Regulatory relief enabling manufacturers to more easily \nproduce their own power and steam from a single source would save money \nand energy and reduce pollutants.\n  Efficient electricity generation. Incentives to encourage utilities \nto utilize their natural gas plants based on efficiency--we call that \nefficient dispatch--to increase their efficiency as much as 40 percent. \nIn plain English, there are old natural gas plants and there are new \nnatural gas plants. The new ones use a lot less natural gas than the \nold ones to produce the same amount of power. Using gas from the new \nones first would save a lot of gas.\n  Oil savings. Last session of Congress, the Congress adopted a plan \nSenator Landrieu and I recommended to direct the administration to come \nup with a plan that would reduce by 1 million barrels per day by 2015 \nour use of gasoline.\n  Senator Johnson and I in our legislation suggest the administration \nadopt a plan to reduce gasoline use by 1.75 million barrels per day. \nThis would save enough gasoline to equal twice the anticipated \nproduction from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  And finally, in terms of conservation, another important idea is \nsupport for hybrid and advanced diesel vehicles. Most of this will have \nto come from the Finance Committee. But the National Commission on \nEnergy Policy, which a lot of us have been reading, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, ``A Bipartisan Strategy to Meet America's Challenges,'' \nhas a number of excellent ideas in it.\n  One of them is $1.5 billion over 5 years in manufacturer and consumer \nincentives for domestic production and purchase of efficient hybrid \nelectric and advanced diesel vehicles. Hybrid vehicles use about 60 \npercent of the gasoline conventional vehicles use. The Commission \nwisely suggested that we have some loan guarantees or tax credits. We \nmight do the loan guarantees in our own legislation in the Energy \nCommittee to help make sure those hybrid vehicles and clean diesel \nvehicles are built in the United States.\n  The other area in which we need to move boldly, and I hope we will, \nis in transforming the way we produce energy. At the head of the list \nhas to be nuclear power. There is a lot of talk in this body about \nglobal warming and carbon. Mr. President, 70 percent of the carbon-free \nenergy we produce in the United States comes from nuclear power. Again, \nSeventy percent of the carbon-free energy we produce in the United \nStates comes from nuclear power. And in the next 5, 10, 15 years, if we \nare serious about global warming, reducing the amount of carbon in the \nair and setting an example for the rest of the world to do the same, we \nwill appropriate at least $2 billion for research and development and \nloan guarantees to help start at least two new advanced technology \nplants.\n  We have not built a new nuclear powerplant in America since the \n1970s. TVA, the Tennessee Valley Authority, fortunately, is reopening \nBrowns Ferry, one of its plants. This will basically be a new plant. \nYet France produces 80 percent of its power using nuclear energy. Japan \nbuilds a new nuclear powerplant every year. Our Navy operates 70, 80, \n90 nuclear vessels. I guess the number is classified; I do not know the \nexact number. They have never had one single, not one single accident \nwith those reactors since the\n\n[[Page S5371]]\n\n1950s. Yet here we are, the most scientifically advanced nation in the \nworld, worried about air pollution, worried about the need for low-\ncost, reliable supply of power, many are worried about global warming \nand carbon in the air, and we have not built a new nuclear powerplant \nsince the 1970s. We should start.\n  The second best hope for transforming our way of producing a low-\ncost, reliable supply of American-produced energy is coal. We need a \nnational coal gasification strategy. Again, both Democratic and \nRepublican Members have been studying this very carefully. I suggest $2 \nbillion in loan guarantees for the deployment of six coal gasification \nplants by 2013 and $2 billion for industrial applications of coal \ngasification.\n  Clean coal gasification, very simply, is taking coal, of which we \nhave plenty, hundreds of years of supply, and turning it into gas and \nmaking electricity from it, either in freestanding powerplants or \nletting industries do that to produce their own power as, for example, \nEastman does in Kingsport, TN.\n  Next we should focus on carbon capture and sequestration from coal \nplants. Coal gasification eliminates most of the problems we have with \nmercury, nitrogen, and sulfur, but it still produces carbon. If we \ncould find a way to capture that carbon and put it away somewhere, \nsequester it, we would have created right there, in addition to nuclear \npower, a way to have a fairly permanent supply of low-cost, reliable, \nadequate American-produced energy.\n  That technology is not mature yet, but we need a research program to \ndemonstrate commercial scale carbon capture and geological \nsequestration at a variety of sites as well as research to reduce \ncapital costs of processes to sequester carbon. That is also one of the \nrecommendations of the National Commission on Energy Policy.\n  As many leading environmental groups have pointed out, coal \ngasification and carbon capture is the best strategy for the rest of \nthe world. Even if we clean up our air, even if somehow we limit our \nproduction of carbon, if China, India, and Brazil build hundreds and \nhundreds of dirty coal plants around the world, it will not matter what \nwe do because the air goes around the world, and we will end up \nbreathing it, too.\n  So it is urgent that we move ahead with advanced nuclear technology \nand with advanced coal gasification and carbon capture and \nsequestration, not just for us, but in hopes that the rest of the world \nwill adopt our technology and, therefore, make our air safer and \ncleaner and make us less dependent on foreign oil.\n  We need to increase our supply of domestic natural gas, and there are \nspecific ways in the Alexander-Johnson legislation to do that. I hope \nthe Senate bill adopts those ideas.\n  No. 1, we should provide the Department of Interior with the legal \nauthority to issue ``natural gas only'' leases. Some of the oil \ncompanies are saying, ``What do you do if you find oil?'' We are not \nthe experts; they are. If the State of Virginia or North Carolina, or \nsome other State prefers to look for natural gas, I would like for them \nto have that option, and today the Secretary does not have that option.\n  No. 2, we should instruct the Department of Interior to draw the \nState boundary according to established international law between \nAlabama and Florida regarding lease 181 and lease portions of it not in \nFlorida by December 31, 2007.\n  That may sound very technical, but here is what that means. The \nSecretary should draw the State line out into the water, which should \nhave been done years ago. The part that is in Florida can't be drilled \non because of the moratorium. The part that is in Alabama could be. \nSome estimates say 20 percent of the natural gas that is produced in \nthe Gulf of Mexico over the next several years could come from that new \npart of lease 181 in Alabama. That would lower natural gas prices.\n  Finally, it allows States to selectively waive the Federal moratoria \non offshore production and collect significant revenues from such \nproduction.\n  If Tennessee had a coastline--I know Georgia does--but if Tennessee \nhad one, here is what I would do. I would put some gas rigs so far out \nin the ocean that nobody could see them. I would take that money and I \nwould put it in an endowment of Tennessee colleges and universities so \nthey would be the best funded and gradually the best colleges and \nuniversities in America. Second, I would take the rest of the money and \nI would lower taxes.\n  That would be a pretty good platform for a Governor. I wish I could \ndo it in Tennessee, but maybe a Governor of New Jersey or Georgia or \nFlorida or Virginia will want to do that. I think they should have that \noption.\n  Finally--I said finally, but one other thing on domestic natural gas. \nWe should take part of these revenues from offshore drilling and create \na conservation royalty. That royalty would be equally shared by all the \nStates in the Land and Water Conservation Fund and wildlife grants. We \nshould take that money and invest it in conservation so an \nenvironmental burden becomes an environmental benefit.\n  There are a couple of other things I would specifically like to \nmention. We are going to have to temporarily increase the foreign \nsupply of natural gas. We have no option if we want lower natural gas \nprices. We do that by streamlining the permitting of facilities for \nbringing LNG from overseas to the United States. We need to give the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission exclusive authority for siting and \nregulating LNG terminals while still preserving States' authorities \nunder the Coastal Zone Management Act, Clean Water Act, and the Clean \nAir Act. Renewable power is an important part of what we ought to do. \nRegarding solar power, the production tax credit now in the law for \nsolar power really isn't enough to make solar power a viable option. We \nshould increase that over the next several years. We should adopt the \nwork that many Democrats, and President Bush, and many Republicans have \nworked on to encourage hydrogen fuel cell initiatives.\n  We should require that FERC grant or deny a terminal pipeline \napplication within 1 year. We should clarify the permitting processes \nfor pipelines and natural gas storage facilities.\n  These are specific steps. They are aggressive steps. But they are the \nkind of steps we need to take.\n  I make these remarks, as I said at the beginning, because Senator \nDomenici and Senator Bingaman, both of whom have been here for a long \ntime, have worked pretty hard to give us a chance to have the right \nkind of clean energy bill. I believe the American people expect us in \nthe Senate to know that natural gas prices are driving jobs overseas \nand are raising prices for farmers. They expect us to know they are \nhaving a hard time affording the cost of gasoline. They expect us to \ntake steps to do something about it. Only the steps like the ones I \nhave mentioned will create a true Clean Energy Act of 2005. Only steps \nlike these will produce adequate conservation and adequate supply of \nreliable, low-cost, American-produced, clean energy. Only steps like \nthese will lower prices and save the United States from the next big \nsurprise: The surprise to our pocketbooks because we failed to prepare \nfor the oncoming energy crisis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/17/senate-section/article/S5371-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
