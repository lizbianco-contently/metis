Especially do we need You in \nthe great moments of life. Graciously regard these Your servants. We \nacknowledge that ``righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a \nreproach to any people.'' May we desire character more than reputation, \ntruth more than expediency, and honesty more than vanity. Help us to be \nthe good Samaritan ready to help all in need regardless of race, face, \nor place. We pray that we may learn the peace that comes with forgiving \nand the strength we gain in loving.

This is a \nnomination we have tried to clear for quite some time but were unable \nto do so because of an objection on the other side of the aisle. On \nTuesday, I filed a cloture motion so we could bring this nomination to \na vote. I do hope we can invoke cloture and subsequently vote \naffirmatively, with an up-or-down vote, on the President's nomination.\n  Once cloture is invoked and we are able to vote on the Dorr \nnomination--once we complete that--we will resume debate on the Defense \nauthorization bill. Chairman Warner and Senator Levin were on the \nSenate floor yesterday to consider amendments. There is one amendment \npending at this point in time. I understand the other side is looking \nat that amendment. It is an amendment relating to armored personnel \ncarriers. We will schedule that for a vote sometime early today, I \nhope.\n  We will be considering additional amendments over the course of \ntoday. We, of course, will be voting over the course of the afternoon \non the Department of Defense authorization bill. We do need to make \nsubstantial progress on the bill this week. Therefore, we do ask \nSenators to come forward with their amendments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/21/senate-section/article/S8589-7", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8589-S8590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today marks the 75th anniversary of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\n  On July 21, 1930, by Executive order, President Herbert Hoover \nconsolidated our veterans programs into a new Federal agency. In the \ndecades since, the Department has grown to become the second largest \nFederal agency. In 1989, its director was elevated to a Cabinet-level \nposition. Today, the agency serves more than 25 million American \nmilitary veterans.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs offers the most comprehensive \nveterans assistance programs of any country in the world. Since the \nvery first\n\n[[Page S8590]]\n\nsettlers, America has provided for our veterans. Way back in 1636, the \nPilgrims of Plymouth County agreed that members of the colony would \nsupport soldiers disabled in the battles with the Pequot Indians. One \nhundred forty years later, the Continental Congress moved to provide \npensions for soldiers disabled by the War for Independence.\n  In the following decades, Congress enacted many more measures to \nsupport our retired service men and women. On June 22, 1944, Congress \npassed the GI bill, one of the most significant pieces of legislation \nin our country's history. Initially, the proposal to provide \neducational assistance to our vets was met with controversy. But after \nsuccessful lobbying by the American Legion, the GI bill was passed \nunanimously in both Houses. It is now considered one of the most \ninfluential pieces of legislation enacted since the Homestead Act.\n  The GI bill has not only opened the door to higher education for \nmillions of Americans, it has transformed America from a society of \nrenters to a society of homeowners. It is the Veterans Affairs \nDepartment that has so successfully overseen this tremendous \nachievement.\n  An area of special interest to me is veterans health. Before coming \nto the Senate, I spent at least a portion of every week serving our \nveterans, through surgery, in the operating rooms in veterans \nhospitals, whether it was the veterans hospital in Nashville, TN, or \nwhen I was on the west coast. But literally every week, over the period \nof my entire professional career in medicine, I was serving veterans in \na hospital, performing heart surgery and lung surgery and removing \ncancers from their chests.\n  The VA hospitals in particular have been successful in streamlining \ntheir health information technologies. As we reach out today, focusing \non our overall health care system--our health care sector, I should \nsay; we don't have a real health care system in this country--we are \nlooking to the Veterans' Administration and their now over 20 years of \nexperience of health information sharing throughout a system, hospital \nto hospital and hospital to physician's office.\n  A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that \nfor a discrete set of measures, VA patients were in better health and \nreceived more recommended treatments as compared to Medicare patients \ntreated on a fee-for-service basis.\n  According to the VA's own medical professionals, a computer system \ncalled VISTA is the key to their success. Sanford Garfunkel, the \ndirector of the VA Medical Center in Washington, DC, says:\n\n       I'm proud of what we do here but it isn't that we have more \n     resources. The difference is information.\n\n  I applaud the VA hospitals for their innovation and for their \ncommitment. I had the opportunity, before coming to the Senate, to see \nit firsthand in the patients I took care of in our VA hospitals. Each \nday, the physicians and nurses in these hospitals are advancing that \nmission of the Veterans Affairs agency to--in the words of Abraham \nLincoln--``care for him who has borne the battle, and for his widow and \nhis orphan.''\n  It is in that spirit that I pledge to our Nation's veterans to pass \nlegislation prior to the August recess to ensure that the veterans \nhealth care system has the resources necessary to care for those who \nhave stood in harm's way for us.\n  Tonight, the VA Diamond Jubilee celebrations will be kicked off with \nan event at the DAR Constitution Hall here in Washington, DC. In the \nfollowing weeks and months, our Nation's veterans, their families, and \ngrateful communities will come together in celebrations all over the \ncountry to honor the deep contributions of our service men and women.\n  Thank you to the VA and to our women and men of the Armed Forces, \nincluding the new generation of veterans coming back from Afghanistan \nand Iraq. America owes you a great debt of gratitude, and we intend \nto--and will--continue that long and proud tradition of providing for \nour soldiers even after they have left the battlefield.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/21/senate-section/article/S8590-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, another way to honor our veterans is to \nhonor the men and women currently serving in our military. Yesterday, \nwe did begin the Defense authorization bill. I do urge my colleagues to \ncome to the Senate floor now, this morning, with their amendments. We \nmust do so now in order to complete this bill. We will consider the \nlegislation amendment by amendment, in an orderly way. It is my \nintention, in consultation with the bill manager, to file cloture on \nthis bill in short order. That should send a strong signal that now is \nthe time for people to come to the Chamber with their amendments.\n  I also plan to offer an amendment to the Defense authorization bill \nto preserve our longstanding relationship between the Department of \nDefense and the Boy Scouts of America. This legislation is necessary--\nit is unfortunate it is necessary, but it is necessary--to press back \non the lawsuits that seek to sever the ties between our military, which \nhas hosted the Boy Scout Jamboree on its bases, and the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica.\n  America's youth can learn so much from the men and women in uniform \ntoday: love of country, commitment to values, sacrifice for others. It \nis simply wrongheaded to conclude that Pentagon support of the Boy \nScouts of America violates the establishment clause. It is time to \nreturn some common sense to the courts.\n  On Monday, July 25, thousands of Scouts from all around the country \nwill begin arriving at Fort AP Hill. Let's protect that relationship. \nWe have an opportunity to do so. It is time for us to act.\n  We will also be considering gun liability legislation before we \nleave. Given the profusion of litigation, the Department of Defense \nfaces the very real prospect of outsourcing sidearms for our soldiers \nto foreign manufacturers. Let me repeat, given the amount, the \nprofusion of litigation, the Department of Defense faces the real \nprospect of having to outsource sidearms for our soldiers to foreign \nmanufacturers.\n  The Baretta Corporation, for instance, makes the standard sidearm for \nthe U.S. Armed Forces. They have the long-term contracts to supply \nthese pistols to our forces in Iraq. Recently, the company had this to \nsay:\n\n       The decision of the D.C. Court of Appeals . . . has the \n     likelihood of bankrupting, not only Baretta U.S.A., but every \n     maker of semiautomatic pistols and rifles since 1991.\n\n  Without this legislation, it is possible the American manufacturers \nof legal firearms will be faced with the real prospect of going out of \nbusiness, ending a critical source of supply for our Armed Forces, our \npolice, and our citizens.\n  The legislation prohibits one narrow category of lawsuits: suits \nagainst the firearms industry for damages resulting from the criminal \nor unlawful misuse of a firearm or ammunition by a third party.\n  Over two dozen lawsuits have been filed on a variety of theories, all \nseeking the same politically motivated goal: putting our industry out \nof business. This is wrong.\n  These frivolous suits threaten a domestic industry that is critical \nto our national defense, jeopardize hundreds of thousands of jobs, and \nput at risk law-abiding citizens who have guns for recreational use.\n  Many support this legislation, including the Fraternal Order of \nPolice. I am hopeful, with the cooperation of Members, we can complete \nall action on this legislation before the recess.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/21/senate-section/article/S8590-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, there \nwill be 1 hour for debate, with the time equally divided between the \nmajority leader or his designee and the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, \nor his designee.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                     Health Information Technology\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on leader time--the managers will be coming \nto the floor--one final thought.\n  I am pleased to report that we are making progress on an issue which \nI mentioned in my previous remarks on information technology. We are \nworking together in a strongly bipartisan way to improve our health \ncare system, to get rid of waste and abuse and ultimately save lives \nand improve quality by promoting and making it easy to use the \nprotected electronic health record. Yesterday, the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee reported out the Wired for Health Care \nQuality Act that was introduced by myself, and Senators Enzi, Kennedy, \nand Clinton. The four of us have been working together aggressively \nwith the HELP Committee.\n  Soon, at the urging of Congress, the administration will make the \nVeterans' Administration's Electronic Health Record System, called \nVISTA, available to health care providers free of charge. Making that \nsystem available will be hugely beneficial, with tens of thousands of \nphysicians who treat seniors being able to harness the power of having \nthis electronic health record. It will improve the quality of care, the \nefficiency of care that they provide. It will ultimately pull down \ncost, and it will get rid of waste within the system.\n  There is much more to be done. That is why I look to rapidly move the \nHELP-reported bill that will hopefully be before us soon, the Wired for \nHealth Care Quality Act. It also will protect patient privacy and \npromote secure exchange of lifesaving health information. It will allow \nfor the rapid adoption of standards that will allow health information \ntechnology systems to communicate, one with the other. It will allow us \nto seamlessly integrate the health information technology standards. It \nwill reduce waste and inefficiency and put patients back at the heart \nof the health care system.\n  Mr. President, the managers are in the Chamber. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  I rise in support of Tom Dorr, the President's nominee for Under \nSecretary of Rural Development at USDA.\n  Tom is a fourth generation ``dirt under the fingernails'' family \nfarmer. He has also been a small businessman and understands the \ndemands and challenges of doing business in rural America.\n  Tom Dorr is a family man, having been married to Ann for 35 years. \nThey have a son and a married daughter and a beautiful granddaughter, \nall who live in Iowa.\n  Tom is a community leader, having served as the chairman of the board \nfor the Heartland Care Center, a cooperative care center in Marcus.\n  Tom was instrumental in starting the Iowa Corn Growers Association \nand served in various leadership roles before moving on to leadership \nat the National Corn Growers Association.\n  Tom served on the board of the Chicago Federal Reserve and has also \nserved on the Iowa Board of Regents, which is truly one of the most \nprestigious jobs in our State, a position now held by the wife of my \nSenate partner from Iowa, Tom Harkin. Mrs. Harkin serves on that \nprestigious body.\n  Tom's leadership ability has been demonstrated and utilized to the \nbenefit of his community and our State time and time again.\n  Tom has dedicated a good portion of his life to serving Iowa's rural \npopulation and improving Iowa's rural economy.\n  Tom Dorr has the financial expertise and business savvy required to \nrun an organization as large and complicated as USDA's Rural \nDevelopment.\n  Rural Development is basically a large bank, with a loan portfolio of \nalmost $90 billion. That is as big as Wells Fargo or Chase Manhattan \nand bigger than most of the banks in America. This agency has 7,000 \nemployees located in over 800 offices across the country.\n  Not just any person can move from the farm and smoothly take over an \norganization of this size. But Tom Dorr did exactly that. Tom Dorr ran \nRural Development as the Under Secretary for 16 months--from August \n2002 until December 2003.\n  Because of Tom's recess appointment, we have the unique opportunity \nto examine his track record.\n  I have heard from many people at USDA about Tom Dorr's \naccomplishments. This news doesn't come only from other political \nappointees, it also comes from career staff and groups who originally \nhad concerns.\n  Folks tell me about his leadership, his vision, his intellect and \nmost importantly, his commitment to rural America. When I hear of \ncomments like this from his peers and those who worked with him, I take \nparticular note.\n  Let me describe a few of Tom's accomplishments while he was the Under \nSecretary for Rural Development:\n  No. 1, he expedited the release of $762 million of water and \nwastewater infrastructure funds provided in the 2002 farm bill in just \n3 months.\n  No. 2, he led the effort to complete the rulemaking process in order \nthat the $1.5 billion broadband program could begin taking applications \nthis year. He believes that if Americans are to live locally and \ncompete globally, that it is as imperative to wire the country for \ntechnology access as it was to provide electricity nationwide 60 years \nago.\n  No. 3, in order to facilitate the review of $37 million in value-\nadded development grants, he creatively used private sector resources \nto expedite the process.\n  No. 4, in order to deliver the financial grants authorized through \nthe Delta Regional Authority, he helped develop and get signed a \nmemorandum of understanding between Rural Development and the Delta \nRegional Authority. This will allow Rural Development to assist in \ndelivering joint projects at no added cost to the Delta Regional \nAuthority.\n  No. 5, he facilitated the development of a memorandum of \nunderstanding, signed by Secretaries Veneman and Martinez, between the \nDepartment of Agriculture and the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, that is focused on better serving housing and \ninfrastructure needs.\n  No. 6, he has developed a series of initiatives with HUD that will \nallow Rural Development to more cost effectively meet the housing needs \nof rural America. These have allowed USDA to provide greater access for \nrural American housing, but especially minorities living in rural \nAmerica in fulfillment of the President's housing initiative.\n  No. 7, he has initiated a review of the Multi-family Housing Program. \nThis includes the hiring of an outside contractor to conduct a \ncomprehensive property assessment to evaluate the physical condition, \nmarket position, and operational status of the more than 17,000 \nproperties USDA has financed, all while determining how best to meet \nthe needs of low-income citizens throughout rural America.\n  No. 8, he has initiated a major outreach program to insure that \nUSDA's Rural Development programs are more easily made available to all \nqualified individuals, communities, and organizations. This marketing \nand branding initiative has also played an important role in changing \nthe attitude of employees to concentrate on customer service and \nproactive outreach, with emphasis on reaching out to minorities.\n  Although this is an incomplete list of his accomplishments, it is \neasy to see that as Under Secretary, Tom Dorr did a great job in the \nshort 15 months he served at Rural Development.\n  Clearly, I support Tom and believe he is the right person for the \njob, but let me read a few comments from the folks that worked with Tom \nwhen he was Under Secretary.\n  First is the Mortgage Bankers Association, a much respected national \norganization in the banking industry:\n\n       We support Mr. Dorr's nomination as Under Secretary for \n     Rural Development because we have found him to be an engaged \n     leader with a true commitment to the housing and community \n     development needs of rural America--Jonathan L. Kempner, \n     President/CEO.\n\n  This organization certainly is able to recognize if someone has the \nability to\n\n[[Page S8592]]\n\nunderstand the financial issues and have the skills needed to run USDA \nRural Development.\n  The next quote is from the Council for Affordable and Rural Housing, \na very respected organization serving the housing industry.\n\n       On behalf of our members throughout the country, we are \n     writing to you today in support of the nomination of Thomas \n     C. Dorr to be the Under Secretary for Rural Development . . . \n     There is a need for strong leadership and determination to \n     forge long-term solutions to preserving this important \n     investment in rural housing--Robert Rice, Jr., President, \n     Council for Affordable and Rural Housing.\n\n  I have many more letters, probably 50 or more, from organizations all \nacross the country asking us to confirm Mr. Dorr. In addition, I have a \nletter signed by many of the leading national agricultural \norganizations such as the National Corn Growers Association and \nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation.\n  There is another issue that I feel compelled to address today. During \nthe 2002 hearing and in the floor debate in the Senate, concerns were \nexpressed regarding Tom's position on minority issues. I would like to \nreference letters for the record this morning that should alleviate any \nlingering concerns.\n  These letters are from minority organization leaders expressing their \nsupport for Tom Dorr's confirmation.\n  The first letter is from the Federation of Southern Cooperatives. You \nmay recall that they had a representative testify against Mr. Dorr at \nthe 2002 Hearing. I will read a quote from their executive director, \nRalph Page:\n\n       I am personally endorsing Tom Dorr's nomination because of \n     his deep interest in rural development. He has made several \n     visits to the communities within the Federation's network and \n     has a great understanding of the needs of rural poor \n     communities. He is the man for the job\n\n  Here is another one:\n\n       Mr. Dorr [has] made great accomplishments in the position \n     and has earned the trust from rural Americans to carry out \n     this mission--Dexter L. Davis, President, Northeast Louisiana \n     Black Farmers and Landowners Associations.\n\n  Here is another one:\n\n       I met Mr. Dorr in Washington, DC, when he was serving as \n     the acting Under Secretary for Rural Development and was \n     impressed with his passion for small farmers. Quite frankly, \n     when I first met Tom, I was not expecting him to be \n     particularly supportive of our needs. But over the years that \n     we have worked together, I have found him to be a great ally \n     and a tireless fighter for the causes that we both support--\n     Calvin R. King Sr., President/CEO, Arkansas Land and Farm \n     Development Corporation.\n\n  Here is another one:\n\n       We hold Mr. Dorr as a valuable asset to our organization \n     and its future. He is one of the individuals that has played \n     a major role in bridging the gap between the small limited \n     resource and minority producers for our organization and the \n     USDA--Fernando Burkett, Black Farmers & Agriculturalists \n     Association, Arkansas Chapter.\n\n  I have many more letters that I could read, but I think it is easy to \nunderstand the point. Thankfully, these organizations were concerned \nenough to come forward after they had a chance to get to know and work \nwith Tom.\n  In addition, I also want to read portions of a letter to Mr. Dorr by \nDr. Dennis Keeney, the former head of the Leopold Center at Iowa State \nUniversity. Many of you will recall Dr. Keeney was asked to testify \nagainst Mr. Dorr in 2002:\n\n       I write to apologize for appearing at your hearing in 2002. \n     It was something I should have said no to right off, but did \n     not. Then it sort of drug on and I had to go through with the \n     appearance or lose face. That still did not make it right. . \n     . . It was during the reading of this book (The Natural, the \n     Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton) that I realized \n     that I had become part of the mudslinging and character \n     assassination. This is not the type of legacy I would like to \n     leave. You have been misunderstood, and made a poster child \n     for big agriculture. I am sure that has not particularly \n     bothered you. But, I have not been proud of my little part in \n     helping paint that picture--Dr. Dennis Keeney, Emeritus \n     Professor, Iowa State University, in a letter to Tom Dorr, \n     June 25, 2003.\n\n  I thank Dr. Keeney for sharing this letter and for setting the record \nstraight.\n  In closing, I ask my colleagues to set aside the politics of the past \nand concentrate on the real issues affecting rural America and what Tom \nDorr would do if confirmed for this important job at USDA.\n  We have neglected our duty by going 4 years without having a \nconfirmed Under Secretary for Rural Development at USDA. We have had \nfour different individuals serving in the Under Secretary position, and \nnone of them were confirmed by the Senate. That is not a good way to \nrun a business, or a large and complicated agency as important to our \nStates as USDA Rural Development.\n  Tom has been under a microscope since his original nomination and \neveryone who has looked in the lense has offered glowing praise for his \nwork and accomplishments.\n  Thankfully, we do not need to speculate about whether Tom would do a \ngood job or not, Tom has already demonstrated he has done and will \nlikely continue to do a great job for rural America in the role of \nRural Development Under Secretary.\n  How often do we actually get to judge a nominee by their proficiency \nin the job? Tom is a sure thing. Rural America is regaining its \neconomic, social and cultural momentum. It would be a shame to deprive \nit of leadership at this critical juncture.\n  We have a unique second chance today. I hope we will set aside our \ndifferences and do what is best for our rural citizens, our States, and \nour country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator is asking to speak on the nomination?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Yes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I simply wanted to rise to give my \nendorsement to Tom Dorr, who has been nominated for Under Secretary for \nRural Development. This agency is important to States such as Wyoming. \nWe have had some experience working with Mr. Dorr and we are pleased \nwith that.\n  Many of the groups from my State have endorsed him, including the \nCattleman's Association, the American Farm Bureau, the Farm Council, \nand so on. I hope we will give the consideration and approval this \ngentleman continues to deserve in this area. He has done a great job. I \nhope he will have a chance to continue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the \nparliamentary situation we face right now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixty minutes equally divided between the \njunior and senior Senators from Iowa, followed by a cloture vote. The \nSenator from Iowa has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the nomination of Thomas C. Dorr for the \nposition of Under Secretary of Agriculture for Rural Development has \nbeen controversial from the outset. It has generated a great deal of \nconcern and opposition and very serious questions. The controversy \nconcern, and questions have continued from Mr. Dorr's nomination in the \n107th Congress, to a recess appointment, to his renomination in the \n108th Congress, and his renomination this year.\n  I regret very much that so many problems have arisen regarding the \nnomination of a fellow Iowan. As any of us would feel, it is a matter \nof pride for me when somebody from my State is nominated for a high \nposition in our Federal Government, regardless of party. This is the \nfirst time in my 20 years in the Senate that I have opposed a \nnomination of a fellow Iowan. Through the Reagan years, the first Bush \nyears, it didn't matter. Regardless of party or about philosophy. Some \nwere a lot more conservative than I am, and I never opposed one of \nthem.\n  Like most Senators, I believe the President should receive a good \ndeal of deference regarding nominations to Cabinet and sub-Cabinet \npositions. However, our Constitution doesn't make us a rubberstamp. We \nhave a responsibility to review nominees--not to decide whether the \nnominee would be our first choice but whether the nominee at least \nmeets certain standards for the job.\n  As a member of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, \nI have a serious responsibility concerning nominations. I have worked \nwith Chairman Chambliss, former chairmen Senators Cochran and Lugar, to \nmove nominees through the Agriculture Committee and through the floor \nfairly and expeditiously. I\n\n[[Page S8593]]\n\nhave done so both as chairman and as ranking member. That has been true \nfor nominees of both parties.\n  This is not a minor nomination. The Under Secretary for Rural \nDevelopment is critically important to family-size farms and ranches \nand to smaller communities all across America. The responsibilities \ninclude helping build water and wastewater facilities; financing \ndecent, affordable housing; supporting electric power and rural \nbusinesses, such as cooperatives. They also include promoting community \ndevelopment and helping to boost economic growth, creating jobs, and \nimproving the quality of life in rural America.\n  Given those responsibilities, one of this nominee's first \ncontroversies arose when Mr. Dorr's position on agriculture was \nreported in the New York Times of May 4, 1998. He proposed replacing \nthe present-day version of the family farm with 225,000-acre mega \nfarms, consisting of three computer-linked pods. Well, with the average \nIowa farm at about 350 acres, this vision certainly was radical, to say \nthe least.\n  On another occasion, at a 1999 conference at Iowa State University, \nMr. Dorr criticized the State of Iowa for failing to move aggressively \ntoward very large vertically integrated hog production facilities. The \nrecord also shows Mr. Dorr verbally attacking the ISU extension service \nand harassing the Director of the ISU Leopold Center for Sustainable \nAgriculture. I ask, is this really the attitude and the vision for \nagriculture and rural communities that the Under Secretary for rural \ndevelopment ought to bring to the job?\n  The person in that position must also be responsive and sensitive to \nthe demands of serving America's very diverse rural citizens and \ncommunities. That requirement cannot be overemphasized in a department \nthat has been plagued with civil rights abuses of both employees and \nclients.\n\n  Here is what Mr. Dorr had to say about ethnic and religious diversity \nat the Iowa State University conference:\n\n       I know this is not at all the correct environment to say \n     this, but I think you have to perhaps go out and look at what \n     you perceive are the three most successful rural economic \n     environments in this State. And you will notice when you get \n     to looking at them that they are not particularly diverse, at \n     least not ethnically diverse. They are very diverse in their \n     economic growth, but they have been very focused and \n     nondiverse in their ethnic background and their religious \n     background, and there is something there, obviously, that has \n     enabled them to succeed and to succeed very well.\n\n  Should we have as Under Secretary of Rural Development someone who \nlacks the judgment to avoid uttering such intentionally provocative and \ndivisive remarks? How does this sort of insensitivity serve the urgent \nneed to reverse USDA's poor civil rights record?\n  Let me also point to a letter Mr. Dorr sent me in October of 1999 to \ncomplain about charges on his telephone bill for the national access \nfee and the Federal universal service fee. Now, the proceeds from these \nrelatively modest fees go to help provide telephone service and \nInternet service to rural communities, hospitals, and schools--\nincluding, I might add, Mr. Dorr's hometown, Marcus, IA, school \ndistrict. It strikes me as very odd that Mr. Dorr would have the \nresponsibility for helping rural communities obtain telecommunications \nservices and technology when he was so vehemently opposed to a program \nthat serves that very purpose.\n  Here is what he said about the national access fee and the Federal \nuniversal access fee:\n\n       With these kind of taxation and subsidy games, you \n     collectively are responsible for turning Iowa into a State of \n     peasants, totally dependent on your largesse. But should you \n     decide to take a few side trips through the Iowa countryside, \n     you will see an inordinate number of homes surrounded by 5 to \n     10 cars. The homes generally have a value of less than \n     $10,000. This just confirms my ``10 car $10,000 home'' \n     theory. The more you try to help, the more you hinder. The \n     results are everywhere.\n\n  Those were Tom Dorr's own words in writing to me. Time and again, we \ngave Mr. Dorr the opportunity to explain this, but he could not explain \nthis broad attack against help to rural communities.\n  In fact, it seems clear that Mr. Dorr was degrading the very people, \nthe very rural communities he is nominated to serve at USDA. He was \nmaking light of lower income Americans in rural communities who are \nstruggling to make a living and get ahead and declaring that it is \ncounterproductive to try to help them.\n  When he appeared before our committee, I asked him about it, and he \ncould not explain it. So I asked Mr. Dorr: Mr. Dorr, have you ever \ngotten any Government help? He did not respond.\n  I said: Did you ever get a guaranteed student loan when you went to \ncollege? He admitted that he had.\n  I asked him if he had received any Government-backed loans for \nfarming operations?\n  Yes.\n  Had he ever gotten any farm payments from the Federal Government for \nhis farming operations?\n  Yes, he had.\n  I listed a number of ways in which the Federal Government had helped \nhim. And I asked rather rhetorically if it hindered him.\n  It seems to me Mr. Dorr was quite willing for the Federal Government \nto help him get ahead, but if the Federal Government is going to help \nsomeone of low income, living in a rural area who is in poverty, he \nsays, no, if you help them, you just hinder them. Is this the kind of \nperson we want in charge of rural development--I think to do any job \nwell one has to believe in its value--if the very purposes of USDA's \nrural development programs are anathema to the beliefs and the \nphilosophy of Mr. Dorr?\n  Furthermore, the nominee's record shows that he prefers to provoke, \nbruise, and offend rather than to seek cooperation and common ground. \nThis simply is not an acceptable approach for the U.S. official in \ncharge of rural development.\n  As with any nominee, the Senate has a responsibility also to examine \nMr. Dorr's financial background and dealings. Former Secretary Veneman \nput it perfectly when she wrote to me:\n\n       Any person who serves this Nation should live by the \n     highest of standards.\n\n  So let us see whether Mr. Dorr meets the standards articulated by \nSecretary Veneman on behalf of the administration.\n  Mr. Dorr was the self-described president and chief executive officer \nof Dorr's Pine Grove Farm Company, of which he and his wife were the \nsole shareholders. In that position, as president and CEO, Mr. Dorr \ncreated an exceedingly complex web of farming business arrangements. \nThis chart illustrates all of the various farming operations in which \nMr. Dorr was involved.\n  Mostly you will hear about a couple of trusts: the Melvin Dorr trust \nand the Harold Dorr trust. There are also Seven Sons, there is the \nIotex Farm Company, there is Ned Harpenau, Diamond D Bar. There is a \ncomplex web of different operations.\n  His operations included land in two trusts set up in 1977, one by his \nfather, Melvin Dorr, and one by his uncle, Harold Dorr. For a time, Tom \nDorr, through his company, Dorr's Pine Grove Farm, farmed the land held \nby the trusts under 50-50 crop share leases, with half of the crop \nproceeds and half of the farm benefits going to Tom Dorr's Pine Grove \nFarm and half going to the trust.\n  Then, beginning in 1988, Mr. Dorr filed new documents with USDA \nindicating that each trust had a 100-percent share of the crop proceeds \nand were entitled to receive 100 percent of the program benefits.\n  Tom Dorr, acting through Dorr's Pine Grove Farm, still farmed the \nland as before, but he claimed the arrangement had become ``a custom \nfarming arrangement.''\n  At some point, one of the trust beneficiaries, Mr. Dorr's brother, \nPaul Dorr, began to question why the custom farming fees were so high \nand out of line with other custom farming fees in that area. Paul Dorr \ntaped a telephone conversation with Tom Dorr that corroborated his \nsuspicions that Tom Dorr was engaged in misrepresentation.\n  Paul Dorr contacted the Farm Service Agency and persisted in his \nrequest for an investigation. Finally, in the spring of 1996, the Farm \nService Agency conducted a review of the Melvin G. Dorr irrevocable \nfamily trust. The Farm Service Agency found that the forms filed and \nsigned by Thomas C. Dorr for the 1993, 1994, and 1995 crop years \nmisrepresented the facts, and the trust was required to pay $16,638 to \nUSDA. That is just one--that is, the\n\n[[Page S8594]]\n\nMelvin G. Dorr trust had to repay that amount. That is the result of an \ninvestigation in 1996.\n  In the fall of 2001, after Mr. Dorr had been nominated for this \nposition, the USDA Office of Inspector General conducted a further \nreview of Mr. Dorr's affairs. The OIG asked the Farm Service Agency to \nreview the Harold E. Dorr irrevocable family trust. Once again, that \ntrust then was found to be in violation of program rules because of the \nmisrepresentation on USDA forms signed by Thomas Dorr. So now that \ntrust had to pay USDA $17,152 in benefits and interest for what was \npaid out to them in 1994 and 1995. So a total of $33,782 was paid back \nby the two trusts.\n  USDA investigations determined that for the years examined, the forms \nsigned by Tom Dorr misrepresented the trusts' shares in the crop \nproceeds. They found, in reality, the land in both of those trusts was \nfarmed on a 50-50 crop share basis, it was not custom farming. The \ntrusts, therefore, were not eligible for the 100-percent share of the \nprogram benefits they had received because Tom Dorr had misrepresented \nthe actual farming arrangement.\n  The records show that Mr. Dorr knowingly carried on a crop share \nlease arrangement between his farm, Pine Grove Farm, and each of the \ntrusts, even as he represented to the Farm Service Agency that it was \ncustom farming, not crop share leases.\n  How do we know this? We know this because in a telephone conversation \nthat Mr. Paul Dorr taped, and which I played for the committee in the \nhearing this spring, Tom Dorr is on that tape, in his own words, \nadmitting that the so-called custom farming arrangement was, in fact, a \ncrop share. And here is the transcript. This is a partial transcript of \nthat conversation.\n  Paul Dorr:\n\n       It, this was all done that way in an effort to . . .\n\n  Tom Dorr interrupts him and said:\n\n      . . . avoid the $50,000 payment limitation to Pine Grove \n     Farms . . .\n\n  Mr. Dorr's operation.\n  Paul Dorr:\n\n       And . . . to, it is to your benefit to your other crop \n     acres . . .\n\n  Tom Dorr:\n\n      . . . that's right. . . .\n\n  Tom Dorr filed that way in order to avoid the $50,000 payment \nlimitation, and he knew full well what he was doing.\n  This is the payment limits connection. Part of the farm program \npayments for land in these two trusts should have been paid directly to \nTom Dorr's Pine Grove Farm under what was actually a crop share \narrangement. Those payments would have counted toward Mr. Dorr's \npayment limitation. Instead, Mr. Dorr misrepresented to USDA the \noperation; therefore, the money was funneled through the trusts and not \ncounted against Mr. Dorr's payment limitation.\n  Indeed, the Farm Service Agency review of Dorr's Pine Grove Farm \nCompany found that Mr. Dorr's misrepresentations in signing up the \ntrust land in the farm program ``had the potential to result in Pine \nGrove Farm receiving benefits indirectly that would exceed the maximum \npayment limitation.''\n  Federal law provides criminal penalties for knowingly making false \nstatements for the purpose of obtaining farm program payments. So the \nUSDA Office of Inspector General referred the Dorr matter to the U.S. \nattorney for the Northern District of Iowa.\n  In February of 2002, that office declined criminal prosecution and \nany affirmative civil enforcement due to the fact that the statute of \nlimitations had run.\n  I have a copy of that letter. I ask unanimous consent to print the \nletter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n         U.S. Department of Justice, Attorney, Northern District \n           of Iowa,\n                                                 February 7, 2002.\n     Re Thomas C. Dorr, Marcus, Iowa PS-0301-616.\n\n     Dallas L. Hayden,\n     U.S. Department of Agriculture, Great Plains Region, 5799 \n         Broadmoor, Suite 700, Mission, KS.\n       Dear Mr. Hayden: After reviewing the Investigative report \n     dated September 26, 2001, regarding the above subject and our \n     telephone discussion of this date, we are, declining criminal \n     prosecution and any affirmative civil enforcement due to \n     statute of limitation issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Charles W. Larson, Sr.,\n                                           United States Attorney.\n                                              Judith A. Whetstine,\n                                 Assistant United States Attorney.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, that is the letter from the U.S. \nAttorney's Office saying they were not moving ahead because the statute \nof limitations had run and they could not do anything--not that they \nhad found Mr. Dorr innocent, but the statute of limitations had run.\n  Mr. Dorr's arrangement with these two trusts was only part, as I \npointed out, of his extensive farming operations. Based on the \nseriousness of the violations involved, it was our responsibility to \nexercise due diligence regarding other parts of Mr. Dorr's complex \nfarming arrangements and to take at least a look at earlier years that \nhad not been involved in these investigations.\n  Again, whatever the Farm Service Agency or the Office of Inspector \nGeneral did or did not pursue, that is not the end of the matter. We \nhave the responsibility to look into this because fraud is fraud, and \nit is serious.\n  Shortly after the March 2002 nomination, Senator Dayton, a member of \nour committee, wrote a letter asking for other information on the other \nfinancial entities with which Mr. Dorr was involved in 1988 to 1995. We \nnever heard back. So I wrote to Secretary Veneman on May 17 and on June \n6, 2002, seeking a response to the committee's questions. We finally \nreceived a response to the letter and some materials, dated June 27, \n2002.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have these letters from Senator Dayton and \nme, along with the transcript of the audiotape printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 21, 2002.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write to express my very serious \n     concerns regarding the nomination of Mr. Thomas C. Dorr for \n     the post of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Under \n     Secretary for Rural Development. As you know, on the morning \n     of his March 6th hearing before your Committee, The Des \n     Moines Register published an investigative story that Mr. \n     Dorr had been forced to repay the USDA's Farm Service Agency \n     almost $ 17,000 for improper payments between 1983 and 1995. \n     The news article also cited passages from a taped telephone \n     conversation in 1995, reportedly between Mr. Dorr and his \n     brother, in which Mr. Dorr stated that he was intentionally \n     deceiving FSA's predecessor agency, the Agricultural \n     Stabilization and Conservation Service, about his farming \n     operation's financial arrangements with a family trust of \n     which he was a trustee with the sole power of attorney.\n       In this taped conversation, Mr. Dorr informed his brother \n     that he had certified it to be a ``custom fee'' arrangement, \n     when, in fact, it was a ``crop share'' arrangement. The \n     reason he did so was, he said, ``To quite frankly avoid \n     minimum payment limitations.''\n       When his brother asked whether this reporting was legal, \n     Mr. Dorr replied, ``I have no idea if its. . . I have no \n     idea. I suspect if they'd audit and if somebody decided to \n     come in and take a look at this thing, they could probably, \n     if they really wanted to, raise hell with us . . .\n       ``. . . Uh, that custom fee is actually not the custom fee. \n     That's crop rental income to me. That's my share of the \n     income. . . .''\n       According to The Des Moines Register, the ASCS received a \n     complaint about this financial arrangement and subsequently \n     received a copy of the reported tape. After their \n     investigation of the financial arrangement with M.G. Dorr \n     Irrevocable Family Trust for the years 1993-1995, the ASCS \n     reportedly determined that it was a crop share arrangement, \n     rather than a custom fee arrangement, which Mr. Dorr, acting \n     with power of attorney for the trust had certified to be the \n     case.\n       However, Mr. Dorr himself directly contradicts his \n     certification in the taped conversation with his brother. In \n     his own words, Mr. Dorr knowingly and intentionally \n     misrepresented this farming arrangement in order, as he said, \n     ``to quite frankly avoid minimum payment limitations.''\n       During my questioning of Mr. Dorr at the hearing, he \n     contradicted his own reported statements during the taped \n     conversation. He contended that the arrangement with the \n     trust was a custom fee, rather than a crop share arrangement. \n     At one point, he stated, ``There was not a filing that we \n     were a custom fee operation or anything like that.'' This \n     assertion is at variance with his reported certifications \n     annually to ASCS attesting to a custom fee arrangement. I \n     subsequently noted that the M.G. Dorr Irrevocable Family \n     Trust was originally established and\n\n[[Page S8595]]\n\n     operated and farmed in a contract share arrangement, unti1 \n     1987 or 1988, when Mr. Dorr changed the report to a custom \n     fee arrangement. Mr. Dorr responded, ``That is correct, and \n     that was at the request of my uncle. I did not initiate \n     that.''\n       When I asked him about the determination by FSA that the \n     Trust was ``in violation of shares'' in 1993, 1994, and 1995, \n     Mr. Dorr replied, ``Well, Senator, I would simply reiterate \n     that the county committee originally reviewed this, decided \n     there was, in fact, no violation of shares. Then, ultimately, \n     it was taken to the state committee by someone, I do not know \n     who, when they determined--frankly, I view this matter, \n     $17,000, it is not a huge sum of money, and I look at it, to \n     some extent, as a tax audit.''\n       I replied, ``Mr. Dorr, I look at it differently. I look at \n     it, and I think any farmer in Minnesota who deals with these \n     programs would look at it for what you, yourself, in these \n     tapes said it was: a clearly intended attempt to violate, to \n     circumvent, or to evade these payment limitations.''\n       I continued, ``I cannot imagine that somebody could be put \n     in place of administering this agency, which is responsible \n     for all of these programs, somebody who has devoted himself \n     to try to circumvent the very regulations and laws which were \n     set up just for this reason, and where you, yourself, \n     knowingly falsified statements and documents that were \n     submitted to the Federal Government, attesting to an \n     arrangement that you, yourself were saying at the time did \n     not exist, that a different arrangement existed. That is how \n     I view it, sir.''\n       For some inexplicable reason, FSA reviewed only one trust \n     for only the years 1993 through 1995. In his testimony, Mr. \n     Dorr stated that there were actually seven different entities \n     established by Dorr family members to own and operate \n     approximately 2,200 acres of farmland in Iowa. During my \n     questioning, he acknowledged that his farming operation had \n     ``the same arrangement'' with the Harold Dorr Trust. \n     Evidently, there are other trusts or entities, perhaps even \n     more than seven, for which there have been no financial \n     audits. Even the arrangement with the trust which was found \n     to be in violation during three years was not further audited \n     for the preceding years, since Mr. Dorr himself reportedly \n     changed the certification from a crop share to a custom fee \n     arrangement.\n       Reportedly, an end of the year review (EOYR) was initiated \n     regarding Mr. Dorr's own farming operation. However, there is \n     evidently no record of that review being completed, nor is \n     there any report thereof.\n       Based upon this very incomplete review, and given the \n     definite and disturbing discrepancies cited in the one and \n     only review to date, I believe very strongly, and I ask you, \n     Mr. Chairman, that the Committee not vote on Mr. Dorr's \n     nomination until all of these other financial entities and \n     their financial transactions involving either the receipt of \n     or the disbursement of federal payments through USDA programs \n     have been reviewed during the years in question, \n     approximately 1988 through 1995. I believe that a further \n     review is necessary to ascertain that all these financial \n     arrangements which were supposedly revised after the FSA \n     determination, did in fact occur, and they have operated \n     properly thereafter.\n       Regardless of these particular findings, Mr. Chairman, I \n     remain deeply troubled by this nomination. However, I will \n     reserve my final judgment until this important information is \n     made known to me and to the other Members of this Committee.\n       Thank you in advance for your consideration of my request.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mark Dayton.\n                                  ____\n\n\nTranscript of Audio Tape Provided Upon Request From the Iowa State FSA \n      Office, Identified as: Copy of Tape Labeled ``Excerpts From \n         Conversation Between Tom Dorr and Paul Dorr 6/14/95''\n\n       The parties are identified as Person 1 (assumed to be Paul \n     Dorr) and Person 2 (assumed to be Tom Dorr).\n       The following are excerpts from a telephone conversation \n     that was recorded on June 14, 1995, occurring between Tom \n     Dorr and Paul Dorr.\n       Person 1: I, I guess I'd like to know as a beneficiary what \n     . . . you know, I know, I understand your desire to keep this \n     all out fr. . ., in the government's eyes, um, but I still \n     think there should be some sort of explanation as to how \n     these, you know exactly how this percentage, allocation is \n     broken out, how its, how its applied each year.\n       Person 2: 50/50. I charge the Trust their half of the \n     inputs, not the machine work. And I charge the, I charge the, \n     I take that back, the only machine charge, the machine charge \n     that I have charged always is $12.50 an acre for combining. \n     That was an arrangement that was entered into when dad and \n     Harold were still alive because of the high cost of combines.\n       Person 1: Yeah . . .\n       Person 2: Beside from that, uh, I take that back, and they \n     also, and we have always charged the landlords a nickel a \n     bushel to haul the grain into the elevator.\n       Person 1: Um Hmm . . .\n       Person 2: Beside those two machine charges everything is \n     done on a 50/50 normal crop share basis, it always has. And, \n     and, and frequently, quite frankly, I've, I've kicked stuff \n     in, or, you know, if there is a split that isn't quite equal \n     I always try to err on the side of the, on the side of the \n     Trust. So, that's, that's the way its been, that's the way it \n     always has been and that's the way these numbers will all \n     resolve themselves if somebody wants to sit down and go \n     through them that way;\n       Person 1: It, this was all done that way in an effort to . \n     . .\n       Person 2: . . . avoid the $50,000 payment limitation to \n     Pine Grove Farms.\n       Person 1: And . . . to, it is to your benefit to your other \n     crop acres . . .\n       Person 2: . . . that's right . . .\n       Person 1: . . . that, that um, this arrangement is set up \n     in, in such a fashion?\n       Person 2: That's correct.\n       Person 1: Uh, do we, as a Trust, um, have any risk if the \n     government ever audits such an arrangement? Or, was it done \n     your saying back when it was legal? Is it still legal?\n       Person 2: I have no idea if its legal. No one has ever \n     called me on it. I've done it this way. I've clearly kept \n     track of all paper work this way. And, uh . . .\n       Person 1: I, I understand how it works, now . . .\n       Person 2: I have no idea. I suspect if they would audit, \n     and, and somebody would decide to come in and take a look at \n     this thing, they could, they could probably if they really \n     wanted to, raise hell with us. Yep, you're absolutely right. \n     Uh, and I'm trying to find out where I've overcharged at.\n       Person 1: Well, I, I don't know what the extension service \n     includes in their, in their, um, uh, estimated figure on, on \n     machinery expense.\n       Person 2: That, that, that figure, I mean if you look at \n     that figure, and I believe, and I'd have to go back and find \n     it, but I know that I discussed this with the trustees and \n     I'm fairly certain that its in one of your annual reports. \n     Uh, that custom fee actually is not a custom fee. That's crop \n     rental income to me. That's my share of the income. I mean if \n     you just sat down and, and, and . . . (5 second pause with \n     music in background) excuse me . . .\n       Person 1: That's ok.\n       Person 2: Uh, what actually happened there was way back in, \n     uh, perhaps even 89, but no, no that was in 90 because that \n     doesn't show up until then. Either 90 or 91, uh, I refiled \n     the way the farm, the Trust land both for the Melvin Dorr \n     Trust and the, the uh, Harold Dorr Trust are operated with \n     the ASCS to, quite frankly, avoid minimum payment \n     limitations. OK?\n       Person 1: Right.\n       Person 2: And I basically told the ASCS and reregistered \n     those two operations such that they are, uh, singularly farm \n     operations on their own, OK?\n       Person 1: OK.\n       Person 2: And I custom farm it. Alright, so how are you \n     going to custom farm it? The reason I did it was, was to \n     eliminate any potential, uh, when I could still do it at that \n     point, of, of the government not liking the way I was doing \n     it. I knew what was coming. I anticipated it the same as I \n     did with proven corn yields way back in the 70's when I began \n     to prove our yields and got basis and the proven yields up. I \n     transferred these out when it was still legal and legitimate \n     to do so and basically they stand alone. Now, obviously I'm \n     not going to go out here and operate all this ground and \n     provide all this management expertise singularly, uh, for the \n     purpose of, of, of doing it on a $60 an acre custom fee \n     basis. Subsequently, what's happened is, the farm, I mean \n     the, the family Trust pays all of its expenses and then we \n     reimburse it and it sells all the income, and it sells all \n     the crop, and it reimburses us with the 50/50 split basis.\n       Person 1: I, I, I remember vaguely something being \n     discussed about that, I'll have to go back to the file . . .\n       Person 2: . . . that's exactly what's going on \n     (unintelligible) . . . those custom fees the way they are . . \n     .\n       Person 1: . . . and then to determine, um, that, that was, \n     again if that was in writing to us beneficiaries, I guess I \n     missed that and I'll, I'll look for that again. Um . . .\n       Person 2: Even if it wasn't I know that that was clearly \n     discussed with the trustees. The beneficiaries really had \n     nothing to do with it.\n       Person 1: OK, well, well, I appreciate your correcting me \n     on the interest and, uh, allocating those incomes to those \n     different years. That does make a difference with that \n     income. I think the custom fees, uh, when I took a look at \n     that one, and I, you know, I just started looking at this in \n     the last 6 weeks. When I took a look at that last figure, uh, \n     and looking back in the file, it may not hurt for you to \n     remind everybody, um, maybe even in the annual report. . . .\n       Person 2: I don't, I don't, really want to tell everybody, \n     not because I'm trying to hide the custom work fees from \n     anybody, but because I don't want to make any bigger deal out \n     of it than I have to, relative to everybody knowing about it, \n     including the government.\n       End of recording.\n                                  ____\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n           Forestry,\n                                     Washington, DC, May 17, 2002.\n     Hon. Ann M. Veneman,\n     Secretary of Agriculture,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Veneman: Thank you for your phone call \n     yesterday. To follow up on one of the matters we discussed, I \n     appreciate your understanding that, given the intense work \n     required by the farm bill conference, the Committee has not \n     had the opportunity to take further formal action on the \n     nomination of Thomas Dorr to the position of Under\n\n[[Page S8596]]\n\n     Secretary of Agriculture for Rural Development.\n       I certainly appreciate your interest in having an Under \n     Secretary for Rural Development confirmed. However, as you \n     recall there were substantial questions raised at Mr. Dorr's \n     nomination hearing and in later correspondence that will need \n     to be answered before proceeding further.\n       To my knowledge no response has been provided to the \n     questions in Senator Dayton's letter dated March 21, 2002. If \n     that is indeed the case, I would appreciate your sending to \n     Senator Dayton and to the Committee answers to the questions \n     raised in his letter. Although you and Mr. Dorr were copied \n     on the original letter you will find a copy of Senator \n     Dayton's letter attached for your information. An expeditious \n     response to Senator Dayton's request will greatly assist the \n     Committee in completing its consideration of the nomination.\n       Thank you in advance for your time and attention to this \n     matter.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                       Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n           Forestry,\n                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 2002.\n     Hon. Ann M. Veneman,\n     Secretary of Agriculture,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Veneman: Thank you for your letter dated May \n     28, 2002 regarding the nomination of Tom Dorr as Under \n     Secretary of Agriculture for Rural Development. With the hope \n     of moving this matter to resolution, I would like to clarify \n     relevant facts and the status of responses to the Committee's \n     questions.\n       To recap what is established, for many years, Mr. Dorr, \n     operating through Dorr's Pine Grove Farms (of which he was \n     sole owner), conducted farming operations on land held by the \n     Melvin Dorr Trust and the Harold Dorr Trust. In some of the \n     earlier years, the arrangements were represented to USDA by \n     Mr. Dorr as crop share leases but at some later point he \n     represented them as involving custom farming by Dorr of the \n     trusts' land.\n       The Farm Service Agency (FSA) conducted a year-end review \n     on the Melvin Dorr Trust for the years 1994 and 1995 in \n     calendar year 1996. In 2001 the FSA conducted a year-end \n     review on the Harold Dorr Trust for 1994 and 1995. In both \n     reviews, it was concluded that the arrangement between Mr. \n     Dorr's Pine Grove Farms and each of the trusts ``was a crop \n     share arrangement, not the custom farming arrangement it was \n     represented to be.'' The trusts were required to repay some \n     $17,000 in farm program payments that they had improperly \n     received for those years because of the ``erroneous \n     representation'' to USDA by Mr. Dorr, who also served as a \n     trustee of each of the trusts.\n       The conclusion that the arrangements were crop share leases \n     rather than custom farming is supported by information before \n     FSA and now before the Committee. For example, the payment to \n     Dorr, through Dorr's Pine Grove Farms, was similar to amounts \n     that would have been received through a crop share \n     arrangement and far above normal and usual custom farming \n     fees. In addition, in a tape recorded telephone conversation, \n     Mr. Dorr said, ``Besides those two machine charges [combining \n     and hauling grain to the elevator], everything else is done \n     on a 50-50 normal crop-share basis.'' He also said, ``that \n     custom fee is not a custom fee. That's crop rental income to \n     me. That's my share of the income.'' Regarding the reason the \n     arrangements were set up in this manner and represented to \n     USDA as custom farming, Mr. Dorr said it was to ``avoid a \n     50,000-dollar payment limitation to Pine Grove Farms.'' At \n     another point Mr. Dorr said, ``I, we filed the way the farm, \n     the trust land, both for the Melvin Dorr Trust and the \n     Harold Dorr Trust are operated with the ASCS, to quite \n     frankly avoid minimum [sic] payment limitations. OK?'' \n     Evidently, these arrangements and representations to USDA \n     would direct farm program payments through the trusts that \n     would have otherwise normally under a crop share \n     arrangement gone directly to Mr. Dorr through Dorr's Pine \n     Grove Farms. As to Mr. Dorr's understanding of the \n     propriety of the arrangements and representations, he \n     said, ``I suspect if they'd audit, and if somebody decided \n     to come in and take a look at this thing, they could \n     probably, if they really wanted to, raise hell with us.''\n       Because of the evidence of misrepresentation to FSA in \n     connection with the effort to avoid payment limitations, the \n     Committee was and is keenly interested in determining whether \n     there may be other instances in which Mr. Dorr may have \n     misrepresented farming arrangements in connection with \n     seeking to avoid farm program payment limitations. Questions \n     were asked at the nomination hearing, but unanswered \n     questions remained. My letter dated May 17, 2002 and Senator \n     Dayton's letter dated March 21, 2002 attempt to make clear \n     that the Committee is interested in having the FSA conduct a \n     year-end review of the Harold and Melvin Dorr Trusts for each \n     of the years 1988 through 1993.\n       In your letter of May 28, you assert that the Office of \n     Inspector General (OIG) has concluded that the Committee has \n     received all the information it is requesting and that the \n     Inspector General indicated that a ``full and thorough \n     investigation has been conducted regarding the matters \n     pertaining to Mr. Dorr . . .'' In fact, the memorandum from \n     the Acting Inspector General that you attached does not \n     support your assertion but instead contradicts it. The \n     Inspector General's memorandum clearly delineates what OIG \n     had investigated and what it had not. It had not investigated \n     the years 1988-1992, and gave no indication that the \n     Committee had been provided the information on these years it \n     is seeking. Likewise, the memorandum makes clear that OIG has \n     investigated only the matters referred to it and that it had \n     not conducted a thorough investigation of all the matters \n     relating to Mr. Dorr. I would encourage you to discuss this \n     matter further with the Acting Inspector General.\n       Thus, the Committee continues to seek information about the \n     period 1988 through 1992, during which time our understanding \n     is that the arrangements were also represented to USDA to be \n     custom farming and not crop share. We would also like to know \n     if in fact the trusts have repaid the funds required by the \n     year-end reviews already conducted as noted above.\n       It is true that the United States Attorney for the Northern \n     District of Iowa declined to prosecute Mr. Dorr upon referral \n     from the OIG, but it is the Committee's understanding that \n     the statute of limitations had run in any case. Avoiding \n     criminal prosecution, however, is only the most minimal and \n     insufficient criterion for confirming an individual to a \n     position as important as that of Under Secretary of \n     Agriculture for Rural Development. Surely, nominees must be \n     held to a higher standard.\n       Consistent with my earlier statements, I do intend to move \n     forward on Mr. Dorr's nomination, but for the Committee to do \n     so--in conformity with its obligations and responsibilities--\n     it must receive the information it reasonably requires and \n     has requested to evaluate the qualifications and fitness of \n     the nominee to serve in this important position.\n       Thank you for your attention to this request.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                       Tom Harkin,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. But critical questions remained unanswered. The materials \nprovided late in June showed that over $70,000 in farm program payments \nhad been received by the two trusts that were prior to that, from 1988 \nto 1992. So what turned up were some new questions.\n  If, in fact, Mr. Dorr had misrepresented his farming operations and \nhe had been caught and the trusts had to pay back money for 3 of those \nyears, what about the 5 years prior to that?\n  So I wrote a letter on July 24, 2002, and asked for the record on all \nthese other operations from 1988 through 1992. That was Wednesday. \nThursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday--on Monday, I received a letter back \nfrom Secretary Veneman, dated July 29, in which basically she said that \nthis issue has gone on too long, that we need to move this nominee. She \ndid not say they did not have the records. She basically said it is \ntime to move this nominee ahead.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter of July 24, \n2002, the questions I submitted and the response of the Secretary of \nAgriculture on July 29, 2002, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n           Forestry,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 2002.\n     Re nomination of Thomas C.

DORR\n\n       Question: In a letter dated May 8, 1996, you were informed \n     that your farming operation, Dorr's Pine Grove Farm Co., had \n     been selected for a 1995 farm program payment limitation and \n     payment eligibility end-of-year review. You were informed \n     that the farming operation would be reviewed to determine \n     whether the farming operation was carried out in 1995 as \n     represented on the CCC-502, Farm Operating Plan for Payment \n     Eligibility Review. You were asked to provide documents and \n     information and were further informed that if you failed to \n     provide the requested information within 30 days of the date \n     of the letter that you would be determined not ``actively \n     engaged in farming for the 1995 crop year.'' In a letter \n     dated June 1, 1996, you requested a 30-day extension of the \n     initial deadline citing weather and family concerns. In a \n     letter dated June 7, 1996, Michael W. Houston the County \n     Executive Director informed you that the Cherokee County \n     Committee approved your request to July 8, 1996 to provide \n     additional information requested by the End of Year Review \n     Committee. The only further information with regard to this \n     end-of-year review is a handwritten note in the file that \n     reads: ``Rec'd phone call from T. Dorr on 8-3-96 at home. \n     Dorr plans on completing requested info., but needs more \n     time. MWH'' Please explain in detail what information and \n     documentation you provided the county committee, when you \n     provided the requested information, and your recollection of \n     how this matter was resolved.\n       Question: According to Farm Service Agency records, for \n     most farming operations in which Dorr's Pine Grove Farm Co., \n     claimed a crop share, that share was roughly 50 percent, \n     ranging from 44.77 percent to 51 percent. However for farm \n     number 2571, Dorr's Pine Grove Farm Co. claimed a 23.6 \n     percent share in 1998 and 1999 and a 33.38 percent share in \n     2000 and 2001. Please explain in detail why the crop share \n     for farm number 2571 deviated so greatly from the customary \n     crop share.

Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition & \n         Forestry, Senate Hart Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am responding to your letter of \n     Wednesday, July 24, 2002, regarding your request for a new, \n     extensive review of records regarding Tom Dorr, the \n     President's nominee to be USDA's Under Secretary for Rural \n     Development.\n       This Department has complied with all your previous \n     requests. We have done so in a timely and responsive manner. \n     We complied when your request was expanded to include family \n     members for which Tom Dorr has no control. Now, you have \n     requested USDA to provide not only additional information on \n     Mr. Dorr, his family members, but your inquiries have \n     expanded to include extensive information from deceased and \n     elderly Iowans.\n       Mr. Chairman, I urge you to move forward on the nomination \n     of Tom Dorr by requesting the full Committee to vote on his \n     confirmation. For more than 450 days we have acted in good \n     faith in providing the Committee every bit of information \n     requested.\n       Additionally, the Department has scoured through its own \n     records, going back nearly fifteen years, at your request. We \n     have done this not once, but on several occasions to \n     cooperate with the Committee. And, we even did so after the \n     Office of Inspector General, the independent investigative \n     arm of the government, concluded that, ``we have investigated \n     the matters referred to OIG concerning Mr. Dorr fully and \n     consider this case to be closed . . . there is no new \n     evidence to warrant reexamination nor the need to open a new \n     investigation.''\n       Mr. Chairman, rural development programs are critical to \n     communities throughout America and to your home state of \n     Iowa. We are working diligently to implement a new farm bill \n     that strengthens these programs, however, this task has \n     become even more difficult without the leadership at the helm \n     of this agency.\n       As well, each time a new request comes from you and your \n     staff, we have to take valuable time and resources away from \n     our already overwhelmed Iowa Farm Service Agency staff who \n     have been working tirelessly on farm bill implementation, and \n     trying to serve Iowa farmers and ranchers, who need their \n     help for program administration.\n       This latest demand of the Iowa FSA office requests an \n     investigation into 22 separate farm entities, data from \n     hundreds of forms dating back nearly fifteen years, and even \n     information from Iowa citizens who are deceased. Quite \n     frankly, from what the staff in Iowa reports, it could take \n     several months to compile this latest request, and drain a \n     great deal of time, resources and effort away from farm bill \n     implementation and constituent services in your state.\n       Chairman Harkin, I certainly appreciate the work of the \n     Committee on our other nominees, but am very concerned as to \n     the process involved with Mr. Dorr, particularly as he has \n     received bipartisan support from members on the Committee.\n       During the past year, Mr. Dorr and his family have \n     weathered this extensive and exhaustive process. He has done \n     everything asked of the Committee and has discontinued active \n     farming and sold all his farm equipment. Mr. Dorr has been \n     through an extensive hearing process, answered every question \n     asked of him, and in good faith provided financial \n     information, as requested.\n       I understand the need for any Senate Committee to receive \n     and request information about nominees. Any person who serves \n     this nation should live by the highest of standards. It is my \n     belief that Mr. Dorr has demonstrated his ability to serve \n     and to lead. And, throughout this process of hearings and \n     inquiries, he remains a strong candidate for this position.\n       Mr. Chairman, again, this is a massive request of \n     information and I feel you have held Mr. Dorr, a fellow \n     Iowan, to a different standard. The Committee for the past \n     year has sought, and received a plethora of information \n     regarding this nominee and I urge you to allow Members to \n     consider what has been provided in moving Mr. Dorr's \n     nomination to the full Committee for a vote.\n       The best course of action is to proceed forward, take a \n     stand, and make a decision on this nomination. The \n     Department, as well as Mr. Dorr, has fully cooperated through \n     this long and extensive process. I would hope, with all due \n     respect, that you would allow Mr. Dorr and his family, the \n     opportunity to have a Committee vote on his nomination. Mr. \n     Dorr, as a proud Iowa native, is ready, able and capable of \n     serving this Department and this nation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ann M. Veneman.\n                                  ____\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n           Forestry,\n                                     Washington, DC July 29, 2002.\n     Hon. Ann M. Veneman,\n     Secretary of Agriculture, Jamie L. Whitten Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Veneman: As you said in your letter today, \n     ``Any person who serves this nation should live by the \n     highest of standards.''\n\n[[Page S8598]]\n\n       I could not agree more. For months this Committee has \n     sought without success to obtain crucial information dealing \n     with very serious farm program payment issues involving the \n     nominee Thomas C. Dorr and the Farm Service Agency. The \n     response from the nominee and from the Department of \n     Agriculture has been slow, grudging and minimal. There has \n     been no ``plethora'' of information provided to the \n     Committee.\n       Shortly after the nomination hearing, Senator Dayton's \n     letter of March 21, 2002 asked for information on the various \n     financial entities with which Mr. Dorr was involved from 1988 \n     through 1995. I wrote you on May 17 and June 6 seeking a \n     response to the Committee's questions. Your letter of June 27 \n     and attached materials left critical questions unanswered \n     and, in fact, raised further questions about farm program \n     payments and Mr. Dorr's farming arrangements that are the \n     basis for the Committee's most recent request.\n       Based on what has been provided, it is known that the \n     nominee was closely involved in misrepresentations to USDA \n     which after investigation led to the required repayment of \n     substantial amounts of farm program payments. Initially, the \n     sum involved was some $17,000, but as the Committee looked \n     further into the matter, it was made aware that another \n     amount of some $17,000 was required to be repaid. \n     Furthermore, information provided to the Committee late in \n     June shows that some $65,000 in payments (not counting \n     potential penalties and interest) were received under the \n     same circumstances that led to the required repayment of the \n     two $17,000 amounts.\n       The nominee was the self-described Chief Executive Officer \n     of Dorr's Pine Grove Farms, Inc. In that position he created \n     an exceedingly complex and convoluted web of farming business \n     arrangements. The purposes for these various arrangements is \n     not altogether clear, but according to the nominee himself in \n     the case of two Dorr family trusts the purpose was to avoid \n     the farm program payment limitation for Dorr's Pine Grove \n     Farms, Inc. It was the misrepresentations to USDA of the \n     nature of these arrangements that led to the required \n     repayment of farm program benefits. The matter was referred \n     to the United States Attorney for possible criminal \n     prosecution, but it is my understanding that the statute \n     of limitations had run.\n       Recent corporate disclosures have underscored the \n     obligation of corporate officers to play by the rules. Just \n     like any other CEO, Mr. Dorr had responsibilities, not the \n     least of which was that of fair and honest dealing with the \n     Department of Agriculture regarding farm program payments. As \n     a nominee, he also has responsibilities, chiefly to respond \n     fully and honestly to questions that bear directly on his \n     fitness to serve in a high position of honor and trust in the \n     federal government. This nominee would do well to follow the \n     advice given to other CEO's in awkward positions: come clean \n     and lay all the cards on the table.\n       Ordinarily, a nominee would be eager to cooperate fully and \n     provide the necessary information to clear up legitimate \n     questions. The responsibility is the nominee's. It is not the \n     responsibility of the Committee to issue subpoenas and pursue \n     litigation-type discovery to get to the bottom of valid \n     questions about a nominee. However, instead of cooperation, \n     this Committee has only seen delay, unresponsiveness and now \n     outright refusal regarding this nomination. The length of \n     time it has taken to consider this nomination lies squarely \n     at the doorstep of the nominee and the Department.\n       After much effort by the Committee to obtain answers to \n     serious and legitimate questions, it is now clear that \n     neither the nominee nor the Department intends to cooperate \n     further with the Committee. Therefore the Committee will have \n     to make a decision based on the troubling and inadequate \n     information it has. I intend to bring the nomination before \n     the Committee on Thursday to consider whether this nominee in \n     his dealings with USDA and with this Committee does indeed \n     ``meet the highest standards.''\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, what I am saying is, let's try to boil \nthis down. Thomas Dorr, in 1988, went into his local USDA office and \nrefiled his farming operations. He said: No longer am I crop sharing \nwith the trusts, I am custom farming. That meant that more money would \ngo to the trusts and that payments to those trusts would not count \nagainst his farming operations payment limitations.\n  In 1995, his brother taped this conversation. He went to the Farm \nService Agency. They investigated and found, indeed, that Thomas Dorr \nhad misrepresented his operations, and the family trusts had to pay \nback nearly $17,000 in 1996.\n  Then after he got the nomination, a further investigation ensued and \nfound the other family trust also had to pay back over $17,000. This \nwas in 2001. Well, this is only for the years 1993 through 1995. So the \nfamily trusts paid $33,782. However, I asked about those other years, \nthe years prior to 1993: 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1992; give us the \nrecords for all of these different operations. That is what the \nDepartment of Agriculture would not give us. They would not give us \nthose records.\n  So we know that the farm payments to one of the trusts from 1988 to \n1992 were $35,377. We also know that payments to another trust from \n1993 were $35,025. What I am saying is if in fact Thomas Dorr's \noperations were the same during those earlier years as they were in \n1994, 1995, and 1996, for which the family trusts had to pay back the \nmoney, Mr. Dorr's family may owe as much as $104,184 to the Federal \nGovernment rather than the 30-some-thousand dollars the trusts had to \npay back earlier. We do not know for certain. Because I have never seen \nthe records. I have asked repeatedly for the Department to make those \nrecords clear.\n  Again, my bottom line on this nominee, No. 1, this is an important \nposition. No. 2, he falsified his documents to the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture in order to obtain money. His family had to pay some of it \nback. We cannot get the records from the Department of Agriculture to \nsee what may be owed for the years before, and yet we are being asked \nto confirm this individual as Under Secretary for Rural Development.\n  As I said, I take no pleasure in opposing this nominee. I have never \nbefore opposed an Iowan for any position. This has nothing to do with \nideology. It has nothing to do with that. I have supported many \nconservatives from Iowa for positions in the Federal Government. My \nbottom line is, someone who knowingly misrepresented the truth to the \nFederal Government to obtain money, who was caught at it, which had to \nbe paid back, who by his own words on tape said he did it to avoid farm \npayment limitations, I do not think that person ought to receive an \nunder secretary's position in the Department of Agriculture.\n  What message does it send to farmers? Go out and defraud the \nGovernment, just be careful and do not get caught. What a terrible \nsituation.\n  I have no problem with any farmer arranging his or her farming \noperation to get maximum payments within the law from the Government. \nThere is nothing wrong with that. But that is not what he did. He \nknowingly filed false documents with the Government. That is what is \nwrong. That is why someone such as that does not deserve to be under \nsecretary.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. First, I want to commend the Senator for his integrity \nand his courage in standing up. I know, as the Senator said, this is an \nunpleasant matter and that is why I wanted to bring to light, having \nserved with the distinguished Senator, now ranking member but then \nchairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, is my recollection \ncorrect that this matter was brought to light in a front-page story \nexpose by the leading newspaper in Iowa? This was not a matter that was \na partisan trying to find information about somebody, this was brought \nforth by the newspaper itself?\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is right. The Des Moines Register did expose \nthis story. At that time they had the tape of the telephone \nconversation. That is how it came to light at that time. It was based \non that and then based upon the investigations at that time in 1996.\n  Then in 2001, after he got nominated, the OIG went further and found \nfurther discrepancies in 1994, and 1995, for which the other family \ntrust had to pay back more money. Well, when 2001 goes into 2002, that \nis when they referred it to the U.S. Attorney's Office for prosecution. \nThe U.S. Attorney, as I said, wrote a one page declaratory letter \nsaying the statute of limitations has passed.\n  That is when everything was dropped. After that, we began to ask more \nquestions in 2002, and as the Senator from Minnesota referred to, I \nwrote a letter to the Secretary asking for these records. I followed up \nwith a letter in July further asking for these records, and we have \nnever to this date received those records of the prior years to see \nwhat his filings were like and how much money had been paid in those \nprevious years based on misrepresentations.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Would the Senator yield for another question?\n\n[[Page S8599]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would be delighted to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DAYTON. During the time the Senator referenced, I believe the \nSenator was the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. It was \nthe responsibility of the administration to perform the due diligence \nnecessary to investigate all of the relevant factors, the background of \nthis gentleman, Mr. Dorr, but especially it was then the responsibility \nof the oversight committee of the Senate, the Agriculture Committee, of \nwhich the Senator was chairman, to look into these matters. I again \ncommend the Senator for taking on that responsibility as the chairman \nof the committee and doing it so forthrightly.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend from Minnesota for his great work on \nthe Agriculture Committee and for again trying to bring to light what \nwent on with this whole matter. Again, I say to my friend from \nMinnesota, I take no delight in this. I have never before opposed an \nIowan and I do not take any joy in this, either. But some things rise \nabove party, some things rise above our own feelings about our State \nand our pride in our own State. I think this rises above that. This \nrises to the level of saying whether someone with that kind of \nbackground deserves to be Under Secretary for Rural Development.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, our colleagues from Iowa, Mr. Dorr's home \nState, have laid out very divergent views and analysis of the nominee's \nbackground and temperament. I will not expand on those, as this body \nhas already spent considerable time and energy on this topic.\n  Rural America is changing a great deal. Changes in immigration, \nemployment patterns, technology, health care, and the economy are \ncontinually reshaping the contours of rural America. The challenges are \nmany and the Under Secretary for Rural Development can have \nconsiderable impact on those challenges. It is a position that demands \nforesight, judgment, and willingness to embrace change creatively.\n  I will not be endorsing the Dorr nomination. But I recognize the \nPresident's authority to make such nominations. And as the ranking \nmember of the Senate Subcommittee on Agriculture Appropriations, I \nstand ready to work constructively with him on issues of mutual \nconcern.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Tom Dorr to be \nconfirmed as Under Secretary for USDA Rural Development. He is a \nproduct of rural America from the greater northern-Missouri area often \nreferred to as Iowa. He is a farmer, a businessman, and a tireless \ninnovator who understands and holds true to the values that embody the \nvery essence of life in rural America. Having had the privilege to meet \nwith Mr. Dorr on several occasions, I have been impressed with his \nmind, his insight, his leadership, his passion, and his vision which is \ncritical to the future of rural communities in Missouri and throughout \nthe nation.\n  Mr. Dorr has lead USDA Rural Development's renewable energy efforts, \nfrom increasing value-added agricultural ventures to ensuring that our \nfarmers, ranchers and rural businesses have access to capital needed to \nimprove their energy efficiency and create new energy systems. He \nunderstands it is an effective way for utilizing our Nation's natural \nresources, and it is critical for the security of our country.\n  Most importantly, Tom Dorr has worked to build coalitions amongst \nGovernment agencies to share their expertise and resources to bring to \nthe table a wider array of Government resources that can ensure that \nour Nation's renewable energy needs are met. We need his continued \nfocus and leadership.\n  Tom Dorr has come to my home state of Missouri and met with community \nleaders and seen first hand how USDA Rural Development investments are \nmaking a difference. He has listened to our leaders, and he will use \nthat insight to help him direct future rural development activities. \nMr. Dorr understands that rural development doesn't happen in \nWashington, it happens in the community and he understands that the \nfuture innovative thinking.\n  With this confirmation process, he will never have to prove his \npatience and determination in any other way. I believe he is the \ncreative and active force that is needed to ensure that rural America \nanticipates and seizes the opportunities of a rapidly-evolving future \nand I urge his approval.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination \nof Thomas C. Dorr to be Under Secretary for Rural Development and a \nmember of the Commodity Credit Corporation board at the Department of \nAgriculture, USDA. The position at USDA to which Mr. Dorr has been \nnominated is highly influential in the continued development of rural \nAmerica, holding the unique responsibility of coordinating Federal \nassistance to rural areas of the Nation.\n  Many people, when they think of rural America, may think of small \ntowns, miles of rivers and streams, and perhaps farm fields. But rural \nWisconsin is also characterized by communities in need of firefighting \nequipment, seniors who need access to affordable healthcare services, \nand low-income families in need of a home. The U.S. Department of \nAgriculture's Rural Development programs and services can help \nindividuals, families, and communities address these and other \nconcerns, which is why the office of Under Secretary for Rural \nDevelopment is so important.\n  I have deep concerns regarding Mr. Dorr's comments and opinions about \nthe future of rural America, particularly in light of his nomination to \nthis important post. I disagree with Mr. Dorr's promotion of large \ncorporate farms and his vision of the future of agriculture. \nNevertheless, when it comes to confirming presidential nominees for \npositions advising the President, I will act in accordance with what I \nfeel is the proper constitutional role of the Senate. I believe that \nthe Senate should allow a President to appoint people to advise him who \nshare his philosophy and principles. My approach to judicial \nnominations, of course, is different--nominees for lifetime positions \nin the judicial branch warrant particularly close scrutiny.\n  My objections to this nomination are not simply based on the \nnominee's views, however. I also have strong reservations about Mr. \nDorr's public comments on issues of race and ethnicity and I am \ntroubled by Mr. Dorr's apparent and admitted abuse of the Government's \nfarm programs. While I acknowledge Mr. Dorr's recent apology, his \ninsensitive remarks and ethical record are not compatible with the \nimportant position to which he has been nominated, and I will oppose \nhis nomination.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I rise to support the nomination of \nTom Dorr for Under Secretary for Rural Development in the Department of \nAgriculture.\n  Thomas Dorr, with his powerful vision for rural America, with his \nproven leadership as Under Secretary, and with the trust that so many \nhave placed on him, is more than qualified to be confirmed by the \nSenate.\n  Let me provide a little background information on this nomination \nprocess since President Bush took office in 2001. On March 22, 2001, \nPresident Bush announced his intention to nominate Tom Dorr to serve as \nthe Under Secretary of Rural Development. During that year, three \nnomination hearings were scheduled and then canceled; finally, during \nthe August 2002 recess, the President appointed Mr. Dorr as \nUndersecretary.\n  During Mr. Dorr's tenure as Under Secretary, it has been his \nleadership and dedication that led to the long list of improvements \nthat increased economic opportunity and improved the quality of life in \nrural America.\n  He tackled the very complicated and difficult problems involved in \nthe Multi-Family Housing Program that, according to the one \ncongressional staff member, ``were ignored by all previous Under \nSecretaries''--he believes all rural citizens deserve safe and secure \nhousing.\n  Dorr initiated an aggressive marketing program to extend the outreach \nof USDA Rural Development programs to more deserving rural Americans \nand qualified organizations, especially minorities.\n  Also while he served as Under Secretary, Mr. Dorr supported the use \nof\n\n[[Page S8600]]\n\nrenewable energy, which led to millions of dollars in grants to develop \nrenewable energy sources; Mr. Dorr boosted the morale of USDA Rural \nDevelopment employees; Mr. Dorr aided in the development of community \nwater/wastewater infrastructure--and the list goes on.\n  After his temporary position as Under Secretary, Tom Dorr has \ncompletely resurfaced USDA Rural Development. This is a result of his \nvision for USDA Rural Development. During his term, Mr. Dorr changed \nUSDA Rural Development from being the lender of last resort to one \nwhere employees aggressively seek out investments to make in people and \norganizations that will fulfill its mission.\n  On June 18, 2003, the Agriculture Committee recommended Mr. Dorr to \nthe Senate on a bi-partisan vote of 14-7. On December 19, 2003 the full \nSenate failed to break Senator Harkin's hold on the nomination by a \nvote of 57-39, six Democrats and fifty-one Republicans. Since the \nattempted cloture, President Bush again nominated Tom Dorr in January \nof this year, only for Mr. Dorr to meet more of the same from the \nSenate.\n  One Senator has held up the confirmation since April 30, 2001, and \nafter President Bush has nominated a qualified candidate for this \nposition three times, we still have yet to see an up or down vote. \nDespite the fact that Tom Dorr has proven his leadership as Under \nSecretary, some have still insisted on using the politics of \nobstruction and partisanship to keep Mr. Dorr from receiving \nconfirmation in this Senate.\n  For my State of Oklahoma, the strong leadership of Thomas Dorr \nresulted in an increase of millions of dollars in rural development.\n  Mr. Dorr's leadership for Rural Development included an aggressive \noutreach program to rural residents in need of assistance and an \ninnovative effort to leverage more appropriated dollars into program \ndollars. In fact, Rural Development receives from Congress annual \nbudget authority of about $1.9 billion, and they turn it into $15 \nbillion in program dollars. This includes the administrative money for \nthe agency. In other words, Rural Development takes 12 cents and turns \nit into a dollar of assistance for rural economic development efforts, \nwhich is a level of efficiency difficult to find in most Federal \nagencies. During his term, Mr. Dorr encouraged the increased use of \nguaranteed loan programs versus grants to achieve this efficiency as \nwell as very strict tracking of loan servicing.\n  In other words, Rural Development ``invests'' its dollars expecting a \nreturn on investment, rather than just throwing money at communities \nand hope they fix themselves.\n  I have seen many of these projects first hand in Oklahoma, from \nrevolving loan funds to business incubators to new water systems. Loans \nmatched with grants with realistic expectations from Rural Development \npartners is what I see as I tour rural Oklahoma. It takes visionary \nleadership to achieve this, and for a short time in 2002 and 2003, Mr. \nDorr provided this leadership. It is still needed in this important \nagency.\n\n  What Mr. Dorr's vision has meant for Oklahoma is an increase in \nfunding assistance. Oklahoma's Program Level in the past 4 years has \ngone from $193 million to $322 million. Business Programs have \nincreased 500 percent, Housing Programs have doubled, and all of this \nis attributable to the outreach efforts encouraged by Mr. Dorr as well \nas the leveraging efforts he has put in place to allow each Federal \ndollar to go further.\n  Mr. Dorr has also made several visits to Oklahoma providing technical \nassistance on ethanol production, which may lead to the development of \nour first ethanol plant in our State. He has also met with our Rural \nHealth Care Providers in Oklahoma to help bridge the gap between rural \nhealth needs and resources available from Rural Development.\n  Mr. Dorr is supported by many of our rural advocacy groups in \nOklahoma as exemplified by the following quotes:\n  Ernest Holloway, President of Langston University Oklahoma's 1890 \nCollege:\n\n       Langston University has a direct stake in improving \n     economic opportunities in rural Oklahoma . . . It is critical \n     that we have strong and creative leadership at the Department \n     of Agriculture in the Rural Development Mission Area. We \n     strongly support Thomas C. Dorr for the position of Under \n     Secretary for Rural Development.\n\n  Ray Wulf, President of Oklahoma Farmers Union, that includes 48 \npercent of the membership of the National Farmers Union:\n\n     . . . (Mr. Dorr) visited our state office here in Oklahoma \n     City. During that meeting we had a very fruitful discussion \n     relative to rural development and the creation of ethanol and \n     oilseed opportunities within the state. He shared several \n     rural development experiences within his own home state and \n     demonstrated his expertise relative to those projects . . . \n     we can see the value in having Mr. Dorr's expertise and \n     experiences put to work on behalf of rural America. We trust \n     that you will equally find such favor with Tom Dorr when he \n     is considered for confirmation by the United States Senate.\n\n  Jeramy Rich, Director of Public Policy for the Oklahoma Farm Bureau:\n\n       Mr. Dorr has proven that he has the passion, skill and \n     experience to lead the USDA's Rural Development efforts. Mr. \n     Dorr has been a leading advocate for the value-added and \n     sustainable agriculture that has benefited small family \n     farmers and offered them an opportunity to remain \n     competitive. In addition, he has pushed the Department to \n     provide more creative outreach to minorities in order to \n     ensure their full participation in USDA Rural Development \n     program . . . Our members need Tom Dorr's leadership at USDA \n     Rural Development.\n\n  Mr. Dorr also has the strong support of Oklahoma's Rural Development \nState Director, Brent Kisling:\n\n       The fact that the President continues to stand by Mr. Dorr \n     since 2001 is a true testimony to the confidence he has in \n     the abilities of Thomas C. Dorr.\n\n  With all of the confidence that has been placed on Tom Dorr and with \nthe incredible results that Mr. Dorr has delivered, I believe that he \nis capable of doing the job that rural America deserves.\n  The nomination process is supposed to be one of bipartisanship, where \nthe Senate is given the opportunity to evaluate the credentials and to \nassess the competence of the nominee. Instead, this process has been \nskewed and perverted by Senator Harkin and others that stand only for \nobstruction.\n  To some, it seems that the confirmation of Thomas Dorr has been a \nsmall, unimportant matter. To the agriculture industry, to the people \nof my State of Oklahoma, and to the people of rural America, this \nconfirmation is not a small matter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my remarks be inserted into the \nCongressional Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask unanimous consent that no time be charged against either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, the Senate Agriculture Committee has \nheld two exhaustive hearings on the nomination of Tom Dorr to be Under \nSecretary of Rural Development. One of those hearings was held under \nthe previous chairman's direction and a subsequent hearing was held \nearlier this year during my tenure as chairman, from which two issues \nwere raised. The issues have been thoroughly explained by the Senator \nfrom Iowa in his previous comments, and based upon the two \nsignificant--and I do not want to minimize them--concerns the Senator \nfrom Iowa has, we have made a presentation. When I say ``we,'' the \nSenator from Delaware, Mr. Carper, has been invaluable in helping us \nwork through this process. Over the past 24 hours we have had \nconversations with Mr. Dorr and based upon those conversations, we have \na letter in hand dated today to me as chairman of the committee, in \nwhich Mr. Dorr basically acknowledges a statement he made in 1999 that \nraised concerns of some people. He has rendered a public apology \nregarding the comments he made.\n  He further says in this statement: Regarding farm program payment \nissues, what I did was wrong. I regret I did it. If I had to do it \nover, I would not have filed my farming operations as I\n\n[[Page S8601]]\n\ndid with the Farm Service Agency. I hope other farmers learn from what \nI did.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 21, 2005.\n     Hon. Saxby Chambliss,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and \n         Forestry, Russell Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Chambliss: Regarding the Senate's \n     consideration of my nomination to be Under Secretary of \n     Agriculture for Rural Development, it is apparent there are \n     concerns I should address.\n       First, I want to address a statement I made about diversity \n     at a meeting at Iowa State University in December of 1999. \n     The comment was not intended to be hurtful, I now realize \n     that to many people it has been, and for this I apologize. I \n     have been brought up to respect all people and my track \n     record at USDA supports this belief. I have worked hard all \n     my life to heal diversity issues and offer equal \n     opportunities to all with whom I've been associated. I have \n     been particularly involved in addressing these issues while \n     serving at the Department.\n       Regarding farm program payment issues, what I did was \n     wrong. I regret that I did it. If I had to do it over, I \n     would not have filed my farming operations as I did with the \n     Farm Service Agency. I hope that other farmers learn from \n     what I did.\n       Thank you for your counsel and continued support of my \n     nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Thomas C. Dorr.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Iowa that he \nhas been very diligent in his pursuit of this. As someone who has been \nintegrally involved in American agriculture for almost 40 years, I \nappreciate his diligence because we need to make sure that people who \nare in the administration at the U.S. Department of Agriculture are \nrespected and that they are the types of individuals who we need in \nthese positions.\n  I know Mr. Dorr. I have seen Mr. Dorr in action, so to speak, in his \nposition that he has been in for the last 4\\1/2\\ years. He is well \nrespected across the country in the agriculture community because of \nthe great work he has done. He is qualified for this position and I am \ngoing to support his nomination.\n  Before I yield 5 minutes to Senator Harkin, which I will do, I would \nbe happy to yield to my friend from Delaware for any comments he wishes \nto make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I convey to Senator Chambliss my respect \nand regards for the way he has handled himself in these negotiations \nover the last 24 hours. Senator Harkin has done us all a favor. What he \nhas done is reminded us when people make a mistake--and we all make \nmistakes. God knows I do--we ought to be willing to acknowledge \nthat. There are serious mistakes, as I think Mr. Dorr has made with \nrespect to his comments about diversity and minorities, and things Mr. \nDorr has done with respect to his own farming operation regarding \nminimum payments. He made serious mistakes. There was a period of time \nwhen it looked as though he wasn't willing to acknowledge those \nmistakes, at least to do so in the public forum. If someone makes \nmistakes of this magnitude, it doesn't mean they are forever denied the \nopportunity for public service. What it means is when their name comes \nbefore this Senate for confirmation for a senior position, in this case \nin the Department of Agriculture, that person should be held \naccountable for their mistakes. They should be willing to acknowledge \ntheir mistakes and they should be willing, essentially, to ask for \nforgiveness for those mistakes.\n\n  It is not always an easy thing to do. Mr. Dorr has made that \nacknowledgment. He said, I was wrong; what I did was wrong and I hope \nothers learn from my mistakes.\n  It now falls to Senator Harkin who, as we all know, has fought hard \nagainst this nomination, as to whether to accept this letter from Mr. \nDorr for us to move forward to the actual vote on the nomination.\n  I want to say to Tom Harkin, thank you for the way you handled \nyourself in the course of this debate over the last 4 years, for the \nimportant role you have played, and for your willingness to allow this \nnomination to come to a vote today.\n  With that having been said, I yield my time and thank the Senator \nfrom Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I again thank the Senator from Delaware \nfor his terrific work on this and other issues. Without his assistance \nthis compromise would not have come together.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, first of all, that Senator \nHarkin be given 5 minutes following my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Second, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \ncloture motion be vitiated, provided further that upon the use or \nyielding back of the remaining debate time, the Senate proceed to a \nvote on the nomination. I further ask consent that following that vote \nthe Senate proceed to an immediate vote on Calendar No. 102, the \nnomination of Thomas Dorr to be a member of the Board of Directors of \nthe Commodity Credit Corporation and that the vote be by voice; \nprovided further that, following that vote, the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes which I want to yield to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to granting an additional 2 \nminutes to the Senator from Minnesota?\n  Hearing none, the Senator from Iowa is recognized for 5 minutes, to \nbe followed by the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. HARKIN. First, let me pay my respects and express my gratitude to \nmy chairman and friend, Senator Chambliss. We have worked together on \nall matters of agriculture. He is a great chairman of our Agriculture \nCommittee and I mean that most sincerely. He has given me and my staff \nevery opportunity to work not just on this issue but all the other \nissues in agriculture. He has been most accommodating of every request \nI have ever asked. I could not have asked for more in terms of pursuing \ninterests on the Agriculture Committee. I publicly thank Chairman \nChambliss for being a great chairman and being a great agricultural \nleader. I appreciate that very much.\n  I appreciate his leadership on this issue also. When you get into \nthese kinds of things, it is never a happy situation for anyone on \nthese kinds of matters. But we all have our responsibilities. As I \nsaid, the chairman has been right in allowing these investigations and \nallowing this matter to move forward in an open and transparent matter. \nAgain, for that I am very deeply grateful.\n  I thank my friend from Delaware for his diligence in looking into \nthis and again, for, as we say, trying to move the ball down the field, \nas you might say. I want to make it clear for the record that all we \nare talking about here is vitiating the cloture vote. I also want to \nmake it clear this letter is a letter in which finally Mr. Dorr says:\n\n       Regarding farm program payment issues, what I did was \n     wrong. I regret that I did it. If I had it to do over, I \n     would not have filed my farming operations as I did with the \n     Farm Service Agency. I hope that other farmers learn from \n     what I did.\n\n  That is the first time Mr. Dorr has ever said what he did was wrong \nand I am glad he finally owned up to it. But, again, let's not get \ncarried away. This letter doesn't make Mr. Dorr pure as the driven \nsnow. Frankly, I still have concerns that we have never gotten the \nrecords from the Department of Agriculture on the previous years. But \nwith a sense of accommodation and comity here in the Senate, I have \nagreed, working with Senator Chambliss and others, to move this ahead. \nI will not object. I did not object to the unanimous consent on \nvitiating the cloture vote.\n  I want to be very clear, however, that I still cannot in good \nconscience vote for the nominee. I will not support the nominee for \nthis position. But I will not pursue any further extended debate on the \nnominee.\n  Sometimes people have deathbed conversions. The problem is sometimes \nthe patient recovers. I hope this is not just one of those deathbed \nconversions on the part of Mr. Dorr. As the ranking member of the \nAgriculture Committee,\n\n[[Page S8602]]\n\nI will be checking very carefully on how he carries out his \nresponsibilities if in fact he wins the vote. I don't even know if that \nis a foregone conclusion. I assume it is, if all of the other party \nvote to confirm. I don't know. But if he does take this position, I can \nassure you we will be carefully looking at how he carries out his \nresponsibilities at the Department of Agriculture. We may still want to \ntake a look at those earlier records.\n  I want to make it clear, I still do not think Mr. Dorr meets the \nstandards, the highest standards, as Secretary Veneman said, for this \nposition, but at least with this admission that what he did was wrong, \nthat he has apologized for the statements he made on diversity, I \nbelieve that is at least enough for us to get past the cloture vote and \nto move to an up-or-down vote on this nominee.\n  With that, again, in the spirit of comity and trying to move this \nball ahead, we will do that. I thank Chairman Chambliss for all of his \nwork and his efforts in this regard.\n  I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I express my admiration to the Senator \nfrom Iowa for his willingness to make this accommodation. Those \nwatching, who wonder whether we do act in the spirit of bipartisan \ncooperation, can note this as one of those instances. I share, however, \nthe concern of the Senator about the timing of this admission by Mr. \nDorr.\n  The first hearing of the Senate Agriculture Committee on the original \nnomination was, I believe, in March of 2002. That is over 3 years ago. \nIf Mr. Dorr had made this kind of acknowledgment in this letter back \nthen, this matter would have been resolved some time ago. Instead, the \ncommittee records will show during that time, and I believe at the \nsubsequent hearing--which I did not attend but I believe the record \nshows happened earlier this year--he said exactly the opposite. He \ndenied any culpability, he denied doing anything wrong, he denied any \nresponsibility for anything that might have occurred inadvertently. \nThis is a direct contradiction of that and it does occur, as the \nSenator noted, at the very last instant before this matter was going to \nbe voted for cloture--and I think it is seriously in doubt whether \ncloture would have been invoked, in which case that nomination would \nhave been in limbo as it was previously, which led to a recess \nappointment.\n  I also, with reluctance but out of necessity, will vote against this \nnominee. Again, I commend the Senator from Iowa, but I think in this \nmatter this is a highly suspect maneuver at the very last instant.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Thomas C. Dorr, of Iowa, to be Under Secretary of Agriculture for \nRural Development.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 62, nays 38, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 198 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--62\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Roberts\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--38\n\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  Mr. WARNER.

SUPPORT FOR YOUTH ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Support \n     Our Scouts Act of 2005''.\n       (b) Support for Youth Organizations.--\n       (1) Definitions.--In this subsection--\n       (A) the term ``Federal agency'' means each department, \n     agency, instrumentality, or other entity of the United States \n     Government; and\n       (B) the term ``youth organization''--\n       (i) means any organization that is designated by the \n     President as an organization that is primarily intended to--\n\n       (I) serve individuals under the age of 21 years;\n       (II) provide training in citizenship, leadership, physical \n     fitness, service to community, and teamwork; and\n       (III) promote the development of character and ethical and \n     moral values; and\n\n[[Page S8603]]\n\n       (ii) shall include--\n\n       (I) the Boy Scouts of America;\n       (II) the Girl Scouts of the United States of America;\n       (III) the Boys Clubs of America;\n       (IV) the Girls Clubs of America;\n       (V) the Young Men's Christian Association;\n       (VI) the Young Women's Christian Association;\n       (VII) the Civil Air Patrol;\n       (VIII) the United States Olympic Committee;\n       (IX) the Special Olympics;\n       (X) Campfire USA;\n       (XI) the Young Marines;\n       (XII) the Naval Sea Cadets Corps;\n       (XIII) 4-H Clubs;\n       (XIV) the Police Athletic League;\n       (XV) Big Brothers--Big Sisters of America; and\n       (XVI) National Guard Youth Challenge.\n\n       (2) In general.--\n       (A) Support for youth organizations.--No Federal law \n     (including any rule, regulation, directive, instruction, or \n     order) shall be construed to limit any Federal agency from \n     providing any form of support for a youth organization \n     (including the Boy Scouts of America or any group officially \n     affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America) that would result \n     in that Federal agency providing less support to that youth \n     organization (or any similar organization chartered under the \n     chapter of title 36, United States Code, relating to that \n     youth organization) than was provided during the preceding \n     fiscal year.\n       (B) Types of support.--Support described under this \n     paragraph shall include--\n       (i) holding meetings, camping events, or other activities \n     on Federal property;\n       (ii) hosting any official event of such organization;\n       (iii) loaning equipment; and\n       (iv) providing personnel services and logistical support.\n       (c) Support for Scout Jamborees.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (A) Section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the \n     United States commits exclusively to Congress the powers to \n     raise and support armies, provide and maintain a Navy, and \n     make rules for the government and regulation of the land and \n     naval forces.\n       (B) Under those powers conferred by section 8 of article I \n     of the Constitution of the United States to provide, support, \n     and maintain the Armed Forces, it lies within the discretion \n     of Congress to provide opportunities to train the Armed \n     Forces.\n       (C) The primary purpose of the Armed Forces is to defend \n     our national security and prepare for combat should the need \n     arise.\n       (D) One of the most critical elements in defending the \n     Nation and preparing for combat is training in conditions \n     that simulate the preparation, logistics, and leadership \n     required for defense and combat.\n       (E) Support for youth organization events simulates the \n     preparation, logistics, and leadership required for defending \n     our national security and preparing for combat.\n       (F) For example, Boy Scouts of America's National Scout \n     Jamboree is a unique training event for the Armed Forces, as \n     it requires the construction, maintenance, and disassembly of \n     a ``tent city'' capable of supporting tens of thousands of \n     people for a week or longer. Camporees at the United States \n     Military Academy for Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts provide \n     similar training opportunities on a smaller scale.\n       (2) Support.--Section 2554 of title 10, United States Code, \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(i)(1) The Secretary of Defense shall provide at least \n     the same level of support under this section for a national \n     or world Boy Scout Jamboree as was provided under this \n     section for the preceding national or world Boy Scout \n     Jamboree.\n       ``(2) The Secretary of Defense may waive paragraph (1), if \n     the Secretary--\n       ``(A) determines that providing the support subject to \n     paragraph (1) would be detrimental to the national security \n     of the United States; and\n       ``(B) reports such a determination to the Congress in a \n     timely manner, and before such support is not provided.''.\n       (d) Equal Access for Youth Organizations.--Section 109 of \n     the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. \n     5309) is amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence of subsection (b) by inserting \n     ``or (e)'' after ``subsection (a)''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e) Equal Access.--\n       ``(1) Definition.--In this subsection, the term `youth \n     organization' means any organization described under part B \n     of subtitle II of title 36, United States Code, that is \n     intended to serve individuals under the age of 21 years.\n       ``(2) In general.--No State or unit of general local \n     government that has a designated open forum, limited public \n     forum, or nonpublic forum and that is a recipient of \n     assistance under this chapter shall deny equal access or a \n     fair opportunity to meet to, or discriminate against, any \n     youth organization, including the Boy Scouts of America or \n     any group officially affiliated with the Boy Scouts of \n     America, that wishes to conduct a meeting or otherwise \n     participate in that designated open forum, limited public \n     forum, or nonpublic forum.''.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this amendment deals with an issue I have \nbeen working on with a number of Senators for a long period of time, \nmany months. It deals with an organization I have been involved with \nfor my entire life--myself and my three boys. The organization is the \nBoy Scouts of America.\n  I am proud to offer the Support Our Scouts Act of 2005 as an \namendment to the Defense authorization bill. This legislation will \nensure that the Defense Department will continue to provide the Scouts \nthe type of support it has provided in the past, including jamborees on \nbases.\n  Pentagon support for Scouts is currently authorized in U.S. law.\n  This bill also ensures Scouts have equal access to public facilities, \nforums, and programs that are open to a variety of other youth \norganizations and community organizations. Boy Scouts, like other \nnonprofit youth organizations, depend on the ability to use public \nfacilities and to participate in these programs and forums. Why am I \noffering this legislation? Since the Supreme Court decided Boy Scouts \nof America v. Dale, Boy Scouts of America's relationships with \ngovernment at all levels have been the target of multiple lawsuits.\n  The Federal Government has been defending a lawsuit brought by the \nACLU aimed at severing the ties between Boy Scouts and the Departments \nof Defense and HUD. The ACLU of Illinois claims that Defense Department \nsponsorship violates the first amendment because the Scouts are a \nreligious organization. This is a red herring.\n  The Scouts are a youth organization that is committed to developing \nqualities, such as patriotism, integrity, loyalty, honesty, and other \nvalues, in our Nation's boys and young men. Part of that development is \nasking them to acknowledge a higher authority regardless of \ndenomination.\n  We do this every day in the Senate when we open the Senate floor each \nmorning, when we take our oaths of office, when our young men and women \nenlist in the Armed Forces--and the list goes on. Such acknowledgement \nand respect is an integral part of our culture, our values, and our \ntraditions.\n  A decision was recently reached in this case. A U.S. district court \nin Chicago ruled that Pentagon support of the Scouts violates the \nestablishment clause and, therefore, the Defense Department is \nprohibited from providing support to the Scouts at future jamborees.\n  The timing of this ruling simply could not be worse. On Monday, July \n25, thousands of Scouts from around the country will be arriving at \nFort AP Hill, close by, in Virginia. The event will draw 40,000 Scouts \nand their leaders and many more proud families, moms and dads.\n  This latest ruling is part of a series of attempts to undermine \nScouting's interaction with government in America at all levels. The \neffect of these attempts of exclusion at the Federal, State, and local \nlevels could be far-reaching. Already, it has had a chilling effect on \ngovernment relationships with Scouts, and it is the greatest legal \nchallenge facing Boy Scouts today.\n  The Support Our Scouts Act of 2005 addresses these issues. To begin \nwith, my amendment makes clear that the Congress regards the Boy Scouts \nto be a youth organization that should be treated the same as other \nnational youth organizations.\n  Second, this bill asserts the view of the Congress that Pentagon \nsupport to the Scouts at their jamborees, as well as similar support to \nother youth organizations, is important to the training of our Armed \nForces. It contributes to--it does not detract from--their readiness.\n  Third, my amendment removes any doubt that Federal agencies may \nwelcome Scouts to hold meetings, go camping on Federal property, or \nhold Scouting events in public forums at any level.\n  The Scout bill has been discussed with the Defense Department. While \nit includes language that establishes baseline Pentagon support for \nScouting activities, it also offers the Secretary of Defense some \nflexibility in its application.\n  Since 1910, Boy Scout membership has totaled more than 110 million \nyoung Americans. Today, more than 3.2 million young people and 1.2 \nmillion adults are members of the Boy Scouts and are dedicated to \nfulfilling the Boy Scouts' mission. This unique American institution is \ncommitted to preparing\n\n[[Page S8604]]\n\nour youth for the future by instilling in them such values as honesty, \nintegrity, and character. Through exposure to the outdoors, hard work, \nand the virtues of civic duty, the Boy Scouts has developed millions of \nAmericans into superb citizens and future leaders.\n  Today, there are more than 40 Members of the Senate and more than 150 \nMembers of the House of Representatives who have been directly involved \nin Scouting. I was a Boy Scout. As I mentioned, my three boys, \nHarrison, Jonathan, and Bryan, all were Scouts as well. Scouting is a \ngreat American tradition that has been shared by countless families \nover many decades.\n  I believe this amendment will receive broad, bipartisan support in \nboth the Senate and the House. I believe we will pass it this year. It \ncurrently has over 50 cosponsors in this body. I encourage others to \ncome and cosponsor this bill and to come to the floor and speak on \nbehalf of our Scouts.\n  I encourage Scout supporters--indeed, all Americans--to contact their \nSenators and Representatives and ask them to support the Support Our \nScouts Act of 2005. I do urge all my Senate colleagues to vote for the \nyoung boys and girls who are following in the worthy Scouting \ntradition. A vote for this amendment will be a vote for them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished majority \nleader, and I associate myself with his remarks and this report.\n  I just looked at one thing, and the staff advised me that the terms \n``Boy Scouts'' and ``Girl Scouts'' embrace what is known as the Cub \nScouts. I want to make sure my understanding is correct that was the \nintention of our distinguished leader, because a lot of families are \nvery active in those organizations.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, indeed it is, Mr. \nChairman. The Cub Scouts badges and uniform is one I wore and, indeed, \nmy three boys wore, Harrison, Jonathan, and Bryan. It is that \nintroduction to Scouts that most of us first experience. Indeed, it is.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished leader. I, too, \nhave had a very modest career in the Scouts. I was sort of attenuated \nwhen I left and joined the Navy in World War II. So I never attained \nany special recognition. But I must say that the training that was \ngiven to me helped me enormously in my early training in the military \nbecause first you learned discipline, then you learned regimentation. \nYou learned the concept of sharing with others, the need to work with \nyour fellow Scouts. It is a magnificent organization. I am so glad you \nhave done this.\n  I also must say I have attended the rally in Virginia to which you \nreferred. I will never forget waiting, as one of the several speakers. \nI was a most inconsequential speaker because a world-famous baseball \nplayer attended. As far as the eye could see, there were clouds of \ndust. They looked like the Roman legions marching in. Tens of thousands \nof Scouts assembled at this rally, all carrying their banners, and the \nparents were all seated under the trees watching this rally. It was a \nspectacle to behold. It was a marvelous experience.\n  So again, Mr. President, I encourage other Senators to join our \ndistinguished leader in support of this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am an original cosponsor of Senator \nFrist's legislation, which we call the Save Our Scouts Act of 2005. I \nwill take a minute to say to my colleagues why I think the bill is \nimportant and why I am glad to be an original cosponsor. I grew up in \nMaryville, TN, at the edge of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park--\nthen a town of about 15,000. Every Monday night, all year long, as soon \nas I was 11 years old, we went down to the new Providence Presbyterian \nChurch at 7 p.m. for a meeting of Troop 88 of the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica. There wasn't a lot of nonsense. It started at 7 and was over \nat 8. Our primary goal was to get organized for outdoor activities. At \nleast once a month--sometimes twice a month--we were away from the \nchurch and were very active. Most often, we went into the Great Smoky \nMountains National Park. Sometimes we went down the road to the \nCherokee National Forest.\n  I can remember on several occasions when we went to the Oak Ridge \nNational Laboratory, which was a source of great wonderment to us that \nclose to the end of World War II. Sometimes we went to Knoxville to the \nTennessee Valley Authority, another government agency known worldwide. \nWe learned from that. I can remember several times we went to the Air \nForce base, another Federal installation. There are a lot of State and \nlocal government places we would go in Troop 88. Sometimes we met at \nWest Side Elementary School or Maryville High School. Sometimes we went \nto the courthouse. I remember seeing a great attorney, Ray Jenkins, \nwaving a bloody wrench in his hand trying to convict a murderer as a \nspecial prosecutor in a family dispute. I was cowering behind the jury \nbox watching this great lawyer carry on. We were there in a public \nbuilding. Sometimes we camped in the city parks. Sometimes we went to \nthe State parks.\n  My point is that all of these places we went in Troop 88, whether it \nwas the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, or any of the others I \nmentioned, those are public places. Ever since the Supreme Court made \nits decision in the Boy Scouts of America v. Dale case, the \nrelationship of the Boy Scouts of America with government at all levels \nhas been the target of multiple lawsuits. That is not just the case for \nboys growing up in Maryville, TN.\n  For the last 25 years, our family has gone up to Ely, MN, on the \nCanadian border. It is a million acres of territory that you have to \ntake a canoe into. It is very restricted wilderness area. It is the \ncenter of one of the Boy Scouts' most important adventure outdoor \nprograms. Whether they are there in the winter, when it is 20 below, or \nin July, when there are a lot of mosquitos, these young men learn to \ntake care of themselves outdoors.\n  Every year for as long as I can remember, the Boy Scouts have looked \nforward to going to the jamborees, which are often held on Federal \nproperty. It is often a highlight in the lives of these young men. They \nlook forward to it for several years. The adult scoutmasters go with \nthem.\n  Mr. President, it makes no sense whatsoever to restrict, in any way, \nthe Boy Scouts from using national parks, national forests, the Oak \nRidge National Laboratory, Air Force bases, State parks, and city \nparks.\n  What do the Boy Scouts do? I tell you what it did for me. It tried to \nbuild some character. I can still say the words: Trustworthy, loyal, \nhelpful, friendly, courteous, kind. There are 12 of them. I did not \nalways live up to them, but they were taught to me.\n  The Boy Scouts taught me about my country. I earned my God and \nCountry award before I got my Eagle Scout. It taught me about this \ncountry and what it means to be an American. It taught me to love the \ngreat American outdoors, which I have always kept and imparted to my \nchildren because we spent almost every weekend in the Great Smoky \nMountains National Park or Cherokee National Forest.\n  I don't want the young men of the day and their volunteer leaders to \nbe kept out of the Great Smokies and the TVA and the schools and the \ncity parks. I don't want those volunteer leaders, who are small \nbusiness people in Maryville, TN, who work at the Alcoa plant--they \ndon't have the money or time to go to court to argue with people about \nwhether those young boys have a right to go there.\n  This is a very important piece of legislation. In this country today, \nmost people would say, when looking at our children, there is nothing \nthey need more than mentors, and the Boy Scouts, just like the Girl \nScouts, provide that. Look at our schools today. Our worst score of \nhigh school seniors is in U.S. history. At least in the Boy Scouts you \nlearn something about the principles that unite us as Americans.\n  Our outdoors are under constant threat. In the Boy Scouts of America, \nwe are constantly building tens of thousands of young men who love the \noutdoors, know how to take care of it, have an environmental ethic and \nuse that for the rest of their lives.\n  I am glad we have a majority leader who is a Boy Scout. I am glad we \nhave more than half the Senate who are cosponsors of this legislation. \nI hope the result of this legislation will remove\n\n[[Page S8605]]\n\nany doubt that Federal agencies may welcome Boy Scouts to hold meetings \nand go camping on Federal property, just as we did. And it says to \nState and local governments that in denying equal access to the public \nvenues to scouts, they will risk some of their Federal funds if they \ncontinue to do that.\n  The Boy Scouts of America is one of the preeminent valuable \norganizations in this country, and I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor of the Support Our Scouts Act of 2005.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to thank our distinguished \ncolleague from Tennessee. I listened carefully to his remarks. It did \nevoke memories of this humble Senator when I had a rather inauspicious \ncareer in the Boy Scouts. Nevertheless, they did a lot more for me than \nI did for them.\n  I remember the jamborees. I can remember very well on our first \nencampment filling a tick bag full of barn straw which we used for a \nmattress. I was greatly impressed with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me also join Senator Frist in this \nlegislation. I believe it is very significant. I spoke last April on \nthe Senate floor on behalf of this issue, and I am proud to do so again \nwith this amendment.\n  Sadly, since my previous speech, there has been a recent Federal \ncourt ruling against the Pentagon's support for the National Boy Scout \nJamboree, which occurs every 4 years and attracts about 40,000 people. \nIt will be taking place on July 25.\n  In her decision, a Federal judge in Chicago ruled that a statute \npermitting the military to lend support for the National Scout Jamboree \nviolates the establishment clause of the Constitution.\n  In short, the judge ruled that Pentagon funding is unconstitutional \nbecause the Boy Scouts are a religious organization as it requires \nScouts to affirm a belief in God. I will speak more on this later.\n  However, it is clear to me that for more than 90 years, the Boy \nScouts have benefited our youth and helped produce some of the best and \nbrightest leaders in our country. I believe we must reaffirm our \nsupport for the vital work they have done and continue to do. Like many \nof my friends here, I was a Boy Scout many years ago.\n  As a result of the great work they do, I was pleased to be an \noriginal cosponsor of S. 642, the Support Our Scouts Act of 2005, as \nwell as this amendment.\n  I had at one time considered introducing my own bill on this very \nimportant matter. However, I was so pleased with the substance of this \nbill that I was proud to add my name as a cosponsor, and I again thank \nSenator Frist for his efforts on this issue.\n  As you may know, this bill, and now this amendment, address efforts \nby some groups to prevent Federal agencies from supporting our Scouts. \nThis bill would remove any doubts that Federal agencies can welcome \nScouts and the great work they do.\n  Sadly, as the following excerpt from a July 20, 2005, Wall Street \nJournal editorial demonstrates, these great organizations have come \nunder attack. The column from this respected publication explains that:\n\n       Because the Scouts require members to ``privately exercise \n     their religious faith as directed by their families and \n     religious advisors,'' the ACLU petitioned the court to \n     declare the organization ``theistic'' and ``pervasively \n     sectarian.'' Judge Blanche Manning didn't go quite that far \n     last month, but she did rule it an overtly religious \n     association because it ``excludes atheists and agnostics from \n     membership.'' She ordered the Army to expel the next Jamboree \n     from Fort A.P. Hill in 2010, by which time we trust the \n     Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals will have overturned her \n     decision.\n\n  I hope this unfortunate decision is overturned as well.\n  As Senator Frist has said, this legislation will specifically ensure \nthat the Department of Defense can and will continue to provide the \nScouts the type of support it has provided in the past. Moreover, the \nScouts would be permitted equal access to public facilities, forums, \nand programs that are open to a variety of other youth or community \norganizations.\n  It is enormously regrettable to me that the Scouts have come under \nattack from aggressive liberal groups blatantly pushing their own \nsocial agendas and become the target of lawsuits by organizations that \nare more concerned with pushing these liberal agendas than sincerely \nhelping our youth.\n  Rather than protecting our religious freedoms, these groups are \nclearly bent on discriminating against any organization that has faith \nas one of its tenets.\n  Thus, today, the Federal Government continues to defend the lawsuit \naimed at severing traditional ties between the Boy Scouts and the \nDepartments of Defense and Housing and Urban Development.\n  What is more, Scouts have been excluded by certain State and local \ngovernments from utilizing public facilities, forums and programs, \nwhich are open to other groups.\n  It is certainly disappointing and, frankly frustrating that we have \nreached a point where groups such as the ACLU are far more interested \nin tearing down great institutions like the Boy Scouts than helping \nfoster character and values in our young men. I am tired of these \ntactics. It is very disturbing to me that these groups unabashedly \nattack organizations, regardless of the good they do or the support \nthey have from the vast majority of Americans, simply to further their \nown subjective social agendas.\n  I, for one, am saddened that the Boy Scouts of America has been the \nmost recent target of these frivolous lawsuits. I reject any arguments \nthat the Boy Scouts is anything but one of the greatest programs for \ncharacter development and values-based leadership training in America \ntoday.\n  We should seek to aid, not impede, groups that promote values such as \nduty to God and country, faith and family, and public service and \nsacrifice, which are deeply ingrained in the oath of every Scout. To \nfail to support such values would allow the very fabric of America, \nwhich has brought us to this great place in history, to be destroyed.\n  Today, with more than 3.2 million youth members, and more than 1.2 \nmillion adult volunteers, we can certainly say that the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica has positively impacted the lives of generations of boys, \npreparing them to be men of great character and values. Remarkably, Boy \nScout membership since 1910 totals more than 110 million.\n  I am proud to report that in Oklahoma we have a total youth \nparticipation of nearly 75,000 boys; and in Oklahoma City alone, we \nhave about 7,000 adult volunteers.\n  These young men have helped serve communities all over our State with \nprograms such as Helping Hands for Heroes, a program where Scouts help \nmilitary families whose loved ones are serving overseas. These young \nmen have cut grass, cleaned homes, taken out the garbage, and walked \ndogs. What a great service for our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines and their families. Our Boy Scouts have also served as ushers \nand first-aid responders at the University of Oklahoma football games \nfor more than 50 years.\n  Notably, Scouts in my State have also shared a long and proud history \nof cooperation and partnership with military installations in Oklahoma. \nFurthermore, events, such as the National Jamboree, allow an \nopportunity to expose large numbers of young Americans to our great \nmilitary in a time when fewer and fewer receive such exposure. I \nbelieve this is a very good thing, and I will fight to see that it \ncontinues.\n  Given all this, I hope my colleagues will join me in defending this \norganization and others like it. We must not be afraid to support our \nyouth and organizations like the Boy Scouts that support them.\n  As the Wall Street Journal editorial that I mentioned previously \nargued:\n\n       The values the Scouts embody are vital to the national good \n     and in need today, more than ever.\n\n  I agree and am proud to rise in support today and always for this \ngreat cause.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Boy \nScouts of America and the Support Our Scouts Act of 2005 amendment \nbeing offered by majority leader Frist.\n  I support the Boy Scouts of America and its goals. I was fortunate to \nbe able to have most of the same experiences and training offered by \nthe Boy Scouts\n\n[[Page S8606]]\n\nas I grew up. My boyhood on a ranch in Walden, CO, offered me the \nchance to develop the outdoor skills and nature appreciation that are \nso much a part of Scouting. As a child I also learned much about \npatriotism, community service, religion, political involvement and \ncivic responsibility--the intellectual development stressed by the Boy \nScouts. As a veterinarian I often served as an advisor to the Scouts on \na variety of issues relating to animal care and health. Americans all \nover our Nation contribute and are touched by this great organization.\n  On July 25 through August 3, Boy Scouts from all over the Nation will \ngather at Fort A.P. Hill in Virginia for their National Scout Jamboree. \nThis opportunity is time to celebrate scouting and the strong ideals it \ninstills in it's youth.\n  Boy Scouts of America, like other nonprofit youth organizations, \ndepend on the use of these public facilities for various programs and \nforums. Boy Scouts of America have had a long and positive relationship \nwith the Departments of Defense and Housing and Urban Development. This \nrelationship has fostered responsible fun and adventure to the more \nthan 3 million boys and 1 million adult volunteers around the country.\n  However, since the U.S. Supreme Court decided Boy Scouts of America, \nBSA v. Dale, the Boy Scout's relationships with Government has been the \ntarget of frivolous lawsuits. Currently, State and local Governments \nare actively excluding Boy Scouts from using public facilities, forums, \nand programs. These are resources that are available to a variety of \nother youth or community organizations. Today access by the Scouts has \nbeen unfairly limited because of the Boy Scout's unwavering \nacknowledgment of God.\n  As we fight to prevent court involvement from changing our founding \ndocuments and other symbols of our national heritage we must also \nsupport and protect the heritage of Boy Scouts of America. Citizenship, \nservice, and leadership are important values on which the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica was built. The ability of the Boy Scouts to instill young \npeople with values and ethical character must remain intact for future \ngenerations. The Boy Scouts of America is a permanent fixture in our \nculture and no court ruling can or should attempt to diminish their \nrights to equal access.\n  This amendment's mission is to ensure that the Boy Scouts are treated \nequally. I feel the Boy Scouts have been unfairly singled out. It is \nimportant to guarantee their right to equal access of public \nfacilities, forums, and programs so that the Boy Scout of America can \ncontinue to serve America's communities and families for a better \ntomorrow.\n  Please join me in supporting the Boy Scouts of America and majority \nleader Frist's Support Our Scouts amendment to the Defense \nAppropriations bill.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment No. 1342, the \nSupport Our Scouts Act, offered by my distinguished colleague from \nTennessee, Senator Frist. The amendment was intended to be simple and \nstraightforward in its purpose, to ensure the Department of Defense can \ncontinue to support youth organizations, including the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica, without fear of frivolous lawsuits. The dollars that are being \nspent on litigation ought to be spent on programs for the youth. Every \ntime we see a group like the Boy Scouts, that will teach character and \ntake care of the community, we ought to do everything we can to promote \nit.\n  This Saturday, over 40,000 Boy Scouts from around the Nation will \nmeet at Fort A.P. Hill in Virginia for the National Scout Jamboree. \nThis event provides a unique opportunity for the military and civilian \ncommunities to help our young men gain a greater understanding of \npatriotism, comradeship, and self-confidence.\n  Since the first jamboree was held at the base of the Washington \nMonument in 1937, more than 600,000 Scouts and leaders have \nparticipated in the national events. I attended the jamboree at Valley \nForge in 1957.\n  Boy Scouts has been a part of my education. I am an Eagle Scout. I am \npleased to say my son was in Scouts. He is an Eagle Scout. Boy Scouts \nis an education. It is an education in possibilities for careers. I can \nthink of no substitution for the 6 million boys in Scouts and the \nmillions who have preceded them. There are dozens on both sides of the \naisle who have been Boy Scouts. I say it is part of my education \nbecause each of the badges that is earned, each of the merit badges \nthat is earned, is an education. I tell schoolkids as I go across my \nState and across my country that even though at times I took courses or \nmerit badges or programs that I didn't see where I would ever have a \nuse for them, by now I have had a use for them and wish I had paid more \nattention at the time I was doing it.\n  I always liked a merit badge pamphlet on my desk called \n``Entrepreneurship.'' It is the hardest Boy Scout badge to earn. It is \none of the most important ones. I believe small business is the future \nof our country. Boy Scouts promote small business through their \ninternship merit badge. Why would it be the toughest to get? Not only \ndo you have to figure out a plan, devise a business plan, figure how to \nfinance it, but the final requirement for the badge is to start a \nbusiness.\n  I could go on and on through the list of merit badges required in \norder to get an Eagle badge. There are millions of boys in this country \nwho are doing that and will be doing that. They do need places to meet. \nThey are being discriminated against. They are being told they cannot \nuse military facilities, even for their national jamborees.\n  These jamborees have become a great American tradition for our young \npeople, and Fort A.P. Hill has been made the permanent site of the \ngatherings. But now the courts are trying to say that this is \nunconstitutional.\n  It isn't just military facilities; it is Federal facilities. A couple \nof years ago, we had an opportunity to debate this again on floor, and \nit had to do with the Smithsonian.\n  Some Boy Scouts requested they be able to do the Eagle Scout Court of \nHonor at the National Zoo and were denied. Why? The determination by \nthe legal staff of the Smithsonian that Scouts discriminate because of \ntheir support for and encouragement for the spiritual life of their \nmembers. Specifically, they embrace the concept that the universe was \ncreated by a supreme being, although we surely point out Scouts do not \nendorse or require a single belief or any particular faith's God. The \nmere fact they asked you to believe in and try to foster a relationship \nwith a supreme being who created the universe was enough to disqualify \nthem.\n  I read that portion of the letter twice. I had just visited the \nNational Archives and read the original document signed by our Founding \nFathers. It is a good thing they hadn't asked to sign the Declaration \nof Independence at the National Zoo.\n  This happens in the schools across the country. Other requests have \nbeen denied. They were also told they were not relevant to the National \nZoo.\n  That is kind of a fascinating experiment in words. I did look to see \nwhat other sorts of things had been done there and found they had a \nWashington Singers musical concert, and the Washington premiers for \nboth the ``Lion King'' and ``Batman.'' Clearly, relevance was not a \ndetermining factor in those decisions.\n\n  But the Boy Scouts have done some particular things in conservation \nthat are important, in conservation tied in with the zoo. In fact, the \nfounder of the National Zoo was Dr. William Hornaday. He is one of the \npeople who was involved in some of the special conservation movements \nand has one of the conservation badges of Scouts named after him.\n  If the situations did not arise, this amendment would not come up. \nBut they do.\n  In 2001, I worked with Senator Helms to pass a similar amendment \nrequiring that the Boy Scouts are treated fairly, as any other \norganization, in their efforts to hold meetings on public school \nproperty. This amendment clarified the difference between support and \ndiscrimination, and it has been successful in preventing future \nunnecessary lawsuits. The Frist amendment is similar to the Helms \namendment and will help prevent future confusion.\n  Again and again, the Scouts have had to use the courts to assure that \nthey were not discriminated against. I am pretty sure everybody in \nAmerica recognizes if you have to use the courts to get your rights to \nuse school buildings,\n\n[[Page S8607]]\n\nmilitary bases, or other facilities, it costs money. It costs time. \nThis amendment eliminates that cost and eliminates that time, to allow \nall nationally recognized youth organizations to have the same rights.\n  The legal system is very important in the country but it has some \ninteresting repercussions. Our system of lawsuits, which sometimes are \ncalled the legal lottery of this country, allow people who think they \nhave been harmed to try to point out who harmed them and get money for \ndoing that. It has had some difficulties for the Boy Scouts.\n  I remember when my son was in the Scouts their annual fundraiser was \nselling Christmas trees. One of the requirements when they were selling \nChristmas trees was that the boys selling trees at the lot had to be \naccompanied by two adults not from the same family.\n  I did not understand why we needed all of this adult supervision. It \nseemed as if one adult helping out at the lot would be sufficient. The \nanswer was, they have been sued because if there was only one adult \nthere and that adult could be accused of abusing the boys. Two adults \nprovided some assurance that a lawsuit would not happen.\n  The interesting thing is, it was just me and my son at the lot and we \nstill had to have another adult in order to keep the Boy Scouts from \nbeing sued.\n  They run into some of the same difficulties with car caravans.\n  So the legal system of this country has put them in the position \nwhere they are doing some of the things that they are doing. The legal \nsystem of the country has caused some of the discrimination that is \ndone.\n  It is something we need to correct. This discussion of the Frist \namendment is timely. U.S. District Judge Blanche Manning recently ruled \nthat the Pentagon could no longer spend Government money to ready Fort \nA.P. Hill for the National Boy Scout Jamboree. The Frist amendment \nwould assure that our free speech protections would also apply to the \nBoy Scouts of America.\n  The Boy Scouts of America is one of the oldest and largest youth \norganizations in the United States and the world today. The \norganization teaches its members to do their duty to God, to love their \ncountry, and serve their fellow citizens. The Boy Scouts have formed \nthe minds and hearts of millions of Americans and prepared these boys \nand young men for the challenges they are sure to face the rest of \ntheir lives. It is an essential part of Americana. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in defending the Boy Scouts from constitutional \ndiscrimination by supporting the Helms amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have no objection that I know of to this \namendment. It does not purport to limit the jurisdiction of a Federal \ncourt in determining what the Constitution means. So we do not have any \nobjection to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1314\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in consultation with the majority leader \nand the distinguished Senator from Michigan, as to the amendment by \nSenator Frist, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be laid aside \nand that we return to my amendment No. 1314.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. On that matter, it is contemplated now that we will have \na vote in relation to the Warner amendment regarding the wheeled motor \nvehicles, armored, today at 12:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we very strongly support the Warner \namendment. I ask unanimous consent that I be listed as a cosponsor of \nthe Warner amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we understand there will be no second-\ndegree amendments to the Warner amendment now.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that Senator Kennedy be listed as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we are checking on Senator Bayh right now.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think it is important. Senator Bayh has been very \nactive on this issue.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1314, as Modified\n\n  Mr. President, I send to the desk a modification to my amendment in \nthe nature of a technical modification. I believe it has been examined \nby the other side. This modification identifies an offset of $445.4 \nmillion from the Iraqi Freedom Fund for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 303, strike line 3 and all that follows through \n     page 304, line 24, and insert the following:\n       (3) For other procurement $376,700,000.\n       (b) Availability of Certain Amounts.--\n       (1) Availability.--Of the amount authorized to be \n     appropriated by subsection (a)(3), $225,000,000 shall be \n     available for purposes as follows:\n       (A) Procurement of up-armored high mobility multipurpose \n     wheeled vehicles (UAHs).\n       (B) Procurement of wheeled vehicle add-on armor protection, \n     including armor for M1151/M1152 high mobility multipurpose \n     wheeled vehicles.\n       (C) Procurement of M1151/M1152 high mobility multipurpose \n     wheeled vehicles.\n       (2) Allocation of funds.--\n       (A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (B), the Secretary \n     of the Army shall allocate the manner in which amounts \n     available under paragraph (1) shall be available for the \n     purposes specified in that paragraph.\n       (B) Limitation.--Amounts available under paragraph (1) may \n     not be allocated under subparagraph (A) until the Secretary \n     certifies to the congressional defense committees that the \n     Army has a validated requirement for procurement for a \n     purpose specified in paragraph (1) based on a statement of \n     urgent needs from a commander of a combatant command.\n       (C) Reports.--Not later than 15 days after an allocation of \n     funds is made under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall \n     submit to the congressional defense committees a report \n     describing such allocation of funds.\n\n     SEC. 1404.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDeWine and Senator Collins be added as cosponsors to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this amendment was debated yesterday. I \nsee other Senators seeking recognition. From my perspective, the debate \nhas been satisfied, unless there are other Senators.\n\n[[Page S8608]]\n\n  Has the Chair ruled on the vote at 12:30? I ask unanimous consent \nthat the vote in relation to the Warner amendment No. 1314 regarding \nwheeled vehicle armor occur today at 12:30 with no second-degree \namendments in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I had approached the chairman to ask if I \ncould speak for a few minutes as in morning business and if it would be \npossible at this time for me to speak for up to 10 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  Mr. WARNER. I bring to the Senator's attention, we did have that \ndiscussion. I didn't, at the time, recognize the imminence of the vote. \nI see a colleague who does have an amendment in relation to the bill. \nTherefore, I am hesitant to grant UC to go off the bill. Could I \ninquire of the Senator from Oklahoma?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I respond to the distinguished chairman that I do have \nthree amendments that are prepared and I am ready to bring them up and \nget them into the system. I also have two UC requests. If I could be \nrecognized for that purpose, I would appreciate that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, are there other colleagues who wish to \naddress the Defense bill? Hopefully, we can accommodate our colleague \nfrom Oregon. Let's determine, procedurally, the order in which matters \nin relation to this bill should be brought up.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I inform the distinguished chairman that \nI was seeking 8 minutes to speak on the underlying bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I inform the chairman I would like to \nspeak for 4 minutes on the Boy Scout amendment discussed, if time is \navailable after other Senators speak on the underlying bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished Senator from Tennessee. I bring \nto his attention that that measure has been laid aside. It doesn't \npreclude his speaking to it, but we will see what we can do.\n  I ask my colleagues on this side, the Senator from Oregon, do you \nwant 10 minutes or 8 minutes?\n  Mr. WYDEN. If the chairman could allow that, I would be appreciative.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wonder if the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma could \nproceed, followed by the Senator from Maine, and then prior to the \nvote, if you desire to do it before 12:30?\n  Mr. WYDEN. If that is at all possible. Perhaps I will ask unanimous \nconsent to speak for up to 10 minutes after the vote; would that be \nacceptable?\n  Mr. WARNER. I would like to ask my colleague, the Senator from \nMichigan, to concur in that UC, that following the vote, the Senator \nfrom Oregon be recognized for a period of not to exceed 10 minutes, and \nwe will go off the bill for that purpose.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if we could lock in an additional speaker. I ask \nunanimous consent that immediately prior to the vote on the Warner \namendment at 12:30, Senator Kennedy be recognized for 5 minutes at \n12:25.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Reserving the right to object, I would like to be in \nthe queue before 12:30.\n  Mr. WARNER. I assure you that you will have 5 minutes in that period \nof time. If the Senator from Oklahoma could present his amendments, \nfollowed by the Senator from Maine, the Senator from Tennessee, and \nthen Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am afraid I didn't hear that request. Are \nthe speakers that have been identified speaking on the pending \namendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Not the pending. In other words, I desire not to go off \nthe bill to accommodate our friend from Oregon. He has now been \naccommodated. We are looking at a period of roughly 40 minutes to be \nallocated among three Senators who wish to speak to matters in relation \nto this bill and reserving at 12:25 that Senator Kennedy be recognized \nfor a period of 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that we add to that request that \nSenator Lautenberg then be recognized to offer an amendment immediately \nafter the speakers who have been identified.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we will do our very best to at least \nintroduce an amendment at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to Senator Lautenberg being \nadded at the end of the three previous speakers?\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Might I inquire as to the amount of time the \ndistinguished Senator from New Jersey might wish?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would like a half-hour evenly divided on the \namendment. We have 50 minutes left before a vote. If I might say, could \nour distinguished colleague be accommodated immediately after the vote, \nfollowing the Senator from Oregon?\n  Why don't I just lay it down and take a couple minutes to talk about \nit.\n  Mr. WARNER. Five minutes then.\n  Mr. LEVIN. He would just lay down an amendment prior to Senator \nKennedy speaking and then he would pick up after the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, I thank the distinguished chairman \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee for allowing me to offer these \namendments. I will stay within a timeframe that will allow other \nspeakers under the UC to be heard. I have three amendments I will be \nbringing up.\n  I first ask unanimous consent that Senator Collins be added as a \ncosponsor to amendment No. 1312 and that Senator Kyl be added as a \ncosponsor to amendment No. 1313.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1311\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, is it necessary to set aside the pending \namendment for me to offer my amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside, and I send an amendment to the desk, No. 1311, and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1311.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To protect the economic and energy security of the United \n                                States)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n\n                      ECONOMIC AND ENERGY SECURITY\n\n       Sec. _. Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 \n     (50 U.S.C.

Mr. President, as a practical and timely step toward \naddressing problems with China, I am introducing amendment No. 1311. \nThis amendment addresses the review process of foreign acquisitions in \nthe U.S. The review of controversial buys, such as the CNOOC, currently \nfalls to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, \nCFIUS. I will state this simply: CFIUS has not demonstrated an \nappropriate conception of U.S. national security. I understand that \nRepresentatives Hyde, Hunter and Manzullo expressed similar views in a \nJanuary letter to Treasury Secretary John Snow, the chairman of CFIUS. \nOf more than 1,500 cases of foreign investments or acquisitions in the \nU.S., CFIUS has investigated only 24. And only one resulted in actually \nstopping the transaction. This lone disapproval, in February 1990, \noccurred with respect to a transaction that had already taken place--it \ntook President George H.W. Bush to stop the transaction and safeguard \nour national security.\n  Another example of CFIUS falling short is with Magnequench \nInternational Incorporated. In 1995 Chinese corporations bought GM's \nMagnequench, a supplier of rare earth metals used in the guidance \nsystems of smart bombs. Over 12 years, the company has been moved \npiecemeal to mainland China, leaving the U.S. with no domestic supplier \nof neodymium, a critical component of rare-earth magnets. CFIUS \napproved this transfer. The United States now buys rare earth metals, \nwhich are essential for precision-guided munitions, from one single \ncountry--China.\n  Some experts believe that China's economic policy is a purposeful \nattempt to undermine the U.S. industrial base and likewise, the defense \nindustrial base. Perhaps it is hard to believe that China's economic \nmanipulation is such a threat to our Nation. In response, I would like \nto read from the book ``Unrestricted Warfare'', written by two PLA, \nPeople's Liberation Army, senior Colonels:\n\n       Military threats are already no longer the major factors \n     affecting national security . . . traditional factors are \n     increasingly becoming more intertwined with grabbing \n     resources contending for markets, controlling capital, trade \n     sanctions and other economic factors.\n\n  I have outlined in my earlier speeches how China is a clear threat. I \nbelieve it is. But I also believe that this threat can be addressed and \nallow a healthy, mutual growth for both our countries. The CFIUS \nprocess is at the heart of this issue. Chairman of the US-China \nEconomic and Security Review Commission, Dick D'Amato, stated this \nmorning that the CFIUS process is ``broken.'' This amendment is a step \ntoward fixing the problems, enabling the foreign review to carry out \nits function and truly protect our national security.\n  First, it clearly charges the commission with measuring energy and \neconomic security as fundamental aspects of national security.\n  Second, it brings congressional oversight into the foreign investment \nreview process. After a 10-day review period, an oversight committee \nchairman can extend the review period to 30 days. Congress then has the \noption to pass a resolution of disapproval and thus stop an acquisition \nharmful to our country.\n  Third, the amendment calls for a report on the security implications \nof transactions on a monthly basis. There will also be a yearly report \nto the proper congressional committees that will review the cumulative \neffect of our sales with China.\n  The amendment also changes the name of the review mechanism to \nreflect the national security focus that it should be emphasizing. The \nnew name would be Committee on Foreign Acquisitions Affecting National \nSecurity, or CFAANS. Further, the designated chairman of the process \nwould become the Secretary of Defense, also reflecting the security \nfocus that the process should be based on.\n  The foreign investment review process is vital to providing for U.S. \nsecurity, particularly in relation to countries such as China. However, \nit is in need of attention and changes no less drastic than I have \nsuggested here.\n  We are going to have to do something about the performance of this \norganization. To do it, we will have to change the structure. I am \ngoing to be recommending that the chairman of CFIUS no longer be the \nSecretary of the Treasury but be the Secretary of Defense, since they \ndeal with very critical national security issues.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1312\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and I send amendment No. 1312 to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], for himself and Ms. \n     Collins, proposes an amendment numbered 1312.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress that the President should \n       take immediate steps to establish a plan to implement the \n  recommendations of the 2004 Report to Congress of the United States-\n             China Economic and Security Review Commission)\n\n       At the end of title XII, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1205. THE UNITED STATES-CHINA ECONOMIC AND SECURITY \n                   REVIEW COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The 2004 Report to Congress of the United States-China \n     Economic and Security Review Commission states that--\n       (A) China's State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) lack adequate \n     disclosure standards, which creates the potential for United \n     States investors to unwittingly contribute to enterprises \n     that are involved in activities harmful to United States \n     security interests;\n       (B) United States influence and vital long-term interests \n     in Asia are being challenged by China's robust regional \n     economic engagement and diplomacy;\n\n[[Page S8610]]\n\n       (C) the assistance of China and North Korea to global \n     ballistic missile proliferation is extensive and ongoing;\n       (D) China's transfers of technology and components for \n     weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their delivery systems \n     to countries of concern, including countries that support \n     acts of international terrorism, has helped create a new tier \n     of countries with the capability to produce WMD and ballistic \n     missiles;\n       (E) the removal of the European Union arms embargo against \n     China that is currently under consideration in the European \n     Union would accelerate weapons modernization and dramatically \n     enhance Chinese military capabilities;\n       (F) China's recent actions toward Taiwan call into question \n     China's commitments to a peaceful resolution;\n       (G) China is developing a leading-edge military with the \n     objective of intimidating Taiwan and deterring United States \n     involvement in the Strait, and China's qualitative and \n     quantitative military advancements have already resulted in a \n     dramatic shift in the cross-Strait military balance toward \n     China; and\n       (H) China's growing energy needs are driving China into \n     bilateral arrangements that undermine multilateral efforts to \n     stabilize oil supplies and prices, and in some cases may \n     involve dangerous weapons transfers.\n       (2) On March 14, 2005, the National People's Congress \n     approved a law that would authorize the use of force if \n     Taiwan formally declares independence.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--\n       (1) Plan.--The President is strongly urged to take \n     immediate steps to establish a plan to implement the \n     recommendations contained in the 2004 Report to Congress of \n     the United States-China Economic and Security Review \n     Commission in order to correct the negative implications that \n     a number of current trends in United States-China relations \n     have for United States long-term economic and national \n     security interests.\n       (2) Contents.--Such a plan should contain the following:\n       (A) Actions to address China's policy of undervaluing its \n     currency, including--\n       (i) encouraging China to provide for a substantial upward \n     revaluation of the Chinese yuan against the United States \n     dollar;\n       (ii) allowing the yuan to float against a trade-weighted \n     basket of currencies; and\n       (iii) concurrently encouraging United States trading \n     partners with similar interests to join in these efforts.\n       (B) Actions to make better use of the World Trade \n     Organization (WTO) dispute settlement mechanism and \n     applicable United States trade laws to redress China's unfair \n     trade practices, including China's exchange rate \n     manipulation, denial of trading and distribution rights, lack \n     of intellectual property rights protection, objectionable \n     labor standards, subsidization of exports, and forced \n     technology transfers as a condition of doing business. The \n     United States Trade Representative should consult with our \n     trading partners regarding any trade dispute with China.\n       (C) Actions to encourage United States diplomatic efforts \n     to identify and pursue initiatives to revitalize United \n     States engagement with China's Asian neighbors. The \n     initiatives should have a regional focus and complement \n     bilateral efforts. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation \n     forum (APEC) offers a ready mechanism for pursuit of such \n     initiatives.\n       (D) Actions by the administration to hold China accountable \n     for proliferation of prohibited technologies and to secure \n     China's agreement to renew efforts to curtail North Korea's \n     commercial export of ballistic missiles.\n       (E) Actions to encourage the creation of a new United \n     Nations framework for monitoring the proliferation of WMD and \n     their delivery systems in conformance with member nations' \n     obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the \n     Biological Weapons Convention, and the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention. The new monitoring body should be delegated \n     authority to apply sanctions to countries violating these \n     treaties in a timely manner, or, alternatively, should be \n     required to report all violations in a timely manner to the \n     Security Council for discussion and sanctions.\n       (F) Actions by the administration to conduct a fresh \n     assessment of the ``One China'' policy, given the changing \n     realities in China and Taiwan. This should include a review \n     of--\n       (i) the policy's successes, failures, and continued \n     viability;\n       (ii) whether changes may be needed in the way the United \n     States Government coordinates its defense assistance to \n     Taiwan, including the need for an enhanced operating \n     relationship between United States and Taiwan defense \n     officials and the establishment of a United States-Taiwan \n     hotline for dealing with crisis situations;\n       (iii) how United States policy can better support Taiwan's \n     breaking out of the international economic isolation that \n     China seeks to impose on it and whether this issue should be \n     higher on the agenda in United States-China relations; and\n       (iv) economic and trade policy measures that could help \n     ameliorate Taiwan's marginalization in the Asian regional \n     economy, including policy measures such as enhanced United \n     States-Taiwan bilateral trade arrangements that would include \n     protections for labor rights, the environment, and other \n     important United States interests.\n       (G) Actions by the Secretaries of State and Energy to \n     consult with the International Energy Agency with the \n     objective of upgrading the current loose experience-sharing \n     arrangement, whereby China engages in some limited exchanges \n     with the organization, to a more structured arrangement \n     whereby China would be obligated to develop a meaningful \n     strategic oil reserve, and coordinate release of stocks in \n     supply-disruption crises or speculator-driven price spikes.\n       (H) Actions by the administration to develop and publish a \n     coordinated, comprehensive national policy and strategy \n     designed to meet China's challenge to maintaining United \n     States scientific and technological leadership and \n     competitiveness in the same way the administration is \n     presently required to develop and publish a national security \n     strategy.\n       (I) Actions to revise the law governing the Committee on \n     Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), including \n     expanding the definition of national security to include the \n     potential impact on national economic security as a criterion \n     to be reviewed, and transferring the chairmanship of CFIUS \n     from the Secretary of the Treasury to a more appropriate \n     executive branch agency.\n       (J) Actions by the President and the Secretaries of State \n     and Defense to press strongly their European Union \n     counterparts to maintain the EU arms embargo on China.\n       (K) Actions by the administration to restrict foreign \n     defense contractors, who sell sensitive military use \n     technology or weapons systems to China, from participating in \n     United States defense-related cooperative research, \n     development, and production programs. Actions by the \n     administration may be targeted to cover only those technology \n     areas involved in the transfer of military use technology or \n     weapons systems to China. The administration should provide a \n     comprehensive annual report to the appropriate committees of \n     Congress on the nature and scope of foreign military sales to \n     China, particularly sales by Russia and Israel.\n       (L) Any additional actions outlined in the 2004 Report to \n     Congress of the United States-China Economic and Security \n     Review Commission that affect the economic or national \n     security of the United States.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. In October of 2000, Congress established the United \nStates-China Security Economic Review Commission to act as a bipartisan \nauthority on how our relationship with China affects our economy and \nindustrial base and China's military and weapons proliferation. I have \nread these recommendations. I have given four 1-hour speeches on the \nfloor of the Senate concerning the recommendations. I think it is \nappropriate that we have those recommendations incorporated into the \nDefense authorization bill under consideration at this time. My \namendment 1312 puts these recommendations into place that I have spoken \non before in the Senate Chamber.\n  As I said, in October of 2000 Congress established the U.S.-China \nSecurity Economic Review Commission to act as the bipartisan authority \non how our relationship with China affects our economy, industrial \nbase, China's military and weapons proliferation, and our influence in \nAsia. For the past 5 years the commission has been holding hearings and \nissuing annual reports to evaluate ``the national security implications \nof the bilateral trade and economic relationship between the United \nStates and the People's Republic of China.'' Their job is to provide us \nin Congress with the necessary information to make decisions about this \ncomplex situation. However, I fear their reports have gone largely \nunnoticed.\n  In the most recent report, dated June 2004, the commission makes this \nalarming opening statement:\n\n       Based on our analysis to date, as documented in detail in \n     our Report, the Commission believes that a number of the \n     current trends in U.S.-China relations have negative \n     implications for our long-term economic and national security \n     interests, and therefore that U.S. policies in these areas \n     are in need of urgent attention and course corrections.\n\n  As their report and recent news headlines show, China has continued \non an alarming course of expansion, in some aspects threatening U.S. \nnational security. I have found the recommendations in the commission's \n2004 Report objective, necessary, and urgent, and I am introducing an \namendment to express our support for these viable steps. This amendment \nexpresses the sense of the Senate that: China should revaluate its \nmanipulated currency level and allow it to float against other \ncurrencies. In the Treasury Department's recent Report to Congress, \nChina's monetary policies are described as ``highly distortionary and \npose a risk to China's economy, its trading partners, and global \neconomic growth.''\n  Appropriate steps ought to be taken through the World Trade \nOrganization\n\n[[Page S8611]]\n\nto hold China accountable for its dubious trade practices. Major \nproblem issues such as intellectual property rights have yet to be \naddressed.\n  The U.S. should revitalize engagement in the Asian region, broadening \nour interaction with organizations like ASEAN. Our lack of influence \nhas been demonstrated by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization recently \ndemanding that we set a pullout deadline in Afghanistan.\n  The administration ought to hold China accountable for proliferating \nprohibited technologies. Chinese companies such as CPMIEC or NORINCO \nhave been sanctioned frequently and yet the Chinese government refuses \nto enforce their own nonproliferation agreements.\n  The U.N. should monitor nuclear/biological/chemical treaties and \neither enforce these agreements or report them to the Security Council. \nThe U.S.-China Commission has found that China has undercut the U.N. \nmany areas, undermining what pressure we've tried to apply on \nproblematic states such as Sudan or Zimbabwe.\n  The administration ought to review the effectiveness of the ``One \nChina'' policy in relation to Taiwan to reflect the dynamic nature of \nthe situation.\n  Various energy agencies should encourage China to develop a strategic \noil reserve so as to avoid a disastrous oil crisis if availability \nshould become volatile.\n  The administration should develop and publish a national strategy to \nmaintain U.S. scientific and technological leadership in regards to \nChina's rapid growth in these fields.\n  The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, CFIUS, \nshould include national economic security as a criterion for evaluation \nand the chairmanship to be transferred to a more appropriate chair, \nallowing for increased security precautions.\n  The administration should continue in its pressure on the EU to \nmaintain its arms embargo on China.\n  Penalties should be placed on foreign contractors who sell sensitive \nmilitary use technology or weapons systems to China from benefiting \nfrom U.S. defense-related research, development and production \nprograms. The administration should also provide a report to Congress \non the scope foreign military sales to China.\n  And finally, we should provide a broad consensus in support of the \nCommission 2004 Report's recommendations.\n  The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission have done an \noutstanding job providing us with a clear picture of a very complex and \nserious situation. Unless our relationship with China is backed up with \nstrong action they will never take us seriously. We will certainly see \nmore violations of proliferation treaties. They will continue to \nmanipulate regional and global trade through currency undervaluation \nand other unhealthy practices. They will develop unreliable oil sources \nand energy alliances with countries that threaten international \nstability. They will continue to escalate the situation over Taiwan, \nraising the stakes in a game neither country can win. In today's world \nwe see how the unpaid bills of the past come back to haunt us in full; \nignoring these problems is unacceptable. As the China Commission \nstates,\n\n       We need to use our substantial leverage to develop an \n     architecture that will help avoid conflict, attempt to build \n     cooperative practices and institutions, and advance both \n     countries' long-term interests. The United States cannot lose \n     sight of these important goals, and must configure its \n     policies toward China to help make them materialize . . . If \n     we falter in the use of our economic and political influence \n     now to effect positive change in China, we will have \n     squandered an historic opportunity.\n\n  The U.S.-China Commission was created to give us in Congress a clear \npicture about what is going on--they have done their job. Now let's do \nours.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1313\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside for the purposes of consideration of amendment \nNo. 1313 which I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], for himself and Mr. \n     Kyl, proposes an amendment numbered 1313.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require an annual report on the use of United States funds \n  with respect to the activities and management of the International \n                      Committee of the Red Cross)\n\n         At the end of title XII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1205. ANNUAL REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE ON \n                   THE RED CROSS.\n\n       (a) Annual Report Required.--Not later than 180 days after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, and annually \n     thereafter, the Secretary of State shall, with the \n     concurrence of the Secretary of Defense and the Attorney \n     General, submit to Congress the activities and management of \n     the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) meeting \n     the requirements set forth in subsection (b).\n       (b) Elements of Reports.--(1) Each report under subsection \n     (a) shall include, for the one-year period ending on the date \n     of such report, the following:\n       (A) A description of the financial contributions of the \n     United States, and of any other country, to the International \n     Committee of the Red Cross.\n       (B) A detailed description of the allocations of the funds \n     available to the International Committee of the Red Cross to \n     international relief activities and international \n     humanitarian law activities as defined by the International \n     Committee.\n       (C) A description of how United States contributions to the \n     International Committee of the Red Cross are allocated to the \n     activities described in subparagraph (B) and to other \n     activities.\n       (D) The nationality of each Assembly member, Assembly \n     Council member, and Directorate member of the International \n     Committee of the Red Cross, and the annual salary of each.\n       (E) A description of any activities of the International \n     Committee of the Red Cross to determine the status of United \n     States prisoners of war (POWs) or missing in action (MIAs) \n     who remain unaccounted for.\n       (F) A description of the efforts of the International \n     Committee of the Red Cross to assist United States prisoners \n     of war.\n       (G) A description of any expression of concern by the \n     Department of State, or any other department or agency of the \n     Executive Branch, that the International Committee of the Red \n     Cross, or any organization or employee of the International \n     Committee, exceeded the mandate of the International \n     Committee, violated established principles or practices of \n     the International Committee, interpreted differently from the \n     United States any international law or treaty to which the \n     United States is a state-party, or engaged in advocacy work \n     that exceeded the mandate of the International Committee.\n       (2) The first report under subsection (a) shall include, in \n     addition to the matters specified in paragraph (1) the \n     following:\n       (A) The matters specified in subparagraphs (A) and (G) of \n     paragraph (1) for the period beginning on January 1, 1990, \n     and ending on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (B) The matters specified in subparagraph (E) of paragraph \n     (1) for the period beginning on January 1, 1947, and ending \n     on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (C) The matters specified in subparagraph (F) of paragraph \n     (1) during each of the Korean conflict, the Vietnam era, and \n     the Persian Gulf War.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section, the terms ``Korean \n     conflict'', ``Vietnam era'', and ``Persian Gulf War'' have \n     the meaning given such terms in section 101 of title 38, \n     United States Code.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. We have \ntalked about some of the problems that have existed with the ICRC, the \nInternational Committee on the Red Cross. I would like to make sure \npeople understand we are not talking about the American Red Cross. \nThere have been problems that have come up. My first concern is for the \nAmerican troops. The ICRC has been around since 1863 and has been there \nfor American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines through two world \nwars. I thank them for that good work they did. Likewise, I thank all \nAmericans for their military service to America. I did have occasion to \nbe in the Army. That was one of the best things that happened in my \nlife.\n  In my continuing preeminent concern for American troops, however, I \nam compelled to note some concerns and pose some questions about the \ndrift in focus of the ICRC. In spite of some of the things that have \nbeen very good that they have done in the past, there have been some \nvery serious problems. I think they need to be called to the attention \nof the Senate and be made a part of this bill.\n  Specifically, the ICRC has engaged in efforts to reinterpret and \nexpand international law so as to afford terrorists and insurgents the \nsame rights and privileges as military personnel of\n\n[[Page S8612]]\n\nstates party to the Geneva Convention. They have advocated, lobbied for \narms control, issues that are not within the organization's mandate, \nand inaccurately and unfairly accused the United States of not adhering \nto the Geneva Conventions when the ICRC itself has demonstrated \nreluctance to ensure that the Geneva Convention protections are \nafforded U.S. prisoners of war.\n  Neither the American Red Cross nor any other national Red Cross or \nRed Crescent Society is consulted by the ICRC or is in any way involved \nin the ICRC's policy decisions and statements. The Government has \nremained the ICRC's single largest contributor since its founding in \n1990. The Government has provided more than $1.5 billion in funding for \nthe ICRC. Congress should request from the administration and the GAO \nan examination of how the ICRC spends the U.S. taxpayers' dollars to \ndetermine whether the entire annual U.S. contribution to the ICRC \nheadquarters--in other words, the ICRC operations--is advancing \nAmerican interests.\n  Additionally, Congress should request that the State, Defense, and \nJustice Departments jointly certify that the ICRC's operations and \nperformance have been in full accord with its Geneva Conventions \nmandate. The administration strongly advocates for full transparency of \nall ICRC documents relating to the organization's core and noncore \nactivities and the administration argues for a change in the ICRC \nstatute so as to allow non-Swiss officials to be a part of the \norganization and directing bodies of the ICRC.\n  Indeed, I fear that the ICRC may be harming the morale of our \nAmerican troops by unjustified allegations that detainees and prisoners \nare not being properly treated.\n  For example, an ICRC official visited Camp Bucca, a theater \ninternment facility for enemy prisoners of war that is, as of January \n2005, being operated by the 18th Military Police Brigade and Task Force \n134, near Umm Qasr in southern Iraq. As of late January 2005, the \nfacility had a holding capacity of 6,000 prisoners but only held 5,000. \nThese prisoners were being supervised by 1,200 Army MPs and Air Force \nAirmen.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal, citing a Defense Department \nsource, the ICRC official told U.S. authorities, ``you people are no \nbetter than and no different than the Nazi concentration camp guards.''\n  The ICRC and the State Department have confirmed that this ICRC \nofficial is now transferred from the Iraq assignment in the wake of her \ncomment. Such a comment is obviously damaging to the morale of our \nAmerican troops and offended the soldiers and airmen present.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee has now held 13 hearings on the \ntopic of prisoner treatment.\n  Sometimes we get bogged down in all the detail and we forget about \nthe overall picture, the big picture. And I'm shocked when I found, \nonly last Tuesday, from the Pentagon's report, that after 3 years and \n24,000 interrogations, there were only three acts of violation of the \napproved interrogation techniques authorized by Field Manual 3452 and \nDOD guidelines.\n  The small infractions found were found by our own government, \ncorrected and now reported. In all the cases no further incidents \noccurred. We have nothing to be ashamed of. What other country attacked \nas we were would exercise the same degree of self-criticism and \nrestraint.\n  Most, if not all, of these incidents are at least a year old. I'm \nvery impressed with the way the military, the FBI, and other agencies \nhave conducted themselves. The report shows me that an incredible \namount of restraint and discipline was present at Gitmo.\n  Having heard a lot about the Field Manual 3452, I asked, ``Are the \nDOD guidelines, as currently published in that manual, appropriate to \nallow interrogators to get valuable information, intelligence \ninformation, while not crossing the line from interrogation to abuse?'' \nThe answer from Gen. Bantz J. Craddock, Commander of U.S. Southern \nCommand was, ``I think, because that manual was written for enemy \nprisoners of war, we have a translation problem, in that enemy \nprisoners are to be treated in accordance with the Geneva Conventions--\nthat doesn't apply. That's why the recommendation was made and I \naffirmed it. We need a further look here on this new phenomenon of \nenemy combatants. It's different, and we're trying to use, I think, a \nmanual that was written for one reason in another environment.''\n  Lt. Gen. Randall M. Schmidt, the senior investigating officer said, \n``Sir, I agree. It's critical that we come to grips with not hanging on \na Cold War relic of Field Manual 3452, which addressed an entirely \ndifferent population. If we are, in fact, going to get intelligence to \nstay ahead of this type of threat, we need to understand what else we \ncan do and still stay in our lane of humane treatment.''\n  Brig. Gen. John T. Furlow, the investigating officer, stated, ``Sir, \nin echoing that, F.M. 3452 was originally written in 1987, further \nupdated and refined in 1992, which is dealing with the Geneva question \nas well as an ordered battle enemy, not the enemy that we're facing \ncurrently. I'm aware that Fort Huachuca's currently in a rewrite of the \nnext 3452, and it's in a draft form right now.''\n  It is clear that our military has humane treatment placed at the \nforefront of their concerns.\n  At the same time I want to ask, ``What other country would freely \ndiscuss interrogation techniques used against high-value intelligence \ndetainees during a time of war when suicide bombers are killing our \nfellow citizens?\n  Why would we freely explain the limitations placed on our \ninterrogators, when we know that our enemy trains his terrorists in \nmethods to defeat our interrogations?\n  We're handing them new information on how to train future terrorists. \nWhat damage are we doing to our war effort by parading these relatively \nminor infractions before the press and the world again and again and \nagain while our soldiers risk their lives daily and are given no mercy \nby the enemy?\n  Our enemies exploit everything we do and everything we say. Al-\nZarqawi, the other day, said to his followers, quote, ``The Americans \nare living their worst days in Iraq now. Even Members of Congress have \nannounced that the u.S. is losing the war in Iraq.''\n  Let us stop demoralizing our troops. I say let us support our troops \nin their continuing humane treatment of the detainees at Gitmo.\n  While we have done more than enough examining of ourselves, I believe \nit is fair to pose some questions to others as well.\n  In this amendment, I am requesting, with my cosponsors, simply a \nreport to the Congress about activities of the ICRC.\n  In the past 15 years the United States has provided more than $1.5 \nbillion dollars in funding to the ICRC. I would like to ask for some \naccountability for the use of this money and a modicum of oversight. \nFor example, I think it is fair to ask:\n  ``How is our money being spent?''\n  ``What are the activities of the ICRC to determine the status of \nAmerican POW's/MIA's unaccounted for since World War II?''\n  ``What are the efforts of the ICRC to assist American POW's held in \ncaptivity during the Korean War, Vietnam War, and any subsequent \nconflicts?''\n  ``Has the ICRC exceeded its mandate, violated established practices \nor principles, or engaged in advocacy work that exceeds the ICRC's \nmandate as provided for under the Geneva Conventions?''\n  Please join with me in supporting this simple, fair request for such \na report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator's amendment will be considered \non the floor in due time. But I assume that at least two of the \namendments involve another committee, the Banking Committee, other than \nthe Armed Services Committee; would I be correct in that?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am aware that only one affects the Banking Committee. \nThe national security ramifications of the performance and the \nfunctions of CFIUS are far greater than any banking function. I would \nbe happy to deal with the chairman of the Banking Committee and talk \nabout the proper jurisdiction.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator. As to the other two amendments, is \nit his judgment that they are solely within the jurisdiction?\n\n[[Page S8613]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is my judgment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I accept that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the good Senator will also share the amendment \nwith the chairman and the ranking member in the Banking Committee, \nboth.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, that is a fair request.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this time I believe our colleague from \nMaine has an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Maine is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act of 2006. This legislation authorizes \ncritical programs for our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines \nserving our country around the world--programs such as those that \nprovide vital protective gear, military pay raises, and increased \nbonuses and benefits, and the advanced weapons systems on which our \ntroops rely.\n  Let me thank and recognize the extraordinary efforts of our chairman \nof the committee and the ranking member for putting together an \nexcellent bill. I commend Senator Warner and Senator Levin also for \ntheir strong commitment to our Armed Forces, to making sure that our \nmilitary's needs are met.\n  This legislation authorizes $9.1 billion for essential shipbuilding \npriorities, and it includes a provision to prohibit the use of funds by \nthe Navy to conduct a ``one shipyard winner-take-all'' acquisition \nstrategy to procure the next generation of destroyers, the DD(X). Not \nonly does this legislation fully fund the President's request for the \nDD(X) program, but it also provides an additional $50 million for \nadvanced procurement of the second ship in the DD(X) class at General \nDynamic's Bath Iron Works in my home State of Maine. I am, \nunderstandably, very proud of the fine work and the many contributions \nof the skilled shipbuilders at Bath Iron Works to our Nation's defense.\n  The high priorities placed on shipbuilding in the Senate version of \nthe Defense authorization bill stand in stark contrast to the House \nversion of the Defense authorization. The House bill, unwisely and \nregrettably, slashes funding for the DD(X) program, in contrast to the \nPresident's budget. Moreover, it actually rescinds funding for the \nDD(X) that was provided last year.\n  Just this week, in testimony before a House Armed Services \nSubcommittee, the Chief of Naval Operations testified that the Navy \nmust have the next generation destroyer, the DD(X). Admiral Clark, in \nwhat is undoubtedly one of his final, if not the final, appearances as \nChief of Naval Operations before his retirement, stated before the \nsubcommittee:\n\n       For the record, I am unequivocally in full support of the \n     DD(X) program. . . . The failure to build a next-generation \n     capability comes at the peril of the sons and daughters of \n     America's future Navy.\n\n  In response to the House addition of $2.5 billion to the shipbuilding \nbudget to buy two additional DDG Arleigh Burke-class destroyers in \nfiscal year 2006, the CNO clearly stated, ``I have enough DDGs.'' It is \nessential that we proceed with the DD(X) destroyer program.\n  The DD(X) will have high-tech capabilities that do not currently \nexist on the Navy's surface combatant ships. These capabilities include \nfar greater offensive and precise firepower; advanced stealth \ntechnologies, numerous engineering and technological innovations that \nallow for a reduced crew size; and sophisticated, advanced weapons \nsystems, such as a new electromagnetic rail gun.\n  Unfortunately, instability and dramatic changes have held back the \nprogress on the DD(X) program. Initially, the Pentagon planned to build \n12 DD(X)s over 7 years. To meet budget constraints, the Department \nslashed funding and now proposes to build only five DD(X)s over 7 \nyears, even though the Chief of Naval Operations has repeatedly stated \non the record before the Armed Services Committee, in both Chambers, \nthat the warfighting requirements remain unchanged and dictate the need \nfor the greater number--12 DD(X)s.\n\n  We have heard a lot about the cost growth in the DD(X) program and, \nindeed, the increase in the anticipated cost of constructing these \nvital destroyers is troubling to us all. But, ironically, one of the \nprimary drivers of cost growth in shipbuilding is instability. This \nlack of predictability in shipbuilding funding only increases the cost \nto our Nation's shipbuilders because they cannot effectively and \nefficiently plan their workload. And, of course, ultimately, it \nincreases the cost to the American taxpayer.\n  The Congress and the administration should be trying to minimize \nshipbuilding costs by ensuring a predictable, steadier, year-to-year \nlevel of funding. Regrettably, that has not been done.\n  Mr. President, the key to controlling the price of ships is to \nminimize fluctuations in the shipbuilding account. It is crucial that \nwe not only have the most capable fleet but also a sufficient number of \nships--and I add, shipbuilders--to meet our national security \nrequirements. Avoiding budget spikes affords more than ships; it \nprovides stability in Naval ship procurement planning and offers a \nsteady workload at our shipyards.\n  When budget requests change so dramatically from year to year, even \nwhen the military requirement stays the same, shipbuilders cannot plan \neffectively, and the cost of individual ships is driven upward. The \nnational security of our country is best served by a competitive \nshipbuilding industrial base, and this legislation before us today \nfully supports our Nation's highly skilled shipbuilding employees.\n  This important legislation also provides much-needed funds for other \nnational priorities. It includes an important provision that builds \nupon my work and the work of other committee members last year and this \nyear to authorize an increase in the death gratuity payable to the \nsurvivors of our military who have paid the ultimate price. It also \nauthorizes an increase in the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance \nbenefit. Surely, that is the least we can do for our brave service men \nand women.\n  This bill also improves care of our military by recommending a \nprovision that would strengthen and extend health care coverage under \nTRICARE Prime for the children of an Active-Duty service member who \ndies while on active duty.\n  This authorization bill is good for our Navy, good for our men and \nwomen in uniform who are serving our country all around the world, and \nI am pleased to offer my full support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nCantwell and Snowe be added as cosponsors to the amendment of the \nSenator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to make certain the Senator from \nVirginia is added as a cosponsor to the Frist amendment now pending at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, I believe, \nunder the UC is about to address the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the unanimous consent agreement, the \nSenator from New Jersey is to be recognized next, is my understanding.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, can we have a clarification?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand my friend from New Jersey has a unanimous \nconsent request to make. I will be glad to yield.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1351\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I understand I will be able to have \nsome time after the vote to discuss the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is very clear. The Senator from New \nJersey seeks up to how much time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If I can have 15 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Can we enter into a time agreement equally divided?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If we have time equally divided, then I ask the \nSenator from Virginia to allow a half hour equally divided.\n\n[[Page S8614]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think we will have to enter into that \nagreement later, but I will work toward that goal.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. With no second degrees possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Is the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey now at \nthe desk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg], for himself, \n     Mr. Corzine, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Feingold, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1351.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n        (Purpose: To stop corporations from financing terrorism)\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n                  TITLE XXXIV--FINANCING OF TERRORISM\n\n     SEC. 3401. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Stop Business with \n     Terrorists Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 3402.

ANNUAL REPORTING.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that investors and the public should be informed of \n     activities engaged in by a person that may threaten the \n     national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United \n     States, so that investors and the public can use the \n     information in their investment decisions.\n       (b) Regulations.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 120 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission \n     shall issue regulations that require any person subject to \n     the annual reporting requirements of section 13 of the \n     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m) to disclose \n     in that person's annual reports--\n       (A) any ownership stake of at least 10 percent (or less if \n     the Commission deems appropriate) in a foreign person that is \n     engaging in a transaction prohibited under section 3403(a) of \n     this title or that would be prohibited if such person were a \n     person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States; and\n       (B) the nature and value of any such transaction.\n       (2) Person described.--A person described in this section \n     is an issuer of securities, as that term is defined in \n     section 3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. \n     78c), that is subject to the jurisdiction of the United Sates \n     and to the annual reporting requirements of section 13 of the \n     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m).\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask that the amendment now be laid aside \nfor purposes under the UC agreement so that the Senator from \nMassachusetts may address the Senate, I believe for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1314\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am delighted to join our chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee and others in cosponsoring the chairman's \namendment. I commend him for his impressive leadership in bringing it \nbefore the Senate as one of the first amendments on this extremely \nimportant bill.\n  The amendment increases funding by $340 million for the Marine Corps \nand $105 for the Army for more and better armored vehicles for our \ntroops in Iraq.\n  This issue has been divisive for far too long. All of us support our \ntroops. We obviously want to do all we can to see that they have proper \nequipment, vehicles, and everything else they need to protect their \nlives and carry out their missions.\n  More than 400 troops have already died in military vehicles \nvulnerable to roadside bombs, grenades, and other notorious improvised \nexplosive devices.\n  Many of us have visited soldiers and marines at Walter Reed and \nBethesda\n\n[[Page S8615]]\n\nand seen the tragic consequences of inadequate armor. We want to ensure \nthat parents grieving at Arlington National Cemetery no longer ask, \n``Why weren't more armored humvees available?''\n  It is scandalous that the administration has kept sending them into \nbattle year after year in Iraq without adequate equipment. It is \nscandalous that desperate parents and spouses here at home have had to \nresort to Wal-Mart to try to buy armor and mail it to their loved ones \nin Iraq to protect them on the front lines. Secretary Rumsfeld has \nrarely been more humiliated than on his visit to Iraq, when a soldier \nhad the courage to ask him why the troops had to scavenge scrap metal \non the streets to protect themselves. The cheer that roared out from \ntroops when he asked that question said it all.\n  We have been trying to make sure the Army and Marine Corps has had \nthe right amount of funding for vehicles for over 2 years. Last year, \nwe tried to get additional funding in committee and faced resistance, \nbut ultimately added money to the supplemental.\n  This past spring, we were successful in getting the Army $213 million \nfor uparmored humvees. That amendment was adopted, but it was a very \nnarrow vote.\n  The Marine Corps leadership clearly understated the amount and types \nof ground equipment it needs. In April, we were told in a hearing that \nbased on what they knew from their operational commanders, the Marine \nCorps had met all of the humvee requirements for this year, which was \n398 uparmored humvees.\n  Less than a month later, the Inspector General of the Marine Corps \nconducted a readiness assessment of the their ground equipment in Iraq. \nOne of the key findings was that the requirement for additional \nupamored humvees would continue to grow. Based on that report and other \nfactors, the Marine Corps reversed itself and testified the need was \nalmost triple the original amount.\n  The inspector general's teams inspected many humvees in Iraq that had \nbeen damaged by mines and other explosive devices. In nearly every \ncase, they found that the cabin was well protected despite significant \ndamage to the engine compartment wheels.\n\n  The inspector general also found that even with recommended changes, \nincluding replacing damaged vehicles, the war will continue to take a \ntoll on the marines' equipment. Nearly all of its fighting gear is \nready for combat this year, they found but it would drop to less than \ntwo-thirds by the middle of 2008. It has taken far too long to solve \nthis problem. We have to make sure we solve it now, once and for all. \nWe can't keep hoping the problem will somehow go away.\n  We have been told for months that the Army's shortage of uparmored \nhumvees was a thing of the past. In a letter last October, General \nAbizaid said:\n\n       The fiscal year 2004 Supplemental Request will permit the \n     services to rapidly resolve many of the equipment issues you \n     mentioned to include the procurement of . . . humvees.\n\n  The Army could have and should have moved much more quickly to \ncorrect the problem. As retired General Paul Kern, who headed the Army \nMateriel Command until last November, said:\n\n       It took too long to materialize.\n\n  He said:\n\n       In retrospect, if I had it to do all over, I would have \n     just started building uparmored humvees. The most efficient \n     way would have been to build a single production line and \n     feed everything into it.\n\n  In April, GAO released a report that clearly identifies the struggles \nthe Pentagon has faced. In August 2003, only 51 uparmored humvees were \nbeing produced a month. It took the industrial base a year and a half \nto work up to making 400 a month. Now the Army says they can now get \ndelivery of 550 a month. The question is, Why did it take so long? Why \ndid we go to war without the proper equipment? Why didn't we fix it \nsooner, before so many troops have died?\n  We need to get ahead of this problem. It is a tragedy for which our \nsoldiers are still paying the price for this delay. As Pentagon \nacquisition chief Michael Wynne testified to Congress a year ago:\n\n       It's a sad story to report to you, but had we known then \n     what we know now, we would probably have gotten another \n     source involved. Every day, our soldiers are killed or \n     wounded in Iraq by IEDs, RPGs, small-arms fire. Too many of \n     these attacks are on humvees that are not uparmored, . . . We \n     are directing that all measures to provide protection to our \n     soldiers be placed on a top priority, most highly urgent, 24/\n     7 basis.\n\n  But 24/7 didn't happen even then until January this year. The plant \nhad capacity that the Pentagon never consistently used, as the plant's \ngeneral manager has said.\n  The delay was unconscionable. Without this amendment, the production \nrate of uparmored humvees could drop off again later this year. That is \nthe extraordinary thing. We need to guarantee that we are doing \neverything possible to get the protection to our troops as soon as \npossible. We owe it to them, to their families here at home and to the \nAmerican people.\n  We have an opportunity now to end this frustration once and for all. \nOur soldiers and marines deserve the very best, and it is our job in \nCongress to make sure the Department of Defense is finally getting it \nright. Too many have died because of these needless delays, but \nhopefully, this will be solved by what we do in this bill.\n  The amendment contributes significantly to this goal, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will be happy to share my brief time for remarks with \nmy colleague. The Senator has joined our bill and I appreciate him \nexpressing confidence in this amendment of the Senator from Virginia. I \ncommend the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, the Senator from \nIndiana, Mr. Bayh, and many others who worked in this area of the up-\narmoring of our military vehicles. But I must take issue with the \nSenator's observations that in any way the Department of Defense is \nopen to criticism because it has been a constantly evolving \nrequirements issue before the combatant commanders.\n  When we look at this record in a careful manner, we will see that the \nDepartment has responded very quickly to the communication from the \ncombatant commanders to adjust through the military departments, \nprimarily the Department of Army, the procurement of the necessary \nequipment.\n  This Senator from Virginia and others are very conscious of the IED \nproblem. I just visited Quantico and looked at their research and \ndevelopment facilities dealing with the IED question. Our committee \nperiodically, at least every 60 to 90 days, has the general in charge \nof the overall responsibility of IEDs in the Department to brief us on \nwhat are his needs and are they fully met financially and in every \nother way.\n  I frankly think the record shows that the Department of Defense is \ndoing its very best for a quickly evolving and changing set of facts \nrequiring the addition of up-armored vehicles.\n  Mr. President, is the amendment the pending business for the purpose \nof a vote at 12:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will be at 12:30.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me also commend the Senator from \nMassachusetts and the Senator from Indiana. They have been stalwarts in \nterms of urging we address this armor question.\n  Our service men and women continue to die and suffer grievous wounds \nin Iraq and Afghanistan, and by far the major casualty producer is the \nroadside bomb or mine--what the military calls an improvised explosive \ndevice or IED. The services are working to counter that threat through \na variety of means--better intelligence, innovative tactics, techniques \nand procedures, the use of jamming devices, and of course, adding armor \nto Army and Marine Corps HMMWVs and other trucks. On my recent visit to \nIraq, met with the Marines in Fallujah and viewed and discussed the \nvarious levels of armor protection on their HMMWVs and the new armor \npackage for their heavy truck.\n  The armor issue is both a good news and a bad news story. The good \nnews is that in just over 2 years, the Army and Marine Corps have gone \nfrom only a few hundred armored trucks to nearly 40,000 and 6,000 \nrespectively. Many people have worked night and day to make that \nhappen, and we commend and thank them for doing so. Congress has\n\n[[Page S8616]]\n\nconsistently provided all the funding requested and, in several \ninstances, has provided funding ahead of any request. In fact, the \nfiscal year 2005 Defense emergency supplemental added $1.2 billion for \nvarious force protection equipment, most notably for uparmored HMMWVs \nand add-on armor for HMMWVs and other trucks. As of last month, all \nknown requirements for truck armor for Iraq and Afghanistan were \nfunded, and the Army and Marine Corps were on track to complete those \nrequirements for HMMWVs by July and September respectively, and for \nother trucks by December of next year.\n  The bad news is that military commanders have been slow to recognize \nthe growing threat to thin-skinned HMMWVs and other trucks in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and determined requirements for armored trucks slowly and \nincrementally. For instance, in May of 2004, my staff sent me a memo \nwhich said:\n\n     The current Central Command requirement for [up-armored \n     HMMWVs in Iraq and Afghanistan is 4454. This appears to be an \n     ever-increasing number over the last year, having been \n     increased from 253 to 1233 to 1407 to 2957 to 3142 to 4149 to \n     4388, and finally to 4454. We have no confidence that it will \n     not be increased again in the future.''\n\n  That was a prescient statement because over the next year, the \nrequirement for uparmored HMMWVs continued to increase--to 10,079 for \nthe Army and 498 for the Marine Corps. The story was similar for the \nrequirements to armor other Army and Marine Corps trucks. These \nincremental increases in requirements have led to inefficient \nacquisition and unnecessary delays in getting armored trucks for our \ntroops.\n  It has also caused a lot of confusion and some fingerpointing, \nparticularly between the Army and the Marine Corps on the one hand \nO'Gara Hess, the company which produces the uparmored HMMWV, On the \nother. A recent New York Times article reported that ``in January, when \nit [referring to the Army] asked O'Gara to name its price for the \ndesign rights for the armor, the company balked and suggested instead \nthat the rights be placed in escrow for the Army to grab should the \ncompany ever fail to perform.'' With respect to the Marine Corps' \nuparmored HMMWV requirement, the same article further reported that, \n``asked why the Marine Corps is still waiting for the 498 humvees it \nordered last year, O'Gara acknowledged that it told the Marines it was \nbacked up with Army orders, and has only begun filling the Marines' \nrequest this month. But the company says the Marine Corps never asked \nit to rush.''\n  I questioned the Army Chief of Staff and the Commandant of the Marine \nCorps on these issues in a hearing on June 30. I asked the Army Chief \nof Staff for an answer for the record as to whether or not it was true \nthat the Army sought to purchase the design rights so that we could \nproduce the uparmored HMMWVs a lot more quickly and that the company \nbalked. I also asked the Commandant of the Marine Corps for an answer \nfor the record as to whether the Marine Corps ever asked O'Gara to rush \nits order for uparmored HMMWVs. Just this morning, I received a formal \nresponse from the Army on the design rights. The Marine Corps has \ninformally asserted that it did ask the company for accelerated \nproduction.\n  In its defense, Armor Holdings, the parent company of O'Gara Hess, \nhas said that at the time of the Marine Corps' inquiry in September of \n2004 relating to potential production of additional uparmored HMMWVs, \nthe company indicated its interest in and its ability to produce those \nvehicles, and that as soon as the order was actually placed by the \nMarines in February 2005, it began to work on and has already begun to \ndeliver those vehicles. What is still unclear is whether the Marine \nCorps ever coordinated a request for accelerated production through the \nArmy's Tank Automotive and Armaments Command which handles all of the \ncontract actions for upamored HMMWVs, and if it did, why the company \nwas not issued a contract to increase the production rate over and \nabove the increase from 450 to 550 a month that the Army requested in \nDecember of 2004.\n  With respect to the technical data package, TDP--the ``design \nrights'' discussed in the New York Times article--the Army says it \nrequested, for informational purposes only, that O'Gara Hess submit a \ncost proposal for procurement of the technical data package in order to \nobtain a price for a TDP complete enough for any firm to manufacture \nthe current uparmored HMMWV. The company has argued that the TDP was \ndeveloped by Armor Holdings, with its own money, under its own \ninitiative; that a formal request was never made by the Army to \npurchase that TDP as required under Federal Acquisition Regulations; \nthat the company responded to an informal e-mail inquiry to that effect \nin January 2005 by offering to place the TDP in escrow and in so doing, \nallow the Army instant access to the design information if the company \never failed to meet the Army's request. In the company's view, it saw \nno logic to the inquiry because it had met or exceeded every production \nrequirement and schedule, was ready and willing to produce more, and \nconsequently there was no need for the Army to obtain alternative \nproduction sources.\n  What is not clear is why the Army would request the rights to the TDP \nfor the uparmored HMMWV in January 2005, since already contracted for a \nthe uparmored HMMWVs it planned to procure in fiscal year 2006--the \nlast year that it intends to procure uparmored HMMWVs as it moves to \nimplement its long-term armor strategy of procuring removable armor \nkits. I am expecting further information from the Army and the Marine \nCorps soon to clear up these matters.\n  This illustrates the continued confusion surrounding uparmored HMMWVs \nthat has frustrated so many of us in Congress.\n  Given this background, and in light of the uncertainty as to whether \nrequirements would continue to increase, the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, in the markup of the fiscal year 2006 authorization bill, \nadded $120 million for the Army to continue to procure uparmored HMMWVs \nor add-on armor for HMMWVs and other trucks, even though the known \nrequirements for Iraq and Afghanistan had been met with fiscal year \n2005 emergency supplemental funding.\n  Now, however, it appears that the requirements have once again \nchanged. Central Command is currently considering a request from the \nSouthern European Task Force commander for additional uparmored HMMWVs \nfor Afghanistan. And the Marine Corps has decided to upgrade and \n``pure-fleet'' all 2,814 Marine Corps HMMWVs in the CENTCOM area of \noperations to the uparmored HMMWV configuration. Based on current, on-\nhand quantities, the Marine Corps could be short 1,826 uparmored \nHMMWVs.\n  To compound the potential problem, the Army plans to end all \nproduction of the uparmored HMMWV as it ramps up the production of a \nnew HMMWV model with a heavier chassis that is ready to accept an \nintegrated, bolt-on/off armor kit. However, the fiscal year 2006 \nPresident's budget only funds 90 of these vehicles with the armor kit. \nThis would not appear to be a prudent approach, given the history to \ndate of ever increasing requirements for truck armor.\n  The pending amendment would do two things: it would add $340 million \nto fund the 1,826 shortfall in the newest Marine Corps requirement for \nuparmored HMMWVs, and it would add $225 million to the Army for truck \narmor, an increase from the $120 million currently in the authorization \nbill. That is enough for the Army to procure the add-on armor kits for \nthe 4,037 M1152 HMMWVs that will currently be fielded without armor in \nfiscal year 2006. With this funding and these additional armor kits, by \nthe end fiscal year 2006 the Army will have fielded 16,768 HMMWVs with \nthe highest--Level 1--armor protection.\n  I whole-heartedly support this amendment and urge my colleagues to do \nlikewise. I also urge the Department of Defense to thoroughly review \nArmy and Marine Corps long-term truck armor strategies and ensure that \nall requirements are identified in a timely manner, and that sufficient \nfunding is requested in a timely manner so that we can ensure our \ntroops get the equipment they need and deserve as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. President, to reiterate, lack of armor for our troops has been \ntruly one of the most discouraging elements of the Iraq war. Partly it \nis because of what the Senator from Virginia said.\n\n[[Page S8617]]\n\nThere has been a change in requirements along the way. Partly it has \nbeen administrative failures along the way inside the Department.\n  Listen to a New York Times article that has a conflict between the \nArmy and Marines on the one hand and our producer, O'Gara Hess, on the \nother hand. The New York Times article says:\n\n       In January, when the Army asked O'Gara to name its price \n     for the design rights for the Army, the company balked and \n     suggested instead that the rights be placed in escrow for the \n     Army to grab should the company ever fail to perform.\n\n  So we have the Army asking the manufacturer how much would it cost to \nbuy the design rights so we could have a second line, so we could have \na second source, we are short of armor. And the Army says they never \ngot the answer. The producer says it was never asked formally. In the \nmeantime, men and women are dying in Iraq because of that kind of \nconfusion.\n  So, yes, the requirements have changed, but there have also been \nadministrative failures as well.\n  Then the Marines say they asked the company to rush the orders. The \ncompany denies it ever got the request to rush the orders.\n  Yes, the chairman is right, there have been changes in the \nrequirements, the numbers needed, but I am afraid the Senator from \nMassachusetts is also right, that there have been some true failures \nand incompetence in the administration of the armor program. The \ndifferences in the conflicts that exist between the stories told by the \nArmy and Marines on the one hand and the company that produces the \nhumvees on the other, it seems to me, are evidence of those failures.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for 30 seconds?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I know the time has run out. I want to mention the \nfamily of Mr. Hart, from Dracut, MA, who lost a son in Iraq. I remember \nseeing the letter that his son wrote that said: Unless we get an up-\narmored, I am not going to last very long. And 30 days later he was \nkilled. Mr. Hart has been tireless in trying to make sure other service \nmen and women in Iraq receive the kind of protection they need. I have \nto mention his name associated with the increase in the protection for \nAmerican servicemen because here is an individual who has made an \nextraordinary difference for our service men and women.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I think the vote is scheduled for 12:30. I \nask unanimous consent to proceed for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wholeheartedly support this amendment. I \ncommend our chairman for it and urge our colleagues to support the \namendment. In addition to that, I hope the Department of Defense will \nthoroughly review the Army and Marine Corps long-term truck armor \nstrategies so we can identify requirements in a timely manner, \nsufficient funding be requested in a timely manner so we can assure our \ntroops that they will get the equipment they need and deserve in time \nto meet the threat.\n  I know this Congress, under this chairman's leadership, has over and \nover again told the Defense Department: We will give you every dollar \nyou need. There are no financial constraints when it comes to \nsupporting our troops.\n  We have told them that over and over again. It should not be \nnecessary to add this money, but it is. I wholeheartedly support it, \nand I thank the chairman for his leadership.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Bayh of Indiana, who I know is \ntrying to get to the floor to support this amendment because of his \nleadership in this area, be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I believe the vote is in order at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1314, as modified.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Before the Senator from Oregon addresses the Senate, I \nwish to speak for 2 minutes and thank colleagues for their strong \nsupport of this amendment. We do not often get 100 votes. It was not \nput up here in mind that there would be 100 votes. It is very \nreassuring to send this strong messages to our Armed Forces and indeed \nthroughout the world that the Senate stands behind those measures which \nwill strengthen our ability to fight terrorism in the world.\n  At this point in time in the struggle against terrorism, not only \nwith our country but the coalition of nations, the type of weapons \nbeing employed, while basic in nature, are lethal in nature, and it \nrequires the modification of our military equipment. This amendment \nprovides the funds to do it.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                         Judge John G. Roberts\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in this Congress, no issue has riveted the \nattention of the American people like the heart-wrenching circumstances \nof the late Terri Schiavo. No issue has generated more public debate, \nmore heated controversy, or more passion than that tragedy. On the eve \nof the Easter recess, I blocked the effort in this Senate to dictate \nfrom the Senate a specific medical treatment in that end-of-life \ntragedy.\n  I did that for two major reasons. First, I believe that under the \nConstitution, the Founding Fathers intended for our citizens and their \nfamilies to have the privacy to decide these types of matters. Second, \nunder the Constitution, to the extent government has a defined role in \nmedical practice, it is a matter for the States and certainly not a \nsubject that should prompt Federal intrusion and meddling.\n  In my opinion, the events that unfolded in the Senate over Terri \nSchiavo need to be remembered as the Senate begins the consideration of \nthe nomination of Judge John Roberts to serve as an Associate Justice \nof the United States Supreme Court.\n  It is important for the Senate to reflect on those events because \nwhile the Court ultimately did not take up the Schiavo case, it was not \nfor lack of effort on the part of those who read the Constitution very \ndifferently than the intent of the Founding Fathers and longstanding \nlegal precedent prescribe.\n  I have come to the Senate today because I believe there will be many \nmore end-of-life cases presented to the U.S. Supreme Court. Current \ndemographic trends, the advancement of medical technologies, and \ncertainly the\n\n[[Page S8618]]\n\npassions this issue has generated ensure that the Court will be \nconfronted again and again with end-of-life issues.\n  Therefore, in my opinion, the Senate--under the advice and consent \nclause--has an obligation to inquire into how Judge Roberts sees end-\nof-life issues in the context of the Constitution.\n  I don't believe in litmus tests for Federal judges, but I intend to \nweigh carefully Judge Roberts' judicial temperament in this regard.\n  Moreover, I have a longstanding policy, begun first with our \nlegendary Senator, Mark Hatfield, and continued with my good friend, \nSenator Gordon Smith, that I will work in a bipartisan way to select \nFederal judges from our State for the President's consideration. \nRepeatedly, Oregon judges have been confirmed with whom I have \ndisagreed on a number of issues and with whom Senator Gordon Smith has \ndisagreed on a number of issues. I have put the ``no litmus test'' \npolicy to work often here in the Senate. I want to make clear that I \nhold to that principle today, but I will follow Judge Roberts' views on \nend-of-life issues carefully as his nomination is considered.\n  My statement today is also not an attempt to tease out a preview of \nhow Judge Roberts might rule on end-of-life cases that come before the \nCourt. I do believe, however, that the Senate would be derelict, given \nthe importance of this issue, not to ask the nominee questions that \nwill shed light on how he interprets the Constitution as it relates to \nend-of-life medical care.\n  End-of-life health care presents American families with immensely \ndifficult choices. In a country of 290 million people, our citizens \napproach these choices in dramatically different ways. Their judgments \nabout end-of-life care often blend religion, ethics, quality-of-life \nconcerns, and moral principles together and as the Senate found out \nthis spring, these judgments are considered extraordinarily personal \nand are passionately held.\n  What the Senate learned last spring in the Schiavo case is that the \nAmerican people want what the Constitution envisioned as their right--\njust to be left alone. Privacy law is complicated, and surely Senators \nhave differing interpretations about the meaning of legal precedent in \nthis area but the American people spoke loudly last spring that they \nconsidered the congressional action to mandate a specific medical \ntreatment for Terri Schiavo to be a gross overreach. I said at the time \nthat I agreed. I do not believe the Constitution should be stretched so \nas to crowd the steps of the Congress with families seeking settlement \nof their differences about end-of-life medical care. However, the U.S. \nSupreme Court is another matter. That body will most definitely see \nmore such end-of-life appeals. That is why the views of Judge Roberts \non this issue are so important.\n\n  Even as the Constitution envisioned a wide berth for individuals to \ndecide these private matters, it also provides parameters if there is \nto be any government involvement at all. Those parameters are guided by \nthe 10th amendment to our Constitution. The 10th amendment stipulates \nthat the powers not delegated to the United States--the Federal \nGovernment--by the Constitution are reserved for the States. \nHistorically and correctly, that includes the determination of medical \npractice within a State's own borders. There are few medical practice \ndecisions more wrenching than those at the end of life.\n  Once again, in the Schiavo case, the Congress sought to overstep its \nconstitutional bounds. What I want to know is whether Judge Roberts is \nsimilarly inclined to stretch our Constitution or whether he will \nconsider end-of-life issues with respect for our hallowed Constitution \nand the doctrine of stare decisis.\n  Finally, as we approach these issues, I make clear that I do not \nintend to prejudge the outcome of the confirmation process, but ask \nonly that the Senate weigh carefully these important issues and that \nquestions about end-of-life care be posed to the nominee.\n  I look forward to learning about the nominee's views, not just on \nend-of-life care, but on a variety of other critical matters and look \nforward to the Judiciary Committee beginning its thorough and careful \nevaluation in the days ahead. I have tried to make bipartisanship a \nhallmark of my service in the Senate. I certainly intend to use that \napproach as the Senate goes forward and considers the nomination of \nJudge Roberts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1351\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk. This \namendment shuts down a source of revenue that flows to terrorists and \nrogue regimes that threaten our security.\n  President Bush has made the statement that money is the lifeblood of \nterrorist operations. He could not be more right. Amazingly, some of \nour corporations are providing revenue to terrorists by doing business \nwith these rogue regimes. My amendment is simple. It closes a loophole \nin the law that allows this to happen, that allows American companies \nto do business with enemies of ours. This will cut off a major source \nof revenue for terrorists. What we need to do is to starve these \nterrorists at the source. By using this loophole, some of our companies \nare feeding terrorism by doing business with Iran, which funds Hamas, \nHezbollah, as well as the Islamic Jihad.\n\n  I want to remind my colleagues that it was Iran that funded the 1983 \nterrorist act in Beirut that killed 241 United States Marines--241 \nMarines killed by Iranian terror--and yet we are currently allowing \nUnited States corporations to provide revenues to the Iranian \nGovernment. It has to stop.\n  So how do U.S. companies get around terrorist sanctions laws? Because \nwe have those laws that are supposed to prevent contact and opportunity \nfor those nations that support terrorism. The process is simple. These \ncompanies run the Iranian operations out of a foreign subsidiary.\n  I have a chart here that shows the route that is taken to get these \nfunds to these companies that do business with Iran. The U.S. \ncorporation sets up a subsidiary, sets up a foreign subsidiary. They do \nbusiness directly with Iran. And again, support for Hezbollah and Hamas \nis common knowledge with Iran.\n  Our sanctions laws prohibit United States companies from doing \nbusiness with Iran, but the law contains a loophole. It enables an \nAmerican company, a U.S. company's foreign subsidiaries, to do business \nprohibited by the parent. As long as this loophole is in place, our \nsanctions laws have no teeth. My amendment would close this loophole \nonce and for all. It would say foreign subsidiaries controlled by a \nU.S. parent, American parent, would have to follow U.S. sanctions \nlaws--pretty simple.\n  The Iranian Government's links to terrorism are, as you know, Mr. \nPresident, substantial. In addition to the 241 Marines who were \nbrutally murdered in their sleep in 1983 in Beirut, Iranian-backed \nterrorists killed innocent civilians in Israel.\n  A constituent of mine, Sarah Duker, 22 years old, from the town of \nTeaneck, NJ, was riding a bus in Jerusalem. The bus was blown up in \n1996 by Hamas, and Hamas receives funding support from the Iranian \nGovernment. We were able to create an opportunity for American citizens \nto bring action against Iran, and they did that, and there was a \nresolution of significant proportion that holds Iran responsible and \nhas them owing substantial sums of money to the victim's family. We \nalso have to worry, however, about providing revenue to Iran because of \nits well-known desire--we see it now. It worries us all. We have all \nkinds of conversations about what we do as Iran tries to build a \nnuclear bomb and other weapons of mass destruction. Well, we don't want \nto help them, we don't want to help provide revenues, opportunities for \nthem to continue this crazy pursuit.\n  The 911 Commission, which established the intelligence organization \nreform, concluded in their report, and I quote:\n\n       Preventing the proliferation of WMD warrants a maximum \n     effort.\n\n  Everybody in our country shares that view. Allowing American \ncompanies to provide revenue to rogue WMD programs is clearly not part \nof a maximum effort.\n  Some think this is an isolated problem, but it is not. A report by \nthe Center for Security Policy says there is a large number of \ncompanies doing business with Iran and other sponsors of terror. Think \nabout it. Here we have\n\n[[Page S8619]]\n\n130,000, 140,000 of our best young people over there fighting to bring \ndemocracy to Iraq while Iran is funding terrorist activities, people \nwho come in there and help those who would kill our troops. The terror \nthey fund has killed hundreds of Americans. Iran continues to seek to \ndevelop nuclear weapons, and yet American companies are utilizing a \nloophole in the law in order to do business with the Iranian \nGovernment. It is wrong but not yet illegal. And we want to make it \nillegal. This amendment would change that.\n  It is inexcusable for American companies to engage in any business \npractice that provides revenues to terrorists, and we have to stop it. \nHere we have a clear view of what happens. We have a chance to stop it \nwith this amendment. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and \nclose the terror funding loophole.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on our side we will at an appropriate time \ninterject our opposition to this amendment. We have just gotten the \namendment, and it requires some further study. So until such time as I \nget some additional material, I will have to defer my statement in \nopposition.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I hope my distinguished colleague and friend from \nVirginia, without having a chance to do the examination he would like, \nhas not suggested opposition even though there hasn't been time for a \nthorough review.\n  I know the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee \nvery well, and we have visited sites of war, and he, like I, served in \nWorld War II, and we are veterans. I hope I could encourage the Senator \nfrom Virginia and colleagues across the aisle to join us to shut down \nthis loophole that permits American companies to do business indirectly \nthrough sham corporations and to earn profits as there are attempts to \nkill our young people. I hope the distinguished manager of the bill \nwould give us a chance to talk about the amendment and not register \nopposition before having a chance to study it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as I said, in due course I will have \nfurther to say. But again it comes down to separation of powers between \nthe executive and legislative branches, and given those situations--and \nI respect my good friend's evaluation of the tragedy associated with \npeople in those lands and the potential for some dollars being funded \ntoward that purpose. But the President has to look at this situation \nconstantly, every day, 365 days a year. Situations change. And for the \nCongress to lay on a blanket prohibition on Presidential power to \nexercise his discretion of where and when and how to disrupt the flow \nof dollars, as pointed out by my colleague from New Jersey, we are very \nmuch hesitant to do that. So at the appropriate time I will have \nfurther to say about this amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend our colleague from New Jersey for \nthis amendment. It is ironic--the person who is presiding at this \nmoment will understand this reference--that when it comes to Cuba, the \nsanctions not only apply to companies that would deal with Cuba under \nour law but also apply to their subsidiaries. And yet when it comes to \nthe subsidiaries of companies that are dealing with terrorism, which \nhave sanctions against them for different reasons, we don't cover the \nsubsidiaries. So with Cuba, the subsidiaries are covered when it comes \nto sanctions, but when it comes to dealing with states that are on a \nterrorist list where the President of the United States decides to \nexercise his discretion to impose sanctions against a country and where \ncompanies are not thereby allowed to do business with that country, we \ndon't cover the subsidiaries of the corporations, only the corporations \nthemselves.\n  It is not only a loophole which has been pointed out by my friend \nfrom New Jersey, but it is a very inconsistent treatment. What the \nSenator from New Jersey is saying is let's do the same for the \nsubsidiaries of corporations that deal with terrorist states and \nterrorist organizations and groups as we cover subsidiaries that deal \nwith Cuba. I thank him for pointing out the loophole. If we are going \nto be serious about our war on terrorism, we have to be serious about \nproviding sanctions against states that support terrorism. We have to \nbe serious about telling American companies they cannot deal with those \nstates or with those entities, and that we are truly serious. We have \nto also tell companies when we say you may not deal with terrorist \nstates, you may not do business with terrorist states when the \nPresident so determines, that we are also applying this to your \nsubsidiaries as well.\n  So it is an important amendment. We had a vote on a very similar \namendment I believe a year ago or so. It almost passed this body. I \nthink it came within one vote, and I hope that, given what we have seen \nin the last year, we can only reinforce the point which the Senator \nfrom New Jersey made in his amendment previously, that we can pick up \nthe additional votes this time and pass this very important amendment. \nI commend him on it.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Michigan.\n  The question is why we would want to protect the opportunity for an \nAmerican company to help fund terrorists directly and indirectly, those \nwho want to kill our people. If you ask the average person who are the \nworst enemies America has, they would, I am sure, list Iran, North \nKorea, among those that would develop weapons of mass destruction, and \nwe don't even want there to be the slightest opportunity for cash to \nflow into their development of a weapons program based on the fact that \nan American company is helping to fund the development of those \nweapons.\n  Heaven knows what we are fighting in Iraq is a battle not against a \nuniformed army, organized military, but against insurgents, terrorists, \nand all one has to do is look at the death toll and see it continuing \nto mount. We care mostly about Americans, but we also don't like to see \nwhat happens in Iraq to infants and families. These terrorists bring \ntheir violence into the country, ripping limbs off. I don't want to get \ntoo detailed, but the horror that is brought from these insurgent \nattacks is beyond description. And to permit--by the way, I will say \nthis--encourage American companies to do business with Iran is \noutrageous. In the war the Senator from Virginia and I were in, anybody \nwho did business with the enemy would be pilloried, called traitors. \nAnd here, because it is a loophole, there is a roundabout way of \ngetting these funds over there, we are saying, no, no, we don't want to \ninterrupt that process.\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides will say no to this practice, and \nshut it down. The last thing we want to do in this room is abet and \nhelp companies that do business in Iran because the profit is not worth \nit. There is no way those profits can be enjoyed by shareholders, by \nemployees, anyone.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia, and I thank my friend from \nVirginia for being so patient in listening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is always a pleasure to hear my old \nfriend and colleague in the Senate of so many years. At the appropriate \ntime I and others will put forth our case on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Lautenberg amendment \nbe laid aside and that time be granted to our distinguished colleague \nand very valued member of the committee, the Senator from Rhode Island, \nMr. Reed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator kindly yield so I can \ninform the Senate of the desire on behalf of this side of the aisle?\n  Mr. REED. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will wait to propound the unanimous consent request \nuntil the other side responds. I am going to ask unanimous consent--but \nI will wait until we get a response from the other side--that a vote on \nor in relation to the Frist amendment No. 1342, regarding supporting \nour Boy Scouts, and others, occur at 2:15 today, with no second-degree \namendments in order prior to the vote; provided further that there be 2 \nminutes equally divided for debate prior to the vote. So I\n\n[[Page S8620]]\n\nsay there is the strong likelihood that request will be granted.\n  I thank the Senator for his courtesy.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, let me begin by commending Chairman Warner \nand Senator Levin for the way they have brought this bill to the floor. \nIt is a collaborative effort, a collegial effort which has brought to \nthe floor a very good bill, which we hope can be improved by the \namendment process. But we begin, I think, in a position of great \nstrength and great unified support for our military forces across the \nglobe, these young and women who make us so proud and do so much to \nprotect our country.\n  I would like to step back for a moment and try to have an assessment \nin the context of our deliberations today with respect to the Defense \nauthorization bill. It has been 28 months since the war in Iraq began. \nIt has been 26 months since President Bush declared ``mission \naccomplished'' onboard the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln. And it has \nbeen almost 13 months since the sovereignty of Iraq was handed over \nfrom the Coalition Provisional Authority to the people of Iraq.\n  It is time, I think, for an assessment. It is time for an assessment \nin the context of our deliberations today with respect to this very \nimportant legislation governing the conduct of our military forces \naround the globe.\n  In October 2002, I was one of 23 Members of this body who voted \nagainst the congressional authorization to use force against Iraq. \nRegardless of how we voted that day, on this day we are united in \nsupport of our forces in the field. We have to give them what they need \nto do the job they were called upon to perform.\n  Back in October 2002, I was not convinced there were weapons of mass \ndestruction that could be used effectively by the Iraqis. I was also \nconcerned that our stay in Iraq would not be tranquil, that we would \nnot be greeted as liberators, but we would literally be sucked into a \nswirling vortex of ethnic and sectarian rivalries, of ancient feuds, of \neconomic problems, of infrastructure problems, which I think should \nhave provided us a more cautionary view of our preemptive attack.\n  Again, despite our forebodings then, our mission now is to be sure we \nprovide the resources necessary for our soldiers and sailors and \nmarines and airmen and airwomen to carry the day for us.\n  What we have seen since that day, in my view, has been a series of \nmistakes and errors by the administration in carrying out their \npolicies, and also an inability to recognize some of these mistake and \nto take effective corrective action. I think this inability to \nrecognize what has gone wrong--to admit it and to correct it--still \nacts to interfere with the successful implementation of our objectives \nin Iraq.\n  One of the most glaring and most obvious aspects of our runup to the \nwar in Iraq is the fact that the American people were told one thing \nand in reality it turned out to be something quite different. The \nadministration argued that Iraq posed an imminent threat to the Nation, \nwhich we all know today is simply not true, and some of us then \nbelieved was not true.\n\n  In his State of the Union to the American people in January 2003, the \nPresident talked about Saddam Hussein seeking significant quantities of \nuranium from Africa.\n  Those assertions proved unsubstantiated. In his address to the U.N. \nSecurity Council, Secretary of State Powell claimed Iraq had seven \nmobile biological agent factories. That, too, proved to be inaccurate.\n  In a February 2003 statement, President Bush stated:\n\n       Senior members of Iraqi intelligence and al Qaeda have met \n     at least eight times since the early 1990s. Iraq has sent \n     bomb-making and document forgery experts to work with al \n     Qaeda. Iraq has also provided al Qaeda with chemical and \n     biological weapons training.\n\n  Again, these assertions have not been substantiated in the \nintervening days. Many leaders in the administration stated that Iraq \nattempted to buy high-strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear \nweapons production. These assertions also proved to be without major \nsubstantiation.\n  Based on these statements by our Nation's leaders, the majority of \nthe Congress and the American people supported our operations in Iraq \nin October 2002. But it was not long until these misstatements became \nclearer to the American public.\n  The CIA sent two memos to the White House 3 months before the State \nof the Union Address expressing doubts about Iraq's attempt to buy \nyellowcake from Niger.\n  In 2002, the CIA produced a report that found inconclusive evidence \nof links between Iraq and al-Qaida and was convinced that Saddam \nHussein never provided chemical or biological weapons to terrorist \nnetworks.\n  Experts at the Department of Energy long disputed the assertion that \nthe aluminum tubes were suitable for nuclear weapons production.\n  The administration's use and misuse of prewar intelligence has caused \nan upheaval in the intelligence community and made Congress, the \nAmerican people, and the world community skeptical of actions with Iraq \nand other countries of concern.\n  I believe this mistake will take years to overcome. What it has done, \nI think, is provide a sense of skepticism in the American public about \nthe justifications for our operations in Iraq. This skepticism has \nslowly been eating away, as reflected in the polls, the view of the \nAmerican public as to the usefulness of our operations in Iraq. Once \nagain, what is heartening is the fact that this skepticism has not \ntranslated into anything other than unconditional support for our \nAmerican soldiers and military personnel. That is critical to what they \ndo and critical to what we should be encouraging here.\n  We are now engaged in this war. People are skeptical and critical of \nthe premises advanced by the administration. But we must, in fact, stay \nuntil the job is done, until a satisfactory outcome is achieved.\n  The military phase of Operation Iraqi Freedom was brilliantly \nexecuted and a great success. It shows the extraordinary preponderance \nof military power we can wield in a conventional conflict where we are \nsending task forces of tanks and mechanized infantry against other \nconventional military forces.\n  Perhaps, however, the most important part of the operation was not \ndefeating the enemy in the field but winning the peace in Iraq. That \nlarger task has not gone as well as we all had hoped. One reason is \nbecause we did not plan for operations after our conventional success. \nAccording to an article in the Philadelphia Inquirer, when a lieutenant \ncolonel briefed war planners and intelligence officials in March 2003 \non the administration's plans for Iraq, the slide for the rebuilding \noperation, or phase 4-C, as the military denotes it, read ``To Be \nProvided.'' We went in with a plan to defeat the military force in Iraq \nbut no plan to occupy and reconstruct the country.\n\n  What makes this lack of a plan worse is that the experts knew and \ntold the Pentagon what to expect. The same Philadelphia Inquirer \narticle states there was a ``foot high stack of material'' discussing \nthe probability of stiff resistance in Iraq. A former senior \nintelligence official said:\n\n       It was disseminated. And ignored.\n\n  There was ample planning done but not used. We have had, as all \nmilitary forces, contingency plans dating back many years for possible \noperations in Iraq, including occupation operations. They were ignored. \nThere was a feeling--an erroneous feeling--we would be greeted as \nliberators, that it would be basically a parade, rather than the \nstruggle we have seen today.\n  The results are clear as to this lack of planning. The insurgency \ntoday is robust, and it continues to inflict damage not only against \nAmerican military personnel but also against Iraqis who are struggling \nto develop a democratic country.\n  In May there were about 700 attacks against American forces using \nIEDs, the highest number since the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The surge \nin attacks has coincided with the appearance of significant advancement \nin bomb design. This is not only a robust insurgency, it is a very \nadaptable insurgency. They are learning as they fight, and that makes \nthem a formidable foe.\n  Improvised explosive devices now account for about 70 percent of \nAmerican casualties in Iraq. Recent U.S. intelligence estimates put the \ninsurgents'\n\n[[Page S8621]]\n\nstrength at somewhere between 12,000 and 20,000. I would note that in \nMay 2003, insurgent strength was estimated to be about 3,000 persons. \nSo this is not the last gasp of the insurgency. This is an insurgency \nthat has momentum, has personnel, and increasingly has technical \nsophistication.\n  As of today, July 21, 1,771 American soldiers have been killed, and \n13,189 have been wounded. I say American soldiers. I will use that as a \nshorthand for valiant marines, Navy personnel, Air Force personnel, \nbecause every service has suffered in Iraq.\n  One of the reasons the insurgency may be stronger is because most of \nthe 300-mile border with Syria remains unguarded because of a lack of \nsufficient troops, allowing insurgents and foreign fighters to freely \nmove back and forth between the countries. This insurgency is also \nallowed to move freely within the country because there are \ninsufficient troops to break insurgent strongholds.\n  We have seen operations, very successful operations, such as the \ntremendously valiant and skillful operations of marines reducing the \nnumber of insurgents in Fallujah. But then at the end of the day, or \ndays later, Marine forces withdraw or pull back, and Fallujah again is \na source of at least incipient resistance to the central Government of \nIraq.\n  In addition, these insurgents continue to have ample ammunition \nbecause it is estimated that even today approximately 25 percent of the \nhundreds of munitions dumps have not yet been fully secured. I was \namazed, in my first trip to Iraq--one of five I have taken--to be up in \nthe area of operations of the 4th Infantry Division with General \nOdierno, and also at the time with General Petraeus, then the commander \nof the 101st, when they pointed out there were hundreds and hundreds \nand hundreds of ammunition dumps unsecured by any military personnel, \ninternational, American, or Iraqi.\n  If you want to know where all this ammunition and explosives are \ncoming from, well, it was there. It was stolen. It was diverted. It was \nhidden away. And now it is being used against our soldiers.\n  To me, that is a glaring example of why we should have had more \ntroops on the ground at the beginning and, indeed, more troops on the \nground today. But that was not done.\n  Perhaps the most well-known consequence of undermanning is the abuses \nat Abu Ghraib. It was a prison out of control, and one primary reason \nwas the lack of U.S. military personnel. In 3 weeks, the population of \nthis prison rose from 700 prisoners to 7,000. Yet the number of Army \npersonnel guarding these prisoners remained at 90 personnel.\n  As former CPA Administrator Paul Bremer stated in October 5, 2004:\n\n       The single most important change, the one thing that would \n     have improved the situation, would have been having more \n     troops in Iraq at the beginning of the war and throughout.\n\n  Subsequently, he might have modified or somehow explained this \ncomment, but I think that is an accurate assessment. On October 5, \n2004, that was his assessment. Today, months after President Bush \ndeclared the end of major combat operations and predicted that troop \nlevels would be at 105,000, over 138,000 troops are still stationed in \nIraq and are likely to be there for some time. I would argue that that, \nin fact, is not sufficient force. When we cannot secure the borders, \nwhen we cannot secure ammunition dumps, when we cannot do many things \nthat are central to stability in Iraq, then we need more forces on the \nground.\n  One of the more frustrating aspects of the administration's \nunwillingness to adjust troop levels was that Congress was ready and \nwilling to help. You can't have additional forces on the ground in Iraq \nunless you have additional forces in the Army and the Marine Corps, our \nland forces. Senator Hagel and I first raised concerns about this issue \nin October 2003. We offered an amendment to the fiscal year 2004 \nemergency supplemental to raise the end strength of the Active-duty \nArmy by 10,000. The amendment was passed by this body, but it was \ndropped in conference, primarily because of the opposition of the \nadministration. Then again in 2004, Senator Hagel and I offered an \namendment to the fiscal year 2005 Defense authorization bill which was \npassed by concerned Senators by a vote of 94 to 3. This amendment \nraised Army end strength by 20,000 personnel and the Marines' end \nstrength by 3,000.\n  However, the President's budget request this year did not acknowledge \nthese end-strength increases. We will therefore try again. The bill \nwhich we are presently considering authorizes an end strength of \n522,400 personnel for the active Army, 40,000 more than the President \nrequested, and 178,000 active personnel for the Marines, 3,000 more \nthan requested. I hope, in fact, we might be able to augment even these \nend-strength numbers.\n  In addition, I hope we can finally pay for these increased regular \nsoldiers not through supplemental appropriations but in the regular \nbudget itself. We are deluding ourselves to think that we can live for \nthe 5 or 10 years we will have a significant engagement in Iraq--and \nthat is roughly along the lines of even admissions by the Department of \nDefense--unless we are prepared to have not a temporary fix to the end \nstrength but a permanent fix, paid for through the budget and not \nthrough supplementals.\n  One other aspect, in addition to the notion of end strength and the \nnumber of personnel on active duty, is how do we recruit and retain \nthese soldiers to maintain overall end strength. This issue is of acute \nconcern because unless we are able to attract new soldiers and Marines \nand unless we are able to retain the seasoned veterans, we will no \nlonger have the kind of force we need.\n  When Senator Hagel and I first offered our amendment in October 2003 \nto increase end strength, there was a headline which said quite a bit. \nIts words were, ``Another Banner Military Recruiting and Retention \nYear.'' Back in 2003, we could attract soldiers, Marines to the \nservice, much more so than today. That was the time period to act. Not \nonly was the need obvious, but the means to obtain objective, willing \nrecruits were also much more evident.\n  Since the administration has refused to raise the numbers of troops \noverall--and the number of troops in particular in Iraq--the Army has \nbeen worn down by repeated deployments and a persistent insurgency. \nNow, ironically, even if we raise end-strength numbers, it is going to \nbe very difficult for the Army to recruit these new soldiers. The Army \nmissed its February through March 2005 recruiting goals. In June, the \nArmy recruited 6,157 soldiers, 507 over their goal. However, the June \n2005 goal was 1,000 fewer soldiers than the preceding year. One might \nthink that the goalposts were moved.\n  As of June 30, the Army recruited 47,121 new soldiers in the year \n2005, but that is just 86 percent of its goal. General Schoomaker, \nChief of Staff, said the Army will be hard pressed to reach its goal of \n80,000 Active-Duty recruits by the end of the fiscal year in September.\n  Despite the improvement in June, the Army has only 3 months left to \nrecruit soldiers; that is, it will have to recruit on an average of \n11,000 soldiers a month, which is a target way beyond the expectation \nof anyone. The June numbers were also not anywhere near the 8,086 \nrecruits the Army brought in during January. This recruiting problem is \npersistent, and it is causing extreme difficulty.\n  These are Active-Duty recruits. The Army National Guard also has its \nchallenges in recruiting. The Army National Guard is the cornerstone of \nU.S. forces in Iraq. I am extraordinarily proud of my Rhode Island \nGuard men and women. They have served with great distinction. During \nthe first days of the war, the 115th and the 119th military police \ncompanies and the 118th military police battalion were in the thick of \nthe fight in Fallujah and Baghdad. Since that time, we have had our \nfield artillery unit, the 103rd field artillery unit, deployed. We have \nhad a reconnaissance unit, the 173rd, deployed. The 126th aviation \nbattalion, the Blackhawk battalion, has been deployed. They have done a \nmagnificent job. The Army National Guard, however, is also seeing the \neffects of this operation and the strains are showing.\n  The Guard missed its recruiting goal for at least the ninth straight \nmonth in June. They are nearly 19,000 soldiers below authorized \nstrength. The Army Guard was seeking 5,032 new soldiers in June, but \nsigned up roughly 4,300. It is more than 10,000 soldiers behind its\n\n[[Page S8622]]\n\nyear-to-date goal of almost 45,000 recruits, and it has missed its \nrecruiting target during at least 17 of the last 18 months. Lieutenant \nGeneral Blum, Chief of the National Guard Bureau, said it is unlikely \nthat the Guard will achieve its recruiting goal for fiscal year 2005, \nwhich ends September 30.\n\n  Today our Army is one Army. It is not an active force with reservists \nin the background. A significant percentage of the forces today in Iraq \nare National Guard men and women. We cannot continue to operate our \nArmy, not only to respond to Iraq but to other contingencies, if we do \nnot have a fully staffed National Guard and Reserves.\n  Looking at the Army Reserve, the story is the same. So far this year, \nthe Army Reserve has only been able to recruit 11,891 soldiers. Their \ntarget is roughly 16,000. At this point, they are about 26 percent \nshort of their goal.\n  One Army recruiting official noted that since March, the Army has \ncanceled 15 basic training classes for the infantry at Fort Benning \nbecause it did not have the soldiers, 220 to 230 of them for each those \nclasses. Now they will begin processing smaller classes of about 180 to \n190.\n  Complementing the recruiting effort, of course, is the retention \neffort. Retention is a ``good news'' story. Retention rates are high. \nBut they won't address certain key personnel vacancies which are being \ndiscovered within the military.\n  From October 1 to June 30, the Army reenlisted about 53,000 soldiers, \n6 percent ahead of its goal. At that pace, the Army would finish this \nfiscal year with 3,800 troops ahead of the targeted 64,000. However, \nthat still is a 12,000-troop shortfall when you look at the recruiting \nand retention numbers together.\n  One method the Army is using to maintain retention levels is the so-\ncalled stop-loss procedure, where someone who might be able to leave \nthe service at the end of enlistment, if their unit is notified to go \nto Iraq, they cannot leave during that notification period and during \nthat deployment period. That adds to retention a bit, but it is not \nsomething that, over time, year in and year out, can be sustained.\n  So we have a situation now where our Army is deeply stressed, and \nthis stress is demonstrated very clearly in recruitment, very clearly \nin making end-strength numbers which we are trying to increase.\n  The Army is also trying to deal with this issue of recruitment and \nretention by looking at their standards. One of the dangers--and it \nhasn't become manifest yet but it certainly has been in previous \nconflicts--is that there is a huge effort or tension, if you will, to \nreduce standards in order to get people to come in. I don't think that \nhas happened yet, but that is looming over the horizon. I think we have \nto be conscious in this body to look carefully at the numbers, not just \nin terms of how many soldiers enlisted but also that we are continuing \nto maintain adequate quality within the forces. I think we are, but I \nam afraid that continued pressure on the forces will force military \npersonnel to begin to look at ways they can attract forces by weakening \nthe criteria.\n  We are in a situation where we have to be very conscious of the \nstress that is on the Army, and we also have to do more to support the \nArmy, particularly in recruiting and retaining. The Congressional \nResearch Service has determined that approximately 50 new incentives \nhave been signed into law since the United States invaded Iraq. These \nare positive tools to enhance recruitment and retention. But while \nthese incentives are needed, we must acknowledge the cost the \nGovernment is paying is a significant sum. We must pay that sum, but we \nmust recognize that this is an expensive proposition of recruiting \nvolunteers in a time of war.\n  The other aspect that we should be concerned about is the fact that \nwe have seen a situation in Iraq where now we are discovering shortages \nof key personnel, complaints that the soldiers in the field, the units \nin the field, were not fully resourced, had inadequate training, again, \nmost demonstrably the Abu Ghraib situation where the lack of resources \nand training were singled out. What we have found though is that, going \nback, no one seemed to be complaining--at least to us--about these lack \nof resources.\n  One fear I have is that there essentially has been a chilling effect \nby Secretary Rumsfeld with respect to advice flowing from the field \ninto the Pentagon and to him. The most notorious example of this might \nbe the treatment of General Shinseki, as we all recall. He was asked--\nhe did not volunteer--about the size of the force needed in Iraq. And \nhe said something on the order of several hundred thousand soldiers. He \nwas immediately castigated by the Secretary, who said his estimate was \nfar from the mark. Secretary Wolfowitz called the estimate outlandish, \nand then, in his few remaining days in the Army, General Shinseki felt \nshunned by the civilian leadership of the Pentagon. In fact, General \nShinseki's observation was more accurate than any of the plans being \nadvanced by the Secretary of Defense.\n  This aspect of criticizing professional officers who come forward \npublicly at our request and give their professional opinion does not \ncreate the kind of environment that is conducive to bringing forward \nadvice and to recognizing problems and to providing the kind of \nleadership which is necessary.\n  It wasn't just limited to General Shinseki. The former Secretary of \nthe Army, Secretary Thomas White, defended the Army on several \noccasions, disagreed with the Secretary. He was, for all intents and \npurposes, cashiered. That sends a bad signal, and it has a chilling \neffect. We are living with that chilling effect today, unfortunately.\n\n  Then again, as I mentioned, as we look at Abu Ghraib, that is one of \nmost serious issues we face here, this lack of resources, the lack of \ntraining. All of that was not apparently diagnosed and reported in \nadequate ways so it could be corrected in a timely way. We have seen \nhow this incident has caused tremendous implications in the Islamic \nworld. It has questioned our conduct. It has set us up for criticism, \nand it has been--in terms I used with Secretary Rumsfeld when he \nappeared before us--a disaster for us. Still, I don't think we have \nfully accounted for what happened. I don't think we adequately \nunderstand how techniques that were developed for use at Guantanamo, \nwhich was deemed by the President to be not under the legal control of \nthe Geneva Convention, how those techniques might relate to Iraq which, \naccording to the President, was fully subject to the Geneva \nConventions. How did those techniques move from one area to another \narea? It wasn't simply five or six individual soldiers; it was \nsomething more than that. We have had several snapshots. We have had 12 \nreports, but they have looked at various pieces. I don't think we have \na comprehensive view of what happened.\n  More importantly, I think we have yet to be able to step back and \ndetermine, in a careful and thoughtful way, what the rule should be. As \nI talk to senior officers, one of their demands is: Give us clear \nrules. Give us the policy. And that policy has to be produced not in \nthe secretive corridors of the Pentagon but here--and perhaps not here, \ndirectly in the Congress, but through a commission that we can adopt \nthat will look at what happened, put all the pieces together and then \nrecommend what changes we must make so that we can conduct this war on \nterror without sacrificing our principle dedication to international \nlaws and also without putting our troops in danger. Because \nunfortunately what we do, even if it is the aberrant acts of a few \nsoldiers, could easily be emulated by others when our soldiers fall \ninto their hands. That would be terrible.\n  Now, there is another aspect of the problem. We can win a military \nvictory in Iraq, but unless we restore the country economically and \nhelp them develop a viable political process, we will not succeed. The \nreconstruction activities to date have been sadly lacking and lagging. \nWe have approximately $18.1 billion committed to the effort, but these \ndollars have not been spent well or wisely. Most of the money is going \nto what they call ``security premiums'' because of the instability in \nIraq.\n  My colleagues, including Senator Lautenberg, were talking about some \nof the aspects of what appears to be excessive billing by our \ncontractors. And, of course, more and more attention is being paid to \nthe issue of corruption and bribery within the context of the Iraqi \neconomy. All of this suggests that we have a long way to go before we \ncan demonstrate to the Iraqi people those palpable benefits which I \nbelieve\n\n[[Page S8623]]\n\ncan help them and force their allegiance to their government more \nquickly.\n  One of the areas of concern is oil production. There were those in \nWashington, before the invasion, who said that within a few months we \nwill be pumping oil and it will be a profit center, it will pay for the \nwhole war, and we don't have to worry about anything. We are not nearly \npaying for this war with the proceeds of Iraqi oil production.\n  The goal was to export a certain number, and we are falling short of \nthat number of barrels per day. Iraqi oil revenue will be $5 billion to \n$6 billion short this year. That revenue pays for many things--\nsubsidies for petroleum in Iraq, food, civil service, and it pays for \ninfrastructure. Who is going to make up that shortfall? If we leave in \na situation when the Iraqis cannot generate enough money to pay their \nown budget, what is going to happen to that country?\n  So we have huge economic problems. Another manifestation of the \neconomic problems of the Iraqi Government is electricity. It is the key \nto stability. There are places in Baghdad today that are enjoying fewer \nhours of electricity than they did under Saddam Hussein. As a result, \nthere are brownouts and blackouts. It is a direct reminder to the \npeople that things are not going so well. We need to get that situation \nin order.\n  Now, as General Abizaid pointed out:\n\n       Military forces, at the end of the day, only provide the \n     shield behind which politics takes place.\n       Providing politics that are open, transparent, and \n     legitimate, we have been trying to do that.\n\n  There has been established a process to draft a constitution. We hope \nby August 15, 2005, a draft is presented to the nation and can be voted \non by October 15. If the constitution is approved, a permanent \ngovernment can be elected by December 15 and take office by December \n31, the end of this year. But it is a very difficult process. If you \nlook at the headlines today, Sunni members of the parliamentary \ncommission are at least temporarily boycotting it because of fears for \ntheir safety. There are suggestions that some provisions of the \nconstitution would be difficult for us to support--they are heavily \nallied with Islamic law, or they don't provide for a robust secular \nsector in Iraq.\n  For all these reasons, we still have a long way to go in the \npolitical process and the economic process that will provide us the \nfinal means to leave the country, to take out significant military \nforces.\n  There is one other aspect of the political process and of the \neconomic process, and that is the role not of our military forces but \nof our State Department personnel. One of the things that struck me \nwhen I was in Iraq last Easter was the comment by soldiers in the field \nthat they needed more State Department support, not in Baghdad but in \nthe field--Fallujah, Mosul, and those towns--to carry out the \nreconstruction, provide political advice, and be the confidants and \nadvisers of Iraqi civilian officials. The sad story is that we don't \nhave enough State Department personnel outside of Baghdad to do these \njobs.\n  In Baghdad, the State Department authorized 899 positions but has \nonly filled 665. The State Department has then authorized 169 for the \nrest of the country--in fact, I suggested that the level should be \nhigher--but only 105 of those have been filled. Iraq is short about 298 \nneeded State Department personnel. These are the people who are doing \nwhat is so critical at this juncture--providing political mentoring, \nproviding technical assistance, providing those resources that \ncomplement military operations. Without them, military operations would \nnot ultimately be successful.\n  There are several reasons for this situation with the State \nDepartment. First, the tour for State Department personnel in Iraq is \nnot 3 years, but 6 months or a year, so State is running through people \nat a very rapid rate.\n  There is a general shortage of mid-level officers for the State \nDepartment worldwide, and those are the officers who would be placed \noutside Baghdad. They have the experience and expertise to operate \nindependently. The problem is opening up too many new posts. We have \nsituations in which new nations evolved. They have to be supported by \nState Department personnel.\n  Secretary Powell did a great job in engaging new personnel to come to \nthe State Department, but these are entry level personnel, and the \nmidlevel, key midlevel personnel are inadequate in terms of numbers, \nnot in terms of skills or talents--certainly not that--but in terms of \nnumbers.\n  There is another obvious reason. It is very dangerous to be outside \nthe green zone in Iraq. All of these State Department personnel need to \nbe protected, and that is slowing down their ability to deploy into the \nfield.\n  I understand also there are incentives being considered by the State \nDepartment to get more people there. However, unless we have a robust \ncomplement of AID officials, State Department experts to help support \nour military efforts, we will not be able to obtain a satisfactory \nresolution in Iraq. I hope we can do more to do that.\n  This is a very perilous time in Iraq. Just this week, a Shi'a leader \nstated that Iraq was slipping into civil war. If it does, then we will \nhave a terrible burden with our forces deployed in the midst of a civil \nwar. Some others have said there has been an incipient civil war for \nmonths now and one of a more major characteristic ready to break out. \nWe do need to respond to these issues.\n  There is another policy impact with respect to Iraq, and that is the \nimpact on its other worldwide missions, like our ability to maintain \nour successes in Afghanistan and keep open all options with regards to \nNorth Korea and Iran.\n  The war in Iraq also has tremendous impact on our economy. We are a \ngreat power, and that is a function of several components. One is \nmilitary power, but also economic power. If we are not able to support \nand afford these efforts over the 5 years, 10 years, or more this \nglobal war on terror is going to take place--and all observers see this \nas a generational struggle, not an episodic one--then we are not going \nto have the economic staying power.\n  Frankly, our economy is performing in a fitful fashion. We have a \nhuge fiscal deficit that is draining our ability to fund needed \nprograms--not just military programs but domestic programs also. We \nhave a huge current accounts deficit which, again, will come home one \nday when those foreigners who are lending us money will ask for the \nmoney back with interest. These economic forces will, I think, not \nsupport indefinitely the kind of expenditures we need to protect \nourselves.\n  So along with reforming and strengthening our military, we have to \nreform and strengthen our fiscal policies in the United States. We \ncannot continue to spend in supplementals billions of dollars a year. \nWe have to recognize that and we have to take steps, and we have to \nultimately pay for this war.\n  It seems to me in this context illogical, if not absurd, to advancing \nhuge additional tax cuts at a time when we are struggling to conduct a \nwar. If that had been our attitude in World War II, we never would have \nsucceeded. We would have been bankrupt before 1945. At that time, we \nresponded, as we have in every major conflict. We asked all Americans \nto share the sacrifice, not just those in uniform, but those on the \nhomefront, those who can help pay for the war, as well as those who are \nfighting the war.\n  Yet today we are advancing two, in my mind, almost contradictory \nproposals. We are going to stay the course in Iraq, we are going to \ntake a generation, if necessary, to defeat global terror, we are going \nto do it not only with military resources, but we are going to have to \nmobilize resources of the world to change the social and political \ndynamics of countries across the globe, particularly Islamic \ncountries--all that very expensive--but, of course, we are going to cut \ntaxes dramatically. We have to decide in a very significant way whether \nwe can afford this dramatic contradiction. I don't think we can.\n  We have a great deal to do in the next few days with respect to this \nlegislation. I think it is important to get on with it. I hope not only \ndo we stay the course in Iraq, but we stay the course on this \nlegislation. The majority leader has suggested he is prepared to leave \nthis bill in midcourse to turn to legislation with respect to gun \nliability immunity. That would, in my\n\n[[Page S8624]]\n\nview, be moving from the national interest to one very special self-\ninterest, the self-interest of the gun lobby.\n  We have soldiers in the field. We have sailors, marines, air men and \nwomen who are risking their lives. I think they would like us to finish \nour job before moving on to something else. I hope we don't move off \nthis bill. Stay the course on this legislation. We will have \namendments, debate them, hopefully we will adopt those to improve the \nbill, and then we will send, I hope, to conference a good piece of \nlegislation of which we can be proud and, more importantly, that can \nassist our soldiers, sailors, marines, and air men and women in the \nfield.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his comments. \nSenator Reed is an esteemed member of the committee.\n  I assure the Senator, I have been in consultation with our leadership \nand presumably the Senator's leadership about this bill. We brought it \nup with the understanding that there may be matters that require the \nattention of the Senate, at which time we do not do anything but put it \naside for a brief period of time and then bring it up again. This is my \n27th time I have had the privilege of being engaged in one level or \nanother the managing of the Defense bill. I can recall one time it took \nus 4\\1/2\\ weeks to get it through. But it was a leadership decision and \nthe managers of our bill recognize from time to time we have to accede.\n  I am not here to try and prejudge what legislation may or may not be \nbrought up, but I assure the Senator, I am in total support of the \nleader making those decisions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, if I may respond, I appreciate not only the \nleadership of the chairman, but also his incredible commitment to our \nmilitary forces. My point is very simple. I think we should finish this \nbill. We have waited weeks to go on it. But I also point out that if \nother matters come before the Senate, as Senators we have the full \nright to use all of the procedures, we have the right to debate. I \nwould hate to be in a situation--and I hope that is not the case--where \nif we attempt, let's say, next week to engage in extensive and \nproductive debate about a particular issue, we are not reminded that we \nare holding up the Defense authorization bill; that no one will suggest \nour ability to debate an issue which, frankly, is on the agenda not \nthrough our desires but others', would somehow be interpreted as \nslowing down our ability to respond to the needs of our soldiers, \nsailors, marines, air men and women.\n  I am on record saying I would like to see us finishing this bill \nwithout interruption, but if there is an interruption, then this Senate \nand our colleagues have to have the right to fully debate any measure \nthat comes before the floor, and I don't think we should be--and maybe \nI am anticipating something that will not evolve--be put in the \nposition of being hurried off the floor because the Defense bill has to \ncome back.\n  We have the bill before us now. I think we should stick to the bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. If the Senator \nparticipated in many of these bills before--for example, tonight, I am \nnot being entirely popular with a number of individuals because I am \nrequesting of the leadership the right to go on into the night with \nvotes, as late as we can possibly go, and then tomorrow morning have \nmore votes and continue tomorrow. After the votes, presumably, if they \nare scheduled in the morning, it may well be we will continue on the \nbill with some understanding among Members that the votes we desire, as \na consequence of the other work on Friday, will be held on Monday some \ntime.\n  I assure the Senator from Rhode Island, I am working as hard as I can \nto get this bill passed. I thank the Senator for his cooperation.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Unanimous-Consent Request\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in concurrence with my distinguished \nranking member, I advise the Senate that we will have a vote on \namendment No. 1342, regarding supporting the Boy Scouts, occurring at \n2:30, with no second-degree amendments in order prior to the vote; \nprovided further, there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided before \nthe vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nunderstand that is a delay being requested from 2:15 to 2:30, so that \neverybody can understand.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, is the Senator from \nVirginia prepared to discuss the Frist amendment? I am reading it for \nthe first time. There is a section I would like to ask him about.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am prepared to discuss it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, I call the attention of \nthe Senator to page 3. If the underlying purpose of this amendment is \nto allow the Boy Scouts of America, or similar organizations, to have \ntheir annual jamboree--which I understand they use military facilities \nand continue to do so, and I have no objection to that. Could I ask the \nchairman of this committee to please read with me on page 3, starting \nwith line 16, the paragraph that follows, and ask him if he would \nexplain this to me. As I read it, it says:\n\n       No Federal law shall be construed to limit any Federal \n     agency from providing any form of support for a youth \n     organization that would result in that agency providing less \n     support to that youth organization than was provided during \n     the preceding fiscal year.\n\n  As I read that, the Appropriations Committee could not appropriate \nless money for a youth organization next year than they did this year \nif we pass this permanent law. Is that how the Senator from Virginia \nreads it?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for raising this \nquestion. The distinguished Senator from Michigan discussed it with me \nearlier. You have read it and you have interpreted it correctly. It is \nto sustain the level of funding and activities that have been \nhistorically provided by the several agencies and departments of the \nGovernment heretofore.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I further ask--I have no objection to the Boy Scouts \ngathering at a jamboree or using the facilities. I have no objection to \nthe appropriation of money for that purpose. But are we truly saying \nthat you could never, ever reduce the amount of money that was given to \nthem?\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my good friend, that is the way the bill reads, \nand there 60-some cosponsors who, presumably, have addressed that. I \nbrought it to the attention of the staff of the leader a short time ago \nand indicated this, asking do I have a clear understanding, and the \nSenator has recited the understanding that I have.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Illinois yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I read this the same as the Senator from Illinois. It is \nnot just that there be no possibility ever of any agency reducing any \nfunding that goes to the Boy Scouts, which is the purported purpose of \nthis, but it is any youth organization because it says any form of \nsupport for a youth organization. That means any youth organization, \nincluding the Boy Scouts. As I read this, it would make it impossible \nfor any youth organization, no matter how bad it was managing its \nbooks, no matter what there might be in terms of fraud and abuse--we \nare talking about every single youth organization that gets funding \nfrom the Federal Government, no matter what the reduction in the number \nof members of that youth organization is, you could not reduce, \napparently, a grant from a Federal agency to any youth organization. I \nthink that goes way beyond the stated purpose of this amendment, which \nis to protect the Boy Scouts, which I agree with and understand and \nsupport.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may say to my colleagues, in no way \ndoes this bind the Appropriations Committee to exercise such discretion \nas it may so desire in that level of funding. If it was brought to \ntheir attention that there was malfeasance or inappropriate \nexpenditures at some point in\n\n[[Page S8625]]\n\nany program, they are perfectly within their authority to limit or \neliminate the funding altogether.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My reference was to any Federal agency, which means any \ngrant agency, not just Appropriations, which the Senator from Illinois \nreferred to, but any Federal agency, which means any agency that makes \nany grant to any youth organization cannot reduce that grant, no matter \nwhat the reason is, next year. That is the way I read this. It is so \noverly broad, it ought to be modified or stricken or something.\n  I think all of us want to support the Boy Scouts and their jamboree, \nusing the facilities or the support of the Secretary of Defense and the \narmed services, as they have done before, but this is way broader than \nthat.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this issue was raised and the legal \ncounsel drew this up. I must say, you raise a point, but I am sure if \nthere are any improprieties associated with these programs, the \nappropriators have full authority to curtail or eliminate the funding.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I may say, I know the Senator has a pending unanimous-\nconsent request. I would like to amend that request to allow language \nto be added to amend this particular section stating that if you have a \nyouth organization that is guilty of wasting or stealing Federal funds, \nthat youth organization is not automatically going to receive the same \namount of funds in the next year. That is malfeasance at its worst and \na waste of taxpayer dollars. I am sure the Senator from Virginia and \nthe Senator from Michigan and I don't want to be party to that.\n  If I may reserve the right to offer a second-degree amendment to that \nsection, I would be happy to allow the unanimous-consent agreement.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, what I suggest in the parliamentary \nsituation is that I withdraw the unanimous-consent request at this \ntime. In the interval, until we raise the question to vote again, the \nSenator presumably will engage with the leader's office regarding these \nconcerns. So I withdraw the request at this time rather than amend it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the amendment--we call it generically the \nBoy Scout amendment--offered by the distinguished majority leader is \nbeing looked at in the full expectation that it can be resolved and \nvoted on at an appropriate time this afternoon. For the moment, I \nbelieve the distinguished Senator from South Carolina and the Senator \nfrom New York have an amendment, and I think we should proceed with \nthat debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if we could reach a time agreement \non this amendment to give everybody an idea as to time. We are hoping \nit will be accepted. It is a terrific amendment. I am wondering if the \nchairman might consider a time limit.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. I thank my colleague. In view of the fact that there \nis a strong indication by myself and my distinguished ranking member \nthat it be accepted, can we reach a time agreement?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Is 20 minutes OK?\n  Mr. WARNER. Equally divided between yourself and the Senator from New \nYork? Then I think 10 minutes for Senator Levin--let us assume that we \ncan do it in 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Let us make it 30 minutes so that we can get everybody \nin, equally divided. I believe Senator Leahy wants to speak on it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is Senator Leahy a supporter or opponent of the amendment?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Supporter.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I do not know of any opposition.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That would be great.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that the time agreement for the \namendment offered by the Senator from South Carolina and the Senator \nfrom New York be 45 minutes, 30 minutes to the proponents, and 15 \nminutes reserved to the managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1363\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Graham], for himself, \n     Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \n     Kerry, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Reid, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Dayton, Mr. \n     Allen, Ms. Cantwell, and Ms. Murkowski proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1363.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To expand the eligibility of members of the Selected Reserve \n                       under the TRICARE program)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title VII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 705. EXPANDED ELIGIBILITY OF MEMBERS OF THE SELECTED \n                   RESERVE UNDER THE TRICARE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) General Eligibility.--Subsection (a) of section 1076d \n     of title 10, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``(a) Eligibility.--A member'' and \n     inserting ``(a) Eligibility.--(1) Except as provided in \n     paragraph (2), a member'';\n       (2) by striking ``after the member completes'' and all that \n     follows through ``one or more whole years following such \n     date''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply to a member who is \n     enrolled, or is eligible to enroll, in a health benefits plan \n     under chapter 89 of title 5.''.\n       (b) Condition for Termination of Eligibility.--Subsection \n     (b) of such section is amended by striking ``(b) Period of \n     Coverage.--(1) TRICARE Standard'' and all that follows \n     through ``(3) Eligibility'' and inserting ``(b) Termination \n     of Eligibility Upon Termination of Service.--Eligibility''.\n       (c) Conforming Amendments.--\n       (1) Such section is further amended--\n       (A) by striking subsection (e); and\n       (B) by redesignating subsection (g) as subsection (e) and \n     transferring such subsection within such section so as to \n     appear following subsection (d).\n       (2) The heading for such section is amended to read as \n     follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 1076d. TRICARE program: TRICARE Standard coverage for \n       members of the Selected Reserve''.\n\n       (d) Repeal of Obsolete Provision.--Section 1076b of title \n     10, United States Code, is repealed.\n       (e) Clerical Amendments.--The table of sections at the \n     beginning of chapter 55 of title 10, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking the item relating to section 1076b; and\n       (2) by striking the item relating to section 1076d and \n     inserting the following:\n\n``1076d. TRICARE program: TRICARE Standard coverage for members of the \n              Selected Reserve.''.\n\n       (f) Savings Provision.--Enrollments in TRICARE Standard \n     that are in effect on the day before the date of the \n     enactment of this Act under section 1076d of title 10, United \n     States Code, as in effect on such day, shall be continued \n     until terminated after such day under such section 1076d as \n     amended by this section.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will try to keep this very short. This \namendment is not new to the body. This is something that I have been \nworking on with Senator Clinton and other Members for a very long time. \nIt deals with providing the Guard and Reserves eligibility for military \nhealth care.\n  As a setting or a background, of all the people who work for the \nFederal Government, surely our Guard and Reserves are in that category. \nNot only do they work for the Federal Government, sometimes on a very \nfull-time basis, they are getting shot at on behalf of the Federal \nGovernment and all of us who enjoy our freedom. Temporary and part-time \nemployees who work in our Senate offices are eligible for Federal \nhealth care. They have to pay a premium, but they are eligible. Of all \nthe people who deal with the Federal Government and come to the Federal \nGovernment when they are needed, the Guard and Reserve, they are \nineligible for any form of Federal Government health care. Twenty-five \npercent of the Guard and Reserve are uninsured in the private sector. \nAbout one in five who have been called to active duty from the Guard \nand Reserve have health care problems that prevent them from going to \nthe fight immediately.\n  So this amendment will allow them to enroll in TRICARE, the military \nhealth care network for Active-Duty\n\n[[Page S8626]]\n\npeople and retirees. Under our legislation, the Guard and Reserve can \nsign up to be a member of TRICARE and have health care available for \nthem and their families. They have to pay a premium. This is not free. \nThis is modeled after what Federal employees have to do working in a \ntraditional role with the Federal Government. So they have to pay for \nit, but it is a deal for family members of the Guard and Reserves that \nI think helps us in three areas: retention, recruiting, and readiness.\n  Under the bill that we are about to pass, every Guard and Reserve \nmember will be eligible for an annual physical to make sure they are \nhealthy and they are maintaining their physical status so they can go \nto the fight.\n  What happens if someone has a physical and they have no health care? \nTo me, it is absurd that we would allow this important part of our \nmilitary force's health care needs to go unaddressed, and it showed up \nin the war. We have had problems getting people into the fight because \nof health care problems. If we want to recruit and retain, the best \nthing we can do as a nation is to tell Guard and Reserve members and \ntheir families, if they will stay in, we are going to provide a benefit \nto them and their families that they do not have today that will make \nlife better.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a USA Today article entitled ``Army \nFinds Troop Morale Problems in Iraq,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          [From the USA Today]\n\n                Army Finds Troop Morale Problems in Iraq\n\n                           (By Paul Leavitt)\n\n       A majority of U.S. soldiers in Iraq say morale is low, \n     according to an Army report that finds psychological stress \n     is weighing particularly heavily on National Guard and \n     Reserve troops.\n       The report said 54% of soldiers rated their units' morale \n     as low or very low. The comparable figure in an Army survey \n     in the fall of 2003 was 72%.\n       Soldiers' mental health improved from the early months of \n     the insurgency, and the number of suicides in Iraq and Kuwait \n     declined from 24 in 2003 to nine last year, the report said. \n     The assessment is from a team of mental health specialists \n     the Army sent to Iraq and Kuwait last summer.\n       The report said 13% of soldiers in the most recent study \n     screened positive for a mental health problem, compared with \n     18% a year earlier. Symptoms of acute or post-traumatic \n     stress remained the top mental health problem, affecting at \n     least 10% of all soldiers checked in the latest survey.\n       In the anonymous survey, 17% of soldiers said they had \n     experienced moderate or severe stress or problems with \n     alcohol, emotions or their families. That compares with 23% a \n     year earlier.\n       National Guard and Reserve soldiers who serve in \n     transportation and support units suffered more than others \n     from depression, anxiety and other indications of acute \n     psychological stress, the report said. These soldiers have \n     often been targets of the insurgents' lethal ambushes and \n     roadside bombs.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. This is a survey. It states: A majority of U.S. soldiers \nin Iraq say morale is low, according to an Army report that finds \npsychological stress is weighing particularly heavily on National Guard \nand Reserve troops.\n  The last paragraph states: National Guard and Reserve soldiers who \nserve in transportation support units suffered more than others from \ndepression, anxiety, and other indications of acute psychological \nstress, the report stated. These soldiers have often been targets of \nthe insurgents' lethal ambushes and roadside bombs.\n  Last month and the month before last were the most deadly for the \nGuard and Reserve since the war started. The role of the Guard is up, \nnot down. It is more lethal than it used to be, and families are being \nstressed.\n  What we did last year, thanks to Chairman Warner, was a good start. \nWe provided relief for Guard and Reserve members who had been called to \nactive duty since September 11, and their families. If you were called \nto active duty for 90 days since September 11 to now, you were eligible \nfor TRICARE for 1 year. If you served in Iraq for a year, you would get \n4 years of TRICARE. The problem is, some people are going to the fight \nvoluntarily and don't meet that criteria. Two-thirds of the air crews \nin the Guard and Reserve have already served 2 years in some capacity \ninvoluntarily. They keep going to the fight voluntarily and their \nservice doesn't count toward TRICARE eligibility.\n  The bottom line is we have improved the amendment. We need to reform \nit even more. We have reduced the amount of reservists eligible to join \nthis program to the selected Reserves. Since I am in the indefinite \nReserve status as a reservist, I am not eligible for this, nor should I \nbe. But if you are a selected Reserve under our amendment, you are \neligible for TRICARE. We have reduced the number of reservists \neligible. We have reduced the amount of premiums the Reserve and Guard \nmember would have to pay. We have reduced it from $7.1 billion to $3.8 \nbillion over 5 years. We have made it more fiscally sound.\n  But the bottom line is for me, you cannot help these families enough, \nand $3.8 billion over 5 years is the least we can do. What does it cost \nto have the Guard and Reserve not ready and not fit to go to the fight? \nWhat does it cost to have about 20 percent of your force unable to go \nto the fight because of health care problems? This is the best use of \nthe money we could possibly spend. There is all kinds of waste in the \nPentagon that would more than pay for this, and our recruiting numbers \nfor the Guard and Reserve are not going to be met this year because the \nGuard and Reserve is not a part-time job any longer. It is a real quick \nticket to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The people who are in the Guard and Reserves are helping us win this \nwar just as much as their Active-Duty counterparts, who are doing a \ntremendous job. Their families don't have to worry about health care \nproblems; guardsmen and reservists do.\n  I have statements from the National Governors Association, the \nNational Guard Association of the United States, the Military Officers \nAssociation of America, the Fleet Reserve Association, the Reserve \nEnlisted Association, and the Air Force Sergeants Association that I \nwould like to submit for the Record, saying directly to the Congress:\n  This is a good benefit. If you will enact it, it would improve the \nquality of life for our Guard and Reserve members and their families. \nIt will help recruiting and retention, and it is needed.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have those letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 17, 2005.\n     Hon. Lindsey O. Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham and Senator Clinton: The nation's \n     Governors join with you in your bipartisan legislative \n     efforts to improve healthcare benefits for members of the \n     National Guard and Reserves by allowing them to enroll in \n     TRICARE, the military healthcare system. We believe ``The \n     Guard and Reserve Readiness and Retention Act of 2005,'' will \n     improve readiness and enhance recruitment and retention.\n       The men and women in our National Guard and Reserves are \n     playing an increasingly integral role in military operations \n     domestically and around the world. Their overall activity \n     level has increased from relatively modest annual duty days \n     in the 1970s to the current integration, making up \n     approximately 40 percent of the current troop force in Iraq. \n     Surely these patriotic men and women deserve support for \n     complete health benefits for themselves and their families.\n       As our nation makes more demands on the National Guard and \n     Reserve, we must make every effort to keep their health \n     benefits commensurate with their service. We encourage your \n     colleagues to support this legislation, which will allow our \n     National Guard and Reservist members and their families the \n     opportunity to participate in the TRICARE program.\n       As Commanders-in-Chief of our nation's National Guard \n     forces, we look forward to working closely with you and other \n     Members of Congress to ensure that this legislation passes \n     during the first session of the 109th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n     Governor Dirk Kempthorne,\n       Idaho, Lead Governor on the National Guard.\n     Governor Michael F. Easley,\n       North Carolina, Lead Governor on the National Guard.\n\n[[Page S8627]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                        National Guard Association\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 2005.\n     Hon. Lindsey Graham,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: I write today to express this \n     association's strong support for expanded TRICARE coverage \n     for Guardsmen and Reservists as included in the Graham/\n     Clinton amendment to the FY06 defense authorization bill. The \n     National Guard Association of the United States appreciates \n     the long-standing support from both sides of the Senate aisle \n     for equity in Guard and Reserve health care coverage and \n     believe your amendment reflects our collective commitment to \n     that coverage.\n       Whether a member of the Guard is attending monthly drill or \n     in combat in Iraq, that man or woman should have access to \n     this coverage. As the war on te1Tor continues, the line \n     between Guard member and active duty member has become \n     indistinguishable. The Secretary of Defense, has said \n     repeatedly, ``the War on Terror could not be fought without \n     the National Guard''. Battles would not be won, peace would \n     not be kept and sorties would not be flown without these \n     soldiers and airmen.\n       Over the past two years, the Senate has included a \n     provision in the defense authorization bill allowing a member \n     of the National Guard or Reserve, regardless of status, to \n     participate in the TRICARE medical program on a contributory \n     basis. This year, the United States Senate has another \n     opportunity to give TRICARE access to any member of the \n     National Guard who wishes to use TRICARE as their primary \n     health care provider, even when not in a mobilized status.\n       The National Guard Association of the United States urges \n     the United States Senate to adopt the Graham/Clinton \n     amendment and allow all members of the National Guard and \n     their families access to TRICARE coverage on a cost-share \n     basis, regardless of duty status.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Stephen M. Koper,\n\n                                  Brigadier General, USAF, (Ret.),\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Military Officers\n\n\n                                       Association of America,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 15, 2005.\n     Hon. Lindsey Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the nearly 370,000 \n     members of the Military Officers Association of America \n     (MOAA), I am writing to express our deepest gratitude for \n     your leadership in securing needed legislation for America's \n     servicemembers. Your planned amendment to S 1082 that would \n     authorize permanent, fee-based TRICARE eligibility for all \n     members of the Selected Reserve is one of MOAA's top \n     legislative priorities for 2005.\n       Extending permanent cost-share access to TRICARE for all \n     Selected Reserve members will help demonstrate Congress's and \n     the nation's commitment to ensuring fair treatment for the \n     citizen soldiers and their families who are sacrificing so \n     much to protect America.\n       A few weeks ago, during a Fox News Channel interview, I was \n     asked what might be done to address Guard and Reserve health \n     care access problems being reported in the media. I said the \n     most important action right now is your legislative fix to \n     offer these families permanent and continuous health care \n     coverage, and that all Americans should ask their legislators \n     to support your effort.\n       In the meantime, MOAA has sent letters to all members of \n     the Senate requesting their vote in favor of your amendment.\n       MOAA is extremely grateful for all of your support on this \n     and other issues, and we pledge to work with you to do all we \n     can to secure your amendment's inclusion in the FY2006 \n     Defense Authorization Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Norbert R. Ryan,\n      President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Fleet Reserve Association,\n\n                                     Alexandria, VA, May 31, 2005.\n     Hon. Lindsey O. Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: The Fleet Reserve Association (FRA) is \n     pleased to offer its support for your amendment to S. 1082 \n     that would authorize permanent, fee-based Tricare eligibility \n     for all members of the Selected Reserve. This will be a major \n     improvement to the temporary eligibility authorized by the \n     U.S. Congress last year.\n       FRA believes strongly that your amendment is the right way \n     to go. The Nation can ill afford to mobilize its reserve \n     forces in the war against terrorism, place them in an \n     indefinite period of active service then, offer them a health \n     care plan that does not encourage participation.\n       Recruiting and the retention of members of the Reserve \n     forces is becoming an increased challenge. The availability \n     of enrolling in a permanent health care plan that embraces \n     the family with comfort and assured assistance, not only \n     provides the reservist with ease of mind particu lady if he \n     or she is immediately ordered to or serving in a hazardous \n     duty zone.\n       FRA is assured that extending permanent cost-share to \n     Tricare for all selected Reserve members will help \n     demonstrate Congress's and the nation's commitment to \n     protecting the interests of our citizen soldiers, airmen, \n     sailors, Coast Guardsmen, and Marines who are sacrificing so \n     much to protect the United States and it citizens.\n       FRA encourages your colleagues to support your amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Joseph L. Barnes,\n     National Executive Secretary.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Reserve Enlisted Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 2005.\n     Senator Lindsey Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham, I am writing on behalf of the Reserve \n     Enlisted Association supporting all Reserve enlisted members. \n     We are advocates for the enlisted men and women of the United \n     States Military Reserve Components in support of National \n     Security and Homeland Defense, with emphasis on the \n     readiness, training, and quality of life issues affecting \n     their welfare and that of their families and survivors.\n       REA supports the Graham/Clinton amendment to provide \n     TRICARE for all participating Reserve Component members. This \n     amendment ensures continuity of healthcare for the Reserve \n     Component member and their family. Currently it is difficult \n     to assess the health and mobilization readiness of Guard and \n     Reserve members because their medical records are scattered \n     between their civilian providers, their unit of attachment, \n     their mobilization unit, and their temporary duty location. \n     This same continuity of care would be extended to our \n     families which we anticipate will affect recruiting and \n     retention efforts.\n       We are dedicated to making our nation stronger and our \n     military more prepared and look forward to working together \n     towards these goals. Your continued support of the Reserve \n     Components is appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Lani Burnett,\n\n                               Chief Master Sergeant (Ret), USAFR,\n     REA Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Air Force Sergeants Association,\n\n                              Temple Hills, MD, February 26, 2005.\n     Hon. Lindsey Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham, on behalf of the 132,000 members of \n     the Air Force Sergeants Association, thank you for \n     introducing S. 337, the ``Guard and Reserve Readiness and \n     Retention Act of 2005.'' This bill would provide a realistic \n     formula allowing members of the National Guard and Reserve to \n     receive retirement pay based upon years of service. \n     Importantly, it would allow members that qualify to receive \n     retirement benefits prior to age 60. As you know, the Guard \n     and Reserve are the only federal entities that do not receive \n     retirement pay at the time their service is complete. This \n     bill would help correct this injustice encountered by many of \n     our members.\n       We also applaud the provision to improve the healthcare \n     benefits for the members in the Guard and Reserve by allowing \n     them the option of enrolling in TRICARE on a monthly premium \n     basis, regardless of their activation status. These two \n     initiatives would go far to improve the morale, readiness, \n     and retention of our valuable reserve forces.\n       Senator Graham, we appreciate your leadership and \n     dedication to America's servicemembers and their families. We \n     support you on this legislation and look forward to working \n     with you during the 109th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Richard M. Dean,\n                                                Excutive Director.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We are building on what we did last year. This fight is \ngoing to go on for a long time in Iraq and Afghanistan. We can't leave \ntoo soon. The idea of having a smaller involvement by Guard and \nReserves is an intriguing idea, but it is not going to happen anytime \nsoon either. This benefit will help immeasurably the quality of life of \nguardsmen and reservists, take stress off of them and their families, \nand it is the least we can do as a nation who are being defended by \npart-time soldiers who are really full in every capacity and die in \nevery bit the same numbers, if not greater, than their Active-Duty \ncounterparts.\n  I will yield the floor to Senator Clinton, who has been with us every \nstep of the way. We have made a great deal of progress. We are not \ngoing to stop until this provision becomes law.\n  To my friends in the House, the House Armed Services Committee passed \nthis provision with six Republicans joining with the Democratic side of \nthe aisle to get it out of the committee and, through some maneuvering \non the floor, this provision helping the Guard and Reserve families was \ntaken out of the bill. There has been one vote after another in the \nHouse where over 350 people have supported the concept.\n  To my friends in the House, I appreciate all you have done to help \nthe troops, but we are going to fight over this issue. This is not \ngoing away. We are not quitting until we get it right for the Guard and \nReserves.\n\n[[Page S8628]]\n\n  I yield the floor to Senator Clinton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I join my colleague from South Carolina. \nHe has been a tireless advocate for this legislation, and his passion \nabout the need to take care of our Guard and Reserve members is \nunmatched. It has been an honor for me to work with him on this \nimportant legislation.\n  Over 2 years ago, Senator Graham and I went over to the Reserve \nOfficers Association building to announce the first version of this \nlegislation. As he has just pointed out, we made some progress on \nexpanding access to TRICARE in the last Congress, but not nearly \nenough. So our work is not done and we come, once again, to the floor \nof the Senate urging our colleagues, on a bipartisan basis, to support \ngiving this important benefit to Guard and Reserve members and their \nfamilies.\n  Our amendment allows Guard and Reserve members the option of \nenrolling full time in TRICARE. They do not have to take this option. \nIt is voluntary. But TRICARE is the family health insurance coverage \noffered to Active-Duty military personnel. The change would offer \nhealth care stability to families who lose coverage under employers' \nplans when a family member is called to active duty, or to families--\nand we have so many of them in the Guard and Reserve--who do not have \nhealth insurance to begin with.\n  So, really, this amendment offers basic fairness to Guard and Reserve \nmembers and their families. We have seen firsthand, those of us who \nhave been to Iraq and Afghanistan--as I have been with my colleague, \nthe Senator from South Carolina--the heroism and incredible dedication \nthat Guard and Reserve members have when they are called up to serve \nour country. They are serving with honor and distinction, and we need \nto reward and recognize that.\n  Senator Graham and I first started talking about this more than 2 \nyears ago because in our respective States, we heard the same stories. \nI heard throughout New York about the hardship being imposed on Guard \nand Reserve members and their families, not because they didn't want to \nserve their country--indeed, they were eager to go and do whatever they \ncould to protect and defend our interests--but because they didn't have \nhealth insurance. Twenty-five percent of our Guard and Reserve members \ndo not, and when they showed up after being activated, 20 percent of \nthem were found not ready to be deployed.\n  We are talking about the three R's: recruitment, retention, and \nreadiness. Since September 11, our Reserve and National Guard members \nhave been called to duty with increasing frequency. In New York, we \nhave about 35,000 members of the Guard and Reserves. I have seen, in so \nmany different settings, their eagerness to do their job. But I have \nalso heard from them and their family members about the hardship of not \nhaving access to health care. I think the broad support that we have \nengendered for this amendment, from the National Guard Association, the \nReserve Officers Association, the Military Officers Association, really \nspeaks for itself.\n  It is important to note that this amendment is responding to a real \nneed. This is not a theoretical exercise. We know that lacking health \ninsurance has been a tremendous burden for Guard and Reserve members \nand their families, and we in our armed services have paid a price \nbecause of that lack of insurance in the readiness we should expect \nfrom our members.\n  Mr. President, I am honored to join my colleague in this long fight \nthat we have waged. I hope we will be able to make significant progress \nand have this amendment accepted and send a loud and clear message to \nGuard and Reserve members and their families that we indeed not only \nappreciate and honor their work, we are going to do something very \ntangible to make it easier for them and their families to bear these \nburdens.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would like to acknowledge what Senator Clinton has done \non behalf of this amendment. Without her, I don't think we would be as \nfar as we are. She has been terrific. To Senator Warner, you and your \nstaff have been terrific to do what we did last year.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has 7 minutes \nleft.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 15 minutes \nmore because, what I would like to do is give Senator Coleman 4 \nminutes, Senator Leahy wants 4 minutes, and Senator Allen wants 4 \nminutes. I am not good at math--whatever we need to get that done.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, clarification: Did 7 go to 15? Which is \nfine. You have 15 minutes, now, total, under your control.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for all our assistance. I now \nrecognize Senator Coleman and yield him 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to speak in \nsupport of the amendment offered by my good friend, Senator Graham, who \nhas been relentless in his determination to secure a fair deal for our \nNation's reservists.\n  Our Nation's citizen soldiers are an integral part of the military. \nThey have been called upon to make big sacrifices, sacrifices many \ndidn't imagine when they signed up. Yet time and time again, they have \nanswered the call. Today, the National Guard and Reserve are on the \nfront line of the war on terror. They are on the front line in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. I say proudly that Minnesota's Army National Guard leads \nthe Nation in recruiting and retention. We want to continue with that \nhigh honor. It is something in which we take great pride.\n  But I can tell you that, in my conversations with Guard and Reserve \nmembers around my State, the strains of mobilization are beginning to \nhave an effect. With the demands now being placed on the Guard and \nReserve, we are going to have to step up our support in order to \nsustain the manpower we need for the future.\n  What I hear from reservists in my State consistently is that given \nthe rising cost of health care, the option of enrolling in TRICARE is \nperhaps the most important thing we can do to help them and their \nfamilies.\n  Thanks to the tireless efforts of my good friend, Senator Graham, we \nhave made good progress in opening up access to TRICARE. But this \noption ought to be available to all reservists. Every member of the \nGuard and Reserve has signed up for the same risks, and they all made \nthe same commitment to defend our country.\n  This amendment is fundamentally about two things: The first is \nfairness--fairness for people facing the same dangers as their Active-\nDuty counterparts. In today's world, any new reservist can almost count \non being called to be there fighting in the war in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. So in a sense, it is not that much different from signing \nup for active duty to begin with. If reservists know they are going to \nbe putting themselves on the front lines just like an Active-Duty \nsoldier, we should be giving them the same benefits.\n  The second is national security. Our country needs a robust National \nGuard and Reserve. We need them to be relevant, which means part of \nmilitary engagements overseas. In order to keep this invaluable cadre \nof citizen soldiers, the least we can do is offer them the same health \ncare as we offer Active-Duty troops.\n  The poet, John Milton, said: ``They also serve, who only stand and \nwait.'' There is not a lot of standing around for today's reservists, \nbut their value to the Nation is incredible.\n  The key to every endeavor, whether it is military, economic, or \npersonal, is using your resources wisely. The fact that the military \nplanners of the United States have a reserve force of such quality, \nspirit, and readiness is our crucial advantage. As such, they deserve \nevery honor and support we give our active military. By protecting this \nvital asset, we accelerate the march of freedom around the world.\n  I am pleased to support my colleague, Senator Graham, once again, and \nI urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield 4 minutes to Senator Leahy, who has been chairman\n\n[[Page S8629]]\n\nof the Guard caucus, and who has championed this legislation. I am \nhonored to have him as a partner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \nkind words. I do rise in support of the Graham-Clinton-DeWine-Leahy \namendment.\n  We have said it makes all members of the National Guard and Reserve \neligible to participate in the military's TRICARE program on a cost-\nshare basis. Basically, we are saying if the Guard and Reserve is out \nthere doing the work of the regular Army--and they are, as we all know, \nincreasingly, all the time--then they should have some of the same \nbenefits, especially medical benefits.\n  Our amendment goes to the readiness of our Reserve Forces. It is \ncertainly an important recruiting tool.\n  Few issues we are going to debate during consideration of this bill--\nwhen we talked about readiness--could be as important as this issue. \nThe National Guard is making a spectacular contribution to the Nation's \ndefense. Everybody would acknowledge that it would be impossible to \nfight the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan without the National Guard. Our \nmilitary reserves are carrying out all kinds of tasks, from combat \nsupport to aerial convoy escort missions. When I talk with the \ncommanders in the field they tell me they don't know which ones are the \nGuard, which ones are the regular forces. They are all doing the same \nthing.\n  One difference is the National Guard has to also continue to provide \na ready force in case of natural disasters or another attack here at \nhome. In the war on terrorism, the National Guard and Reserve are a \n21st century fighting force. But they are doing it with the last \ncentury's health insurance. We want to bring it up to date. We want to \nmake sure that those who are fighting our wars, those who are defending \nour Nation, are treated alike. That is all it is. We just want to make \nsure they are treated the same.\n  Many members of our Guard and Reserve did not have access to \naffordable health insurance when they were on civilian status, and then \nin a moment's notice they may be called to answer the time-honored call \nto duty. The GAO, the Government Accountability Office, reported in \n2002 that at least 20 percent of the members of the Guard and Reserve \ndid not have health insurance--20 percent of the members of the Guard \nand Reserve did not have health insurance. That means that there are \nmembers of the Guard and Reserve who potentially are not as healthy as \nwe want them to be when we ask them to deploy.\n\n  Last year, we enacted a partial version of this amendment. It became \nknown as the TRICARE Reserve Select Program. The program ties \neligibility for gaining access to TRICARE--on a cost-share basis--to \nservice on active duty in a contingency. That was a step forward. \nTRICARE was an important step forward, but it doesn't address the \nhealth insurance needs before deployment. It doesn't address the \nbroader question of readiness of the force.\n  This amendment opens eligibility to any member of the Select Reserve. \nAs long as a reservist stands ready for deployment, he or she will be \nable to participate in the program. It offers real, practical, \nmeaningful health to citizen soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. It \nalso is going to provide a meaningful recruitment incentive for the \nGuard and Reserve. As we all know, they are struggling to meet \nrecruiting goals.\n  I am honored to be the cochair of the Senate National Guard Caucus. \nAs cochair, I believe that few defense personnel reforms are as needed, \nas demonstrably needed and overdue as this health insurance initiative \nfor Guard and Reserve. It has been a high priority of each of the \nmembers of our bipartisan coalition. Republicans and Democrats alike \nagree the Guard and Reserve deserve to have available health insurance \nthe same as all others.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes from the time allotted to the \nSenator from Michigan.\n  Mr. WARNER. No objection.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the GAO study commission exposed and \nconfirmed these glaring deficiencies. In this GAO study, I said it \nappears to me we are sending our Guard and Reserve out to fight \nalongside our regular forces, but they are doing it without the health \ninsurance protection our regular forces have. Well, the GAO study said \nexactly what I thought was happening was happening. So it has been \nheartening to work with my fellow Senators in remedying these problems. \nI will continue to press forward until a full TRICARE program for the \nGuard and Reserve is in place.\n  I will close with this. We are going to ask our Guard and Reserve to \ndo the same duties, face the same dangers, stand in harm's way in the \nsame way as our regular forces, and they ought to be treated the same \nwhen it comes to medical care. It is a matter of readiness, it is a \nmatter of honesty, but most importantly it is a matter of simple \njustice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator from \nSouth Carolina for the lineup of speakers.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would like to yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nVirginia, who was one of the original founders of this whole idea, \nfighting before this became popular, and he has been a terrific \nadvocate for the Guard and Reserve. I yield 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the Chair. I thank my good friend and colleague, \nSenator Graham, for his tremendous leadership on Guard and Reserve \nmatters. Of course, he is the only active member of the Guard and \nReserve in this body, and so he understands what families and Guard \nmembers are facing.\n  My experience goes back to the days when I was Governor and saw how \nimportant our Virginia Guard troops were when there were times of \nfloods and hurricanes and natural disasters. I also remember visiting \nmany of our Guard troops in Bosnia who had been sent over there. I \nremember welcoming back some of our Virginia Air Guard who were flying \nin the no-fly zone in Iraq.\n  As Senator Coleman said earlier in this debate, and all of us \nrecognize, the Guard and Reserve are being called up more frequently \nand for greater duration than ever before. In fact, when I was in Iraq \nback in mid-February, there were some Guard troops I was meeting with \nat Balad, and four or five of them actually had been in Bosnia. They \nsaid: We remember when you were in Bosnia to visit as Governor. In \nreality, the Guard and Reserve troops who are being called upon so much \nin this war on terror are generally, compared to the Active Forces, \nolder and therefore more likely to be married and more likely to have \nchildren.\n  So if we are going to retain and recruit Guard members and \nreservists, we are going to need to show proper reasonable \nappreciation. We need to address the pay-gap problem. On average, when \nthey get activated, they loose $368 a month, and Senator Landrieu, \nSenator Graham, and several of us are working on this issue.\n  This measure on health benefits means a great deal to the Guard \nmembers and their families. We did make some progress last year, but \nnevertheless it wasn't as much--the passage of this measure was 75 to \n25--as we thought it would be, and Senator Graham, like the rest of us, \nis not going to be deterred. We are going to keep fighting, and it is a \nfight that is worth fighting because it is important to show proper \nappreciation with fair expansion of health care benefits which are so \nimportant for Guard and Reserve families. This, in my view, will help \nretain and recruit Guard members. I trust my colleagues will again \nstand strongly with our Guard and Reserve troops and our families and \npass this very reasonable, logical legislation to provide health care \ncoverage to all the members of our Guard and Reserve.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. At this time, Mr. Chairman, if I may, I yield to Senator \nThune, one of our newest members, 3 minutes. He has been a strong \nadvocate of this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I also compliment the Senator from South \nCarolina for his leadership on this issue, and also the Senator from \nNew\n\n[[Page S8630]]\n\nYork. I know they have worked together on this, but I will say that one \nof the first issues that the Senator from South Carolina talked to me \nabout when I first arrived in the Senate was this very issue. It is \nimportant for a lot of reasons, important in my State of South Dakota \nbecause we have a number of people who have been called up. Over 1,700 \nof our National Guard men and women have served in the deployments to \nIraq and Afghanistan, and as I have traveled my State and attended many \nof the events as they have been deactivated and come home, I looked \ninto the eyes of their children and their loved ones and assured those \npeople that the job they are doing is important to freedom's cause, \nthat the work they are doing is important in bringing freedom and \ndemocracy to places such as Iraq and Afghanistan and thereby also \nmaking our country more safe and secure.\n  It is important that we put in place the appreciation for the good \nwork that our guardsmen and reservists are doing and important that we \nrecognize that by offering them access to affordable health care. This \nlegislation is important because we do have a challenge as we go \nforward with the continuing duration of the deployments, with the need \nto call up our Guard and Reserve on a more frequent basis, to ensure \nthat we put the incentives in place so that we can recruit and retain \nthe men and women who continue to fill those very important roles.\n  And so I am happy to cosponsor this amendment to offer my support to \nthe Senator from South Carolina and to urge our colleagues on the floor \nof the Senate to support this important legislation, to send a strong, \nclear message to the men and women who are serving our country in the \nGuard and Reserve that we support them. This is no longer a 1-weekend-\na-month, 2-weeks-a-year deployment. That is a thing of the past. The \nlonger deployments and the heightened responsibilities are taking an \nunforeseen toll on the families and members of the Guard and Reserve. \nIf Congress is going to call on our Reserves to do more, we have a \nresponsibility to provide them with more. By offering TRICARE to Guard \nand Reserve, we are helping to mitigate the effects of the burden we \nare asking Guard and Reserve to shoulder in the war on terror. No \nsoldier should be deployed to fight for his country only to have his \nthoughts consumed by the welfare of his family.\n  So I thank Senator Graham for his leadership on this issue. I \nencourage my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair. Thanks to all Senators, and thanks to \nthe Guard and Reserve because we need them the most.\n  One of the problems that Guard and Reserve families have to face is \nthe lack of continuity of health care. If you are called back to duty, \nyou have health care. Once you are released from active duty, with its \nhealth care program, you go back into the civilian health care network. \nThat means you have to change hospitals and doctors. If you are \nexperiencing a pregnancy, that means your hospitals may change, the \ndoctors may change because you bounce from one health care network to \nthe other.\n  This bill would provide a health care home for guardsmen and \nreservists, taking stress off their families if they choose to join. \nThey never have to worry about bouncing from one doctor to one hospital \nto the next. They would have a continuing network. The Guard and \nReserve have to pay a premium, unlike their Active-Duty counterpart. It \nis not a free benefit. I think this is a fair compromise. At the end of \nthe day, this will help the Guard and Reserve.\n  I am proud of what we have done. I thank the chairman for his \nwillingness to work with us. Time will tell how we will do this, but I \nam optimistic Congress is going to rise to the occasion to help these \nmen and women who risk their lives to protect our freedom.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, earlier this year I introduced legislation \nto strengthen our military and enact a ``Military Family Bill of \nRights.'' One piece of that bigger agenda is providing TRICARE \neligibility to members of the National Guard and Reserve. Today I have \nthe pleasure of cosponsoring an amendment that would expand the \neligibility for TRICARE to members of the Selected Reserve. While this \namendment is only a start towards better policies for Americans in \nuniform and their families, it is also an important step in supporting \nour troops.\n  ``Supporting the troops'' means paying attention to the needs of our \ntroops in the field and at home; understanding their lives both as \nwarriors fighting for the defense of their country and as parents, \nbrothers and sisters, sons, and daughters struggling for the prosperity \nand happiness of their families.\n  As many as one in five members of the National Guard and Reserves \ndon't have health insurance. That is bad policy and bad for our \nnational security. When units are mobilized, they count on all their \npersonnel. But when a member of the National Guard or Reserve is \nmobilized, and unit members fail physicals due to previously \nundiagnosed or uncorrected health conditions because that servicemember \nlacked health insurance, it disrupts unit cohesion and affects unit \nreadiness.\n  Under current practice, members of the National Guard and their \nfamilies are eligible for TRICARE only when mobilized and, in some \ncases, upon their return from Active Duty. For some, that means they \nlack continuity of care, having to switch healthcare providers whenever \ntheir loved one is mobilized or returns home. This lack of continuity \nis particularly difficult for individuals with special health care \nneeds, such as pregnant spouses or young children.\n  When we think of supporting our troops, we must remember that we also \nhave to support families. Investing in military families isn't just an \nact of compassion, it is a smart investment in America's military. Good \ncommanders know that while you may recruit an individual soldier or \nmarine, you ``retain'' a family. Nearly 50 percent of America's \nservicemembers are married today. If we want to retain our most \nexperienced servicemembers, especially the noncommissioned officers \nthat are the backbone of the Army and Marine Corps, we have to keep \nfaith with their families. If we don't, and those experienced, enlisted \nleaders begin to leave, America will have a broken, ``hollow'' \nmilitary.\n  Thus, TRICARE for members of the Select Reserve is not simply a new \n``benefit'' but an issue affecting mission readiness. With our military \nforces stretched as thin as they are due to the conflicts in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, we need to rely on the Reserves to an even greater extent \nthan in the past. Indeed, at a time when the Guard and Reserve face \ngrowing problems in recruiting and retention, extending TRICARE \ncoverage also has the potential to be a great recruiting tool.\n  We have a sacred obligation to keep faith with the men and women of \nthe American military and their families--whether they are on Active \nDuty, in the National Guard or Reserves, or veterans. Today's amendment \nis an important step.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. The distinguished ranking member and myself are prepared \nto accept this amendment. But I want to talk just a bit about the \nimportance of what these two Senators, primarily the Senator from South \nCarolina and the Senator from New York, have done. This is a very \nsignificant piece of legislation. We laid the foundation last year and \nhad some incremental improvement, but this really carries the ball the \nbalance of the field and scores a touchdown in behalf of the men and \nwomen in the Armed Forces and Reserve.\n  As the Senator from South Carolina has pointed out, this is not a \nfree benefit. There is going to be, I say to both of my colleagues, the \nSenator from New York and the Senator from South Carolina, a reasonable \nfee.\n  But if I could bring back a little personal experience, in 1950, I \nwas a member of the Marine Corps Reserve, having come up from the \nenlisted ranks and gotten my commission. The Korean war sprung on us \ntotally without anticipation. I remember at the time\n\n[[Page S8631]]\n\nTruman was in office, and Louie Johnson was basically the Secretary of \nDefense who disbanded the military. Suddenly we had to do a rapid \nturnaround, and we had nowhere to go but to call up the Reserves. I was \njust a young bachelor then. I was happy to go, but when I was in my \nfirst training command in the fall of 1950 at Quantico in the first \nspecial basic class, why, over half the class was married and had to \nleave their families and everything and quickly return. Most of us had \nbeen in World War II and gotten our commissions.\n  I simply point out that is another hidden element to this; that is, \nwhen you are maintaining voluntarily the status of being in the Select \nReserve, you are subject to call at a late hour of the night to pack \nyour bags, leave your family, leave your job, and go. And if you look, \nthere are 1,142,000 members of the total Reserve, and the Select \nReserve is only 700,000. I mean, it is a significant number, but it is \nthat group of 700,000 that is subject to call on very short notice. And \nthat is ever present. It sometimes requires a problem with the \nemployer, to maintain that status knowing that valuable employee could \nleave on less than 30 days' notice and the employer has to seek another \nto fill the post, and so forth. So there is much to be said about \nstaying in.\n  I recall when I got back from Korea, I was finished my obligated \nmilitary service and could have cashiered out, but I stayed in the \nReserves another 10 or 11 years, to my recollection--I think it was 12 \nyears. There were certain benefits that were an inducement to stay in \nand, frankly, I enjoyed it enormously. I don't have a military career \nof great consequence. I am certainly grateful for the opportunity to \nserve, and I think this is a marvelous thing.\n  I would like to be listed as a cosponsor, as my distinguished \ncolleague from Michigan likewise, and we salute the two Senators who \npioneered this approach.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. In the beginning we had to look at the dollars and the \nfigures and balance it out.\n  As the Senator said, fight on. And we will be there, and each of \nthese Members will be by our side. I hope Members can walk out of that \nconference some day with a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment.\n  I urge adoption of the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1363) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank our colleagues.\n  We are open for further amendments. The Boy Scout amendment is being \nreviewed. The Lautenberg amendment is, likewise, being reviewed on our \nside. It will take the managers a few moments to advise the Senate as \nto what the next matter will be.\n  Therefore, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada has consulted with \nthe managers of the bill and desires to address the Senate in the \ncontext of several amendments. We thank the Senator very much for his \nparticipation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To enhance and extend the increase in the amount of the death \n                               gratuity)\n\n       On page 159, strike line 20 and all that follows through \n     page 161, line 9, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 641. ENHANCEMENT OF DEATH GRATUITY AND ENHANCEMENT OF \n                   LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN COMBAT \n                   RELATED DEATHS.\n\n       (a) Increased Amount of Death Gratuity.--\n       (1) Increased amount.--Section 1478(a) of title 10, United \n     States Code, is amended by striking ``$12,000'' and inserting \n     ``$100,000''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by this subsection \n     shall take effect on October 7, 2001, and shall apply with \n     respect to deaths occurring on or after that date.\n       (3) Coordination with other enhancements.--If the date of \n     the enactment of this Act occurs before October 1, 2005--\n       (A) effective as of such date of enactment, the amendments \n     made to section 1478 of title 10, United States Code, by the \n     Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the \n     Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief, 2005 (Public Law \n     109-13) are repealed; and\n       (B) effective immediately before the execution of the \n     amendment made by paragraph (1), the provisions of section \n     1478 of title 10, United States Code, as in effect on the \n     date before the date of the enactment of the Act referred to \n     in subparagraph (A), shall be revived.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the provisions in the fiscal year 2005 \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill increase the military death \ngratuity from $12,400 to $100,000. The bill before us continues that \nincrease in the gratuity. The provisions, however, do not cover all \npeople on active duty. It only covers people who are killed in combat. \nOur military leaders strongly, and I believe unanimously--our uniformed \nleaders--believe the death of a military person who is on active duty \nshould be covered equally whether that person was killed in combat or \non his way to a training exercise.\n  They have testified in front of our committee very forcefully that \nthey believe the benefit which we have provided, the so-called military \ndeath gratuity of $100,000--now as we provide in the bill to be made \npermanent--should be applied equally to all persons on active duty.\n  The case of Marine LTC Richard Wersel, Jr., who had a fatal heart \nattack while exercising 1 week after returning from his second tour of \nduty in Iraq, perhaps says it all. This was an active-duty marine. He \nhad just come back from an extremely difficult and stressful \ndeployment. He had multiple deployments over 30 months. He had been \ntraining indigenous troops to fight drug traffickers. As well, he had \ntwo tours of duty in Iraq. But as his wife put it: Those multiple \ndeployments were the silent bullet that took her husband's life.\n  Under current law, the death gratuity which would go to the wife and \nfamily would only be $12,400. Had the heart attack occurred while in \nIraq, the death gratuity would have been $100,000. In either case, \nColonel Wersel was serving his Nation, as he did very well throughout \nhis life. He was on active duty. The fact that he died a week after \nreturning from a second, stressful tour in Iraq should not cause his \nsurviving spouse to receive such a significantly smaller death \ngratuity.\n  This is what the Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps told the \nArmed Services Committee at a hearing on military death benefits. He \nsaid:\n\n       I think we need to understand before we put any \n     distinctions on the great service of these wonderful young \n     men and women who wear this cloth forward into combat, \n     training to go to combat or in tsunami relief, they are all \n     performing magnificently. I think we have to be very cautious \n     in drawing distinctions.\n\n  At another hearing, I asked General Myers, the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs, for his views on whether the military death gratuity should be \nthe same for all members who die on active duty. His answer was:\n\n       I think a death gratuity that applies to all servicemembers \n     is preferable to one that's targeted just to those that might \n     be in a combat zone.\n\n  He said:\n\n       When you join the military, you join the military. You go \n     where they send you. And it's happenstance that you're in a \n     combat zone or you're at home. And I think we have in the \n     past held to treating people universally, for the most part, \n     and consistently. And that's how I come down on that.\n\n  That is what General Myers said.\n  The Presiding Officer well knows this because he has to deal with \nthese losses regularly back home in Minnesota. He pointed out earlier \ntoday how many Reserve folks he has in Minnesota whom he supports.\n  No benefit--no benefit--can replace the loss of life of a soldier, \nsailor, airman, or marine who gives his or her life in service to our \ncountry. Every survivor would choose to have the servicemember alive \nand healthy rather than any compensation our Government could provide. \nBut that does not mean our benefits should not be full and generous and \nconsistent; it is just a recognition that we cannot place a monetary \nvalue on a life given in service to our Nation.\n  There is much more to be said about this issue. But, again, the \ntestimony of our senior uniformed military leaders, it seems to me, is \nthe most compelling testimony, in addition to the actual, tragic \nsituations we have, such as the one I read about a moment ago.\n  So I offer this amendment. Many of us have supported this amendment. \nThere have been many members of our committee and many Members of the \nSenate who are not on the committee who I know very strongly support a \n$100,000 death gratuity for all active-duty military deaths, not just \nthose who die in combat-related activity.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am happy to join the Senator from \nMichigan in sponsoring this amendment. Earlier this year, we offered an \nidentical amendment to the fiscal year 2005 Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriation Act, which passed the Senate with 75 votes but was \ninexcusably dropped in conference. We need to rectify that wrong \nbecause the death gratuity system created last spring, despite good \nintentions, sells short people who deserve better: our soldiers and \nmilitary.\n  The issue is simple: when it comes to our men and women in uniform, \nhow do you draw the line between one death in one circumstance and \nanother death in another circumstance? I don't believe you can. The \nexisting law relies on the combat related special compensation \nlegislation to determine which personnel who die outside of combat \nzones receive the increased death gratuity. It may seem sufficient, but \nit is not.\n  Consider the case of Vivianne Wersel. Her husband, LTC Richard M. \nWersel,\n\n[[Page S8633]]\n\nU.S. Marine Corps, served 20 years and 6 months in the Marine Corps. \nHis last overseas assignment was with the Multinational Forces Iraq in \nBaghdad. He served there as the plans chief for the Civil Military \nOperations Directorate. In February of this year, just a week after \nreturning home, Lieutenant Colonel Wersel suffered a fatal heart attack \nlifting weights in the gym at Camp Lejeune, NC.\n  If he had died 1 week earlier lifting weights in Iraq, his family \nwould have been eligible for the increased benefits. Because he died in \nthe United States, his sacrifice isn't properly honored, and his family \nis left to a greater struggle.\n  This is what the uniformed leaders of the American military were \ntalking about when they testified before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee earlier this year. It is time we listened to them. Let me \nremind my colleagues what they said:\n  GEN Michael T. Moseley, U.S. Air Force, said:\n\n       I believe a death is a death and our servicemen and women \n     should be represented that way.\n\n  GEN Richard A. Cody, U.S. Army, said:\n\n       It is about service to this country and I think we need to \n     be very, very careful about making this $100,000 decision \n     based upon what type of action. I would rather err on the \n     side of covering all deaths than try to make the distinction.\n\n  And ADM John B. Nathman, U.S. Navy, said:\n\n       This has been about . . . how do we take care of the \n     survivors, the families, and the children. They can't make a \n     distinction; I don't believe we should either.\n\n  Vivianne Wersel certainly doesn't make that distinction. She and her \nhusband have two wonderful children. They have lived on 10 bases in the \nlast 15 years living the proud but challenging life of a Marine family. \nThey have made sacrifices for this country throughout Colonel Wersel's \ncareer--supporting him in his missions wherever that took him. They \nhave missed their father for a long time not simply since his death. \nThey deserve better from us, who they sacrificed to protect.\n  For the survivors of our Nation's fallen heroes, much of life \nremains, and though no one can ever put a price on a lost loved one, we \nmust be generous in helping them put their lives back together. Current \nlaw doesn't work. We can change it. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to be made a cosponsor of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I recall very vividly the testimony we \nreceived from the whole group of the Joint Chiefs of Staff led by \nGeneral Myers. General Myers was very strong on this point. You \nmentioned General Pace. Indeed, he was a leader on it. But, across the \nboard, our chiefs stepped up.\n  I say to the Senator, it is important this be done. We accept the \namendment and are ready to move when you are ready to move.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1376) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, momentarily we will have another matter to \nbe brought to the floor. We are making progress. At the moment, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank our distinguished colleague from Maine, who is \ngoing to address a very important subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1377 to Amendment No. 1351\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1377 to amendment No. 1351.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure that certain persons do not evade or avoid the \nprohibitions imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers \n                      Act, and for other purposes)\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, I rise to offer a second-degree amendment \nto the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, \nMr. Lautenberg. While I take a slightly different approach than my \ncolleague from New Jersey, I wish to be clear that my intent is very \nsimilar to his; that is, to close loopholes in current U.S. law that \nallow U.S. firms to do business in terrorist nations or nations that \nare known to sponsor terrorism and are under U.S. sanctions.\n  Denying business investment to states that finance or otherwise \nsupport terrorist activities, such as Syria, Iran, or Sudan, is \ncritical to the war on terrorism. The United States has had sanctions \nin place on the Iranian Government for a long time and for good \nreasons. These sanctions prohibit U.S. citizens and U.S. corporations \nfrom\n\n[[Page S8634]]\n\ndoing business in Iran, a nation known as a state sponsor of terrorism. \nI fully support the use of these sanctions to deny terrorist states \nfunding and investment from American companies.\n  Currently, U.S. sanctions provisions in the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act prohibit U.S. companies from conducting business \nwith nations that are listed on the terrorist sponsor list. The law \ndoes not specifically bar foreign subsidiaries of American companies \nfrom doing business with terrorist-supporting nations, as long as these \nsubsidiaries are considered truly independent of the parent company.\n  There have, however, been reports that some U.S. companies have \nexploited this exception in the law by creating foreign subsidiaries of \nU.S. companies in order to do business with such nations. The \nallegations are that these foreign subsidiaries are formed and \nincorporated overseas for the specific purpose of bypassing U.S. \nsanctions laws that prohibit American corporations from doing business \nwith terrorist-sponsoring nations such as Syria and Iran. There is no \ndoubt that this practice cannot be allowed to continue.\n  I supported Senator Lautenberg's amendment last year because it was \nthe only proposal before us to deal with this very real problem. The \nSenator from New Jersey has been very eloquent in speaking about this \nexploitation of the exceptions in the current sanctions laws. The \nexamples that we have heard, where American firms simply create new \nshell corporations to execute transactions that they themselves are \nprohibited from engaging in, are truly outrageous. Clearly, the law \ndoes need to be tightened. But we need to be careful about how we go \nabout addressing this problem. I have long felt that while the Senator \nfrom New Jersey is correct in his intentions, the specific language of \nhis amendment needs improvement.\n  We have worked very closely--my staff and I--during the past 6 \nmonths, with the administration to draft a proposal that closes the \nloophole without overreaching. We must draft this measure in a manner \nthat gets at these egregious cases that are so outrageous without \noverstepping the traditional legal notions of jurisdiction. Otherwise, \nwe may find ourselves harming the war on terror rather than helping.\n  Some truly independent foreign subsidiaries are incorporated under \nthe laws of the country in which they do business and are subject to \nthat country's laws, to that legal jurisdiction. There is a great deal \nof difference between a corporation set up in a day, without any real \nemployees or assets, and one that has been in existence for many years \nand that gets purchased, in part, by a U.S. firm. That foreign company \nmay even be an American firm with a controlling interest in that \nforeign company, but under the law, it is still considered to be a \nforeign corporation.\n  Senator Lautenberg's proposal requires foreign subsidiaries and their \nparents to obey both U.S. and applicable foreign law at the same time, \neven if they are in conflict. Not only does this complicate our \nrelations with other countries, it also puts U.S. subsidiaries of \nforeign parent companies in danger of being subjected to other nations' \nlaws in retaliation. It also raises all sorts of questions when there \nare conflicts in the two sets of laws. At a time when we are seeking \nthe maximum active foreign cooperation possible in the global war \nagainst terrorism, exerting U.S. law over all foreign companies owned \nor controlled by U.S. firms and their foreign operations seems to be an \nimprudent and excessive move. The administration agrees.\n  Rather than simply declaring many foreign entities subject to U.S. \nlaw regardless of their particular situation, my amendment would take \nfour strong steps to improve U.S. sanctions laws--specifically, the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act--without raising the \nconcerns that come forth if we take the approach recommended by Senator \nLautenberg.\n  First, my amendment would prohibit any action by a U.S. firm that \nwould avoid or evade U.S. sanctions. This would clearly prohibit the \ncreation of a new shell company for the purposes of evading U.S. \nsanctions, a situation that has occurred and that we need to prevent.\n\n  Second, my amendment would prohibit American firms from ``approving, \nfacilitating or financing'' actions that would violate U.S. sanctions \nlaws if undertaken by a U.S. firm. This would prohibit any involvement \nby a U.S. parent firm with an existing subsidiary that was engaged in a \ntransaction that violated the International Emergency Economic Powers \nAct. In order to comply with the law, the U.S. parent firm would need \nto be totally passive in any transaction. But if the American firm is, \nin fact, approving the actions of that foreign subsidiary that is doing \nbusiness in a prohibited country or facilitating it in any way--that is \na pretty broad word--or financing those prohibited actions, that would \nbe a violation of our law.\n  Third, my amendment would increase the maximum penalties per \nviolation under the act from $10,000 to $250,000 for a civil violation \nand from $50,000 to $500,000. For companies who think that the risk of \ngetting caught is worth it, they will need to think again because now \nthe penalties are sufficient that they have real bite.\n  Finally, our amendment would provide explicit subpoena authority to \nobtain records related to transactions covered by the act. Right now, \nthere has been a difficulty in enforcing the sanctions in terms of \ngetting the information that is needed. This would provide subpoena \npower.\n  Specifically, by increasing penalties and providing for explicit \nsubpoena authority, I believe my amendment results in a much stronger \nsanctions regime but without invoking many of the concerns that have \nbeen voiced with regard to Senator Lautenberg's amendment.\n  Again, I want to make clear that I think the goals of the Senator \nfrom New Jersey and myself are very similar. The question is how to \ncraft a solution that addresses the problem without overreaching and \nwithout causing the possibility of a foreign country retaliating \nagainst the American subsidiaries of that country's firm.\n  I believe that my amendment is the right approach to this critical \nproblem. It will make clear that U.S. corporations cannot circumvent \nU.S. law. They cannot set up phony shell corporations for the purpose \nof evading the law. They can't direct a foreign subsidiary to do what \nthey are prohibited from doing under our laws. It will also greatly \nstrengthen and improve the enforcement of the law through the increase \nin penalties and by vesting subpoena power. At the same time, my \napproach is carefully crafted to avoid unintended consequences that \nwill harm our relations with our international allies.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this balanced approach.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the Collins amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment I have just sent to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I might, through the Chair, address the \nchairman of the committee. I have an amendment which I would like to \noffer, but I don't want to step into a process or a queue that is \nalready established. I am not going to call up the amendment at this \nmoment. I merely want to speak to it and offer it and put it on the \nlist of amendments to be considered at a later time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we would like to accommodate the Senator. \nMy only inquiry is, we now have on the floor the two principals on this \nimportant measure. If you wish, for a few minutes, to lay down an \namendment, I am sure we could do that. I would like to have this \nimportant debate resumed.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the chairman, that is exactly what I would \nlike to do.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these two pending amendments be set \naside strictly for the purpose of introducing an amendment and speaking \nno more than, say, 10 minutes and then, at that\n\n[[Page S8635]]\n\npoint, I ask that we return to the pending order of business, the \nLautenberg amendment and the Collins amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1379\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1379.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require certain dietary supplement manufacturers to report \n                    certain serious adverse events)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 330. REPORTING OF SERIOUS ADVERSE HEALTH EVENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Defense may not permit a \n     dietary supplement containing a stimulant to be sold on a \n     military installation or in a commissary store, exchange \n     store, or other store under chapter 147 of title 10, United \n     States Code, unless the manufacturer of such dietary \n     supplement submits any report of a serious adverse health \n     event associated with such dietary supplement to the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services, who shall make such \n     reports available to the Surgeon Generals of the Armed \n     Forces.\n       (b) Effect of Section.--Notwithstanding section 201(ff)(2) \n     of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \n     321(ff)(2)) and subsection (c)(3) of this section, this \n     section shall not apply to a dietary supplement that is \n     intended to be consumed in liquid form if the only stimulant \n     contained in such supplement is caffeine.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Dietary supplement.--The term ``dietary supplement'' \n     has the same meaning given the term in section 201(ff) of the \n     Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(ff)).\n       (2) Serious adverse health event.--The term ``serious \n     adverse health event'' means an adverse event that may \n     reasonably be suspected to be associated with the use of a \n     dietary supplement in a human, without regard to whether the \n     event is known to be causally related to the dietary \n     supplement, that--\n       (A) results in--\n       (i) death;\n       (ii) a life-threatening experience;\n       (iii) inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an \n     existing hospitalization;\n       (iv) a persistent or significant disability or incapacity; \n     or\n       (v) a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or\n       (B) requires, based on reasonable medical judgment, medical \n     or surgical intervention to prevent an outcome described in \n     subparagraph (A).\n       (3) Stimulant.--The term ``stimulant'' means a dietary \n     ingredient that has a stimulant effect on the cardiovascular \n     system or the central nervous system of a human by any means, \n     including--\n       (A) speeding metabolism;\n       (B) increasing heart rate;\n       (C) constricting blood vessels; or\n       (D) causing the body to release adrenaline.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill, and included in here are funds for those base \nexchanges where members of the Armed Forces and their families go to \nbuy the necessities of life. They turn there for groceries, \npharmaceuticals, and other needs for their families. The purpose of \nthis amendment is to make sure that the products sold at these base \nexchanges across the United States and around the world are safe for \nthe military and the families who use the base exchanges.\n  I am particularly concerned about dietary supplements. Military \npersonnel are under tremendous pressure to be physically fit. The \nconditions under which they work and train are harsh and demanding. A \nsupplement product can be attractive because it is marketed for \nperformance enhancement and weight loss. My amendment seeks to ensure \nthat these so-called health products sold at military stores are \nmonitored for safety.\n  At the outset, I want to say I have no quarrel with dietary \nsupplements like vitamins. I woke up this morning and, like millions of \nAmericans, took my vitamins in the hope that I will live forever. I \nthink that should be my right and my choice. I don't believe I should \nneed a prescription for vitamin C or multivitamins.\n  What is at issue are the dietary supplements that cross the line. \nInstead of providing nutritional assistance, many of them make health \nclaims that, frankly, they cannot live up to. Finding many of these \nproducts on a military base is easy. A 2004 report on dietary \nsupplements notes that a newly deployed U.S. Air Force base had eight \ndifferent dietary supplements stocked on the shelves that were marketed \nfor weightlifting and energy enhancements 5 months after it opened. Six \nof these products contain the stimulant ephedra.\n  Most dietary supplements are safe and healthy, but there is a growing \nconcern about categories of dietary supplements that are being taken by \ninnocent people who think they are good and, in fact, they are not.\n  The Navy released a list of serious problems related to dietary \nsupplements recently. They included health events such as death, rapid \nheart rate, shortness of breath, severe chest pain, and becoming \nincreasingly delusional. These are from over-the-counter dietary \nsupplements.\n  Unfortunately, most of the time these events are never reported. In \nother words, the laws that govern prescription drugs and many over-the-\ncounter drugs do not apply to dietary supplements.\n  Let me show you a chart that I think illustrates that quite well. \nHere are different categories of things you might buy at your \ndrugstore. You might buy prescription drugs through your doctor or \nover-the-counter medications, such as cough medicine, or you might buy \ndietary supplements. Metabolife is a popular version. The question is: \nAre they all safe? The obvious answer is: Not by a long shot. \nPrescription drugs are safety tested before being sold. Over-the-\ncounter medications are safety tested. Dietary supplements are not. \nDoes anybody test them to make sure that the claims on some of them--\nfor example, the claims that this is going to help with my cough or \nthat this is going to give me energy--has anybody tested these to make \nsure they are effective for what they claim? Yes, when it comes to \nprescription drugs, they are tested for efficacy before they are sold; \nyes, for over-the-counter medications; but no, for dietary supplements, \nthe claims are not tested ahead of time. How about individual doses? If \na doctor tells you to take four tablets during the course of a day, how \nwell can you trust the dosage on the package to reflect what the doctor \nrecommended? Well, when it comes to prescription drugs, the FDA says, \nyes, we test the dosage. It is the same with over-the-counter \nmedications. When it comes to these dietary supplements, vitamins, \nnutritional supplements, there is no individual dosage control.\n  They have been fighting over this for almost 10 years. Finally, if \nsomething goes wrong with a prescription drug--if you take it and you \nget sick and you report it to the company that made the drug, do they \nhave to tell the Federal Government? Absolutely, when it comes to \nprescription drugs. How about in the case of over-the-counter drugs? \nYou bet. If you get sick and call the maker of one of the drugs, they \nare required by law to tell the FDA, and if it reaches a certain point, \nthey can be taken from the market. How about dietary supplements? What \nif you take one, such as yellow jackets that contains ephedra and you \ncall the company and tell them you got sick, do they have a legal \nrequirement to report that to the Government? No. There is no legal \nrequirement, even if you are dealing with a situation where a dietary \nsupplement has killed a person.\n  That troubles me. I don't believe we should have any dietary \nsupplements being sold across America--certainly not at our military \nbase exchanges--that is sold in a situation where, if there is adverse \nhealth consequence--death, stroke, heart attack, serious health \nconsequences--the manufacturer doesn't have to report it to the \nGovernment.\n  That is basically what this amendment says: If you want to sell a \nsupplement containing a stimulant on a military base, be prepared to \nreport adverse events to the Federal Government. If you will not tell \nus, the Federal Government, when people are dying or are seriously ill \nbecause of your dietary supplement, you should not be selling them at \nthe exchanges.\n  Let me say a word about ephedra. It received a lot of headlines.\n\n[[Page S8636]]\n\n  Mr. President, for the purpose of those who were following my \nstatement ever so closely and might have been interrupted and lost \ntheir train of thought, let me return to that for a moment and tell you \nwhat I am doing.\n  This amendment says you cannot sell dietary supplements containing \nstimulants at military stores and base exchanges, unless the maker of \nthe dietary supplement agrees, under law, to notify the Government if \nthere are adverse events when somebody takes the supplement. In other \nwords, if you take a nutritional or dietary supplement and suffer a \nheart attack or a stroke or someone dies and it is reported to the \nmanufacturer, this would require that the manufacturer notify the \nGovernment.\n  Has that ever happened? Sadly, it has. The military bases took \nephedra off the shelves at the end of 2002 because, between 1997 and \n2001, at least 30 active American military duty personnel died after \ntaking ephedra. After 7 years of effort, the FDA banned ephedra in \n2004. The industry went to court and fought it--even though 150 \nAmericans had died from this dietary supplement--and they won. In a \ncourt in Utah, they determined that the Federal law, the Dietary \nSupplement Health Education Act, DSHEA, didn't have the teeth to stop \nthe sale of ephedra as a dietary nutritional supplement. So today this \ntells the story.\n  Nutrition centers, such as this one in the photo, in Cincinnati, OH, \nare proclaiming ``ephedra is back.'' It certainly is. A member of my \nstaff decided to order 30 pills containing 200 milligrams each of \nephedra over the Internet from a post office box in Boonville, MO. You \ncan pick it up everywhere, even though it continues to be dangerous.\n  Why should we expose the men and women in our military to supplements \nthat have already taken the lives of at least 30 of our military \npersonnel and threatened scores of others? This amendment says we will \nnot. Unless you, as a manufacturer, are prepared to report adverse \nevents to the Federal Government, you cannot sell these products on \nmilitary bases.\n  In case people are wondering whether this little effort against \nephedra is my personal idea, ephedra, such as I am holding it here, has \nalready been banned for sale in Canada. As I am holding it here, it has \nbeen banned for sale in many local jurisdictions. The American Medical \nAssociation has said it is a dangerous supplement. We have seen sports \nactivities--one after the other--ban the use of ephedra. A Baltimore \nOrioles pitcher died last year after taking it in an attempt to lose \nweight. In my area of Lincoln, IL, in central Illinois, a great young \nman, 16 years old, went to the local gas station--Sean Riggins was his \nname--to buy some dietary supplement pills to get ready for a high \nschool football game. By the next morning, he was dead from a heart \nattack.\n  I do not want to see that happen again. I certainly want to spare our \nmilitary personnel from having to face that.\n  I tried to move this amendment last year. Others came to the floor \nand said: We can work this out. It never happened. The industry did \nnothing. We have achieved nothing. We have to put this protection in \nthe law for our military personnel.\n  I close by asking unanimous consent that Senator Feinstein's name be \nadded as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CHAFEE). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that letters \nof support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Letters of Support\n\n       My name is Kevin Riggins from Lincoln, IL. and I would like \n     to tell you my story. On Sep. 3, 2002, my wife and I lost our \n     son, 16 year old, Sean Riggins to a heart attack brought on \n     by the use of ephedra. Sean was a healthy, active student \n     athlete with no health problems overt or latent. Sean played \n     football, wrestled, and was a ``Black Belt'' in Tae Kwon Do, \n     and while he excelled in each sport, he and his teammates \n     strived for more. To ``enhance'' their performance in \n     football they began taking dietary supplements containing \n     ephedra. Because of the current FDA rules concerning dietary \n     supplements, or more precisely the lack thereof, my son lost \n     his life.\n       As you may or may not know, dietary supplement companies \n     fall under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act \n     (DSHEA) and NOT under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. Under \n     DSHEA, supplement companies do not need a license to \n     manufacture these products, nor do they require a medical or \n     science professional to formulate and create said products. \n     As a result, there are numerous companies that are owned and \n     run by persons with no more than a high school diploma, in \n     fact, I know of at least 3 owners that have State and Federal \n     convictions for a variety of offenses including drug \n     possession and distribution. Imagine a high school graduate \n     convicted felon formulating the mixtures and dosages for \n     these products.\n       There are no good manufacturing processes set in place for \n     these companies, which means that dosage requirements and \n     contents are irrelevant due to the lack of standardization.\n       There are no requirements for adverse event reporting to \n     the FDA. If a supplement company receives a report that their \n     product injured someone, the company can and in certain cases \n     has thrown the AER away.\n       These are but a small sample of the problems with this \n     industry and that is why I support any and all efforts to \n     reign in these lawless companies.\n       As an honorably discharged decorated veteran, I applaud \n     requiring adverse event reports turned in by military members \n     to be reported to the FDA. Our soldiers, sailors and airmen \n     deserve this protection. They put themselves on the line and \n     tell our enemies ``you will not pass'', and for that we must \n     accord them every protection.\n       If I sound somewhat bitter, I am. If I sound driven and \n     committed to reigning in these types of corporations, I am. I \n     lost my son. You cannot know that pain, that emptiness, that \n     hole in your soul when you lose a child unless you have been \n     there, and I pray that none of you ever have to experience \n     that. Please, help our service men and women, my brothers and \n     sisters in arms. Pass this amendment. Let them know that \n     somebody gives a damn. Let me know somebody gives a damn. Let \n     Sean know.\n           Thank you.\n     Kevin S. Riggins.\n                                  ____\n\n       My name is Debbie Riggins. My son, Sean, died of a heart \n     attack almost 3 years ago at age 16 due to ephedra. That day \n     changed my life forever. I still struggle with the memory of \n     that day; the moment I saw the life drift from the eyes of my \n     only child. As Sean started high school, he thought of what \n     he might want to do with his life. He considered a life in \n     the armed services. He never got that chance. He was robbed \n     of the chance to do many things.\n       Now it's time for the military to set an example to the \n     private sector; a chance to show the Nation that it truly \n     cares about the health and welfare of its troops. We are \n     asking the military to track and report adverse event reports \n     of their troops. Since the pharmaceutical companies have been \n     so lax and unprofessional in their reporting practices, many \n     events are either being diagnosed incorrectly or being swept \n     under the rug. The military should be an example for the rest \n     of the Nation. The armed services is a more controlled \n     environment and would thus be a more consistent reporting \n     base reflecting truer figures and facts.\n       It's already a tragedy when a family is informed that their \n     loved one has been killed in action but to later discover \n     that it was from an uncontrolled herbal supplement while they \n     were deployed is even worse. It's ``chemical warfare meets \n     friendly fire''.\n       Protect the service men and women as they protect us.\n     Debbie Riggins.\n                                  ____\n\n     From: Hilary Spitz\n     Sent: Tuesday, July 19, 2005, 10:02 p.m.\n\n       On March 16, 2000, our lives forever changed. My daughter, \n     Hilary Spitz had worked midnights as a deputy sheriff for \n     Coles County. When she got home, we went shopping. I dropped \n     her off at home and left to go sign documents at the school \n     board office. My husband worked midnights also. They both \n     closed their respective doors. Soon after I arrived, Dr. Berg \n     received a call for me. I was told my daughter was in trouble \n     at home and an ambulance had been called. My husband had \n     heard our dogs barking and went to check on them. They were \n     scratching at Hilary's door and he could hear a horrible \n     wailing sound coming from her room. He burst in and found her \n     lying on the floor in a very violent seizure. He could not \n     get her to respond and quickly dialed 911. He physically had \n     to lay across her to keep her from hurting herself. Her feet \n     were bleeding from kicking the bed and dresser. When I \n     arrived home, I could hear her from the doorway. No one knew \n     what was wrong. When I arrived at the hospital, I was met at \n     the door by a nurse and told they were doing everything they \n     could for her and I could not go in. Soon after my family \n     arrived, we convinced them to let me in, maybe I could talk \n     to her. By that time, she was still unresponsive and \n     uncontrollable. No amount of medicine would calm her down. \n     They did all kinds of tests and eventually transferred her to \n     Carle Clinic. Her seizure lasted 13\\1/2\\ hours. It was \n     eventually determined that this was caused by an herbal diet \n     supplement that contained ephredra. She had taken 5 pills in \n     10 days. That wasn't even the amount that was suggested to \n     take. She was in a coma for 7 days. When she woke up, she had \n     no idea what had happened. Since that time, she has\n\n[[Page S8637]]\n\n     had other health issues that have come up, but cannot be \n     linked directly to the ephedra seizure, but it seems strange \n     that they happened after that. But, since the seizure and the \n     hypoxic aftereffects, she is unable to work. She suffers from \n     depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, agitation, and sever \n     memory dysfunction. I am so grateful that she is here with \n     me. I wish she did not have the symptoms, but I am content \n     that she is alive. We continually live with her problems and \n     continually have to be with her. She was afraid to go to \n     sleep for a long time and had the light on in the bedroom \n     closet. Hilary lives with us and we help raise her 7 year old \n     daughter. If there is anything that we can do to keep this \n     horrible product off the market, we would be happy to discuss \n     this with you. We want to prevent anyone else from going \n     through this. Unfortunately, most people do not survive this. \n     Hilary is one of the lucky ones. It is just too bad that she \n     had to go through this.\n           Thank You, Michelle Skinlo.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Center for Science\n\n\n                                       in the Public Interest,\n\n                                                    July 21, 2005.\n     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: The Center for Science in the Public \n     Interest (CSPI) wishes to commend you for introducing an \n     amendment to S. 1042 that would require manufacturers who \n     sell on military bases dietary supplements containing \n     stimulants to submit to the Food and Drug Administration \n     (FDA) reports of serious adverse health reactions relating to \n     such products. Serious reactions include death, life-\n     threatening conditions, hospitalization, persistent \n     disability or incapacity, and pregnancy-related effects.\n       Members of the armed forces are particularly at risk from \n     potentially harmful stimulants that are promoted for weight \n     loss and performance enhancement. Such claims ``are enticing \n     to soldiers [and other members of the armed forces] who are \n     trying to meet or maintain weight standards, improve physical \n     fitness test scores, or be competitive in specialized unit \n     requirements.''\n       Between 1997 and 2001, 30 active duty personnel died after \n     taking ephedra, the most widely used stimulant at that time. \n     As a result, the Marine Corps banned the sale of dietary \n     supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids at its \n     commissaries more than two years before FDA's nationwide ban \n     became effective on April 12, 2004. The other members of the \n     Armed Forces implemented their own bans soon thereafter. \n     Although replacements for ephedra, such as bitter orange, \n     usnic acid and aristolochic acid appear to present similar \n     risks, it may take years before FDA has amassed the data \n     necessary to ban or otherwise restrict the sale of these \n     and other stimulants. We, therefore, believe that, in the \n     interim, military personnel should be protected.\n       Passage of this amendment will also provide FDA with sorely \n     needed data to support restrictions on the sale of harmful \n     supplements. In July 2000, the General Accounting Office \n     concluded that:\n       ``Once products reach consumers, FDA lacks an effective \n     system to track and analyze instances of adverse effects. \n     Until it has one, consumers face increased risks because the \n     nature, magnitude and significance of safety problems related \n     to consuming dietary supplements and functional foods will \n     remain unknown.''\n       Similarly, a report by the Office of Inspector General (IG) \n     of the Department of Health and Human Services, Adverse Event \n     Reporting for Dietary Supplements: An Inadequate Safety \n     Valve, concludes that ``FDA receives less than 1 percent of \n     all adverse events associated with dietary supplements'' \n     under its voluntary reporting system. This under-reporting is \n     particularly problematic because, as the IG explained, \n     dietary supplements do not undergo premarket approval for \n     safety and efficacy, and the adverse event reporting system \n     is the FDA's primary means for identifying safety problems. \n     The IG, therefore, recommended that manufacturers be required \n     to report serious adverse health reactions to the FDA.\n       The most recent report by the National Academy of Sciences \n     Institute of Medicine underscores the necessity of passing \n     such legislation. As the report explained, ``[e]ven though \n     they are natural products, herbs contain biological and \n     chemical properties that may lead to rare, acute or chronic \n     adverse effects.'' Therefore, the IOM recommended that \n     Congress strengthen ``consumer protection against all \n     potential hazards'' and called for legislation to require \n     that a manufacturer or distributor report to the FDA in a \n     timely manner any serious event associated with the use of \n     its marketed product of which the manufacturer or distributor \n     is aware. Adverse event reports are an essential source of \n     ``signals'' that there may be a safety concern warranting \n     further examination.\n       While we believe the FDA should be given new authority to \n     ensure that all supplements are safe before they are sold \n     regardless of whether they are sold at military \n     installations, and to promptly remove unsafe products from \n     the market, the measures in this bill are an important first \n     step towards evaluating the safety of dietary supplements now \n     on the market. We, therefore, believe that the legislation \n     should be enacted.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Bruce Silverglade,\n                                        Director of Legal Affairs.\n                                              Ilene Ringel Heller,\n     Senior Staff Attorney.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             American Osteopathic Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 2005.\n     Hon. Richard Durbin,\n     Democratic Whip, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: As President of the American \n     Osteopathic Association (AOA), I am pleased to inform you of \n     our support for the ``Make Our Armed Forces Safe and Healthy \n     (MASH) Act.'' We appreciate your willingness to offer this \n     provision as an amendment to the ``Fiscal Year 2006 \n     Department of Defense Appropriations Act'' (H.R. 2863). The \n     AOA and the 54,000 osteopathic physicians it represents, \n     extends its gratitude to you for introducing this important \n     amendment.\n       The AOA continues to evaluate the impact of increased use \n     of dietary supplements and other ``natural'' products upon \n     the patients we serve. Over the past ten years we have seen a \n     steady increase in utilization of dietary supplements by \n     consumers. As a result, we are increasingly concerned about \n     the unregulated manner in which many of these products are \n     produced, marketed, and sold.\n       As evidenced by a 1999 study conducted by the U.S. Army \n     Research Institute for Environmental Medicine, the use of \n     dietary supplements is a significant health care issue for \n     American soldiers. A similar study conducted by the \n     Department of the Navy found that overall seventy-three \n     percent of personnel reported a history of supplement use, \n     with the number as high as eighty nine percent of Marines \n     reported using supplements. These studies demonstrate the \n     prevalence of these products among our men and women in \n     uniform.\n       The AOA believes that it would be beneficial for consumers \n     and physicians to have an increased understanding of the \n     potential serious side effects of dietary supplements. All \n     too often patients fail to inform their physician when they \n     use one or more of these products. This leads to potential \n     interactions with prescribed medications and may obscure an \n     accurate diagnosis of an underlying condition or disease. The \n     physical rigors of the military place soldiers at an even \n     greater risk of harm caused by dietary supplements that have \n     not been properly monitored.\n       The AOA supports the ability of the Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA) to monitor dietary supplements. Your \n     amendment would take a significant step in ensuring the FDA, \n     and ultimately military personnel, physicians, and the \n     general public, become more knowledgeable with regard to \n     possible serious side effects of certain dietary supplements. \n     By requiring that the FDA receive serious adverse event \n     reports for dietary supplements sold on military \n     installations, a significant gap in knowledge about these \n     products and their effect on a person's health would be \n     closed.\n       On behalf of my fellow osteopathic physicians, I pledge our \n     support for your efforts to promote the health of American \n     soldiers by confronting the issue of dietary supplements and \n     the health of our armed services. Please do not hesitate to \n     call upon the AOA or our members for assistance on this or \n     other health care issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Philip Shettle, D.O.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Consumers Union,\n\n                                                    July 21, 2005.\n     Hon. Richard Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer \n     Reports magazine supports your ``Make our Armed Forces \n     Healthy (``MASH'') amendment to the FY 2006 Department of \n     Defense Authorization bill. Your amendment would require \n     manufacturers that sell dietary supplements containing \n     stimulants on military installations to file reports of all \n     serious adverse events relating to the products (including \n     death, a life-threatening condition, hospitalization, \n     persistent disability or incapacity, or birth defects) with \n     the FDA.\n       Many members of the military invest a lot of time and \n     attention in their physical fitness. In addition to physical \n     training, some have turned to dietary supplements--including \n     those containing stimulants--believing they may increase \n     their performance. Unfortunately, use of such stimulants too \n     often results in harm. Prior to its action banning this \n     ingredient from herbal supplements on February 11, 2004, the \n     FDA had received at least 16,961 adverse event reports \n     relating to ephedra supplements, including reports of heart \n     attacks, strokes, seizures and fatalities. Consumer Reports, \n     however, continues to strongly urge people to avoid all \n     weight-loss and energy-boosting supplements, including those \n     that are now touted as ``ephedra-free.''\n       As reported in the January 2004 issue of Consumer Reports, \n     herbal supplements that are labeled `ephedra-free' are not \n     necessarily safer than ephedra. Many include similar central \n     nervous stimulants, such as synephrine-containing bitter \n     orange (citrus aurantium) that not only are structurally \n     similar to ephedrine, but also affect the body in similar \n     ways. Because there is no required pre-market safety \n     evaluation for those products, consumers have no assurance \n     that the problems experienced by ephedra users will not \n     continue with a switch to ephedra-free products.\n       We therefore commend you for crafting this amendment that \n     will better ensure that the military--and the broader \n     public--is informed about the potential harms that can\n\n[[Page S8638]]\n\n     result from the use of these products. Thank you again for \n     your sponsorship.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Janell Mayo Duncan,\n                               Legislative and Regulatory Counsel.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I report to my colleagues that my \namendment has been endorsed by the American Medical Association, the \nAmerican Dietetic Association, the American Osteopathic Association, \nConsumers Union, Center for Science in the Public Interest, the \nAmerican Society for Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics, as well as \ntwo individuals, Michelle Skinlo of Mattoon, IL, mother of 31-year-old \nHillary Spitz, who had a seizure in 2000 and continues to suffer long-\nterm debilitation because of ephedra, and Kevin Riggins of Lincoln, IL, \nfather of 16-year-old Sean Riggins, a high school football player who \ndied after taking ephedra. The tragedy of these families does not need \nto be replicated, certainly on the military bases, across America.\n  I urge my colleagues support my amendment.\n  Pursuant to my earlier request, I ask the amendment be set aside and \nwe return to the regular business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the regular order.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I very much need to accommodate Senators \non both sides of the aisle with a short unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield for that purpose.\n  Mr. WARNER. This is a matter the ranking member and I have worked on.\n  I ask unanimous consent that between the hours of 4:30 and 6:30 \ntonight the amendment by Mr. Lugar be brought up with 1 hour on each \nside, with the hour in opposition under the control of Mr. Kyl, with a \nrollcall vote immediately following.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, to clarify that, regardless of what is \npending, at 4:30, we will move to the Lugar amendment, and we will vote \non that amendment at 6:30, and then return to whatever the pending \nmatters are.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator. There are no second degrees.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Right.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry:\n  I wanted to make time for the Hutchison-Nelson amendment to come \nafter Senator Durbin and before the 4:30 amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to engage the Senator from Maine \nand the Senator from New Jersey. We have a unanimous consent request \nfrom our colleague from Texas. Would the Senator from Texas repeat that \nfor the Senator from Maine.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I was under the impression that \nSenator Nelson and I would be able to offer our sense-of-the-Senate \namendment following Senator Durbin.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator from Maine advise the chairman as to \nwhen you would resume your debate with the Senator from New Jersey?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I have offered a second-degree amendment. \nI have asked for the yeas and nays on it. I believe that the floor \nstaff is trying to set up the vote on the alternative approaches. It \nmay well be appropriate for the Senator from Texas to go ahead while we \nare considering those things.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank our colleague.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, we have a lot of amendments \nnow that have been set aside. If the Senator from Texas is asking that \nshe could introduce a sense-of-the-Senate amendment and put it in order \nand then it be set aside immediately and taken up at a later time, I \nwill have no objection. Because other amendments are waiting to be \ndisposed of, I could not agree that her amendment come ahead of other \namendments.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Whatever is the pleasure of the chairman and ranking \nmember.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask the Chair to restate the unanimous consent request \nwhich we are ready to accede to on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Consent has been granted for 2 hours of debate \non the Lugar amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. The Senator from Texas can state her request.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nNelson and I be able to offer our amendment following Senator Durbin \nand before Senator Lugar's amendment is considered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, my understanding of the \nrequest is that immediately following Senator Durbin, the Senators from \nTexas and Florida will be recognized simply to introduce a sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment, which would then be set aside, and then we would \nmove at 4:30 as previously authorized, and any time remaining between \nthe time they offer and set aside that amendment would then go to the \nSenator from Maine and the Senator from New Jersey to continue their \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1357\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for herself and \n     Mr. Nelson of Florida, proposes an amendment numbered 1357.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate with regard to manned \n                             space flight)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ------. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MANNED SPACE \n                   FLIGHT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) human spaceflight preeminence allows the United States \n     to project leadership around the world and forms an important \n     component of United States national security;\n       (2) continued development of human spaceflight in low-Earth \n     orbit, on the Moon, and beyond adds to the overall national \n     strategic posture;\n       (3) human spaceflight enables continued stewardship of the \n     region between the earth and the Moon--an area that is \n     critical and of growing national and international security \n     relevance;\n       (4) human spaceflight provides unprecedented opportunities \n     for the United States to lead peaceful and productive \n     international relationships with the world community in \n     support of United States security and geo-political \n     objectives;\n       (5) a growing number of nations are pursuing human \n     spaceflight and space-related capabilities, including China \n     and India;\n       (6) past investments in human spaceflight capabilities \n     represent a national resource that can be built upon and \n     leveraged for a broad range of purposes, including national \n     and economic security; and\n       (7) the industrial base and capabilities represented by the \n     Space Transportation System provide a critical dissimilar \n     launch capability for the nation.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that it is in the national security interest of the United \n     States to maintain uninterrupted preeminence in human \n     spaceflight.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, \nSenator Nelson of Florida, to offer an amendment expressing the sense \nof the Senate regarding the critical nature of human spaceflight to \nAmerica's national security.\n  The day after the scheduled space shuttle launch was canceled last \nweek, there were two news items that were largely overlooked by many \nwho were focused on what might have caused the sensor failure which was \nthe basis for stopping the countdown to launch.\n  One of these was an announcement by the Chinese space agency that \nthey planned to launch their second manned spaceflight in October \naboard their Shenzhou spacecraft. The other was the announcement by the \nRussian space agency that they were initiating full-scale development \nof their clipper space vehicle, a small shuttle-like space vehicle \ncapable of taking several people into orbit, a sort of winged \nsupplement to their existing Soyuz launch vehicles.\n  Whether these announcements were calculated to remind the world that \nthe space shuttle and the United States do not represent the only \navenue by which humans can fly to space is debatable. My purpose in \nmentioning them, however, is to remind my colleagues that space is not \nthe exclusive province of the United States, that there is increasing \ninterest among technically advanced nations of the world in developing \nand maintaining the ability to conduct human spaceflight missions. Not \nall of those nations share the same values and\n\n[[Page S8639]]\n\nprinciples as our country, and they may not have the same motivations \nfor advancing their independent capability for human spaceflight.\n  Space represents the new modern definition of the high ground that \nhas historically been a significant factor in defense strategy. \nVirtually all of our military actions in recent years have made \ndramatic use of space-based assets in conducting those important \noperations in the course of pursuing national security and foreign \npolicy. Satellite targeting, surveillance and intelligence gathering, \nuse of radio frequencies and communications all result from our ability \nto explore in space.\n  In recent years, we have witnessed a growing entrepreneurial interest \nin developing access to space for humans and cargo. We recently passed \nout of the Commerce Committee a NASA reauthorization bill which will \nprovide guidance for our space program at a critical time, a time when \nwe have multiple demands on limited resources.\n  During our consideration of this bill and during hearings, it became \nclear that we must think of manned spaceflight in terms of national \nsecurity, as well as science and exploration. For these reasons, I \nbelieve it is important that in the context of this Defense \nauthorization bill, we express the sense of the Senate that we \nrecognize the important and vital role of human spaceflight in the \nfurtherance of our national security interests, and that we reaffirm \nour commitment to retaining our Nation's leadership role in the growing \ninternational human spaceflight community of nations.\n  Great nations discover and explore. Great nations cross oceans, \nsettle frontiers, renew their heritage and spirits, and create greater \nfreedom and opportunity for the world. Great nations must also remain \non the front edge of technologically advanced programs to maintain \ntheir security edge.\n  Today we recognize one such program. We have an international outpost \nin space. We are on a path to establish a permanent presence on the \nMoon. Let us stand united to recognize the inexorable link and \nimportance of human spaceflight in our national security.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this important statement that says \nkeeping our dominance in space is a matter of national security for our \ncountry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I join with my colleague, the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas, who serves as the Chair of our \nScience and Space Subcommittee and of which I have the privilege of \nbeing the ranking member. The timing of this amendment is propitious \nbecause the problem on the shuttle has been found and the count will \nstart shortly. Next Tuesday morning at 10:39 a.m., if all goes as well \nas we certainly hope, we will see the space shuttle launch into the \nFlorida sky after having been down for 2\\1/2\\ years after the mistakes \nthat should not have been made that took down Columbia, and that 18 \nyears earlier had taken down Challenger.\n  We have a new leader, Michael Griffith, and he is doing a good job. I \ncan tell you that the team is ready and they have scrubbed this orbiter \nand this stack as it has never been scrubbed before. Even though \nspaceflight is risky business, they are ready to go. It is an \nacceptable risk because of the benefits we gather from it.\n  What this amendment does--and I want to say a word about our two \ncolleagues who lead our Armed Services Committee who I think will \naccept this amendment--it simply says: It is the sense of the Senate \nthat it is in the national interest of the United States to \nmaintain uninterrupted preeminence in human spaceflight.\n\n  Why? Why are we saying that? Because we could be in a posture that if \nthe space shuttle is shut down in 2010, which is the timeline, and if \nwe did not soon thereafter come with a new vehicle to have human access \nto space, the new what is called the crew exploration vehicle, which \nwill be a follow-on--it may be in part a derivative of the shuttle \nstack vehicle, but it will be more like a capsule harkening back to the \nold days where you have a blunt end that has an ablative heat shield \nthat will burn off in the fiery heat of reentry--that if we don't watch \nout and we have a hiatus between when we shut down the space shuttle \nand when the new vehicle flies, one originally that was planned by NASA \nto be 4 years, which meant it was going to be 6, 7, or 8 years, then we \ndon't have an American vehicle to get into space.\n  If that is not bad enough, who knows what the geopolitics of planet \nEarth is going to be in the years 2011 to 2018. We may find that those \nvehicles we rely on to get today, for example, to the space station, \nwhen we are down with the American vehicle, may be aligned with \nsomebody else. That is why we want to make sure we have that other \nvehicle ready about the time we shut down the space shuttle so we will \nhave human access to this international space station and reap the \nbenefits, once it is fully constructed, of all the experimentation and \nthe processing of materials we can uniquely do in the microgravity of \nEarth's orbit.\n  That is the importance, in this Senator's mind, of this resolution.\n  Before I turn back to my colleague, I want to say a word about our \nleadership on the Armed Services Committee, and I want the Senator from \nVirginia to hear this. I want him to know what a great example he and \nthe Senator from Michigan set for the rest of us in the way these two \nSenators work together so problems that could be so thorny are usually \nironed out, especially in dealing with such matters of great importance \nto our country, such as the defense interests of our country.\n  The way they have worked this is nothing short of miraculous. I would \ncall them Merlin the Magicians. I thank them for the leadership they \nhave shown us.\n  I associate myself with remarks made earlier on the TRICARE amendment \nfor the Guard and Reserves. So often my colleagues have heard me speak \nwith such great pride about the Florida National Guard. They were first \ninto Iraq. They were in Iraq before the war started because they were \nin there with the special operations troops. For us to give them the \nhealth care through TRICARE is exceptionally important.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida. I am the Chair and he the ranking member on the Commerce \nSubcommittee on Space and Science. I so appreciate the opportunity to \nexpress this sense-of-the-Senate amendment. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport it because I do believe that human spaceflight is as much a \npart of our national security as anything we do. We see the preeminence \nwe have in our military because of precision-guided missiles, because \nof the ability to execute surveillance and intelligence gathering to an \nextent we never have been able to before we explored space and were \nable to put satellites there.\n  The idea that we would consider a hiatus in our opportunities to put \nhumans in space is one that is unacceptable to me and to my ranking \nmember. We hope the sense-of-the-Senate amendment will be adopted to \nacknowledge and assure that space exploration is shown to be a part of \nour national security interests. It is essential that we not, in any \nway, ever let our eye get off that ball, that we must have dominance in \nspace if we are going to keep our preeminence in national defense.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, may I just make one further \ncomment? It is interesting at the very time we are talking about space, \nwe have America's true national hero on the Senate floor, a former \ncolleague of the Senate, John Glenn, who blazed the trail for \neverybody. When he climbed on that Atlas rocket, he knew there was a \n20-percent chance that it was going to blow up. Yet that is the kind of \nrisk that he took so that all of us in America that followed could have \nthese wonderful benefits.\n  I want to note the presence on the floor of former Senator Glenn.\n  (Applause.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first let me say how delighted that I know \nI am--I know every Member who is on the floor now is, and every Member \nwould be if they were on the floor--just taking a look at a dear friend \nand a former colleague of ours who just walked on the floor. When John \nGlenn\n\n[[Page S8640]]\n\nis in our presence, it lifts all of us. The way he lifted up this \nNation, he still provides a great lift to each and every one of us. And \nhis beloved wife and our beloved friend, Annie, does the same when she \nis at his side. So it is great to see former Senator Glenn again.\n  I also want to thank Senator Nelson for his remarks. I must say we \nare blessed--and I know Senator Warner feels the same way I do--that \nthe members of our committee work so well together, but we are \nparticularly blessed when we have members such as Bill Nelson of \nFlorida who fight for so many issues not just for Florida but for the \nNation.\n  He mentioned TRICARE. He has been on that issue as long as anybody I \ncan remember. As it happened, we passed that perhaps when he was not \neven on the Senate floor today, but I know he has been a strong \nsupporter and his advocacy has made all the difference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join my colleague in thanking former \nSenator Glenn for coming back and joining the longstanding tradition of \nthe Senate, and a proper one. A former Senator is always welcome back \non the floor. There is the desk at which he sat these many years, and \nas a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  I never heard about the blowup thing before, but I can say I have \nseen the Senator sit in that chair and blow up this place many times in \nhis long distinguished career and fight for the things in which he \nbelieved. We send the best to you, dear friend, and your lovely wife \nAnnie, and wish you well. Return many times.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the chairman would yield, there is an issue on the \nfloor today, in addition to the pending sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nabout keeping men in space. We have a pending amendment that is going \nto be offered by Senator Lugar that has to do with nonproliferation, \nNunn-Lugar, trying to make it possible for us to see if we cannot \nreduce the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. I \nthink the Member of the Senate who probably pioneered in the effort to \nprevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction was John Glenn, \nwho happens to be on the Senate floor at this particular moment. \nSenator Lugar is now here. Under our UC, he will be offering his \namendment. But the effort of Senator Lugar to try to control weapons of \nmass destruction, to lock them up, to make sure that there are no loose \nnukes, that Senator Nunn and so many others joined in, was actually a \nsubject which was very close to the heart and very much on the lips of \nJohn Glenn when he was here as a Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this point in time under the UC, there \nis 2 hours equally divided between the distinguished Senator from \nIndiana, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. Kyl, who will soon be on the floor, and \nmyself.\n  I would say to Senator Lugar, I find myself in a bit of an awkward \nposition at this time in opposition because I remember the breakfast \nthat Sam Nunn had in the Armed Services Committee office when the first \nconcept of Nunn-Lugar was adopted and how grateful all of us are for \nthe Senator's continued service in these many years ensuing to make \nthis very important program effective not only for this country, the \ncitizens of Russia, and the former Soviet Union but also the world. I \nthank the Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1380\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIndiana is recognized to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend, John \nWarner, for his very thoughtful comments about the origin of the \nprogram and the initial bipartisan breakfast of Senators that in the \nlatter stages of the 1991 session made possible the cooperative threat \nreduction legislation.\n  I am honored that Senator John Glenn and Annie are likewise \nwitnessing the program today, along with our distinguished colleagues, \nSenator Warner and Senator Levin, who have meant so much to all of us \nin formulating the defense policy.\n  I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of myself, Senators Levin, \nObama, Lott, Jeffords, Nelson of Florida, Voinovich, Dodd, Leahy, \nNelson of Nebraska, Murkowski, Kennedy, Chafee, Collins, Alexander, \nAllen, Salazar, Hagel, DeWine, Reed, Dorgan, Mikulski, Biden, Stabenow, \nBingaman, Akaka, and Lautenberg, and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar], for himself, Mr. \n     Levin, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Obama, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Nelson of \n     Florida, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Nelson of \n     Nebraska, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Chafee, Ms. \n     Collins, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Allen, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Hagel, \n     Mr. DeWine, Mr. Reed, Mr. Dorgan, Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Mikulski, \n     Mr. Biden, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Akaka, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Enzi, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1380.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To improve authorities to address urgent nonproliferation \n         crises and United States nonproliferation operations)\n\n       On page 302, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1306. REMOVAL OF CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON PROVISION OF \n                   COOPERATIVE THREAT REDUCTION ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) Repeal of Restrictions.--\n       (1) Soviet nuclear threat reduction act of 1991.--Section \n     211(b) of the Soviet Nuclear Threat Reduction Act of 1991 \n     (title II of Public Law 102-228; 22 U.S.C. 2551 note) is \n     repealed.\n       (2) Cooperative threat reduction act of 1993.--Section \n     1203(d) of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 1993 \n     (title XII of Public Law 103-160; 22 U.S.C. 5952(d)) is \n     repealed.\n       (3) Russian chemical weapons destruction facilities.--\n     Section 1305 of the National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2000 (Public Law 106-65; 22 U.S.C. 5952 note) is \n     repealed.\n       (b) Inapplicability of other restrictions.--\n       Section 502 of the Freedom for Russia and Emerging Eurasian \n     Democracies and Open Markets Support Act of 1992 (Public Law \n     102-511; 106 Stat. 3338; 22 U.S.C. 5852) shall not apply to \n     any Cooperative Threat Reduction program.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I likewise would like to ask that Senator \nFeinstein and Senator Enzi be added as cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, my amendment is based upon S. 313, the \nNunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 2005, which I first \noffered in November 2004 and reintroduced this January. It is focused \non facilitating implementation of the program and removing some of the \nself-imposed restrictions that complicate or delay the destruction of \nweapons of mass destruction. By self-imposed, I mean restrictions \nimposed by our Government on our programs which bring about delay, \nsometimes very severe delay, at a time that we take seriously the war \non terrorism, and the need, as a matter of fact, to bring under control \nmaterials and weapons of mass destruction as rapidly and as certainly \nas possible.\n  In essence, I am going to argue in various forms during the next few \nminutes that the United States of America, contrary to almost all \ncommon sense, imposes upon itself the need to examine year by year \nspecifically Russian cooperation, Russian money, whether moneys are \nfungible; that is, moneys that are spent by the United States to work \nwith Russians to destroy weapons of mass destruction in Russia and \nelsewhere, whether we are, in fact, serious about this.\n  If we came to a conclusion that for some reason the Russians had not \nspent precisely the amount of money that we think they ought to spend, \ndoes any Senator believe we at that point should stop taking warheads \noff of missiles, should stop trying to get control of weapons of mass \ndestruction in the chemical and biological areas? Of course not. We \nhave constructed for 14 years an extraordinary situation in which from \ntime to time Senators, some of whom had come new to the floor, were not \nhere during the end of the Cold War or any of the Cold War for that \nmatter, and said simply: We are suspicious of Russians. We are not sure \nwe ought to be helping them at all. Why should they not destroy 40,000 \nmetric tons of chemical weapons? Why should they not pay for it? They \nmade their bed. Let them sleep in it. In essence, if they do not \ndestroy it, that is their problem.\n\n[[Page S8641]]\n\n  Long ago, as Senator Warner pointed out, we found it was our problem. \nThe 13,300 nuclear warheads were aimed at us, sometimes 10 warheads to \na missile--multiple reentry vehicles they were called. That is the \nproblem. We thought, as a matter of fact, for our safety, after a half \ncentury, it was useful to work with Russians who came to visit with \nSenator Nunn and with me and who asked for our help. They said: We have \na problem in Russia, but you have a problem, too. Those warheads are \naimed at your cities and they are still up there on the missiles, and \nthe tactical warheads are still out there, and privateers as the Red \nArmy breaks up could cart them off on flat bed trucks to Iran, Iraq, \nLibya, wherever there is a market for them.\n  As a matter of fact, the Wall Street Journal helpfully published an \narticle about how one could take a missile out on a flat bed truck. So \nthis was not rocket science. Even at that time people were still \nputting on stipulations.\n  Why does that matter? It matters because at the beginning of each new \nbudget year the President of the United States and various agencies \ninvolved have to go through thousands of bureaucratic hours examining \nall of the stipulations that have been added by some Member of the \nHouse or Senate over the years to try to divine whether there has been \nproper compliance.\n  At the end of the day, the law now states--and in fairness, the \nSenate Armed Services Committee has provided--that there will be a \npermanent waiver authority.\n  After all of these thousands of hours of bureaucratic hassling, the \nPresident can finally say: Listen, we are in a war on terror. Let's get \non with it. But, apparently, the President would be hard-pressed to do \nthat before going through all the machinations.\n  I am just saying, it is time to take seriously weapons of mass \ndestruction, materials of mass destruction. It is time to get over the \nthought that somehow or another the Russians may or may not be \ncooperative because the fact is, it is our program, cooperation with \nthe Russians, that has brought about at this point some remarkable \nresults.\n  Let me recite some of those results. During the last 14 years, the \nNunn-Lugar program has deactivated or destroyed 6,624 nuclear warheads; \n580 ICBMs; 477 ICBM silos; 21 ICBM mobile missile launchers; 147 \nbombers--these were the transcontinental bombers that could have \ncarried nuclear weapons across the oceans to us, and they have been \ndestroyed--789 nuclear air-to-surface missiles; 420 submarine missile \nlaunchers; 546 submarine launched missiles; 28 nuclear submarines; 194 \nnuclear test tunnels.\n  Perhaps most importantly, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan, who \nemerged from the former Soviet Union situation as the third, fourth, \nand eighth largest nuclear weapons powers in the world, all three are \nnow free as a result of the cooperative threat reduction program, the \nso-called Nunn-Lugar program, of nuclear weapons.\n  This did not happen easily. In each of the years in which these \ndestructive efforts with regard to the former Soviet ICBMs and cruise \nmissiles and what have you came about, there had to be competitive \nbidding conducted by the Department of Defense. In every year, this was \ndelayed because, once again, each of the stipulations added by a \nSenator or Member of the House had to be examined and had to be met.\n  In some years, in the early parts of the program, waivers were not \navailable; waivers never occurred. The fiscal year ran out and nothing \nhappened in many programs. I find it incomprehensible why, at this \nparticular point in history, after 14 years of this experience, there \nare still Members who would argue we still should go through the \nthousands of hours of bureaucratic hassles every year, even if there is \na Presidential waiver at the end of the trail that says: Call it off. \nLet's get on with the war on terror.\n  It seems to be almost a theological bent of some Members, who I \nsuspect have a feeling that anything involving Russians or recipients \nof weapons of mass destruction or materials requires a whole lot of \nexamination before we take the active steps to work with them to \ndestroy the material.\n  In any event, I commend the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nmy friend, Senator Warner, and the ranking member, Senator Levin, for \nthe important legislative efforts they have made. They have been \nsteadfast in their support of the program throughout the years. They \nplayed critical roles in the success of the program. This year they \nhave brought to the floor a bill that contains full funding for Nunn-\nLugar programs, some $415 million. They also embraced one of the most \nimportant elements of my earlier bill, S. 313, namely the transfer of \nauthority from the President to the Secretary of Defense for approval \nof Nunn-Lugar projects outside the former Soviet Union.\n  In 2003, Congress authorized the President to use up to $50 million \nin Nunn-Lugar funds for operations outside the former Soviet Union. The \nlegislation requires the President to certify that the utilization of \nthe Nunn-Lugar funds outside the former Soviet Union will address a \ndangerous proliferation threat or achieve a longstanding \nnonproliferation opportunity in a short period of time.\n  President Bush used this authority to authorize the destruction of 16 \ntons of chemical weapons in Albania. Let me say the Albanian experience \nis instructive, not only because good results occurred, but the very \ncircumstances require the Senate, it seems to me, to focus on the world \nin which we live. Word came to officers in the Pentagon, in the \nCooperative Threat Reduction Program, from authorities in Albania last \nyear, 2004, that weapons of mass destruction were in Albania, \nspecifically chemical weapons of mass destruction. This was a surprise \nto our authorities, quite apart from Members of this body. I was \nprivileged to accompany members of our Armed Forces and members of the \nAlbanian Armed Forces on a trip into the mountains outside of Tirana, \nthe capital city of Albania. Up in the mountains we came upon \ncanisters. We saw a number of them. As a matter of fact, by the time \nthe compilation was completed, 16 tons of chemical weapons, nerve gas, \nwere discovered in Albania.\n  We had a program, because we had adopted it a short time before, in \nwhich we knew that $50 million might be allocated outside the former \nSoviet Union. Obviously we were going to need that program. But the \ndilemma immediately was that a number of signoffs was required. Members \nwill recall we were in an election year in 2004. We were able to get \nsignatures ultimately from the Secretary of State. It was very \ndifficult for people at the White House to accumulate the papers and \nrequirements for President Bush to sign off, but eventually he did. But \nnevertheless, it was roughly a 60-day period from time of discovery.\n  In this particular instance, a $20 million program of neutralization \nwill eventually take care of that risk, and it is a very substantial \none. But my point is it will not be the last one.\n  I commend the Armed Services Committee for recognizing the need for \nexpedited review and decisionmaking when it comes to these emergency \nsituations. This may be an instance in the war against terror in which \nwe had success, and we had success beyond that. While we were up in the \nmountains, the Albanian soldiers took us by sheds in which there were \n79 Manpad missiles. As part of the good will of that expedition, they \nagreed to destroy those in September of 2004, and they did so.\n  Furthermore, as another feature, the next day when we were out of the \nmountains, in the office of the Minister of Defense of Albania, he \ntalked about his plans for a military academy, a modest beginning at \nleast of training of young officers, with one of the skills to be \nrequired a facility in the English language. In essence, they wanted to \ncontinue talking to us and continue working with us so there would be \nfewer and fewer surprises.\n  I would contend in the war against terror we are going to have many \nsurprises and we better have very rapid responses. I thank the drafters \nof the legislation we are considering today for their consideration of \nthis.\n  Let me say the problem of the overall situation in Russia remains as \nconfounding as before. It is a peculiar thought that some of the \nprograms of the Cooperative Reduction Program that occur in the \nDepartment of State and Department of Energy do not have these \nstipulations. They are literally a hangover from the first Nunn-Lugar\n\n[[Page S8642]]\n\ndebates in 1981--people suspicious of Russia, still suspicious of \nRussia, and believing, because they are exercising their suspicions of \nthe Russians, that somehow this has something to do with destruction of \nweapons of mass destruction. We have to get over that and that is the \npurpose of this debate today, to try to get on and try to understand \nthe world in which we live, including Russia.\n\n  The question finally is, what national security benefit do these so-\ncalled certification requirements provide the American people? Do these \nconditions I would advocate terminating make it easier or harder to \neliminate weapons of mass destruction in Russia--or elsewhere, for that \nmatter? Do the conditions make it more likely or less likely that \nweapons are going to be eliminated? It would be hard to argue logically \nthat putting more and more conditions upon action help us in destroying \nweapons and materials of mass destruction. They obviously hinder us. In \nsome years they stopped us for months. We did this to ourselves. We \ncontinue to do it to ourselves, year after year.\n  Congress imposed an additional six conditions on construction of the \nchemical weapons destruction program at Shchuch'ye, after imposing all \nof the other conditions with regard to nuclear weapons in Russia. These \nconditions include, No. 1, full and accurate Russian declaration on the \nsize of its chemical weapons stockpile. Experts have argued for 14 \nyears over whether Russia has specifically 40,000 metric tons of \nchemical weapons or something more or less, and we will be arguing \nabout it every year so long as we have a stipulation that we have to \nhave this argument. Some will claim that Russia has never made a full \ndeclaration of all of it. But, nevertheless, it is not a good reason \nfor stopping the program, because we are dissatisfied with whether the \nRussians have come clean on every pound--or ton, for that matter--when \nthere are 40,000 metric tons we know of that need to be destroyed.\n  No. 2, every year we have to talk about allocation by Russia of at \nleast $25 million--its equivalent in Russian currency--to chemical \nweapons elimination. We also argue about whether Russia has developed a \npractical plan for destroying the stockpile of nerve agents and whether \nenactment of a law by Russia that provides for elimination of all nerve \nagents at a single site is valid.\n  We have been arguing about the single site problem for quite a while. \nWe have at this point, I suspect, a general summation that probably \nchemical weapons will be destroyed at three sites. I simply point these \nthings out because in order each year to start up the program, all of \nthese arguments must go back through the bureaucracy. Somebody must \ncertify that the Russians have, in fact, appropriated $25 million, that \nthey have made a full declaration--40,000 metric tons or more; that we \nwish they would do it all in one place, and we are still arguing with \nthem over that.\n  In essence, what is the alternative? Let us say that for some reason \nsomeone contends at the time Russians have 41,000 tons. Is this a good \nreason to delay any destruction, any further security in our benefit? \nNot at all. That is the essence of what we are talking about today--\nstipulations that long ago were obsolete, were, if not a figment of \nsomeone's imagination on the floor of the Senate, a deliberate, \nprovocative act to get an argument going with the Russians that could \nnever in fact be consummated. I suggest that some have said, well, at \nworst the certification process is simply an annoyance; that by this \ntime in history we go through the process every year and the \npredictable arguments are made, the thousands of hours are spent, \nreports are filed, they are bumped up from one desk to the next, and \nthen ultimately at the end of the trail the President waives the whole \nbusiness and we get on with the program.\n  While well-intentioned, these conditions, in my judgment, seriously \ndelay and complicate constructive efforts to destroy weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  I get back to this again. If the No. 1 security threat facing our \ncountry is weapons of mass destruction, the security of those weapons, \nthe destruction of those weapons, we cannot permit delays in our \nresponse.\n  I was interested last year, as I know you were, Mr. President, in a \nvery vigorous debate between President George Bush and our colleague, \nSenator John Kerry of Massachusetts. But one thing on which the \nPresident and Senator Kerry agreed was that the No. 1 national threat \nwas what we are talking about today: weapons of mass destruction, \nproliferation of those into the hands of terrorists. They agreed this \nis the essence of what all of our defense business is about, \nultimately. All I am suggesting is, given the urgency of this, the \nillogic of delaying, deliberately delaying on our part, \nbureaucratically, year after year, even if finally, as I say, at the \nend of the day we give the President the right to waive the whole thing \nand say, enough of this, get on with it--we must finally come to grips, \nand this amendment does, and that is what the argument is about today--\nto eliminate these barriers that are self-imposed and that I believe \nare destructive to our national security.\n  Let me make a point. In 2002--to get the facts--the Bush \nadministration withheld certification for Russia because of the \nconcerns about chemical and biological weapons arenas. President Bush \nrecognized the predicament. The President said, How can we get out of \nthis predicament? And he requested waiver authority for the \ncongressionally imposed conditions. While awaiting a temporary waiver \nto be authorized in law, the new Nunn-Lugar projects were stalled, and \nno new contracts could be finalized from April 16, 2002, to August 9, \n2002. This delay--and this is just 3 years ago--caused numerous \ndisarmament projects in Russia to be put on hold, including, \nspecifically, installation of security enhancements at 10 nuclear \nweapons storage sites, initiation of the dismantlement of two strategic \nmissile submarines, 30 submarine launched ballistic missiles, and \ninitiation of the dismantlement of the SS-24 rail mobile and the SS-25 \nroad mobile ICBMs and launchers--all of these deliberately delayed by \nus. We did this ourselves. This is what these restrictions are about. \nClearly, these projects were in our national security interest at the \nbeginning of April and August when we finally got on with it. But they \nwere delayed because of self-imposed conditions and the bureaucratic \nredtape that we have continually perpetrated year after year after \nyear.\n\n  The second period of delays began when the fiscal year started, \nOctober 1, 2002--back into it all over again--with the expiration of \nthe temporary waiver that lasted only until September 30, 2002. Again, \nU.S. national security suffered with the postponement of critical \ndismantlement of security activities for some 6 additional weeks until \nthe Congress acted.\n  Unfortunately, the events of 2002, although they are fairly recent, \nare reminiscent of what occurred in the years prior to that. They are \nthe rule. In some years, as a matter of fact, Nunn-Lugar funds were not \navailable for expenditure until more than half of the fiscal year had \npassed and weapons of mass destruction slated for dismantlement awaited \nthe U.S. bureaucratic process. This means the program during those \ntimes was denied funds for large portions of the year. The bureaucracy \ncontinued to generate reams of paper and yet ultimately produced an \noutcome that was never in doubt; namely, that it is in the national \nsecurity interest of our country to destroy weapons of mass destruction \nin Russia and elsewhere.\n  Let me say, finally, Mr. President, this certification consumes not \nonly hundreds of man-hours in the Defense Department but in the State \nDepartment, in the intelligence community, and the energy community. \nObviously the time could better be spent tackling the problems of \nproliferation where, in fact, the materials are--where are the Albanias \nof the future; identifying the next A.Q. Kahn in Pakistan and that \nnetwork, locating hidden stocks of chemical and biological weapons, as \nmany of us have attempted to do.\n  Mr. President, let me add as a personal thought, it is apparent, I \nsuspect, with the urgency with which I approach this that I take it \nseriously, and I do, and I think a majority of Senators do. I plan to \nvisit Russia again in August, as I have each year for the last 14. I \nplan to visit Ukraine. I hope to go to Azerbaijan. I hope to go to \nother countries that I think might develop\n\n[[Page S8643]]\n\nduring those trips. It has been my experience that while in Russia, \nRussians came to me and asked would I like to visit Sevmash, Sevmash \nbeing where the Typhoon submarines are. No American has been invited to \nSevmash. There have been no invitations to anyone to destroy six \nTyphoon submarines. I said: Of course, I would like to go to Sevmash. \nAnd I did go to Sevmash. Russians took pictures of submarines, \nincluding one of me standing in front of a large Typhoon, and in due \ncourse they sent the pictures to me. I must say, this was the best view \nthat our authorities had had of a Typhoon in some time.\n  Now, the fact is, it is cooperative threat reduction. There was no \nparticular reason for the Typhoons to come into play at that particular \nmoment, nor for other submarine programs on other occasions. But the \nnature of the dialog, in fact, if there is engagement, has been to \nbring about revelations and finally additional cooperation.\n  I make that point because the gist of all these controls is a \nsupposition that the Russians will be uncooperative, that they will \nhide what they have, and in some cases they have. On another occasion, \nI tried to get into a bioweapons situation and was denied that access. \nThey told us the Air Force plane could take off, but it would not be \nable to land. In due course they changed their minds but not totally, \nand I took this up with the Defense Minister in Moscow. He admitted \nbureaucracy in Russia sometimes creates problems for him and for \nRussians who want to be cooperative.\n  I mention these situations anecdotally because as far as I am \nconcerned there is a hands-on operation. This is something personal. I \nhave been there, I have seen, I have worked, and this is why, perhaps, \nI become so infuriated with people who are determined, \nbureaucratically, to block it, year after year to delay it, until \nfinally out of exasperation, we have adopted waivers so that somehow we \ncan get on with our own national security.\n  But this is the debate today. Those who want to get rid of the \nbureaucracy and the stipulations will vote in favor of the Lugar \namendment, and those who want to keep all of this can vote against it, \nand we will have an up-or-down vote because this is a critical national \nsecurity objective. I cannot put it more directly or more simply.\n  The delays have given on occasion, if there were those in Russia who \nwished to hide whatever they have, an opportunity simply to blame the \nUnited States for slow program implementation as we took the spotlight \noff of failure on the other side with our friends in Russia. Therefore, \nMr. President, I am hopeful that this amendment will have very strong \nsupport. I am grateful for Senators who have, in fact, cosponsored the \namendment as well as the original bill.\n  I would conclude by indicating that during my talk today, Senators \nRockefeller, McCain, Bennett, Lautenberg, Murray, and Schumer have all \nasked to be added as cosponsors. I thank each of these Senators for \ntheir cosponsorship.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nSecretary Rice, and this follows direct questioning of the Secretary \nduring her confirmation about her support of this very objective we are \ntalking about today. And she does support what I want to do.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                       The Secretary of State,\n\n                                         Washington, June 3, 2005.\n     Hon. Richard G. Lugar,\n     Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate.\n       Mr. Chairman: I am writing in response to your March 28 \n     letter urging support for legislation that would repeal the \n     Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) certification \n     requirements.\n       During my confirmation hearings, I stated that flexibility \n     in administering these extremely important programs would be \n     most welcome, and that the Administration supports \n     legislation to remove the certification requirements for \n     provision of CTR assistance. The Administration believes that \n     these programs are extremely important to U.S. national \n     security and to building a cooperative security relationship \n     with Russia and the other states in Eurasia.\n       As a former student of the Soviet Union and of the Soviet \n     military, I can think of nothing more important than \n     proceeding with the safe dismantlement of the Soviet arsenal, \n     securing nuclear weapons facilities, and destroying their \n     chemical weapons. We will continue to press the Russians to \n     provide greater accountability for their chemical weapons and \n     for increased transparency of their biological weapons \n     program.\n       The Administration is also willing to consider other \n     alternatives to achieve flexibility in administering these \n     programs. One possible alternative is included in the April \n     7, 2005, Defense Department transmittal to Congress of its \n     national defense authorization bill and would renew \n     permanently the authority under which existing certification \n     requirements may be waived.\n       I greatly appreciate the leadership you have shown on these \n     important issues and look forward to working with you on \n     these programs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Condoleezza Rice.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Finally, I will submit additional letters that have come \nfrom other officials of our Government, from the National Security \nCouncil and the Department of Defense.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wish to commend my very dear and longtime friend, \nSenator Lugar--as I said, I was here when this program was initiated--\nand our esteemed former colleague, Sam Nunn, for their vision and work \nin this very valuable program.\n  Through the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program the United States \nhas, since 1991, been providing assistance to states of the former \nSoviet Union to help them eliminate and safeguard weapons of mass \ndestruction and related infrastructure materials. These programs helped \nto eliminate large Cold War stockpiles and dangerous weapons that were \nno longer needed. Today, this program is an important element in the \ncontinuance of our strategy to keep weapons of mass destruction and the \nknow-how from falling into hands antithetical to the interests of those \nwho are trying to fight terrorism and preserve freedom.\n  When Congress first authorized the Cooperative Threat Reduction \nProgram, an important element of the authorizing legislation was the \ninclusion of certain conditions that must be met before a country could \nreceive CTR assistance from the United States.\n  I was a key author of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 1993, \nwhich reauthorized the original Nunn-Lugar program. I was a strong \nadvocate of including the requirement that, for each recipient nation \nof CTR funds, the President certify that the recipient nation is \ncommitted to:\n  making substantial investment of its resources for dismantling or \ndestroying its WMD;\n  foregoing any military modernization program that exceeds legitimate \ndefense requirements and foregoing the replacement of destroyed WMD;\n  foregoing any use in new nuclear weapons of fissionable or other \ncomponents of destroyed nuclear weapons;\n  facilitating U.S. verification of any weapons destruction carried out \nthrough the CTR program;\n  complying with all relevant arms control agreements; and\n  observing internationally recognized human rights, including the \nprotection of minorities.\n  I believe these conditions remain as relevant and important today as \nthey were in 1993. They provide the Congress and the public relevant \ninformation about the countries that are to receive taxpayer-funded \nassistance for eliminating and safeguarding weapons of mass \ndestruction. The conditions help provide us confidence that U.S. tax \ndollars will be well spent in countries that are committed to right-\nsizing their militaries, complying with arms control agreements, \nproviding transparency regarding how CTR assistance is used, and \nrespecting human rights.\n  These certification requirements do not impede the provision of CTR \nassistance. For several years now, Congress has provided the President \nwith waiver authority so that even if one or more of the certifications \ncannot be made for a particular country, the President may provide CTR \nassistance to that country if he certifies it is in the national \ninterest to do so.\n  The current waiver authority will expire in September 2005. That is \nwhy in this bill we have included a provision that would make permanent \nthe President's authority to waive, on an annual basis, the conditions \non provision of CTR assistance when he judges it is in the national \nsecurity interest to do so.\n  This provision for permanent waiver authority for the CTR programs \nthat is\n\n[[Page S8644]]\n\nin our bill is what was submitted in the President's budget request to \nCongress. Only subsequently, on June 3, 2005, Secretary Rice wrote to \nSenator Lugar stating that the Administration supports legislation to \nremove the certification requirements for provision of CTR assistance. \nHer letter went on to state that the administration is also willing to \nconsider alternatives including the OMB-cleared legislative request \nfrom the Department of Defense for a provision to renew permanently the \nauthority under which existing certification requirements may be \nwaived. So the administration does not oppose the existing \ncongressionally-mandated certification requirements, so long as there \nremains a waiver provision.\n  Senator Lugar's amendment would also repeal the conditions Congress \nplaced on the provision of CTR assistance to Russia for chemical \ndemilitarization activities. Those conditions were established in the \nFY 2000 National Defense Authorization Act. They required the Secretary \nof Defense to certify that Russia has:\n  provided a full and accurate accounting of its chemical weapons \nstockpile;\n  demonstrated a commitment to commit $25 million annually to chemical \nweapons elimination;\n  developed a practical plan for destroying its stockpile of nerve \nagents;\n  agreed to destroy or convert two existing chemical weapons production \nfacilities; and\n  demonstrated a commitment from the international community to fund \nand build infrastructure needed to support and operate the chemical \nweapons destruction facility in Russia.\n  For several years the Congress decided not to support the provision \nof CTR assistance for chemical weapons destruction in Russia. It was \nprecisely the inclusion of these conditions in the authorizing language \nthat persuaded the Congress to resume U.S. CTR assistance for this \nimportant endeavor. These conditions relevant to the chemical weapons \ndestruction program in Russia also have a waiver provision, so that the \nassistance can continue in the absence of certification if the \nPresident deems it in the national interest.\n  I feel strongly that the eligibility requirements and conditions for \nCTR assistance are entirely appropriate and should not be repealed. \nThey remain an important element in assuring the American taxpayer that \nCTR dollars are being expended wisely and that the underlying aims of \nthe CTR program are in fact being embraced by the recipient countries. \nThis is essential to maintaining strong public support for CTR.\n  The waiver authority ensures that even in cases where a country does \nnot meet all the eligibility requirements, the President has the \nauthority to provide CTR assistance if it is in the national security \ninterest to do so.\n  I urge my colleagues not to support Senator Lugar's amendment to \nrepeal the conditions and eligibility requirements for the CTR program. \nWe all share the goal of supporting programs like CTR that can help \nkeep dangerous WMD, and technology and know how, from slipping out of \nthe countries of the former Soviet Union. I continue to believe that \nthe certification requirements are useful in helping to maintain public \nconfidence in the CTR program.\n  I say to my good friend, when we initiated these criteria, it was \ndone because the American public never fully quite understood how we \ncould require their tax dollars, which were so badly needed for schools \nand medical needs and innumerable requirements in this country, be \ngiven to countries which ostensibly, if they wanted to squeeze their \nown budgets, might well obtain the funds to do it by themselves. But I \nthink it was right for this country to step forward. In the history of \nthis country beginning, really, with the Marshall Plan, we have gone to \nthe aid of other nations, and we have been the beneficiaries, as I \nstated in my opening remarks, of the success to date of the Nunn-Lugar \nprogram. But still it seems to me that we have an obligation on behalf \nof the American taxpayers who continue to willingly give their dollars \nto this important program to have in place certain criteria that must \nbe met in order for those dollars to leave our shores and go abroad.\n  Now, this year, in consultation with Senator Lugar and the Department \nof State, we put in this bill the permanent waiver authority for the \nPresident. And that was important. I think that cuts down on some of \nthe administrative problems and the time delays. But the fundamental \nand compelling reason to have these criteria remain is for this \ninstitution, the Congress of the United States, together with the \nexecutive branch, to monitor expenditure of these funds and to have \nthat leverage to get reciprocal actions and assurances from those \ncountries to which our taxpayers' dollars go.\n  Mr. President, at this time I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the time I put under the control of the \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it is with reluctance that I urge that \nSenator Lugar's amendment be defeated. I say with reluctance because \nthe spirit with which he offers this amendment is in keeping with his \noriginal concept, along with Senator Nunn, for providing assistance \nfrom the United States to countries with weapons we want to see \neliminated, dismantled; primarily at that time the Soviet Union, now \nRussia. Through the program which was adopted which bears his name, \nSenator Lugar has helped not only to ensure the continued support for \nthe program, but on a personal basis I am aware he has traveled \nfrequently to these countries and personally participated in what he \ncalls the hands-on implementation of the program, and in his case it \nhas literally been hands on. So not only has he helped to sponsor the \nlegislation, seen to it it is implemented every year, expressed \nfrustration when delays have occurred--I have heard him do that--but he \nhas also gone to these countries and helped to see to it that it is \ncarried out in the proper way.\n  It is therefore understandable when he expresses frustration at the \nfact that in the past the bureaucracy of the United States--and I am \nsure there are other reasons for this, too--has resulted in delays in \nmaking available funding for the program to be carried out in an \nexpeditious way. We have all seen that in different kinds of programs, \nbut it must be especially frustrating in this particular case.\n  It was at least partially in response to that that the committee has \noffered a solution which is embodied in the bill which grants a \npermanent waiver authority for the President so that this problem of \nthe past need no longer be a problem. In other words, the conditions \nthat have been established that Senator Warner referred to, conditions \nfor making the funds available for the dismantling of these weapons, \ncan and have been waived. They can be waived and they have been waived. \nThere is that authority in the law. But we go a step further in this \nbill by granting that permanent waiver authority for the President so \nthat he doesn't have to rely anymore upon this slow-working bureaucracy \nto get the reports prepared, to answer the questions of whether the \nRussians have been cooperating fully, and all the other requirements \nwhich I will allude to in a minute. That is no longer a requirement.\n\n  To some extent, I say with all due respect, this amendment is a \nsolution in search of a problem. Whatever problem existed in the past, \nit should not exist in the future. In fact, the letter referred to from \nSecretary Rice notes that one alternative to the solution, and the \nproblem that was discussed by Senator Lugar, is included in the April \n7, 2005 defense transportation transmittal to Congress of the National \nDefense authorization bill and would renew permanently the authority \nunder which existing certification requirements may be waived. That is \nprecisely what was included in the bill. I suspect all Members support \nthat.\n  The question is, Why do we need to go the step further and remove \nwhat have been very important conditions to the granting of this money? \nThere are two reasons for these conditions, but before I discuss them, \nlet me state what they are so everyone knows what we are talking about. \nThe first set of these were actually instituted at least partially as a \nresult of Senator Warner's work in the authorizing legislation to make \nsure that the American taxpayers knew that the money we would be \nspending on this dismantlement would, in fact, be spent wisely. It\n\n[[Page S8645]]\n\nis, in fact, a justification for the expenditure of taxpayer funds.\n  But the conditions go further than that. What they do is tell a \ncountry such as Russia, for example, that we care about what they are \ndoing; that, for example, we would not want to use our money to \ndismantle one of their weapons if they are going to turn right around \nand use their money and build a replacement. No one would want that to \noccur. That would not make any sense. That is one of the conditions, \nand it lets the Russians and others know that if they expect U.S. \ntaxpayer assistance, they have to do their part as well. That is only \nreasonable.\n  Here are the conditions: that the President certify that the \nrecipient nation is committed to making substantial investment of its \nresources for dismantling or destroying WMD. It should not be a one-way \nstreet. It should not be just the obligation of the United States to \nhelp other countries dismantle their weapons.\n  Second, forgoing any military modernization program that exceeds \nlegitimate defense requirements and forgoing a replacement of destroyed \nWMD. That is what I referred to before. We would not want to be using \ntaxpayer dollars to help Russia, for example, dismantle an aged weapons \nsystem, for example, only to see it use its money to replace that \nsystem with one that is even more robust and more threatening. That, \nobviously, is simply aiding the Russians in modernizing their forces. \nObviously, that is not what this program is about.\n  Three, forgoing any use of nuclear weapons of fissionable or other \ncomponents of destroyed nuclear weapons. This is a key component in \nwhat Senator Lugar intended, and I am sure he agrees with this concept \nthat we do not want them taking fissionable material out of the weapons \nwe are destroying and putting them into a new weapon. That defeats the \nentire purpose of the destruction program.\n  Four, facilitating U.S. verification of any weapons destruction \ncarried out in the CTR Program. Obviously, if we are spending our money \non dismantling these weapons, we have a right to at least do some \nchecking to see whether it was done. When we set out to do the job, did \nit in fact get accomplished?\n  I know from stories I have heard or reports I have read that the \nRussians--the Soviets before them--had an entirely different concept of \nhow this might work. They have whole cities devoted to their weapons \ncomplex. One of their ideas was that U.S. money should be used to \nprovide assistance to the people in those cities who were dismantling \ntheir primary means of making a living; we should provide them other \nways of making a living and relieve the suffering they might occasion \nas a result of not having a job building these weapons anymore. That \nrepresented the difference of opinion about how our taxpayer dollars \nshould be used and how the Russians saw it at the time.\n  Another condition: complying with all relevant arms control \nagreements. Now, that ought to be a pretty minimal and bottom-line \nrequirement. If we are going to be doing business with a country and \nproviding taxpayer dollars to dismantle weapons, we want to make sure \nthey comply with the agreements they have signed on arms control.\n  Finally, observing internationally recognized human rights, including \nthe protection of minorities. This is not directly related to the \nsubject of the CTR, but it is something we have all agreed is an \nimportant goal that the United States has and a way for us to remind \nthese countries that they need to be paying attention to this kind of \nissue as well as the dismantlement issue.\n  These conditions are useful to continue to apply pressure to a \ncountry such as Russia to do the right thing, to provide assurance to \nthe American taxpayer that our money is being spent appropriately, and \nalso to provide Congress with the kind of information we need to ensure \nour continued support for the program. And they do, in fact, provide us \nthat confidence.\n\n  There has always been a waiver authority, and the President has \nexercised that waiver authority because, as Senator Lugar noted in the \npast, there have been delays in getting the certifications--that the \nRussians have met these requirements, for example--delays which have \ncreated problems in getting the resources to the country in time to do \nthe dismantlement that was planned. So the President exercised that \nwaiver authority.\n  The current problem is that the waiver authority will expire in \nSeptember of this year. That is one of the reasons we need to get this \nbill passed, so the waiver authority that is granted in the bill--now \npermanent authority that does not expire--will be the President's to \nexercise in the future. That will largely obviate the problem that has \nbeen discussed.\n  The problem is not the conditions. The conditions are perfectly \nappropriate. Every Member would agree that there is nothing wrong with \nthe goals of these conditions. The problem is in the implementation of \nthe statute. That has apparently taken longer than it should have in \ncertain cases. It has resulted in people being able to delay the \nprogram and perhaps not intentionally but at least unintentionally \ndelaying the program because the conditions have to be certified. That \nis why the waiver has had to be used in order to get around the \nproblem.\n  As I said, when Secretary Rice responded to Senator Lugar's letter, \nshe noted that one of the alternative solutions to the one proposed by \nSenator Lugar was this permanent waiver authority, which is what we \nhave included in this bill.\n  There is also a second very important aspect of this. We were having \na hard time in using the CTR assistance for chemical weapons \ndestruction in Russia. It was precisely because of that that conditions \nwere specifically inserted into the law, and I will get the citation in \na moment. But specifically, we added requirements for the CTR \nassistance to the elimination of the chemical weapons, and this program \nadded conditions, and I will note for the record what those conditions \nare; it added these conditions so that we could actually begin \nproviding assistance to add to the nuclear assistance the elimination \nor destruction of the chemical weapons so that program could go forward \nin Russia as well.\n  The eligibility requirements, the conditions for CTR assistance, \ncertainly no one would argue are inappropriate or should be repealed. \nIt simply is a question of whether they have been administered in a way \nthat has facilitated the implementation of the statute.\n  From my point, I think they do remain an important element in \nassuring the American taxpayer that our dollars are being expended \nwisely here as well. They are also important to maintain strong public \nsupport for the program.\n  Again, I said that it is with reluctance I oppose the amendment \nbecause of all the work Senator Lugar has done. No one is more keen to \nensure that this program can work in the future than Senator Lugar. \nHowever, I also think we would probably all have to agree that the \nconditions themselves are totally appropriate conditions; that with the \nexception of human rights, they all pertain to the effectuation of the \nprogram itself; that they do serve the purpose of ensuring that \ncountries such as Russia understand they have some obligations, and \nalso providing information to Congress that permit us from year to year \nto continue to support the program. It is not the conditions themselves \nthat are the problem; it has been the implementation of the program. \nAnd in the past, apparently, this has been a problem.\n  The waiver authority has solved these problems but on a temporary \nbasis. From now on, the President will have permanent waiver authority \nif we pass this bill. I believe that should be a solution to the \nproblem that would be agreeable to all.\n  Now, there may be some who want to go further and eliminate these \nconditions as well. I don't think that is necessary to make it work, \nand I do think there would be a downside for the reasons I have \narticulated.\n  That is why I oppose the amendment, and I hope that the committee's \nmark, the bill we have before us, will be sustained when there is a \nvote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, let me respond directly. I do oppose the \nconditions. The purpose of my amendment is to eliminate the conditions. \nThe reason I want to eliminate the conditions, and the Senator from \nArizona has simply\n\n[[Page S8646]]\n\nillustrated that in his recitation of them--for example, No. 5, \ncomplying with all relevant arms control agreements. That is a work of \nart every year for people to fathom whether the Russians have complied \nwith every one of those agreements. The question is, What if we decide \nthey have not? Is this, then, the reason we stop destroying Russian \nwarheads, missiles, submarines? Just stop cold because we say the \nRussians, in our judgment--and there is usually a debate among those in \nthe Pentagon about this--have not got it quite right?\n  Even more, No. 6, observing internationally recognized human rights, \nincluding the protection of minorities, I am not certain that almost \nany Senate or administration official has ever come to a conclusion \nthat the Russians have been observing all internationally recognized \nhuman rights for 14 years. Yet someone is still arguing we ought to \nleave that on the statute books as a reason the bureaucrats in our \ncountry ponder about the human rights conditions in Russia for as many \nweeks and so forth until the President says: We have had enough, I \nwaive it, let's get on.\n  To suggest that it is extreme to leave these situations on the books, \nit seems to me, is not at all logical given our own activity and the \nfact that we are fighting a war on terror. This is not simply a grant \nof inconsequential effort with regard to our security, it is the whole \nball game.\n  Or condition No. 4, facilitating U.S. verification of weapons \ndestruction carried out under the program. As a rule, we have had \npretty good fortune with the CTR people following through precisely \nwhat has occurred but not in all instances. If you go to Russia and you \nvisit with our people on the ground, they will give you instances \nimmediately in which they are having trouble with Russian friends who \ndo not want to let them see what has occurred. Then we all argue, as \nmilitary and civilians, with our Russian friends that we really do need \nto see these situations. We are on the ground and we have tried to work \nit out. But back here, to make an evaluation that we have not seen all \nof it and therefore we stop the music makes no sense at all at this \npoint in history.\n  On the conditions on the chemical business, they were not at all \nhelpful, to say the least. It is an ongoing process of getting \nsomething done still, trying to get the international community's money \ninto it, trying to get the Russians over the threshold as the Duma. \nThis is hard work but back here not so hard to say we want to evaluate, \nAre the Russians making a substantial investment? Well, what is \nsubstantial? Sometimes people have put a figure on it--$25 million, I \nmentioned in my speech. That was another stipulation. An allocation of \n$25 million, someone came up with here. I am not sure how we know; we \nare not able to audit the books.\n  We can make some judgments as to whether a substantial effort is \nbeing made, but let's take the other case: The Russians make no \nattempt. They say, We are bankrupt, and they were in the early years of \nthe program. Is that a reason why we do nothing, then? Do we just stop \nthe music and say, You are not making a reasonable allocation?\n  The old argument used to be called fungibility, the thought that \nsomehow if U.S. taxpayer money got into Russia and we worked to destroy \nnuclear warheads, take them off the missile and so forth, the Russians \nwould not have to spend money doing that and therefore they would spend \nit on something else of a nefarious nature. I am not sure that many \npersons in the Russian military ever were excited about taking the \nwarheads off of the missiles, about destroying the missiles, about \ndestroying all the submarines, destroying the transcontinental bombers. \nI don't think there was a wave of enthusiasm, people in the streets \ndemanding that their government do these things.\n  The fact is that cooperative threat reduction, as the Russian \ngenerals told Sam Nunn, is something that is our problem, but it is \nyour problem because you folks in the United States have the \ncontractors, you have the money, you have the organization. These are \nnot funds donated in a United Way project to Russia. They are funds \nlargely spent with American contractors, American experts, American \npeople who take their time and at some risk to themselves have gone to \nRussia, and now to other places, to dismantle dangerous weapons and try \nto corral dangerous material in the benefit of all of us.\n  Because in another forum we would be having the speech: What happens \nif al-Qaida gets their hands on even a few pounds of fissionable \nmaterial? What would have happened if even a small weapon had been on a \nplane that went into the World Trade Center? Then we have briefings \nfrom experts that show concentric circles of death and destruction, of \nhundreds of thousands of Americans losing their lives. That is the \nissue.\n  Anyone who is delaying this has to give some better reason for it \nthan at some point a Member of the House or Senate thought it might be \na good idea to ask the Russians what they are doing. Of course, that is \na good idea. Those of us who have been visiting with the Russians ask \nit all the time and, as a matter of fact, have a very tough-minded \nattitude, which they appreciate because they have the same feeling for \nus.\n  But I am saying we have come to a time in which we have to understand \nit is not useful to require that before Nunn-Lugar funds are spent each \nyear there be a symposium on how human rights are going in Russia and, \ntherefore, at the end of the day the President waives it and says: OK, \nnot so good, but, after all, American security is still what I am after \nas Commander in Chief.\n  Let me reiterate. I think it is important to clean the books, to get \non with a program in which we understand, as Americans, we want to work \nwith Russians to destroy weapons of mass destruction every year without \ndelay. If the $415 million that is in this bill is appropriated, \nultimately--and I hope it will be--we want to be able to spend that \nfrom October 1 onward. As has been pointed out, the waiver authority, \neven as it is, dies September 30. What happens if for some reason there \nis a conference hassle on the Department of Defense appropriations bill \napart from the authorization bill? Certainly that happens in the body, \nand with the other body, from time to time. And when it has happened \nbefore, the music stopped. We did it to ourselves. We cannot afford to \ncontinue doing that.\n  Mr. President, I yield time to my distinguished colleague, the \nranking member of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from Indiana for \nhis intrepid, persistent, and determined, bulldogged leadership to try \nto address the greatest threat this country faces which is the presence \nof a weapon of mass destruction in the hands of a terrorist or \nterrorist state. We are told over and over again--one commission after \nanother tells us--the greatest threat this Nation faces would be a \nchemical, biological, or nuclear weapon in the hands of a terrorist or \nterrorist state--``loose nukes,'' as they are sometimes called.\n  Yet, in the wonderful program we have called Nunn-Lugar, we have \nimpediments to the prompt spending of our money in order to secure or \ndestroy the weapons that threaten us. Why, in Heaven's name, we would \nput any impediment in the way of addressing the greatest threat that \nfaces this country absolutely mystifies me.\n  We have six conditions that have to be certified to annually by the \nPresident before this money can be spent to protect our Nation. Let me \ntake one of them. One of the conditions that has to be addressed and \nmet in a report is the President certify annually that each country is \nmeeting the following condition--one of the six--that the country is \nforegoing any military modernization program that exceeds the \nlegitimate defense requirements of that country.\n  Now, why, in Heaven's name, we want to have some agency's employee \nspending time looking at whether Kazakhstan or Uzbekistan or, yes, \nRussia, in their entire military budget is spending any money on any \nweapons system that, in our judgment, they do not need--and if we \ncannot certify that, we cannot protect ourselves against destroying the \nweapon of mass destruction that exists in Kazakhstan or Uzbekistan--why \nwould we want to tie our hands that way in order to address the \ngreatest threat that faces us? It is absolutely mysterious to me.\n\n[[Page S8647]]\n\n  The great Senator from Indiana--I do not know if he went through each \none of these conditions. I know he went through some of them. And I am \nnot even sure how we could certify that Russia has forgone every single \nmilitary modernization program that exceeds their legitimate defense \nneeds. How could anyone certify that? Go through the entire Russian \ndefense budget and look at every single modernization program? I am not \neven sure it is public. I am not sure ours are. I know ours are not all \npublic, by the way. We have classified programs. But the way the law \nreads, we have to get the Presidential certification that there is no \nRussian modernization program that exceeds their legitimate defense \nneeds.\n  We have to do that with every country--Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, \nUkraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Albania--before we can secure or destroy \nweapons, material, weapons of mass destruction, biological weapons, \nchemical weapons, nuclear material that threatens us? We have to write \nthese endless reports, trying to certify that those conditions are met?\n  We are cutting off our nose to spite our face. What we are doing here \nis, instead of trying to secure material or destroy material, we end up \nsecuring reports, producing reports. How many of us have read those \nreports, by the way? I am not sure how many have been filed because \nthey have to be waived every year if they are not written. But how many \nof us would look through a report on every modernization program--if we \ncould figure it out--that Kazakhstan has before we destroy material \nthat threatens us that might exist in that country?\n\n  Now, these impediments to protecting our people against the greatest \nthreat we face actually make no sense anymore. We ought to get rid of \nthem instead of requiring an annual certification, involving people \nwriting these certifications, writing these reports rather than \neffectively spending our resources in order to protect the American \npeople.\n  We say we have to be able to certify that Russia has accurately \ndeclared the size of its chemical weapons stockpile. We cannot certify \nthat, verify it, because there is a great dispute over verification \nbetween ourselves and Russia. They want to come in to certain places we \ndo not want them to come in, so they cannot verify certain things, \nbecause we are not giving them access. We are not perfectly transparent \nin terms of our own chemical production facility, for legitimate \nreasons. But there is a dispute on transparency between us and Russia.\n  So that dispute, which is a legitimate dispute, which has not been \nresolved yet--despite, let's assume, good-faith efforts on both sides--\nthe presence of that dispute means we cannot or the President cannot \nmake a certification that Russia has accurately declared the size of a \nchemical weapons stockpile because we cannot get the verification \nagreed to, again, because we will not provide access to our own \nfacility. That stops us from defending our people against chemical \nweapons.\n  What is the goal here? Reports or security? If we can get our hands \non chemical weapons or biological weapons or nuclear material or \nmissiles and destroy them, why wouldn't we want to grab that \nopportunity? Why would we want to put impediments in the way and \nrequire reports or certifications to be made?\n  By the way, I think it is great if the reports can be made. I have no \nproblem with it, either. Senator Lugar mentioned, we raise these issues \nall the time. But we should not attach these as conditions to our \ntaking action which is in our own interest. Churning away at reports \nwhen it is in our national security to eliminate weapons of mass \ndestruction does not make sense to me. We have this process requiring \nhundreds of man-hours of work by the State Department, the intelligence \ncommunity, the Pentagon, as well as other departments and agencies. \nThat time could be better spent tackling the proliferation threats that \nface our country.\n  We should be spending all of our energies on interdicting WMD \nshipments, all of our energies at identifying the next A.Q. Khan, all \nof our energies on locating hidden stocks of chemical and biological \nweapons. Instead, we have nonproliferation experts spending time \ncompiling reports and assembling certifications and waiver \ndeterminations.\n  By the way, the majority of those reports is repetitive. They have \nalready filed reports in other formats. Yet we continue to require \nthat.\n  The President does not have to spend any of this money. If the \nExecutive decides they have questions and they are not going to spend \nmoney, for whatever legitimate reason, fine. But we should not add to \ntheir burdens. And we should not jeopardize the security of this Nation \nby putting barriers in the way of taking action to secure or destroy \nthe most threatening material we face--chemical, biological, or nuclear \nmaterial.\n  I very strongly support the efforts of our good friend from Indiana, \nwho has been such a leader here. When Sam Nunn was here, it was Nunn-\nLugar. No one could take Sam Nunn's place. Senator Lugar, with the \nsupport of many of us, including, may I say, our chairman, the \nPresiding Officer--who has supported the amount of money for Nunn-\nLugar--without the support of the chairman of the committee, who is now \npresiding over the Senate, we would not be able to get that amount of \nmoney we have in this authorization. By the way, we are going to try to \nincrease that somewhat during the debate on this bill.\n  But that amount of money, which is requested, I believe, by the \nadministration, would not be there but for the Senator from Indiana, \nbut for the chairman of our committee, and but for the support many of \nus on the Armed Services Committee have to address this absolutely most \ndangerous threat this Nation faces.\n  I commend the Senator from Indiana, and I am proud to be a cosponsor \nof his amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time is on either \nside to be utilized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has 5\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, let me take a moment to thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan for his very strong words and, \nlikewise, to echo his commendation of you, as I do at this moment in \nthis debate.\n  Very clearly, each one of us has attempted to do our best in this \narea. I am proud to have pictures of all of us in my office, standing \nin front of missiles and explosives and all the elements that have \nmarked 14 remarkable years.\n  This entire program is counterintuitive. Those who looked at the half \ncentury that preceded 1991, the breakup of the former Soviet Union, \nwould say: Here we are, two superpowers. A number of estimates were \nwrong on all sides about the economy of Russia, maybe the economy of \nour country or the relative strengths we had at that time. It was not \nuntil several years later that we knew there were 13,300 warheads on \nthose missiles. We had estimates of that, but we now know that. We know \nexactly how many have been taken off and how many are still to be taken \noff, and how many missiles remain as vehicles, and how many submarines \nremain. This is remarkable. This is a degree of cooperation that is \nvery substantial.\n  There are some elements that we still do not know. I would claim that \nour Russian friends have been in denial on a good number of the \nbiological programs, while they would say they were not weapons \nprograms. They were something else dealing with livestock or other \nelements. We have had differences, and I would say there are still four \nsituations in Russia in which none of us have had access. Therefore, \nthose who argue that there is no good reason to raise questions of the \nRussians argue well. But my logic at the end of the day, even if the \nRussians have not been forthcoming on these four biological situations \non which I have sought access, physically asked to go and may some day \nbe admitted, if for some reason they may find it useful to admit me, \nthat is not a good reason to delay for one week or one month or any \ntime the movement of the moneys, the programs, the contractors, the \nAmerican spirit that is working with a number of Russians in this \nwindow of history that was miraculously opened.\n\n[[Page S8648]]\n\n  I hope it will be open for a long time. I hope the cooperation with \nRussia will continue so that we do have, together, access, and so do \nother partners in the G8, in the so-called ``10 plus 10 over 10'' \nprogram. It is because we will need more time. We need to make certain \nthat we do not make mistakes, certainly the ones we can avoid. I am \nsuggesting today that we can avoid mistakes--and by eliminating these \nconditions, we will at least remove one of them--and that we have then \nan opportunity to continue to be forthcoming with the Russians in \nasking them to work with us in their own interest.\n  Finally, when I was in vaults in which there are nuclear warheads \nlying almost akin to bodies in a morgue, I noted little tablets at the \ntop of these which had Russian inscriptions. I asked: What is on those? \nThey said: This tells when the weapon was built. It gives a service \nrecord. These weapons are not inert sporting guns' ammunition sitting \non a shelf. They require servicing. There is a chemical mixture going \non there that, without proper care, can lead to dire results. We don't \nknow, nor do the Russians, what the results are.\n  Therefore, down on the tab there is an estimate of the efficacy of \nthe weapon; that is, how long the warhead probably would work if it \nwere taken out of the vault and put back on a missile. Then you have \neven a stranger estimate, and that is when it might become dangerous; \nthat is an event, a nuclear event in Russia with dastardly results for \nRussians.\n  This is one reason why this is not totally counterintuitive. If you \nstill have thousands of these weapons in warhead form, you want to make \ncertain you have a partner who has some money and some expertise, and \nyou try to make sure you use that money on the oldest ones first before \nyou work out what is going to happen historically, something none of us \nhave thus far had the horror to find out.\n  This is serious business. We all take it that way. I appreciate the \nspirit of the debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I think Senator Lugar controls all of the \ntime on his side. I wonder if he might yield 4 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island. I don't know how long the Senator from Texas was \ngoing to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time in opposition is under the control of \nthe Senator from Arizona. But in his absence, the Senator from Texas is \nin control of the time and has the authority to grant the time.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have no objection to the Senator from \nRhode Island addressing the Senate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. This would be on Senator Lugar's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair understands the allocation of the \ntime.\n\n\n                         Gun Industry Immunity\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, let me thank Senator Lugar for his \ncommendable amendment and thank Senator Cornyn for allowing me to \nproceed. I would like to speak to the possible procedural posture we \nwill be in next week.\n  We are now on the Defense authorization bill, which is critical to \nproviding resources to our service men and women who are engaged today, \nas we speak, in a global war on terror. But tomorrow the majority \nleader intends to file a cloture petition on the motion to proceed to \nthe gun industry immunity bill. That means on Tuesday morning we will \nhave a cloture vote, and the vote will present a stark choice for all \nSenators. We can stay on the Defense bill and finish our work on behalf \nof our soldiers, sailors, air men and women, or we can leave the \nDefense bill for an undetermined period of time and move to a special \ninterest bill to give legal immunity to the gun industry.\n  If the Senate invokes cloture on the motion to proceed to the gun \nindustry bill next Tuesday, we will be on that motion for the next 30 \nhours. On Wednesday, when that time runs out, the majority leader would \nthen file another cloture petition on the bill itself. The Senate would \nthen spend the next 2 days on the immunity bill, and we would have \nanother cloture vote Friday. If the Senate invoked cloture on the bill \nnext Friday, we could face another 30 hours on the gun immunity bill, \npushing final passage until at least next Saturday and potentially \ndelaying passage of the Defense authorization bill until after the \nAugust recess.\n  We face a situation where the majority is asking Senators to delay \nconsideration of a bill to support our troops, possibly for up to a \nmonth, so that we can take up a bill to give a special interest gift to \nthe gun industry.\n  Senator Frist said this morning that lawsuits against gun \nmanufacturers like Beretta are the reason to take up this measure \nbecause they provide small arms to the U.S. Army and the Department of \nDefense. First, Beretta is a privately held corporation owned by an \nItalian parent. There is no obligation for them to disclose their \nfinances. But their competitors, Sturm Ruger and Smith & Wesson, \ncontinue to assure their shareholders in SEC filings that this \nlitigation is not having an adverse material effect on their financial \nposition. So I don't know how much credence we can give to that.\n  I believe we should stay on this bill, finish our obligation to our \nservice men and women, and then at some other time, take up this bill \nbecause such a bill about immunity requires extensive debate. That is a \nrequirement that many Senators will not forgo.\n  I urge the majority leader to reconsider his proposal. I thank the \nSenator from Texas and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lugar). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, with some reluctance, I rise to oppose the \namendment of the distinguished occupant of the chair, the senior \nSenator from Indiana. But I feel a certain obligation, as the chairman \nof the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, out of which \nthis particular portion of the bill emanated, to explain the reasons \nwhy the bill contains these conditions that I believe are important and \nwhich I will explain and which have existed in the bill as it has been \npassed by the Congress since its inception.\n  The question that I would pose is, what has changed? What has changed \nthat now would lead this body to eliminate these important criteria \nthat have existed in the bill for lo these many years? I think it is \nimportant, as a general matter, that there be some sort of reciprocal \nobligation on the part of Russia for receiving more than $400 million \nin American taxpayer money, potentially. I know there has been \ndiscretion added to make sure that WMD located in other countries can \nnow be addressed by this Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. That is \na good thing. But certainly, while I appreciate the argument that \nregardless of whether or not Russia complies with the conditions that \nare required to be monitored under this Cooperative Threat Reduction \nProgram, I still do not believe that it is the best stewardship of the \nAmerican taxpayers' moneys for us to say: We don't care whether Russia \ncomplies with their reciprocal obligations or not, and we are going to \ngive the money away anyway, albeit for a good purpose.\n  On balance, I am not persuaded that the burden to change the system, \nas it has been since 1991, has been met, and I believe that we should \nretain some way to monitor the progress of Russia, the recipient of \nthese funds, on these important criteria that have been set out in the \nbill.\n  Of course, the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program has long been \nproviding assistance to states of the former Soviet Union to help \neliminate and safeguard weapons of mass destruction and related \ninfrastructure materials. These programs helped to eliminate large Cold \nWar stockpiles of dangerous weapons that are no longer needed. Today, \nof course, this is an important element of our strategy to keep weapons \nof mass destruction and know-how from falling into the hands of \nterrorists. That is the reason why I applaud the senior Senator from \nIndiana for his leadership in this important effort.\n  When Congress first authorized the Cooperative Threat Reduction \nProgram, an important element of the authorizing legislation was the \ninclusion of the conditions which now this amendment seeks to \neliminate. These conditions must be met before a country can receive \nCooperative Threat Reduction assistance from the United States. These \nconditions were retained\n\n[[Page S8649]]\n\nin the Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 1993 which reauthorized the \noriginal Nunn-Lugar program. That act included the requirement that for \neach recipient nation of Cooperative Threat Reduction funds, the \nPresident certify that the recipient nation is committed to the \nfollowing goals:\n  One, to making substantial investment of its resources for \ndismantling or destroying its weapons of mass destruction; two, \nforgoing any military modernization program that exceeds legitimate \ndefense requirements and forgoing the replacement of destroyed weapons \nof mass destruction; three, forgoing any use in new nuclear weapons of \nfissionable or other components of destroyed nuclear weapons; \nfacilitating U.S. verification of any weapons destruction carried out \nunder the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program; complying with all \nrelevant arms control agreements; and observing internationally \nrecognized human rights, including the protection of minorities.\n  I would certainly agree with the distinguished senior Senator from \nIndiana that some of these are vague standards. For example, as he \npointed out, complying with all relevant arms control agreements or \nobserving internationally recognized human rights, including the \nprotection of minorities. But the fact that they are somewhat general--\nsome might say somewhat vague--does not mean that they are unimportant. \nOne of the important roles played by these criteria is that there be \nsome effort on the part of the Government to ascertain whether, in \nfact, the old Soviet Union is, in fact, exercising good faith as part \nof the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. If, in fact, ultimately \nthe President decides, as authorized by this bill, to ultimately waive \nthe noncompliance of those criteria in the interest of our national \nsecurity, at least Congress and the Nation know that some assessment \nhas been made of the old Soviet Union's compliance with these criteria.\n  I think we would all agree that the information that is collected and \nscrutinized is important in the interest of our national security and \nin the interest of knowing that we have met our responsibility to see \nthat American tax dollars are spent as wisely and efficiently as \npossible.\n  These conditions remain as relevant and as important today as they \nwere in 1993. They provide Congress and the public relevant information \nabout the countries that have received taxpayer-funded assistance for \nthis program. The conditions also help provide us confidence that U.S. \ntax dollars will be well spent in countries that are committed to \nright-sizing their militaries, complying with arms control agreements, \nproviding transparency with regard to Cooperative Threat Reduction \nassistance, and respecting human rights. I do not understand how one \ncould argue that these conditions are unimportant or irrelevant to our \nnational security or that we ought to simply blind ourselves to the \nrecipient nation's compliance with these criteria in the interest of \npursuing our ultimate goal.\n  The truth is, we all agree in the ultimate goal of this important \nprogram. But this provides us additional checks and balances and \ninformation that is relevant, significant, and which I think \ndemonstrates that we are being good stewards of the American taxpayer \ndollar while we pursue a safer and more secure world.\n\n  These certification requirements do not impede the provision of \ncooperative threat reduction assistance. For years now, the Congress \nprovided the President with waiver authority, so that even if one or \nmore of the certifications cannot be made for a particular country, the \nPresident may provide these funds if it is in our national interest to \ndo so, and that is appropriate.\n  One of the things this bill does is to make that temporary waiver \nauthority that had been conferred upon the President permanent, to \nprovide the kinds of flexibility that Secretary Rice said the President \nand the administration wanted when it came to this program in her \nletter of June 3, 2005, which has been previously referenced.\n  This provision for permanent waiver authority for cooperative threat \nreduction programs in the bill provides the flexibility needed. It also \nprovides us the way to deal in a responsible fashion with the countries \nthat compose the former Soviet Union. I remember, of course, the famous \nwords of President Reagan when talking about negotiating with the \nSoviet Union, where he said, ``trust, but verify.'' What these criteria \ndo in this cooperative threat reduction program is allow us to not just \ntrust but also to verify that these countries that were once the old \nSoviet Union are worthy of our trust by allowing us to verify their \ngood faith compliance with this program.\n  The amendment of the senior Senator from Indiana would also repeal \nconditions Congress placed on the provision of financial assistance to \nRussia for chemical demilitarization activity. These conditions were \nestablished in the fiscal year 2000 National Defense Authorization Act. \nThey required the Secretary of Defense to certify that Russia has \nprovided a full and accurate accounting of its chemical weapons \nstockpile; demonstrated a commitment of $25 million annually to \nchemical weapons elimination; developed a practical plan for destroying \nits stockpile of nerve agents; agree to destroy or convert two existing \nchemical weapons production facilities; finally, a commitment from the \ninternational community to fund and build infrastructure needed to \nsupport and operate the chemicals weapons destruction facility in \nRussia.\n  Here again, these provisions would be effectively repealed by this \namendment which is proposed today by the distinguished Senator from \nIndiana. They do not represent an impediment to the accomplishment of \nthe chemical demilitarization program because they may be likewise \nwaived in the end if the President deems that waiver in our national \ninterest. But no one, it seems to me, could in good faith argue that \nthese criteria are unimportant or irrelevant.\n  Indeed, each of these criteria demonstrate the reciprocal good faith \nand responsibility of the recipient nations in accomplishing chemical \ndemilitarization, a goal that is the subject of an international treaty \nthat this country is a party to and one that is certainly in our \nnational interest to see accomplished.\n  For several years, Congress decided not to support the provision of \ncooperative threat reduction assistance for chemical weapons \ndestruction in Russia. It was precisely the inclusion of these \nconditions in the authorizing language that persuaded Congress to \nresume assistance under the chemical threat--the Cooperative Threat \nReduction Program for this important effort of chemical \ndemilitarization.\n  These conditions relevant to the chemical weapons destruction program \nin Russia also have a waiver provision, so that the assistance, as I \nmentioned a moment ago, can continue in the absence of certification \nif, in the end, the President deems it in the national interest. The \neligibility requirements and conditions for assistance are entirely \nappropriate.\n  Mr. President, I believe the burden of proof on those who would \nrepeal it has not been met. They remain an important element in \nassuring that the American taxpayer is being well served and that the \nmoney is being spent appropriately and wisely on the underlying aims of \nthe Cooperative Threat Reduction Program that we all agree are a good \nthing. This assurance to the American taxpayer and to the American \npeople that their money is being well spent is essential to maintaining \nstrong public support for this important program.\n  The waiver authority ensures that even in cases where a country \ndoesn't meet all eligibility requirements, the President has the \nflexibility to provide this assistance if it is in the national \nsecurity interest to do so. This is all, in the end, that the \nadministration, through Secretary Rice's letter, has requested. So we \nhave accomplished that goal already, even before this amendment has \nbeen proposed.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues not to support this amendment \nthat would repeal the conditions and the eligibility requirements under \nthe Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. We all share the goal of \nsupporting programs like this that can help keep dangerous weapons of \nmass destruction and technology and know-how from slipping out of the \ncountries that used to be the old Soviet Union.\n  I continue to believe that certification requirements are useful in \nhelping to maintain public confidence in\n\n[[Page S8650]]\n\nthis important program, and I urge my colleagues to vote against the \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask that the amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, this amendment to S. 1042 that would delay \nimplementation of the 2005 round of the Defense Base Closure and \nRealignment. This amendment does not seek to nullify the Department of \nDefense recommendations, nor does it seek to halt the work of the BRAC \nCommission now well underway. Nor do I seek to block the presentation \nof the BRAC Commission's final recommendations to the President. To the \ncontrary, I believe the BRAC commission to be an integral and \nindispensable check on this process and I value their analysis and \ndemonstrated independence.\n  The amendment would essentially extend the congressional review \nperiod for any final recommendations approved by the President until \ncertain conditions are first met. This proposed suspension of the ``45 \nday'' review period would thus delay ``implementation'' by the \nDepartment of Defense until one year following the last condition is \nmet. These conditions center on certain events that are anticipated to \noccur and which have potentially large or unforeseen implications for \nour military force structure. Therefore, implementation of any final \nBRAC recommendations should not occur until both the DoD and Congress \nhave had a chance to fully study the effects such events will have on \nour basing requirements. I will say more about those conditions in a \nmoment.\n  But first, I want to make my position perfectly clear. I do not \noppose the BRAC process. The underlying purpose of BRAC, as written by \nthis body, is not only good for our armed forces, it is good for the \nAmerican taxpayer. We all want to eliminate waste and reduce redundancy \nin the government. But when Congress modified the Base Realignment and \nClosure law in December 2001, to make way for the 2005 round of base \nclosings, it failed to envision this country involved in a protracted \nwar involving stretched manpower resources, ever-evolving threats and \nthe burden of large overseas rotational deployments of both troops and\n\n[[Page S8651]]\n\nequipment. I do, therefore, question the timing of this round of BRAC.\n  The amendment identifies several principal actions that must occur \nbefore final implementation of the 2005 BRAC recommendations. First, \nthere must be a complete analysis and consideration of the \nrecommendations of the Commission on Review of Overseas Military \nStructures. The overseas base commission has itself called upon the \nDepartment of Defense to ``slow down and take a breath.'' It cautions \nthat we should not move forward on basing decisions without knowing \nexactly where units will be returned, and if those installations are \nprepared or equipped to support units returning from garrisons in \nEurope, consisting of approximately 70,000 personnel.\n  Second, BRAC should not occur while this country is engaged in a \nmajor war and rotational deployments are still ongoing. We have seen \nenough disruption of both military and civilian institutions due to the \nlogistical strain brought about by these constant rotations of units \nand personnel to Iraq and Afghanistan without, at the same time, \ninitiating numerous base closures and the multiple transfer of units \nand missions from base to base. This is simply too much to ask of our \nmilitary, our communities and the families of our servicemen and women, \nwho are already stretched and overtaxed. Frankly, our efforts right now \nmust be devoted to winning the global war on terrorism, not packing up \nand moving units around the country.\n  Our amendment would delay implementation of BRAC until the Secretary \nof Defense determines that substantially all major combat units and \nassets have been returned from deployment in the Iraq theater of \noperations, whenever that might occur.\n  Third, it seems counterintuitive and completely out of logical \nsequence to attempt to review or implement the BRAC recommendations \nwithout having the benefit of studying the Quadrennial Defense Review, \ndue in 2006, and its long-term planning recommendations. Therefore, the \namendment requires that Congress receive the QDR and have an \nopportunity to study its planning recommendations as one of the \nconditions before implementing BRAC 2005.\n  Fourth and Fifth: BRAC should not go forward until the implementation \nand development by the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security of \nthe National Maritime Security Strategy; and the completion and \nimplementation of the Secretary of Defense's Homeland Defense and Civil \nSupport Directive--only now being drafted. These two planning \nstrategies should be key considerations before beginning any BRAC \nprocess.\n  Finally, once all these conditions have been met, the Secretary of \nDefense must submit to Congress, not later than one year after the \noccurrence of the last of these conditions, a report that assesses the \nrelevant factors and recommendations identified by the Commission on \nReview of Overseas Base Structure; the return of our thousands of \ntroops deployed in overseas garrisons that will return to domestic \nbases because of either overseas base reduction or the end of our \ndeployments in the war; and, any relevant factors identified by the QDR \nthat would impact, modify, negate or open to reconsideration any of the \nrecommendations submitted by the Secretary of Defense for BRAC 2005.\n  This proposed delay only seems logical and fair. There is no need to \nrush into decisions, that in a few years from now, could turn out to be \ncolossal mistakes. We can't afford to go back and rebuild installations \nor relocate high-cost support infrastructure at various points in this \ncountry once those installations have been closed or stripped of their \nvaluable capacity to support critical missions.\n  Frankly, some of the recommendations made by the Department of \nDefense seem more driven by internal zeal to cut costs, than by sound \nmilitary judgment. Several recommendations involving the consolidation \nof high value military air and naval assets at single locations seem to \nviolate one of the most basic tenets of national security--that of \nensuring strategic redundancy. Yes, the Cold War may no longer be a \nfactor in military basing requirements, but after 9/11 is there any \nquestion in anybody's mind whether the threat to our country or our \nmilitary installations has diminished--particularly as rogue countries \nand terrorist groups continue their quest for weapons of mass \ndestruction?\n  The GAO, in its report of July 1, 2005, has even questioned whether \nthis BRAC will achieve the savings that DoD contends it can achieve. \nGAO calculates the upfront investment costs of implementing this BRAC \nto be $24 billion and reveals that DoD's estimated savings of $50 \nbillion NPV over 20 years is largely illusory--incorrectly claiming 47 \npercent of the savings from mi1itary personnel that are not eliminated \nat all from the services, but only transferred to different \ninstallations.\n  There are many questions I and many of my colleagues have about the \nwisdom of the timing of this BRAC round and the prudence of some of its \nrecommendations and I will return to the floor to speak to many of \nthese as this amendment is considered. Again, I am not opposed to the \nBRAC process. But I do question whether this is the right time to begin \na new round of domestic base closures and massive relocations of \nmanpower and equipment.\n  I, therefore, offer this amendment today and call upon my colleagues \nto join us in this debate and support its passage.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for bringing this \namendment. There are some very distinguished cosponsors. It would be my \nexpectation to reply to the Senator in brief tonight following this \nvote because I think some record should be made today. The Senator made \nhis statement on the side of the proponents, and I need time within \nwhich to evaluate since I have just received this document, but I will \nbe prepared, following this vote, to make some reply, and I hope that \nmy colleague would likewise.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the chairman yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Now, I assume this amendment will be laid aside similar to \nother pending amendments.\n  Mr. THUNE. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I assume that in addition to the debate taking place \ntonight on this amendment, it could also take place tomorrow, along \nwith a number of other amendments which at least will be debated \ntomorrow. I hope this might be one of those amendments that could be \ndebated tomorrow, in addition to the comments that the chairman would \nmake.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct. Given the importance of this \namendment and the interest in this amendment, I wish to lay down some \nparameters tonight about my concerns.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I join in those concerns, and I agree that there should be \nsome response tonight.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator be available for further debate \ntomorrow?\n  Mr. THUNE. If that is the chairman's wish, we could make that \narrangement.\n  Mr. WARNER. Perhaps we can discuss it.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 1390 through 1400, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that the vote be delayed for a \nfew minutes because we have a series of amendments at the desk which \nhave been cleared by myself and the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate consider these \namendments en bloc, that the amendments be agreed to and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  I ask that any statements relating to any of these individual \namendments be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We have no objection and support that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1390\n\n  (Purpose: To increase the authorized number of Defense Intelligence \n                  Senior Executive Service employees)\n\n       At the end of title XI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1106.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, for over 3 years, we have heard that our \nmost important national security priority is to ``keep the world's \ndeadliest weapons out of the hands of the world's most dangerous \npeople.'' One of the best ways to do that is to secure the world's \nstocks of fissile material and to destroy such material that is no \nlonger needed for the nuclear weapons programs of the five accepted \nnuclear weapons states.\n  The Cooperative Threat Reduction program, also known as the Nunn-\nLugar program, is an important mechanism for achieving this vital \nobjective.\n  For over a dozen years, Nunn-Lugar has funded the destruction of \nRussian long-range ballistic missiles, nuclear warheads, and chemical \nweapons, as well as improved security for Russia's nuclear and chemical \nweapons. This program has furthered Russian compliance with bilateral \nand multilateral arms control treaties, and it has done so with great \ntransparency. In short, Nunn-Lugar has been a consistent contributor to \nour national security.\n  Experts report, however, that since 9/11, the pace of Nunn-Lugar \nactivities has fallen off. Fewer arms are being destroyed and there has \nbeen a major delay in activities due to disagreements with Russia over \naccess to activities and liability protection for contractors \nassociated with the program.\n  Another major impediment to Nunn-Lugar activities has been the need \neither to meet onerous certification requirements or to prepare an \nannual report justifying Presidential waivers of those certification \nrequirements. This is a needless waste of resources.\n  Worse yet, the certification and waiver requirements often lead to \ngaps of several months in the flow of funds to Nunn-Lugar projects. \nThose projects are not undertaken out of the goodness of our hearts; \nrather, they are designed\n\n[[Page S8654]]\n\nto improve our national security by lessening the risk that rogues or \nterrorists will acquire weapons of mass destruction.\n  So, what is the point of requiring onerous certifications or waiver \nreports? The only effect of those requirements is to slow the process \nof improving our national security.\n  The truth is that the certification requirements were imposed by \npeople who questioned the wisdom of Nunn-Lugar in the first place. And \nI cannot believe that anybody could doubt the usefulness of Nunn-Lugar \ntoday, given its proven record of achieving U.S. objectives.\n  If we are serious, then, about ``keeping the world's deadliest \nweapons out of the hands of the world's most dangerous people,'' the \ntime has come to pursue that goal more efficiently.\n  In particular, the time has come to stop putting roadblocks in the \nway of the Nunn-Lugar program, as we use that program to secure and \ndestroy weapons of mass destruction that might otherwise fall into \n``most dangerous'' hands.\n  The Lugar-Levin amendment will clear a major roadblock from the path \nto national security. I urge all my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this time, I yield to the Senator from \nIndiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I ask unanimous consent that Senators Landrieu, Sununu, \nBayh, Smith, and Carper be added as cosponsors to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Lugar amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote and lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Now, Mr. President, while we will not have further \nrollcall votes tonight, it is the intention of the managers to continue \ntonight to first clear package of amendments that we have, and then \nthere may well be a lot of other Senators who want to discuss their \namendments.\n  The Senate will come in tomorrow at such hour as specified by the \nleadership and there will be filed a cloture motion. Following that, \nthe managers will entertain further amendments and have debate on those \namendments. So we have made some progress. We still have a goal to \ncomplete this bill as early as we can next week, working with our \nleadership. But we will need the cooperation of Senators.\n  I again thank the Senator from South Dakota for bringing forth this \nvery important amendment on BRAC. There remains a very important \namendment by the distinguished Senator from Michigan and Mr. \nRockefeller and others. Perhaps the Senator from Michigan could give us \nsome timetable as to when the Senate could expect to have an \nopportunity to debate that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we are attempting to find a time for that \namendment which fits not just the Senate schedule but a very important \npersonal need, which I think the Senator from Virginia is aware of, of \none of the cosponsors. We do have many amendments that we are going to \nbe offered tomorrow. Apparently there is no plan for votes tomorrow; is \nthat the Senator's understanding?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my understanding is there will not be \nvotes tomorrow.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Although there will be no votes tomorrow, we nonetheless \nare making an effort on this side, and I hope the chairman will do the \nsame on his side, to have people debate amendments, lay down \namendments, set them aside so we can vote on them next week. We are \ndoing that on this side.\n  The idea that a cloture motion is filed on this bill, to me, is \ninappropriate. There is no filibuster of this bill. Everybody wants to \nhandle amendments as quickly as possible to this bill, and the idea \nthat there is a cloture motion filed on a bill where we are making \nprogress, where people are offering amendments, and we are disposing of \nthem, to me is inconsistent with what we have done as a body and should \nbe doing as a body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, to the two managers of this bill, I have \nsaid before and I say again, we could not have better managers. They do \nthings on a bipartisan basis. This is an important bill. I have from \nthis floor on other occasions this year talked about the need to go to \nthis bill. I still believe that. I think it is important that we do \nthis bill before we go home for the August recess. To think that \nyesterday was opening statements--I think it was yesterday, was is not? \nYes. Today is Thursday. No votes tonight, no votes tomorrow, vote at 5 \no'clock on Monday night--that is no way to legislate. To think that \ncloture will be invoked on this bill, we are here working with \nsubstantive amendments. We are not trying to slow things down, to stall \nthings. I am a supporter of the legislation that the leader wants to \nbring up--not to jeopardize this bill. It is simply not fair.\n  I went to Walter Reed Monday. I saw lying in those beds men who are \ndisfigured; their lives have changed forever. It is hard to get out of \nmy mind's eye a young man there just turned 21 years old, blind in one \neye, can't hear except a little bit out of one ear. I talked to another \nman lying there in bed; he was blown through the top of a Striker \nheadfirst, which indicates how his head was injured. He is going to \nlose a leg.\n  We have to finish this bill. That is what we need to do. We have \nspent as much as 5 weeks on this bill. Should we not be able to spend 5 \ndays on it? We have had 1 day to legislate on it. As the distinguished \nranking member of the committee had indicated, we have lined up \namendments for tomorrow, substantive amendments that relate to the \nsubject matter of this legislation. We are ready to vote on them. \nMonday we will have people here ready to offer amendments. I think it \nis so unfair to people whom I visited at Walter Reed to not finish this \nbill and to invoke cloture on it.\n  So we are faced with this proposition. We have basically had 1 day. \nCloture,\n\n[[Page S8655]]\n\nwe will have a vote on it Monday. We have 1 day where we have votes. \nAnd the votes we had today, we didn't need to have most of them. Two of \nthem were 100 to zero, or however many Senators we have here today. \nThey passed unanimously. We agreed not to have votes. ``Yes, we want to \nhave rollcall votes on them.'' Is it just to eat up time? My Democratic \nSenators are going to be asked Tuesday morning to vote for invocation \nof cloture on the Defense bill after they have had 1 day of debate, so \nthe hue and cry will be from the majority, the Democrats are holding up \nthe Defense bill. I want the Record to be spread with the fact that the \nDemocrats are not holding up anything on this bill. We wanted to move \nto it months ago. It has been more than 2 months reported out of \ncommittee.\n\n  Everyone knows here how I like the trains to run on time. I like this \nplace to be an orderly body to try to get things done. But this is not \nthe way to get things done. I am terribly disappointed. I have \nexpressed this personally to the majority leader. I told him what I was \ngoing to come to the floor and say. But he is also going to have \ncriticism from others.\n  Moving off this, we have other things he has already indicated he \nwould do: No. 1, the Native Hawaiian bill that the Senators from Hawaii \nhave been waiting on for years to do. He has agreed, he has given us \nhis word that we would move to that this time. When is that going to \ntake place?\n  So I am terribly disappointed. I am terribly disappointed that we are \nin a situation where we are going to move off this bill. I don't know \nwhat legislation we could do that would be more important than the \nsafety and security and to give proper resources to the men and women \nfighting all over this world in addition to giving them a pay raise.\n  Mr. President, I hope people will reconsider.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to respond to our distinguished \nminority leader. I accept full responsibility for the timing and the \nmanagement of this bill and making the decision that there would be no \nmore votes tonight. My leader has entrusted me with that power, and I \nhave so exercised it. I regret that it appears to the minority leader, \na very valued and dear colleague in this Chamber, that it is not a \nproper course of action, but I accept that. We have a difference of \nopinion.\n  The fact that we will not have votes tonight will not deter my \ndistinguished colleague and me as managers from continuing to work \nthrough amendments. We will both be here throughout tomorrow. We could \nstack a number of amendments which could be addressed on the afternoon \nof Monday at such time as the two leaders determine it would be \nappropriate.\n  As to the matter of cloture, again I accept full responsibility. This \nis the 27th Armed Services bill I have been privileged to be involved \nin. I believe that historically cloture is needed, particularly in the \nlast week when colleagues, understandably, on both sides of the aisle \nhave many matters of great interest to them and they desire to exercise \ntheir rights to amend this bill and otherwise to get a decision by the \nSenate as a body.\n  So I accept the responsibility. Whether we go ahead and as the \ncloture ripens we go forward, that is a matter I will work on with my \nleader in consultation. And if there is such progress made on a list of \namendments that remain, I would wish to take into consideration the \npossibility we might not vote on it. But I feel I have to have that in \nplace to efficiently work and manage this bill in the interim period \nbetween now and Tuesday morning.\n  But bottom line, I accept the responsibility. It is not that of the \ndistinguished majority leader.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Through the Chair to the distinguished southern gentleman--\nhe really is--the mere fact that we don't have votes tonight is the \nleast of my worries. I do say that we do more than 1 day. I would say \nto the two managers of the bill, based on what the distinguished \nchairman of the committee has said, from what I have heard, if we all \nlay down a number of amendments, the Senator would be satisfied that we \nhave done enough on the bill that he would not have to seek the \ninvocation of cloture. I don't like that. I think this is one of the \nbills where people should be able to offer amendments that they want \nto, not only on this subject but others.\n  But I hope by tomorrow when the majority leader returns, we can have \na better understanding of what is expected of the minority. We \nunderstand we are the minority, but we are a powerful minority and we \nhave rights, as the distinguished Senator from Virginia knows.\n  So again, I hope the two managers of the bill would follow the \nsuggestion of the distinguished Senator from Virginia as to what we \nneed to do to make you feel late in the session that we have done what \nneeds to be done where cloture does not have to be filed.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am curious; my sense is that in years \npast, we have on occasion had the Defense authorization bill on the \nSenate floor for some significant length of time. The reason for that \nis this bill is a very large bill, it has significant policy questions \nengrained in it, and some are very controversial.\n  I observe, as did my colleague from Nevada, I have great admiration \nfor the Senator from Virginia. He provides real leadership, as does the \nSenator from Michigan. I do hope we will not have cloture filed on this \nbill.\n  I am going to debate an amendment that will be offered in the \nmorning. I will offer an amendment around lunchtime tomorrow, a \nseparate amendment. I am sure many of our colleagues have amendments \nthey wish to offer. I hope the opportunity for full debate will be \navailable because this area is so critically important.\n  If I might take another moment, the amendment tomorrow deals with, as \nI understand it, the earth-penetrating bunker buster nuclear weapon, \nthe amendment I will offer with respect to the development of a Truman-\ntype commission to deal with contracting abuses--waste, fraud, and \nabuse, massive abuses which I will describe tomorrow. These are \nimportant issues. These are not small issues. They are big issues that \nrequire and demand significant debate and consideration.\n  I hope we will take the time we need as a Senate to sink our teeth \ninto this bill, to improve on the wonderful work that has been done by \nthe chairman and the ranking member. I hope we can avoid cloture. I do \nnot believe it is necessary. I hope we will work through next week and \nfinish a Defense authorization bill that we can all be proud of, that \nwill strengthen and advance this country's efforts.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate very much the statement of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Let me say one additional thing. If a cloture motion is filed on this \ntomorrow, I have tentatively called a Democrat caucus for 5:45 Monday \nnight. I personally am going to ask my members to not invoke cloture. \nWe are doing a disservice to the people of this country and the men and \nwomen in the military to not have the opportunity to try to improve \nthis bill. There are so many things that are left undone, some of which \nhave been named this evening, that I believe we would be remiss if we \ndid not fully debate this bill.\n  I say to my friend from Virginia--again, we are friends, and I say \nthis in the most underlined and underscored fashion--it is not fair. We \nbasically have spent today on the bill. We know what has happened \naround here in recent years. Fridays and Mondays, not much happens. We \nwill try to change that. We just have not had an opportunity to spend \nany time on this bill. I have not been here 27 years, but I have been \nhere 23 years. These Defense bills take a long time--certainly more \nthan 2 or 3 days. It is so unfair.\n  As I have indicated to those within the sound of my voice, I \nunderstand the distinguished majority leader has a lot to do. The \nSenator from Virginia is the wrong person to direct this to. We wasted \nso much time on these five judges--I don't know how many weeks, but we \nhave been in session 94 days, and we have spent 31 days on judges. That \npretty much says it all.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n\n[[Page S8656]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I remember, we spent 2 weeks of the Senate's time on \nthe bankruptcy legislation, which is basically special interest for the \ncredit card companies, and we spent 2 weeks on class action, which is \nspecial interest legislation. That is 4 weeks. We are asked now to \nspend less than a week debating the authorization for the fighting men \nand women after we spent 2 weeks for the credit card companies and 2 \nweeks for class action that will benefit special interests. And now we \nwill be asked in less than 2 or 3 days to snuff off and silence debate \non the issues affecting the men and women of this country on the first \nline of defense?\n  Mr. REID. I respond to my friend, add to that the 2 weeks and 2 \nweeks, add 31 legislative days on judges, and understand that wound up \nbeing five people, three of whom are now judges, two of whom are not. \nAs I understand it, we have more than 400,000 men and women in the \nmilitary, not counting Guard and Reserve. They are entitled to as much \ntime as we spent on bankruptcy, as much time as we spent on class \naction, and certainly as much as we spent on five people, every one of \nwhom had a job. They were not jobless.\n  There are more than 400,000 men and women, some of whom are out here \nin a hospital, in a bed because they cannot walk--at that hospital \nalone, there are more than 300 men and women who have lost limbs--and \nthey deserve more than 2 or 3 days of Senate time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding if we go through this with the \nmotion for cloture, it is the hope that we would spend the rest of next \nweek finishing this bill? Is that the game plan?\n  Mr. REID. If cloture is invoked on the underlying bill--certainly \npeople know the procedure around here better than I, but if cloture is \ninvoked Tuesday morning, say 11 o'clock, add 30 hours to that, and that \nis when we would be finished.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And there would still be amendments? I ask through the \nChair, Members could still offer amendments?\n  Mr. REID. During the 30 hours. Technically, you can.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Germane amendments.\n  Mr. REID. Make sure that people understand this: The mere fact that \nthere are amendments that are valid postcloture does not mean they will \nallow a vote on them.\n  Mr. DURBIN. We have all learned that bitter lesson.\n  Let me ask the Senator. It is not a carefully guarded secret that \npart of the reason they want to move this bill off the Senate is so \nthey can bring to the floor the National Rifle Association bill on gun \nmanufacturers' liability before we leave for the August recess. So it \nis not just a matter of cloture to move the DOD bill, the Department of \nDefense bill, it is to make room and time for the National Rifle \nAssociation, another special interest group, so that they have more \ndays to deliberate their bill than we may spend on this bill.\n  Mr. REID. Let me say to the distinguished Senator from Illinois in \nresponse to the question, the majority leader has the right to pull \nthis bill. He can do that. He does not need to get cloture. Even though \nI would not be happy with doing that, he could go ahead anytime he \nwants to move off this bill and move to anything he wants to do because \nthey have more votes than we have. He could do that. But at least if he \ndid that, we could have an opportunity to complete this bill in an \norderly fashion, not cut off debate willy-nilly.\n  So the answer to my distinguished friend's question is yes, but what \nit appears the majority wants to do is blame the minority for not \nallowing the Defense bill to go forward, and it has nothing to do with \nus. He has the right, today, to move off this and move on to gun \nliability, native Hawaiians, estate tax, flag burning, and all the \nother threats we have had around here.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Another question to the Senator from Nevada, and I think \nI know the answer: Is there anything more important than finishing the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill in an orderly fashion when a \nnation is at war and men and women are risking their lives, as the \nSenator from Nevada noted?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my distinguished friend, we completed the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill last week. That was a pretty important \nbill because it protects our Nation. If we are not so inclined to help \nthe men and women who have signed up to represent us and defend this \ncountry, this is not a good sign for this Senate. Therefore, I truly \nbelieve there is nothing more important that we could be doing in this \nSenate than finishing this bill in an orderly fashion. To think we will \nhave one normal voting day on this--that is what it will amount to--\nbefore cloture is invoked. One day. Thursday. That is it because we do \nnot work around here on Mondays and Fridays.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask one last question of the Senator from Nevada. It is \nmy understanding today we have had two votes on this bill.\n  Mr. REID. We had one unanimous consent vote today on DOD and a vote \non the Lugar amendment. I thought there would be something on Boy \nScouts, but that never came to be, on an amendment offered by the \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might ask the Senator, it is my understanding there are \nmany amendments pending right now that we could debate.\n  Mr. REID. I believe there are six--I could be wrong, but something \nlike that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have one pending.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Thirteen amendments pending.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my colleagues, I accept the responsibility. I \nlistened carefully to these points. I suggest we all do our very best \nbetween now and Tuesday morning to put together a record of \naccomplishments to have the votes--they can be set up quite easily \ntomorrow, tonight, Monday--and we will reassess this situation.\n  Clearly, with the representations that underlie your statements that \nwe need to move forward, with that momentum on that side, I would be \nvery happy to match it on this side. I assure you it will be \nforthcoming. But I am not going to sit here and recount the number of \ninstances today I have worked with Senators on both sides of the \naisle--of which my distinguished colleague is aware--who, for various \nreasons, could not do this or that. And I respect that. But we have had \na reasonable amount of work achieved today. So might I suggest at this \npoint in time that we have made our case with all points. I accept \nresponsibility. Let's go forward and see what we can achieve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there is nobody in this body I would rather \nwork with than Senator Warner. We have had this relationship, which is \na very warm one, for as long as we have both been here, and we have \nbeen here the same length of time.\n  I want to tell Senator Warner we are doing something unusual tomorrow \nand Monday in an effort to address the amendments which people want to \noffer. We are lining up people to speak on amendments, although they \ncannot get votes. Traditionally around here, there has been great \nresistance--and understandably--to offering amendments on one day if \nyou cannot get a vote on that day because people want votes to come \nshortly after the debate so it will be fresh in people's mind.\n  We are making every effort to move this bill. We are having people \nlined up. We have them for tomorrow. We have them for Monday. We are \nwilling, just in order to expedite consideration of this bill, to \ndebate the bill on a Friday, although the votes cannot occur until a \nTuesday. We are moving heaven and Earth. We are going out of our way to \nbring up amendments. But it is utterly unfair that a cloture motion be \nadopted which will cut off the opportunity of other Members to offer \namendments under this circumstance. We are not delaying it. We are \nexpediting this bill in every single way we know.\n  In terms of the question asked by a number of my colleagues, I cannot \nremember a Defense bill that just had 1 day for votes. Typically, we \nspend a good week on debate, maybe more--2 weeks, 3 weeks--on a Defense \nauthorization bill. The idea that the cloture is filed on the second \nday to cut off debate on amendments seems to me unthinkable.\n\n[[Page S8657]]\n\n  These are amendments aimed at improving this bill, strengthening this \nbill. That is the motive. We all have the same goal. We may differ when \nit comes to votes, but the motive is to strengthen this bill, to offer \ngreater support for the men and women in the military. The idea that \nany one of those amendments might be cut off because technically they \nare not germane--although they are relevant--seems to me unthinkable.\n  I hope, No. 1, we will make progress; No. 2, that the majority would \nthink about filing a cloture motion under these circumstances which \nwould deny an opportunity to strengthen a bill which is so important to \nthe men and women in the military.\n  Mr. WARNER. Now, Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan and I have cleared amendments. I would like to do them. Then I \nwish to entertain a colloquy with my colleague from South Dakota. \nPerhaps I will undergo that colloquy at this time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1389\n\n  Again, the Senator has very cooperative in bringing this amendment to \nthe attention of the Senate. I have had a few minutes to go over it. \nLet's see if we can, as best we are able, define certain parameters \nwith regard to the goals of this amendment and its impact on the \nexisting law. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \ndetailed listing of the BRAC timeline.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           2005 BRAC TIMELINE\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSECDEF sends initial selection criteria to  December 31, 2003\n defense committees.\nPresident submits proposed force            February 1, 2004\n structure.a.\nSec/Def sends final selection criteria to   February 16, 2004\n defense committees; publishes criteria in\n Federal Register.\nCriteria final, unless disapproved by Act   March 15, 2004\n of Congress.\nCongress receives interim report of         March 31, 2005\n Overseas Basing Commission.b.\nPresident transmits nine nominees for BRAC  NLT March 15, 2005\n Commission to Senate for advice, consent\n and confirmation.c.\nSECDEF sends closure/realignment list to    NLT May 16, 2005\n Commission and defense committees;\n publishes in Federal Register.\nGAO reviews DOD's list; reports findings    July 1, 2005\n to President/defense committees.\nCommission sends its recommendations to     NLT September 8, 2005\n President.\nPresident reviews Sec/Def's and             NLT September 23, 2005\n Commission's list of recommendations and\n reports to Congress.d.\nCommission may submit revised list in       NLT October 20, 2005\n response to President's request for\n reconsideration.\nFinal date for the President to approve     November 7, 2005\n and submit BRAC list to Congress (or\n process is terminated)e.\nWork of the closure/realignment Commission  April 15, 2006\n is terminated.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\na SECDEF has option to submit revised force structure to Congress by Mar\n  15, 2005.\nb Established by Congress in P.L. 108-132. Report date extended in PL\n  108-324.\nc If President does not send nominations by required date, process is\n  terminated.\nd President prepares report containing approval or disapproval.\ne Congress has 45 days to pass disapproving motion, or list becomes law.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. We have completed the GAO reviews of the DOD list and \nreported findings to the President and defense committees. That was \ndone July 1. We are in the process and the Commission is having a \nseries of hearings all across the country. The Commission sends its \nrecommendations to the President on September 8. Thereafter, the \nPresident reviews the recommendations of the Secretary of Defense and \nthe Commission's list of recommendations and reports to the \nCongress. That is September 23. Then the Commission may submit a \nrevised list in response to the President's request no later than \nOctober 20. And the final date for the President to approve and submit \nthe BRAC list to the Congress, or the process is terminated, is \nNovember 7. So that frames the current timetable.\n\n  Now, as I look over the Senator's--and I will go first to page 2, the \nsection entitled: ``Actions Required Before Base Closure Round.''\n\n       The actions referred to in subsection (a)--\n\n  And that is essentially the timetable I have recounted here--\n\n     are the following actions:\n       (A) The complete analysis, consideration, and, where \n     appropriate, implementation by the Secretary of Defense of \n     the recommendations of the Commission on Review of Overseas \n     Military Facility Structure of the United States.\n\n  I draw your attention to the word ``implementation.'' Now, this \nreport, if finished, will be released August 15. But the \nimplementation--I certainly have no facts before me at this time by \nwhich I could even conjecture how long it would take the Secretary of \nDefense to implement the recommendations of the Commission on Review of \nOverseas Military Facility Structure of the United States. So there is \nno determinate date at which time the provisions in (A) can be \nestimated; is that correct?\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the first criteria that deals with the \nOverseas BRAC Commission's findings and report would suggest that until \nthose recommendations, until the analysis is complete, until that \nreport has been carefully analyzed, and then ultimately it says \nimplemented, ``where appropriate,'' by the Secretary of Defense is the \ncondition to be met. It does not specify a specific date when that \nhappens.\n  I think the answer, through the Chair, to the chairman's question is \nthat the notion of having a domestic round of closures occur before \ndecisions are made with respect to the basing needs overseas and some \nof the recommendations that have been brought forward by the Overseas \nBRAC Commission--that process would be completed prior to the \nimplementation of the domestic BRAC recommendations.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, our colloquy is addressed through the \nChair. It is the word ``implementation.'' It could be that analysis \ncould be completed--consideration. But the ``implementation'' leaves an \nindeterminate date for (A). I think we both agree on that point.\n  Going to the next point:\n\n       The return from deployment in the Iraq theater of \n     operations of substantially all (as determined by the \n     Secretary of Defense) major combat units and assets of the \n     Armed Forces.\n\n  Now, our President, I think quite wisely, and the Secretary of \nDefense have avoided any reference to a timetable with respect to the \nachieving of our goals in Iraq; namely, allowing that country to form \nits government, to provide for itself that measure of security to \nprotect the sovereignty and, hopefully, law and order in that country, \nat which time it is expected that our President and the coalition \nleaders will make a determination as to the redeployment from the \ntheater in Iraq of substantially all of the major combat units. So that \nclearly is a very difficult condition to meet in terms of when that \ncould be completed, that with even conjecture, we cannot anticipate \nwhen that will be completed--unless you have facts that I am not aware \nof.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the Chair giving me \nan opportunity to respond to the question. I think what the Senator \nfrom Virginia is asking is if there is a definitive timetable in the \namendment. The answer is no, there is not. This does not involve a \ntimetable. We are not suggesting in this amendment that there be any \ntimetable. All we are simply saying is that the Secretary of Defense \ncan determine at what point the return from deployment of personnel who \nare stationed in Iraq as a result of some drawdown of the operation \nthere is substantial. That is a determination which, as you can see, we \nleave to the Secretary of Defense.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, it is the words ``return from deployment.'' That, \nclearly, in the mind of this Senator, means all the major, as \ndetermined by the Secretary of Defense, combat units. It is not \ndifficult for me to define what are major combat units. What I cannot \nestimate in any way reasonably, and nor should I, because it would \nimpinge upon the President's decision--a correct one--not to try to set \na timetable. So anyway, I will move on. But that is a very \nindeterminate condition, to me.\n  We then go to (C). Now, I am told that report is likely to be \nfinished by March of next year.\n  Then let's go now to (D):\n\n       The complete development and implementation by the \n     Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security \n     of the National Maritime Security Strategy.\n\n  Now, I can possibly conjecture or maybe even estimate when the \ndevelopment would be completed by the two Secretaries, but I certainly \nwould not be able to determine, nor can anyone else, in my judgment, \nwhen there would be implementation. So there is another open-ended \ncriteria. Am I incorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. I thank you, Mr. President.\n  I say to the Senator from Virginia, if you are looking for, again, a \nspecific timeline on this, I think these were probably condition (D) \nand condition\n\n[[Page S8658]]\n\n(E) you were referring to. It may be more easily defined if you are \nlooking for a specific time, although I do not think that is specified \nhere. But these are conditions. These are not specific timelines. We \nare not saying that the BRAC shall be delayed until March of 2006, \nalthough with the QDR that becomes a little more clear.\n\n  But these are conditions in the same way that I think our military \nleadership and the President have said the withdrawal from Iraq ought \nto be condition-based. These are conditions that would have to be met \nbefore the domestic BRAC recommendations would be implemented.\n  Mr. WARNER. What I am trying to convey, Mr. President, to my \ndistinguished colleague is that the criteria you have established for a \nnew timetable, which, again, is in a subsequent paragraph--that is in \nparagraph (2) on page 4--and I read it--\n\n       The report required under subparagraph (F) of paragraph (1) \n     shall be submitted not later than one year after the \n     occurrence of the last action described in subparagraphs (A) \n     through (E) of such paragraph.\n\n  So you add possibly up to a year on a whole set of indeterminate \nschedules up here. Now, I think I have made my point.\n  I want to put this question to the Senator. As our colleagues have \nthe opportunity--as we are now doing--to look at this and to either \ndetermine how best they can vote to protect the interests of their \nState and to protect the interests of the country, as we go through \nthis very difficult process of BRAC this is my fifth one. It is not \neasy. I think they have to suddenly recognize the indeterminate \nschedule, as laid out by this amendment, will hold in limbo the whole \nBRAC process for, it could be, up to 2 years. I just throw the quick \nestimate out of 2 years. That 2-year period poses a frightful situation \nfor the communities that will have had by that time the report of the \nBRAC Commission, which will send its recommendations to the President \non September 8.\n  So this amendment does not stop that process going forward. I am \ncorrect on that; am I not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, again, the Senator from Virginia is correct \nin that the timeline you gave me, the current BRAC timeline, is not \nimpacted until the President would act and make the recommendation to \nthe Congress.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is fine. But on September 8, all the communities \nwould know what is final, what is decided by the Commission on the \nPresident's original list that went up, which bases, facilities will be \nclosed, realigned, whatever the case may be. It is a wide spectrum of \ndecisions. Then they are subject to other additions, which they are in \nthe process of going through. And they are permitted by law.\n  So there it is: The BRAC Commission report is out, and these \ncommunities have to now cope with the high probability, under this \namendment, were it to be adopted--2 years have lapsed. In the meantime, \nhow can they attract new business as a consequence of such facility, \nthe military they have? The businesses that are serving indirectly or \ndirectly the military facilities in that community, do they decide to \nput in new capital and continue to modernize their business to do their \nresponsible actions to support that facility?\n  You put a cloud of indecision and doubt over all the communities that \nwill be affected by this September 8 decision. And BRAC is onerous in \nits own schedule right here. It is extremely hard. And now to take and \nhold these communities, literally, in irons for a period of 2 years \nuntil, if the amendment were adopted, certain adjustments might be made \nin the final Presidential decision--I just find this amendment, with \nall due respect to my good friend and colleague, who is a member of our \ncommittee, as one that will impose on communities a very severe \nhardship. I am not sure the Congress will want to do that. I say that \nto you in all respect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, if I could respond to the very \ndistinguished chairman of our committee. And I do appreciate his \nleadership on our committee. I appreciate his sensitivity to the impact \nthat these decisions are going to have on communities all across this \ncountry.\n  But I would also submit that when the conditions are met, a timeline \nshould not be a prerequisite where national security is involved. This \nis the exact same argument we are now making with respect to our \ninvolvement in Iraq, that we cannot subscribe to a specific timeline. \nIt is a conditions-based approach that we are adopting there. This \nwould simply say that these are conditions that, when they are met, \nwould trigger that next step in the BRAC process, which ultimately is \nthe approval by this body. It comes back to the Congress.\n  The Congress would have an opportunity, then, after they have \nevaluated the recommendations in the QDR, after they have gotten a \nbetter handle on that and the Defense Department has had a chance to \nreview the recommendations with respect to overseas basing needs and we \nhave gotten a better idea about what our domestic needs are going to be \nwhen these troops start returning to this country. I think those are \nconditions for which at this point in time it is unwise for us to be \nmoving forward at this fast pace.\n  I would simply add what the Overseas Basing Commission in their \nrecommendations said; and that is, if the Congress moves too quickly on \ndomestic basing decisions, it could weaken our global posture and, \nfurthermore, that we need to proceed with caution. I believe that the \nconditions we have included here are things that, as a Congress--as a \nMember of the Senate--I would want to know before I make a vote on a \nfinal list of recommendations.\n  Now, the Senator is correct, it is fair to say there will be \ncommunities, after August 22, perhaps--which I think is when the markup \nis--that will know whether they are on or off the list.\n  At the same time, what we are saying is, those communities may or may \nnot stay on that list. In fact, when the Congress has had an \nopportunity to review some of these conditions that are included in \nthis legislation, they may decide not to vote in favor of those \nrecommendations. I don't think the door is closed, I say to the Senator \nfrom Virginia, at the time when the list is approved by the BRAC \nCommission and submitted to the President.\n  Mr. WARNER. One last point, and then perhaps the distinguished \nranking member would like to be engaged in this debate. One of the \naspects of the BRAC process that has always troubled this Senator is \nthe duty, beginning with the Governor of the State and the \ncongressional delegation, to encourage the communities, with their \nsupport, to do everything they can to question such decisions as may be \nmade regarding installations within that State and the several \ncommunities.\n  In doing so, they engage in those activities which are quite normal--\nhire lobbyists, experts to come in and help them. That whole \ninfrastructure then essentially has to be kept in place for maybe up to \nanother 2 years at an enormous cost to these communities. I will argue \nstrenuously, when we get into further debate on the Senator's \namendment, that the amendment, no matter how well-intended, will \ninflict on communities across this land affected by BRAC an unusual \npunishment that certainly I do not believe any of us would want to do.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. THUNE. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. THUNE. If I could make one comment, I understand what the \nchairman is saying with respect to some of these communities. I think a \nlot of these communities would welcome the opportunity to keep fighting \nfor a couple of years. I also know firsthand, because I have a \ncommunity that is involved, about the costs that are associated with a \nlong, drawn-out, protracted campaign. Many of these communities have \nbeen in that process literally since the last round in 1995. Much of \nthat expense concludes when the BRAC makes its recommendation. For all \nintents and purposes, what you are left with, once the recommendations \nare out there, is final approval by the President and the Congress. My \nassumption would be that in terms of the cost for consultants and all \nthe costs\n\n[[Page S8659]]\n\nassociated with analyzing data and making presentations to the BRAC, \nmany of those costs are now sunk. Those are costs that are going to be \nconcluded, by the time August 22nd rolls around and these \nrecommendations are out there.\n  I hear what the chairman is saying. I don't think that is an issue \nthat many of these communities that are fighting to keep their bases \nare most concerned with. I think they would welcome the opportunity to \nkeep the fight going.\n  Mr. WARNER. My last question on that point, there will be an enormous \namount of data generated, information and decisionmaking that will take \nplace should the Senator's amendment become law. Is he suggesting that \nthe communities then will have no participation in the deliberations as \nto how that data may or may not affect the decision of the Secretary of \nDefense regarding the prior decision of the Base Closure Commission and \nhow the Secretary of Defense is to advocate? I just cannot see this \namount of data and decision being made by all of these various \ntribunals and organizations and that the communities just have to sit \nthere and fold their hands and let the executive branch go backwards \nand forwards until the President then submits something to the \nCongress.\n  Mr. THUNE. I am not sure I fully understand the question except that \nit seems to me if what you are suggesting is that somehow they are \ngoing to continue, once the BRAC Commission makes its final \nrecommendations, to have to appeal this to the Secretary of Defense, I \ndon't understand the process to work that way. Ultimately, what they \nare left with is a decision by the President and final subsequent \napproval by the Congress. It seems to me, once you get past this point \nin the process, when August 22nd is reached and those recommendations \nare made by the BRAC Commission, it then becomes a function of the \nPresident.\n  What our bill would do is trigger the BRAC period moving forward, \ngoing forward from the time the recommendations are submitted to \nCongress, the 45-day period. So most communities would then be lobbying \nmembers of their congressional delegation, if they are on the list, I \nsuspect, to vote no when that final vote would come.\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand that. But it seems to me, if you look at all \nof the information, data, reports in A, B, C, D, E, and F, to me, in \nfairness, the communities should have some involvement as to how that \ninformation may or may not impact the decision with regard to their \ncommunity rendered by the BRAC Commission. I just can't see that \neverybody is going to fold their hands. If you are going to delay it \nfor 2 years, some provision should be made to allow the active \nparticipation, once again, by the communities after this massive amount \nof data is brought into the public domain. I make that observation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, one final observation. My expectation would \nbe that if we get this, if there is a download of information as a \nresult of QDR and some of these other conditions that we impose, that \nCongress would hold hearings. The public would have an opportunity, \nthrough a congressional process, through their elected representatives, \nto be heard on the subject that the conditions would address.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I, too, oppose the amendment for the \nreasons which were set forth by the chairman. But, in addition, I have \nsome other thoughts about this process. Each one of our States has gone \nthrough a tremendous period of anxiety. As it turns out, some of that \nanxiety was well based because they are on the list. For those States \nthat did better than expected or better than their worst fears, it \nseems to me this amendment will throw them right back into that state \nof anxiety because by definition, this makes it more likely because of \nthe uncertainty that is injected. And because of the delay in the final \ndisposition, more States will be thrown right back into the position of \nbeing very nervous and anxious as to whether their bases and their \nfacilities might be hit by a base-closing round. In other words, there \nis no finality. It is a totally uncertain finish, not just 2 years.\n  We don't know when substantially all major combat units from Iraq \nwill be withdrawn. I would be very concerned that in addition to the \narguments which the Senator from Virginia made, we have many States \nthat hired consultants, that made major presentations, that now are \ngoing to be put back into a state of limbo because they will then say: \nWell, we are not going to know whether we are basically off the hook \nfor years, potentially many years. So those that breathe a sigh of \nrelief by this list or did better than their worst fears or better than \nexpected are now going to be put in a position where they are going to \nhave to say: This could go on for years. We better keep these \nconsultants on board. We better continue to be nervous about this for \nsome indefinite period of time.\n  There are many uncertainties that are created and a great degree of \npain that will be inflicted if we continue this process for some \nunlimited period.\n  As I understand the Senator's amendment, he would complete the \nprocess through the Presidential decision.\n  Mr. THUNE. The Senator from Michigan is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That means that while the Senator sets forth arguments for \nwhy all this information is essential before a congressional decision, \nthe Presidential decision would be made before all of this information \nis available?\n  Mr. THUNE. That would be correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think there is a deep illogic in that. To the extent you \nwould want to delay something so that Congress could have information, \nwhich I think would be a mistake for the reasons given, to the extent \nthere is logic in that, the President should have the same information \nbefore making his decision as the Congress arguably should have.\n  Again, for reasons given by Senator Warner and myself, I think it \nwould be a mistake to create the state of limbo which would result from \nthe adoption of this amendment. It also has that degree of illogic in \nit as well.\n  Finally, I ask the chairman, so that we can get the precise position \nof the administration on this, whether we could reasonably expect that \nat least by Monday we could have a letter from the administration \nrelating to the specifics of this amendment. I know we have a general \nposition of the administration.\n  Mr. WARNER. What we do have already is a statement by the President \nthat any effort to delay or impede the BRAC process would lead to a \nveto, with such clarity in my mind. By the way, an amendment, if I may \nadvise my good friend, quite similar to this amendment was considered \nby the House and defeated by a vote of 112 for and 316 against, or \nsomething.\n  I think our colleague should know if this ever got into the bill, the \nPresident would have to veto the bill. We would have to start all over \nagain on the Defense bill. I don't know when we would do it. But \ncertainly if the House is any guide, it was thoroughly rejected.\n  Am I not correct in that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. If the Senator from Virginia would yield, the response to \nyour question is that you are correct. The House did have a vote on an \namendment. There was a BRAC amendment. But it was not this amendment. \nIt was an amendment that would essentially do away with or delay the \nentire BRAC process. In other words, the BRAC Commission would not be \nable, under the House amendment, to complete its work. This allows the \nBRAC Commission to continue with their work product and respects the \nBRAC process, but simply slows down the implementation of those \nrecommendations until these certain conditions are met.\n  And with respect to the question of the Senator from Michigan \nregarding the so-called illogic of having the President weigh in on \nthis, frankly, this Senator would like to know this type of information \nbefore we cast votes on whether we are going to close bases. I, \nfrankly, don't know, nor does anybody on the floor this evening, what \nis in the QDR. I have some assumptions about that, but I happen to \nbelieve we may be surprised by some of the findings, some of the \nstrategies that are going to be laid out when that\n\n[[Page S8660]]\n\nQDR comes out, and what some of the weapon systems needs are and what \nsome of the basing needs are. We are the elected representatives of the \npeople. We represent the people of our respective States. In my view, \nwe should be the ones who review this type of information before we \nmake votes on shuttering bases across the country. As a member of the \nArmed Services Committee, and my chairman and distinguished ranking \nmember are here, I think we have a responsibility before we make \ndecisions of this consequence and this magnitude about bases that may \nnever be able to be opened again. Once we shut these things down, they \nare shut down for good.\n  There are a lot of questions that remain unanswered about the QDR, \nabout basing needs overseas, about what our needs are going to be when \nthose troops start coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan from other \ntheaters.\n  I appreciate and respect the leaders of this committee on their \nthoughts. I understand their opposition to this amendment. Frankly, I \nwould urge my colleagues who look at these issues and are concerned \nabout moving forward too quickly on decisions that have enormous and \nmajor consequences, not only for the communities that are impacted but \nfor the national security of the United States of America, that without \nhaving this kind of information, it seems to me at least that many of \nthe decisions are, at a minimum, very premature.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our colleague. We have had quite a \ngood debate. I am prepared to move on, subject to the views of my \ncolleague.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I think it is important that in addition to \ngetting the general views of the administration about the importance of \nthis BRAC process proceeding for the reasons they have set forth, the \nlanguage of this amendment be forwarded to them. I will give an example \nof why.\n  As I understand it, one of the impacts of the amendment would be that \nit would be difficult, if not impossible, for the Army to bring back to \nthe United States about 49,000 personnel and their families because \nthose relocations back to the United States are dependent upon certain \nsteps being taken as proposed in the BRAC process. We are leaving a lot \nof people in limbo overseas, I believe--that is our conclusion--but I \nwould like to hear from the Defense Department as to the specific \nramifications of this kind of delay, in addition to the reasons they \nhave already given for opposing any delay or cancellation of the BRAC \nprocess. So I agree with our chairman that they are very clear that \nthey would veto this bill if this kind of amendment passes.\n  But in terms of the argument on the amendment, there are practical \nproblems, in addition to the ones already raised by the Defense \nDepartment, that they may want to raise if we get them the language. I \nhope that over the weekend the chairman will forward the language to \nthe Defense Department.\n  Mr. WARNER. Rest assured, that will be done. I will prepare a letter. \nThe Senator from Michigan and I will be here tomorrow morning and \nperhaps we can make a joint request outlining precisely what our views \nare.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I hope the Senator from South Dakota, if available \ntomorrow or Monday, if there is further debate on this amendment, might \nbe present or be able to listen to the debate so he could respond to \nit.\n  Mr. WARNER. I anticipate that the reply from the administration would \nbe forthcoming on Monday. I think the Senator would be available to \ndebate this matter later in the afternoon.\n  Mr. THUNE. I will, and I welcome the opportunity to come to the floor \nand speak to it as well.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator has a very distinguished list of cosponsors, \nI might add.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And an even more distinguished list of opponents. Just \nkidding. The hour is late.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in great seriousness, referring to the \ncosponsors, they are Senators Lieberman, Snowe, Lautenberg, Johnson, \nDodd, Collins, Corzine, Bingaman, and Domenici.\n  I stick by my words that it is a distinguished list of cosponsors.\n  Mr. THUNE. I thank the chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the managers wish to advise the Senate \nthat we have accomplished a good deal today, and we will be fully in \nbusiness tomorrow, with the exception of rollcall votes. It is our hope \nand expectation that we can go through a number of amendments and stack \nthose votes for a time to be decided by leadership.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I think we can move off of the bill and do \nsuch wrap-up as is necessary.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/21/senate-section/article/S8660-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to pay tribute to \nformer Senator Jim Exon, a friend and colleague, who passed away on \nJune 10, 2005.\n  Jim Exon is a legend in his own State. For almost three decades, he \nserved the people of Nebraska as both Governor and Senator. And through \ndedication and the force of his personality, he almost singlehandedly \nfounded the Democratic Party in his State. In his entire career, he \nnever lost an election because his constituents recognized his basic \ndecency and common sense.\n  However, Jim Exon didn't only serve his Nebraska constituents. He \nalso served his country and our Government in ways that we could sorely \nuse today. He was, of course, a patriot and World War II veteran who \nbrought his wartime experience to his important role on defense \nmatters. But beyond his obvious love of country, Jim Exon especially \nloved his country's democracy, which he saw as the crucial spark \nanimating the American community.\n  Jim Exon relished forthright debate and always had tremendous faith \nin the fairness of our system of Government. But while he advanced his \nbeliefs with conviction and passion, he also listened to those with \nwhom he disagreed. Indeed, he was renowned as a fair and considerate \nlawmaker who routinely sought common ground with adversaries out of \ngenuine sympathy for their concerns.\n  Jim Exon's facility for finding common ground with others stemmed \nfrom his roots in America's heartland. In rural areas and small towns, \nneighbors must depend on one another. People in the country rely on \npragmatism to solve problems, having little patience with argument for \nits own sake. Jim Exon brought these Midwestern values to his work, \nfighting openly for his beliefs, while still playing a cooperative and \nconstructive role in resolving differences.\n  Given his ability to see the point of view of others, it's hardly \nsurprising that Jim Exon made abundant legislative contributions. I was \nprivileged to serve on the Senate Budget Committee with him, where he \nfought to keep our Nation's fiscal house in order. Here, too, his \napproach was balanced, offering a fierce opposition to wasting taxpayer \nmoney on unjustified spending, while maintaining an abiding faith in \neffective government. Most importantly in this area, he recognized that \nlawmakers must resist the temptation to use public debt to shift \ncurrent burdens onto future taxpayers. To Jim Exon, skyrocketing \nFederal debt was a shameful legacy to leave our children.\n  Senator Exon also understood the wisdom of investing in the family \nfarmer, the backbone of rural communities. A tireless advocate of rural \neconomic development, he was one of the first to recognize the \nimportance of ethanol as fuel, a renewable energy source that we \nproduce here at home. And he fought for better transportation, better \nmedical care, and better\n\n[[Page S8661]]\n\nschools for rural areas facing special challenges.\n  Jim Exon also worked to keep America's military strong. A veteran of \nthe South Pacific in World War II, he never wavered in his commitment \nto our Armed Forces. He played a crucial role on the Armed Services \nCommittee in the aftermath of communism's collapse. Thanks in large \nmeasure to his efforts, our military remained the mightiest in the \nworld, even though its mission was reoriented to face the challenges of \nthe post-Cold War world. He worked tirelessly to contain nuclear \nproliferation.\n  Jim Exon accomplished much during his three terms here in the Senate. \nThat's not surprising given the kind of man he was. He lacked pretense. \nHe would tell you straight out what he believed, and he listened \ncarefully to others. And he was fair. He brought Senators together by \nfocusing on shared interests, rather than differences.\n  Jim Exon was a big hearty man who loved to laugh. His deep, rolling \nbaritone had an infectious good humor and compassion behind it that won \nover others. He was effective, in part, because people liked to work \nwith him.\n  I will miss my good friend and colleague. His accomplishments live \nafter him. The Nation and the people of Nebraska will long remember the \nstandards of integrity and decency that were the hallmarks of Jim \nExon's service to his country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/21/senate-section/article/S8661-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING THE MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

I especially commend Dr. Laurence Ronan, the \ngroup leader at MGH who did so much to organize the trip.\n  These dedicated health professionals answered the urgent call when \nthe disaster struck.

FLETCHER\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we should all take a moment today to honor \nthe life and the work of Arthur Fletcher. Considered ``the father of \naffirmative action,'' he advised four Presidential administrations and \nnever missed an opportunity to advance the interests of underserved \npeople throughout the Nation. Today, Mr. Fletcher is being laid to \nrest, after a distinguished life of public service.\n  As an affirmative action supporter, Mr. Fletcher identified with \nAbraham Lincoln's legacy and felt that in order to make the greatest \nchanges he needed to work from inside the political system. He was \nappointed by President Nixon to be the Assistant Secretary of Wage and \nLabor Standards. From this position, he developed ``the revised \nPhiladelphia Plan'' which became the blueprint for affirmative action \nplans, creating a framework for employers to use in hiring. He \ncontinued to advise three more presidents: He was the Deputy Urban \nAffairs Adviser for President Gerald R. Ford, an adviser to President \nRonald Reagan, and the Chairman of the Civil Rights Commission between \n1990 and 1993. During his service in these administrations, Mr. \nFletcher never shied away from addressing the most challenging \nopposition as he worked to expand equality and opportunity.\n  Mr. Fletcher is probably best known for the phrase, ``a mind is a \nterrible thing to waste'' which he helped develop while serving as the \nexecutive director of the United Negro College Fund, however his \ninfluence was more far reaching. For example, Mr. Fletcher personally \nhelped finance the lawsuit against the Topeka Board of Education in the \nlandmark Brown v. Board of Education case, which successfully sought to \ndesegregate the Topeka public school system.\n  His interests seemed to know no bounds as he played football for the \nLos Angeles Rams and then became the first African American player for \nthe Baltimore Colts. He ran for high public office, including President \nof the United States in 1996, always to advance the virtues of \naffirmative action.\n  As a lifetime advocate Arthur Fletcher himself was a story of \naffirmative action, not only working for the advancement of others but \nblazing a trail for others to follow of hard work and determination. \nHis contributions to American society have benefited millions and \nraised the lifestyles of African Americans and all traditionally \nunderserved people across our country. His family can take pride in the \ngreat strides that our country has made as a result of his hard work.\n  My deepest sympathy goes out to his three children, his many \ngrandchildren, and of course his wife Bernyce Hassan-Fletcher. His \nlegacy lives on in all of us who believe in the struggle for racial and \ngender equality and who continue to fight for equal opportunity for \nall. He will be greatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/21/senate-section/article/S8661-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8661-S8662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              HONORING THE LIFE OF MR. ALFRED WILLIAM EDEL\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am saddened to report the \npassing of one of the most innovative news personalities in South \nDakota broadcasting history, Alfred William Edel.\n  On July 3, South Dakota and the broadcasting industry lost a veteran \nradio and television reporter to cancer. Al's extraordinary \ncontributions to news media set him apart from other dedicated \nreporters.\n  Born in Buffalo, NY, in 1935, Al received his bachelor's degree from \nthe College of Wooster, OH, in 1957, and then went on to secure his \nmaster's degree in communications from Syracuse University in 1959. \nFollowing his graduation from Syracuse, Al became a radio broadcaster \nand editor at WKBW in his hometown of Buffalo. Although his time at \nWKBW was short, it was clear from the start that his deep, booming \nvoice would take him far.\n  In 1960, Al joined the Department of Defense's American Forces \nNetwork, AFN, in Frankfurt, Germany. Al worked as a news writer and \nanchor, relaying the news to millions of GIs and American civilians \nstationed throughout the continent. The local community quickly \nappreciated and welcomed his quick understanding of the region's issues \nand his innate ability to infuse humor into his insightful and succinct \nreports. Interestingly, Al's two sons, Scot and Tod, were both born in \nthe U.S. Army's 97th General Hospital in Frankfurt. As a result of his \nsuccess in Germany, Al was promoted to chief of AFN's London news \nbureau in 1961. Following his term in London, Al, his wife Lee, and \ntheir two children packed up and moved back to the U.S. in 1966. At \nthat time, he anchored ABC Radio's newscasts that aired daily \nthroughout our Nation.\n  Eager to try his hand in television, Al left ABC in 1970 to accept a \nposition as prime-time news anchor at KSOO-TV in Sioux Falls, SD. KSOO \nwould later become KSFY, which continues to broadcast today. As a \nmember of KSOO-TV's team, Al and the news bureau nearly led the market \nwith their tenacity and determination to cover all the news, even if \ntheir competitors were not interested in the story. Steve Hemmingsen, a \nreporter for KELO-Land News, recalls that Al and KSOO-TV went ``the \nextra mile to cover stories that KELO didn't think of covering. General \nDouglas MacArthur's `hit 'em where they ain't' philosophy of war \ntransposed to television. [Al] helped wake [KELO] up and changed the \nway we do business.'' In addition to his ubiquitous strategy, Al's \nfamous, deep, rumbling ``Good evening,'' and his trademark, ``Rest \neasy'' lured viewers to his program.\n  Despite his success and popularity in South Dakota, Al accepted an \noffer in 1980 and moved to Washington as a\n\n[[Page S8662]]\n\nnews writer for ``Good Morning America.'' Subsequently, in 1982, he \nmoved across town to become a radio anchor for the government's ``Voice \nof America station'' that broadcasts around the world via shortwave.\n  Al retired from ``Voice of America'' in 1997, having worked in the \nbusiness for nearly 40 years. In 2001, he and his wife Lee moved to St. \nGeorge, UT, where he lived out his remaining years.\n  It is an honor for me to share Al's accomplishments with my \ncolleagues and to publicly commend the talent and commitment to \nbroadcasting he always exhibited throughout his life. His dedication to \nproviding the public with accurate, insightful, and original \ninformation serves as his greatest legacy, and his work continues to \ninspire all those who knew him. South Dakota and the broadcasting \nindustry are far better because of Al's life, and while we miss him \nvery much, the best way to honor his memory is to emulate the passion \nand enthusiasm he shared with others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/21/senate-section/article/S8662-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING THE COMMUNITY OF MILBANK, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and publicly \nrecognize the 125th anniversary of the founding of Milbank, SD. I would \nlike to take this opportunity to draw attention to and commemorate the \nachievements and history of this charming city that stands as an \nenduring tribute to the fortitude and pioneer spirit of the earliest \nDakotans.\n  Located in Grant County in northeastern South Dakota, Milbank got its \nstart with the help of the railroad, specifically the Milwaukee line. \nPrior to the establishment of Milbank, the Milwaukee Railroad only went \nas far west as Ortonville, MN however, in 1880 it was extended to \nMilbank, a deserted section of prairie consisting of a solitary sod \nshanty. The railroad's arrival quickly gave rise to the town. Milbank \nis, in fact, named for Jeremiah Milbank, director of the Hastings \ndivision of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad. Platted in \n1880, the town was originally called the Village of Milbank Junction.\n  Construction of the tracks was completed in July of 1880; however, at \nthat point, the town was still in its earliest stages. As a result, \neveryone in the region ``who could handle a saw and hammer'' was \nsummoned to help construct buildings. Development plans were running \nsmoothly until a blizzard struck on October 25, 1880. The blizzard \nlasted 3 days, impeding not only the building process, but all local \nbusiness.\n  In hindsight, this storm turned out to be a sign of the difficult \ntimes Milbank would experience in its next few years. Due to the heavy \nsnow storms and high drifts, rail service throughout the winter of \n1880-81 was sporadic, at best. In fact, the spring proved to be more \ntreacherous than the winter, as Milbank was hit with a series of \nblizzards between January and mid-April. Over a 12-week period, the \ntracks were so dangerous that no trains were able to reach the \ncommunity. Consequently, the town nearly ran out of fuel, save for the \ngreen wood brought down from the hills.\n  In the fall of 1881, the county commission held an election with \nhopes of moving the county seat from Big Stone City to an area closer \nto the center of Grant County. Milbank's population had increased \nconsiderably by that time, and its residents eagerly anticipated \nwinning the two-thirds majority necessary to capture the title. Turnout \nfor the vote was staggeringly high with virtually every person, \nregardless of residency, voting. Milbank received about 1,100 votes, \nclaiming to have passed the two-thirds threshold; however, Big Stone \nCity disputed Milbank's declaration, asserting that Milbank was 11 \nvotes short. A rather long and drawn out dispute erupted, ripe with \nclaims of election fraud and mismanaged ballot counting. The dispute \nensued until two of the three county commissioners declared Milbank the \nwinner.\n  In addition to the difficult winter of 1880-81, four devastating \nfires broke out between 1884 and 1900. The Big Fire, as many call it, \noccurred mid-November of 1884, destroying every building on the east \nside of Main Street south to Third Avenue. Another of the significant \nfires, one of the quickest on record, took place July 30, 1895. Started \nby a loan company assistant hoping to profit from the catastrophe, the \nblaze ravaged the Grant County Court House, destroying virtually all of \nthe records housed there, save for those locked in the fireproof safe. \nDespite these tragedies and hardships, Milbank's resilient residents \nrebounded and rebuilt, which is testimony to South Dakotans' legendary \npioneer spirit.\n  One of Milbank's notable attractions is its historic grist mill, a \ncelebrated relic from the town's early days. Located on the east edge \nof the city, the Old Holland Mill is a favorite of tourists. Its name, \nhowever, is deceiving, as many assume it is a Dutch windmill. In \nrealty, the English-style mill was designed and built in 1882 by Henry \nHollands, who himself was an Englishman. The mill was used to grind \nbuckwheat flour and to saw wood. Due to the rapid growth of the \nsurrounding foliage, however, after a short period of time, the wind \nwas not strong enough to turn the giant blades, consequently requiring \nthe attachment of a gasoline engine to supply the power necessary to \noperate it. An interesting and clever feature of the mill is its main \ndrive wheel, which is constructed entirely of wood to prevent \nsignificant damage or injury. If something were to go wrong, the wooden \ncogs in the wheel would break, thus rendering the mill ineffectual.\n  Milbank is also proud of the recreational opportunities it offers. In \naddition to its four city parks, lighted tennis courts, swimming pool, \nand golf course, Milbank is the birthplace of American Legion Baseball. \nWhile hosting the seventh annual American Legion and Auxiliary \nconvention in July of 1925, a resolution was passed to create Junior \nLegion Baseball throughout the entire Nation. Not only does this \nprogram provide an excellent recreational outlet for millions athletic \nyouth, but throughout the years it has guided many talented athletes on \nto play professionally.\n  In the twelve and a half decades since its founding, Milbank has \nprovided its citizens with a rich and diverse atmosphere. Milbank's \nnearly 3,500 proud residents celebrate the town's 125th anniversary \nAugust 8-14, and it is with great honor that I share with my colleagues \nthis community's unique past and wish them the best for a promising \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/21/senate-section/article/S8662-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JEN JEN HAZELBAKER\n\n Mr. BOND.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include \nwireless telecommunications equipment in the definition of qualified \ntechnological equipment for purposes of determining the depreciation \ntreatment of such equipment; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill that \nwould clarify the class life of cell site equipment used by wireless \ntelecommunications companies.\n  Wireless telecommunications, like many other high-tech industries, \nuses computer-based technology to facilitate the digitization of voice, \nvideo and data services over its networks. The wireless industry was in \nits infancy in 1986 when the Internal Revenue Code's rules regarding \ndepreciation were last revised, so the sophisticated equipment used \ntoday was not even contemplated. For the past 20 years, the Internal \nRevenue Service--and taxpayers--have had to try to shoehorn modern \nequipment into outdated wireline telephony definitions in order to \ndetermine the appropriate depreciation period. Even the Treasury \nDepartment, in its July 2000 ``Report to the Congress on Depreciation \nRecovery Periods and Methods,'' admits that this is inappropriate.\n  The result of this methodology is that the IRS has taken the position \nthat wireless cell site equipment should be depreciated similarly to \nwooden telephone poles and wires rather than other, computerized \nequipment that it more closely resembles. Consequently, this equipment \nis depreciated over 20 years rather than 5. In other words, the \nmisclassification significantly increases the cost of capital \ninvestment in the Nation's wireless network.\n  Given the rapid technological change and advances in the wireless \nindustry, this bill would classify wireless telecommunications \nequipment as ``qualified technological equipment.'' This is the proper \nclassification because the major components of wireless cell sites are, \nin fact, computers or peripheral equipment controlled by computers.\n  Consumer demand for wireless services grew almost 700 percent over \nthe last decade, and rapid growth in this area continues. The industry \nalso makes significant contributions to the economy directly employing \n226,340 workers and making hundreds of billions of dollars in capital \ninvestments. Clarifying the depreciation treatment of cell site \nequipment means even greater wireless investment, increased wireless \nemployment, and improved benefits to America's wireless consumers.\n  Wireless technology has brought tremendous advances to rural America, \nand this bill would ensure that rural consumers continue to have timely \naccess to the latest technology available. I thank my colleague from \nArkansas, Mrs. Lincoln, for joining me in recognizing the problem and \nintroducing this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1441\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subparagraph (A) of section 168(i)(2) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (defining qualified \n     technological equipment) is amended by striking ``and'' at \n     the end of clause (ii), by striking the period at the end of \n     clause (iii) and inserting ``, and'', and by inserting after \n     clause (iii) the following new clause:\n       ``(iv) any wireless telecommunications equipment.''.\n       (b) Wireless Telecommunications Equipment.--Section \n     168(i)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by \n     inserting after subparagraph (C) the following new \n     subparagraph:\n       ``(D) Wireless telecommunications equipment.--For purposes \n     of this paragraph, the term `wireless telecommunications \n     equipment' means all equipment used in the transmission, \n     reception, coordination, or switching of wireless \n     telecommunications service, other than cell towers, \n     buildings, and T-1 lines or other cabling connecting cell \n     sites to mobile switching centers.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a \nCoordinated Environmental Health Network, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with my \ncolleagues Senators Chafee and Reid, the Coordinated Environmental \nHealth Tracking Act of 2005.\n  There is a saying--``what you don't know can't hurt you.'' But when \nit comes to chronic disease, what we don't know can hurt all of us. The \nbill we are introducing today will help us solve the mysteries behind \nthe high rates of chronic diseases such as cancer, autism, and \nAlzheimer's that afflict so many American communities.\n  Once we are able to track diseases, and detect links to environmental \nor other causes, we will be able to prevent public health crises before \nthey occur.\n  The environmental links to the onset of diseases are not well \nunderstood. They are hidden health hazards that manifest themselves in \nchronic diseases. We are only beginning to understand what these \nhazards are and what is the scope of their effects on our health.\n  We need more specifics on these environmental factors. For example, \nwe need to know what is the cumulative effect of extended exposure to a \nvariety of environmental factors over time.\n  One way to get those specifics is to track the outbreak of chronic \ndiseases, just like we track the outbreaks of infectious diseases.\n\n[[Page S8668]]\n\n  This legislation would establish a comprehensive national tracking \nsystem for chronic diseases, so that we can identify, address and \nprevent them.\n  It would help States to participate in this national tracking system- \nby providing them with Environmental Health Tracking Network Grants, \nassisting them in developing the infrastructure necessary to \nparticipate in this network.\n  It would also create a chronic disease response force, bringing the \nexpertise of environmental, scientific and health experts to areas with \npotential clusters of chronic diseases, like Long Island's breast \ncancer cluster.\n  It will allow us to monitor our environmental health by requiring an \nannual report of the results of the Nationwide Health Tracking Network, \nhelping to educate and arm us with valuable information in the fight \nagainst chronic diseases.\n  Finally, it will help us build the public health expertise we need to \naddress these issues in the future, by providing funding for the \nestablishment of at least seven biomonitoring labs and setting up \nepidemiology fellowships and centers of excellence for environmental \nhealth.\n  I believe that this legislation will help obtain and act on the best \npossible evidence to improve our Nation's health and to begin to tackle \nthe extraordinary human and economic costs that chronic disease imposes \non our country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 1443. A bill to permit athletes to receive nonimmigrant alien \nstatus under certain conditions, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to once again introduce \nlegislation that will address the challenges facing many promising, \ntalented young athletes from other countries who wish to play for \nsports teams in the United States. Due to the shortage of H-2B \nnonimmigrant visas for temporary or seasonal nonagricultural foreign \nworkers both this year and last, many American teams who rely on these \nvisas to recruit new talent from abroad have been unable to bring some \nof their most talented prospects to the United States. This bill would \nprovide a commonsense solution to this problem.\n  Across the United States, the H-2B visa shortage has been a \nsignificant concern to many in a wide variety of industries, including \nhospitality, forest products, fisheries, and landscaping, to name a \nfew. While we recently were successful in crafting a temporary, 2-year \nfix for the H-2B shortage, there is more still to be done. We must \ncontinue to seek permanent solutions to this problem, and to find \npractical ways to reduce the demand on this visa category. While there \nare a number of factors contributing to this high demand, among these \nis the extremely diverse, ``catch-all'' nature of this visa \nclassification.\n  What many people do not know is that, in addition to loggers, hotel \nand restaurant employees, fisheries workers, landscapers, and many \nother types of seasonal workers, the H-2B visa category is also used by \nmany talented, highly competitive foreign athletes. Specifically, minor \nleague athletes--unlike their counterparts at Major League franchises--\nare lumped into this same oversubscribed visa category, despite the \nobvious differences in the nature of the work they perform. The recent \nH-2B visa shortage has therefore meant that hundreds of promising \nathletes have been unable to come to the United States to play for \nminor league and amateur sports teams across the Nation. Not only have \nmany teams been unable to bring some of their most talented prospects \nto the United States, but this visa shortage has also compromised a \ntraditional source of talent for Major League sports teams. In \naddition, some very talented ice skaters who have earned roles in a \nnumber of popular theatrical productions, such as Disney on Ice, have \nfaced difficulties in coming to the United States.\n  In my home State of Maine, for example, the Lewiston MAINEiacs, a \nCanadian junior hockey league team, faced tremendous difficulties last \nyear obtaining the H-2B visas necessary for the majority of its players \nto remain in the United States to play in the team's first home games \nin September. These young athletes are among Canada's most talented \njunior players, but the shortage of H-2B visas threatened their chances \nof improve their skills with the MAINEiacs and, possibly, graduate to a \ncareer in professional hockey. This year, due to uncertainty about the \navailability of H-2B visas at the end of the fiscal year, the team has \nhad to schedule a later season home opener. It must also attempt to \nschedule make-up games for the home games that the team would normally \nplay in September. This creates a hardship on the team and its venue, \nand could mean fewer home games and a loss of revenue for businesses in \nthe surrounding area. I have received a letter from the MAINEiacs, \nexpressing the teams's support for this legislation. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  The Portland Sea Dogs, a Double-A level baseball team affiliated with \nthe Boston Red Sox, is another of the many teams that relies on H-2B \nvisas to bring some of its most skilled players to the United States. \nThousands of fans come out each year to see this team, and others like \nit across the country, play one of America's favorite sports. Due to \nthe shortage of H-2B visas, however, Major League Baseball reports that \nmore than 350 talented young, foreign baseball players were prevented \nfrom coming to the U.S. last year and early this year to play for Minor \nLeague teams, a traditional proving ground for athletes hoping to make \nit to the Major Leagues. The experience gained in the Minor Leagues is \ncrucial to the development of the best Major League players.\n  The inclusion of these athletes in the H-2B visa category seems \nparticularly unusual when you consider that Major League athletes are \npermitted to use an entirely different nonimmigrant visa category: the \nP-1 visa. This visa is used by athletes who are deemed by the U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services, CIS, to perform at an \n``internationally recognized level of performance.'' Arguably, any \nforeign athlete whose achievements have earned him a contract with an \nAmerican team would meet this definition. However, CIS has interpreted \nthis category to exclude minor and amateur league athletes. Instead, \nthe P-1 visa is typically reserved for only those athletes who have \nalready been promoted to Major League sports. Unfortunately, this \ncreates something of a catch-22: if an H-2B visa shortage means that \npromising athletes are unable to hone their skills, and to prove \nthemselves, in the Minor Leagues, then they are far less likely to ever \nearn a Major League contract.\n  A simple solution would be to expand the P-1 visa category to include \nminor league athletes and certain amateur-level athletes who have \ndemonstrated a significant likelihood of graduating to the major \nleagues. I have received a letter from officials from Major League \nBaseball, which continues to strongly support the expansion of the P-1 \nvisa category to include professional Minor League baseball players. I \nwould ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record. \nAs the League points out, by making P-1 visas available to this group \nof athletes, teams would be able to make player development decisions \nbased on the talent of its players, without being constrained by visa \nquotas. The P-1 category, the League argues, is appropriate for Minor \nLeague players because these are the players that the Major League \nClubs have selected as some of the best baseball prospects in the \nworld.\n  There is no question that Americans are passionate about sports. We \nhave high expectations for our teams, and demand only the best from our \nathletes. By expanding the P-1 visa category, we will make it possible \nfor athletes to be selected based on talent and skill, rather than \nnationality. In addition, we would reduce some pressure on the H-2B \nvisa category so that more of those visas can be used where they are \nreally needed.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 11, 2005.\n     Re legislation for nonimmigrant alien status for certain \n         athletes.\n\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senator from Maine, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: I wish to express the Lewiston \n     MAINEiacs Hockey Club's support for your efforts with regard \n     to amending the P-1 work visa to enable all of our\n\n[[Page S8669]]\n\n      non U.S. players to work in the United States.\n       The Lewiston MAINEiacs Hockey Club is the sole U.S. based \n     franchise in the 18-member Quebec Major Junior Hockey League \n     (QMJHL). The QMJHL together with the Ontario Hockey League \n     (OHL) and the Western Hockey League (WHL) make up the \n     Canadian Hockey League which comprises a total of 58 teams. \n     Of these 58 franchises, 9 are located in the United Stats \n     (OHL-3,WHL-5, QMJHl-1).\n       The CHL is the largest developer of talent for the National \n     Hockey League (NHL). More than 70% of all players, coaches \n     and general managers who have played in the NHL are graduates \n     of the Canadian Hockey League.\n       The majority of players in the Canadian Hockey League are \n     Canadian, although each team is permitted to have a maximum \n     of 2 Europeans on their rosters. These is also an increasing \n     number of elite U.S. born players now playing in the league.\n       The MAINEiacs sophomore season in 2004-fnl2-005 was a giant \n     success, growing the fan base to over 93,000 fans in the \n     regular season (2662 per game average). The team easily \n     advanced through the first round of the playoffs before \n     losing to the Rimouski Oceanic in the second round. Rimouski \n     subsequently went on to win the league title. The Lewiston \n     MAINEiacs also had two of their players drafted into the \n     National Hockey League in June 2004 with Alexandre Picard \n     being selected in the first round, 8th overall by the \n     Columbus Blue Jackets and Jonathan Paiememt being selected by \n     the New York Rangers in the 8th round. A total of 27 players \n     in the QMJHL were selected at the 2004 NHL Entry Draft.\n       In January of 2004, the City of Lewiston purchased the \n     Colisee in order to complete the first round of renovations \n     to the facility which was in excess of two million dollars. \n     The Colisee has undergone a second phase of renovations in \n     excess of 1.8 million dollars that entails a three-story \n     addition to the front of the building providing for new \n     offices, box office, proshop, food and beverage concessions \n     and a new private VIP suite that can accommodate more than \n     130 fans per game. The City of Lewiston recently contracted \n     the day-to-day management of the Colisee to Global Spectrum, \n     a subsidiary of Comcast-Spectacor, one of the largest and \n     most successful facility management companies in North \n     America.\n       The results of the current visa laws have forced all U.S. \n     based franchises in the CHL to delay the commencement of \n     their regular season until or after October 1 of each year \n     due to the restrictions of the H-2B temporary work visa \n     regulations. This has caused significant hardship on teams, \n     their facilities and the 3 leagues. U.S. based franchises are \n     forced to try and make-up games that would normally be \n     scheduled in the month of the September later in the season, \n     putting both the teams and their fans at disadvantage before \n     the season even commences.\n       Under your leadership, should congressional legislation \n     make available P-1 visas to Major Junior players of the CHL, \n     the success of all 9 U.S. based CHL franchises would be \n     greatly enhanced by ensuring that all 58 teams have an equal \n     chance at attracting and developing the best available \n     talent.\n       It is the hope of the Lewiston MAINEiacs that your \n     colleagues in the Senate follow your leadership and endorse \n     your recommendations for the expanded P-1 work visa to ensure \n     the viability and success of not only our franchise--but the \n     8 other U.S. based clubs in the Canadian Hockey League.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Matt McKnight,\n     Vice President & Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Office of the Commissioner,\n\n\n                                        Major League Baseball,\n\n                                        New York, NY, May 6, 2005.\n     Re legislation for nonimmigrant alien status for certain \n         athletes.\n\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senator from Maine, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: I write to express Major League \n     Baseball's support for your efforts on behalf of Minor League \n     professional baseball players. We understand that you are \n     sponsoring legislation that will enable Minor League players \n     to obtain P-1 work visas to perform in the United States.\n       Currently, foreign players under Minor League contracts are \n     required to obtain H-2B (temporary worker) work visas to \n     perform in the United States, forcing the Major League Clubs \n     to compete with employers of various unskilled workers for a \n     limited number of such visas that are issued. The United \n     States Citizenship and Immigration Services stopped accepting \n     H-2B visa applications in early January this year (and in \n     March, in 2004), citing the nationwide cap in the number of \n     such visas that can be issued. That action prevented more \n     than 350 young baseball players from performing in the Minor \n     Leagues in the United States in 2004 and 2005. Moreover, \n     Major League Clubs were forced to make premature player \n     promotion decisions this past off-season, in a race to apply \n     for H-2B visas before the cap was reached.\n       Minor League experience is crucial in developing the best \n     possible Major League players. Unlike other professional \n     athletes, baseball players almost invariably cannot go \n     directly from high school or college to the Major Leagues. \n     Almost all need substantial experience in the Minor Leagues \n     to develop their talents and skills to Major League quality. \n     To get that necessary experience, young players are signed by \n     Major League Clubs and assigned to play for Minor League \n     affiliates throughout the United States, such as the Eastern \n     League's Portland Sea Dogs in your state.\n       Major League Clubs sign many players from the Dominican \n     Republic and Venezuela and assign them at first to affiliates \n     in those countries, then seek to promote them to affiliates \n     in the United States as players' skills progress. Typically, \n     a Club would seek to promote 3-5 players per season to Minor \n     League affiliates in the United States, but the visa \n     restrictions will make those promotions impossible this \n     season, as they did last year as well. The Major League Clubs \n     were able to use only approximately 80% of the H-2B visas the \n     Department of Labor allowed them for the 2004 and 2005 \n     seasons, because current laws prevent them from making \n     decisions in the late spring and throughout the summer to \n     promote foreign prospects to United States affiliates. My \n     staff has learned that at least several Clubs shied away from \n     drafting foreign (mostly Canadian) players whom they \n     otherwise might have selected in the annual First-Year Player \n     Draft in June 2004 and will do so again this year, because \n     those Clubs know there is no opportunity for those players to \n     begin their professional careers in the United States the \n     summer after their selection. For the Canadian players who \n     were drafted in June 2004, signings declined 80% from 2003. \n     These results of the current visa laws have deprived Minor \n     League fans across America from seeing the best young players \n     possible perform for affiliates of the Major League Baseball \n     Clubs and have affected the quality and attractiveness of \n     those affiliates.\n       Under your leadership, congressional legislation could, by \n     sensibly making available P-1 visas to professional Minor \n     League athletes, ensure that the best baseball prospects from \n     around the world will get the opportunity to develop here in \n     the United States, without the constraint that the H-2B visa \n     cap imposes. The National Association of Professional \n     Baseball Leagues, Inc., also known as Minor League Baseball, \n     shares our support of your legislation. The Major League \n     Baseball Players Association also supports allowing the best \n     young players to develop here in the United States.\n       Major League Baseball hopes that your Senate colleagues \n     will follow your leadership and pursue a legislative remedy \n     to a problem that is threatening to weaken Baseball's Minor \n     League system.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert A. DuPuy,\n                            President and Chief Operating Officer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Coleman):\n  S. 1444. A bill to amend the Trade Act of 1974 to provide for \nalternative means of certifying workers for adjustment assistance on an \nindustry-wide basis; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance for Industries Act.\n  I have long been a champion for our Trade Adjustment Assistance \nprogram, what we call ``TAA.''\n  For more than 40 years, TAA has been providing retraining, income \nsupport, and other benefits to workers who lose their jobs due to \ntrade. The program has a critical mission: to give trade-impacted \nworkers the skills they need to find new jobs and prosper in growing \nsectors of the economy.\n  Maintaining a well-trained workforce is key to our Nation's long-term \ncompetitiveness and economic health. And helping those few who lose out \nfrom our trade policy choices is key to maintaining public support for \ntrade liberalization.\n  In the Trade Act of 2002, I spearheaded the most comprehensive \nexpansion and overhaul of the TAA program since 1974. We expanded the \nkinds of workers who are eligible for TAA benefits. We extended the \ntraining benefit to make it more effective and enhanced funding for \ntraining. We added new benefits like wage insurance and the health \ncoverage tax credit. We also streamlined the application process to get \nworkers enrolled and retraining sooner.\n  TAA is a lifeline for those who enter the program. Participating \nworkers in Montana tell me that TAA has made it possible for them to \nmake a new start. It gives them hope that they can do something more \nthan merely survive a plant closure.\n  One of the industries in Montana that has had all too much experience\n\n[[Page S8670]]\n\nwith the TAA program is softwood lumber. Our softwood lumber industry \nhas been battered for years by imports of dumped and subsidized lumber \nfrom Canada. Over time, and despite decades of litigation, these unfair \ntrading practices have taken their toll.\n  Since 1999, workers from at least 24 Montana lumber mills have \napplied for TAA certification. An additional 11 petitions were filed \nunder the now-repealed NAFTA-TAA program.\n  What surprises me is not that so many Montana lumber workers have \napplied for TAA--but the inconsistent treatment of their petitions. Of \nthe 24 Montana lumber companies that petitioned for TAA, 16 were \napproved and 8 were denied. Under the NAFTA-TAA program, 6 petitions \nwere approved, and 5 were denied.\n  These results do not make sense. These mills are all competing in the \nsame market. They are all competing against dumped and subsidized \nimports from Canada that drive down prices until U.S. producers cannot \nsurvive. The International Trade Commission found that Canadian imports \ninjure or threaten injury to the entire domestic softwood lumber \nindustry. And yet, somewhere between a third and a half of Montana \nworkers laid off in the industry were left to fend for themselves, \nwhile the others had the chance to participate in TAA.\n  So why are some workers getting TAA and others being turned down? The \nanswer lies in the way the Department of Labor reviews petitions. Under \ncurrent law, petitions have to be filed and reviewed on a plant-by-\nplant basis and in a total vacuum.\n  In effect, the Labor Department puts on blinders. It does not \nconsider whether the International Trade Commission has found injury to \nthe industry from imports. It does not ask whether imports are leading \nto job losses nationwide. It does not examine whether entire \noccupational categories are being offshored.\n  Instead, it just asks an individual plant whether it or its customers \nare buying more imports. If that one plant submits the wrong \ninformation, or its customers deny buying imports, its workers lose \nout--while similar workers up the road get the benefits they deserve.\n  The plight of softwood lumber illustrates why, in some cases, plant-\nby-plant certification is not the best policy. And lumber workers are \nnot alone. A similarly checkered record of certifications and denials \naffects other industries, like textiles and small electronics. Simply \nput, there are some industries where the trade-related displacements \nare clearly national in scope.\n  The industries are easy to identify. They experience multiple plant \nclosures covering multiple states in a relatively short period. They \nare often industries seeking or receiving relief under trade remedy \nlaws.\n  In these cases, it makes no sense to consider petitions one plant \nclosure at a time. That creates the risk of inconsistent results for \nsimilarly situated workers. And it makes the Department of Labor \ninvestigate the same situation over and over again--even when the \nInternational Trade Commission, or another Federal agency, has already \nmade a thorough injury investigation.\n  What would make more sense is a way to certify workers on an \nindustry-wide basis or on the basis of occupational classification in \ncases where the trade-related layoffs are national in scope. That is \nwhat this legislation does.\n  I should note that, in one rare circumstance, the President already \nhas the authority to certify workers for TAA on an industry-wide and \nnationwide basis. When the President grants a remedy in a global \nsafeguard case--what we call section 201--he has the option of \ncertifying all workers in the affected industry for TAA.\n\n  To my knowledge, this option has been used only once, by President \nReagan, in a case involving the footwear industry. In that case, \nworkers laid off from individual footwear plants did not need to \npetition the Department of Labor for a determination that their job \nlosses were import-related. All each worker had to do was go to a \ndesignated office in his State and prove that he lost a job in the \nfootwear industry within the applicable time period.\n  Normally, there are two steps needed to qualify for TAA under current \nlaw. First, the Department of Labor has to certify that a particular \nlayoff is trade-related. That certification covers all the workers laid \noff at a single plant. Second, each individual worker affected by that \nlayoff has to prove that he or she satisfies a list of criteria to \nqualify for benefits, such as 2 years' employment at the firm and \neligibility for unemployment insurance. In the footwear case, workers \nwere spared the first, group eligibility step and moved right to the \nsecond step.\n  To me, this model makes a lot of sense. If you believe in the purpose \nof TAA, it makes sense to make it as easy as possible for qualifying \nworkers to access benefits.\n  This bill achieves that goal in two ways.\n  First, it makes industry-wide TAA certification automatic in cases \nwhere the President, the International Trade Commission, or another \nqualified Federal agency has already determined that imports are having \nan injurious effect. If workers lose their jobs in an industry covered \nby a global or bilateral safeguard or an antidumping or countervailing \nduty order, within a set period of time, they do not need to file a \npetition for TAA. Instead, they can proceed directly to the second step \nof demonstrating their individual eligibility and enrolling through the \none-stop centers in their states.\n  Second, the bill permits, but does not require, the Secretary of \nLabor to make her eligibility determination on an industry-wide or \noccupation-wide basis in other circumstances that suggest a plant-by-\nplant approach is not appropriate. Such circumstances would include \ncases where the Secretary has received three or more petitions from \nworkers at different plants in the same industry within a 6 month \nperiod. It would also include cases where the Senate Finance Committee \nor the House Ways and Means Committee passes a resolution requesting an \nindustry-wide investigation. In these cases, the Secretary may certify \nworkers in an entire industry only if she determines that the statutory \neligibility criteria are satisfied on an industry-wide basis.\n  Now that I have described what this bill does, I think it is \nimportant to emphasize some things that it does not do:\n  It does not change the eligibility criteria or make any new \ncategories of workers eligible for TAA.\n  It does not make TAA benefits available to workers who quit their \njobs or are fired for cause.\n  It does not change the type or amount of benefits an eligible worker \ncan receive.\n  What it does is create a fair, predictable, and efficient way to make \neligibility determinations where industry-wide effects are obvious.\n  We owe our trade-affected workers a fair chance to train for the jobs \nof the future and get back into the workforce. And we owe our employers \nand our economic future well-trained workers.\n  We already have a program designed to do just that. We should be \ndoing everything we can to make sure that TAA benefits reach every \nqualified worker who needs them. This change is long overdue.\n  I want to thank Senator Coleman for joining me in introducing this \nimportant legislation. He has been a strong partner in the quest to \nmake TAA work for every American who needs it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1444\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Trade Adjustment Assistance \n     for Industries Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Trade Adjustment Assistance assists workers and \n     agricultural commodity producers who lose their jobs for \n     trade-related reasons to retrain, gain new skills, and find \n     new jobs in growing sectors of the economy.\n       (2) The total cost of providing adjustment assistance \n     represents a tiny fraction of the gains to the United States \n     economy as a whole that economists attribute to trade \n     liberalization.\n       (3) In circumstances where, due to changes in market \n     conditions caused by the implementation of bilateral or \n     multilateral free\n\n[[Page S8671]]\n\n     trade agreements, unfair trade practices, unforeseen import \n     surges, and other reasons, import competition creates \n     industry-wide effects on domestic workers or agricultural \n     commodity producers, the current process of assessing \n     eligibility for trade adjustment assistance on a plant-by-\n     plant basis is inefficient and can lead to unfair and \n     inconsistent results.\n\n     SEC. 3. OTHER METHODS OF REQUESTING INVESTIGATION.\n\n       Section 221 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2271) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(c) Other Methods of Initiating a Petition.--Upon the \n     request of the President or the United States Trade \n     Representative, or the resolution of either the Committee on \n     Ways and Means of the House of Representatives or the \n     Committee on Finance of the Senate, the Secretary shall \n     promptly initiate an investigation under this chapter to \n     determine the eligibility for adjustment assistance of--\n       ``(1) a group of workers (which may include workers from \n     more than one facility or employer); or\n       ``(2) all workers in an occupation as that occupation is \n     defined in the Bureau of Labor Statistics Standard \n     Occupational Classification System.'';\n       (2) in subsection (a)(2), by inserting ``or a request or \n     resolution filed under subsection (c),'' after ``paragraph \n     (1),''; and\n       (3) in subsection (a)(3), by inserting ``, request, or \n     resolution'' after ``petition'' each place it appears.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \ntechnical corrections, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Today I am pleased to introduce the Tax \nTechnical Corrections Act of 2005 with Senator Baucus.\n  Technical corrections measures are routine for major tax acts, and \nare necessary to ensure that the provisions of the acts are working \nconsistently with the originally enacted provisions, or to provide \nclerical corrections. Because these measures carry out Congressional \nintent, no revenue gain or loss is scored from them.\n  Technical corrections are derived from a deliberative and \nconsultative process among the Congressional and administration tax \nstaffs. That means the Republican and Democratic staffs of the House \nWays and Means and Senate Finance Committees are involved as is the \nTreasury Department staff. All of this work is performed with the \nparticipation and guidance of the non-partisan Joint Committee on \nTaxation staff. A technical enters the list only if all staffs agree it \nis appropriate.\n  The process and test for technical corrections ensures that only \nprovisions narrowly drawn to carry out Congressional intent are \nincluded.\n  Unfortunately, some press reports have distorted the technical \ncorrections bill. These reports unfairly characterize this technical \ncorrections bill as a re-opening of substantive tax policy of settled \ntax legislation.\n  While it is true that interested parties are heard on purported \ntechnical corrections, only measures that all staffs agree are purely \ntechnical are included in the bill. Clarifications or substantive \nchanges to provisions are not considered technical corrections. This is \nan important distinction that the press reports unfortunately did not \nmake.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1447\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; AMENDMENT OF 1986 CODE; TABLE OF \n                   CONTENTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Tax \n     Technical Corrections Act of 2005''.\n       (b) Amendment of 1986 Code.--Except as otherwise expressly \n     provided, whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal is \n     expressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a \n     section or other provision, the reference shall be considered \n     to be made to a section or other provision of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (c) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act \n     is as follows:\n\nSec. 1.

A bill to improve the treatment provided to veterans \nsuffering from post-traumatic stress disorder; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, seventy-five years ago today, President \nHerbert Hoover created the Veterans Administration by signing Executive \nOrder 5398 for the ``Consolidation and Coordination of Governmental \nActivities Affecting Veterans.''\n  Of course, the commitment of America to the care and welfare of the \nNation's veterans goes back to the earliest days of our Republic. In \n1789 George Washington said, ``The willingness with which our young \npeople are likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall \nbe directly proportional as to how they perceive the Veterans of \nearlier wars were treated and appreciated by their country.''\n  The care of veterans was a central theme in Abraham Lincoln's second \ninaugural address. He said, ``With malice toward none; with charity for \nall; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let \nus strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's \nwounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his \nwidow, and his orphan--to do all which may achieve and cherish a just, \nand a lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.''\n  Today, this important work of caring for our veterans is carried on \nby the Department of Veterans Affairs at a time when American troops \nare engaged in combat under very trying circumstances overseas.\n  In order to address the clearly emerging needs of the newest \nveterans, I am today introducing the ``Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder \nTreatment Improvement Act.''\n  This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to hire the \nnumber of mental health professionals which the Department's own \ninternal panel of experts has for years recommended as that required to \nprovide an appropriate\n\n[[Page S8679]]\n\nlevel of treatment for veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress \ndisorder or PTSD.\n  PTSD is a fairly new term but it is by no means a new problem. People \nexposed to extremely traumatic stressful events can suffer lasting and \nlong-term mental health problems as a result. Soldiers who have endured \nthe horrors--of the battlefield--who've experienced and had to \nparticipate in deeply troubling events--have long been susceptible to \nthis problem. Among Civil War veterans it was called ``the soldier's \nheart.'' Among World War I veterans it was called ``shell shock.'' In \nWorld War II it was called ``battle fatigue.'' Many people will \nremember the incident during World War II in which General George \nPatton slapped a soldier hospitalized with battle fatigue. The American \npublic reacted angrily to Patton's action because they understood that \nPatton was wrong; needing medical treatment to help recover from the \npsychological trauma of war was not any sign of weakness or cowardice \nbut rather simply one of the understandable hazards of the very violent \nmodern battlefield. In the aftermath of Vietnam, our understanding of \nwhat is today known as post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD has grown \ntremendously and so has our ability to treat it. Today, as a result of \nits work with Vietnam Veterans, the Department of Veterans Affairs is \nthe world leader in diagnosing and treating PTSD.\n  While the quality of the expertise in the VA is high, we need to \nimprove the quantity. The Department of Veterans Affairs needs more \nmental health professionals to meet the needs of the coming influx of \nnew veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Two articles in the July 2004 issue of the New England Journal of \nMedicine indicate that the nature of the war in Iraq is producing a new \ngeneration of American veterans who will require treatment for PTSD. \nThe data gathered from recently returned troops suggests that about 1 \nin 6 of our Iraq veterans will develop this serious problem. One of the \narticles cautions that the actual numbers will probably be even higher \nbecause the data of the reported study was collected from soldiers and \nmarines who served in the theater before the Iraqi insurgency rose to \nits current level of intensity. The conditions are now made even more \nstressful by the hidden enemy, frequently concealed among civilians and \nattacking suddenly with roadside explosions and suicide bombers. The \nuncertainly, the shock, the blood and destruction of this type of \nwarfare understandably takes a toll on the feelings of even the \ntoughest of our warriors. We know from experience that roughly 30 \npercent of Vietnam veterans suffered from PTSD sometime in their \nlifetime.\n  Senators don't have to read the New England Journal of Medicine to \nknow that our returning veterans will need a little help to overcome \nsome terrible memories and troubling mental images. We can hear it from \nthe veterans in our own States.\n  Several weeks ago I traveled across my State of Illinois to five \ndifferent locations for roundtable discussions about this subject. I \ninvited veterans as well as medical counselors from the Veterans' \nAdministration to tell me about former service members who were trying \nto come to grips with this torment in their minds over what they had \nbeen through and what they had seen. I was nothing short of amazed at \nwhat happened. At every single stop, these men and women came forward \nand sat at tables before groups in their communities, before the media, \nand told their stories of being trained to serve this country, being \nproud to serve, and going into battle situations which caused an impact \non their mind they never could have imagined. They talked about coming \nhome with their minds in this turmoil over the things they had done and \nseen. Many of them told of having to wait months and, in one case, a \nyear before they could see a doctor at a VA hospital.\n  I heard from veterans from Iraq, Vietnam, Korea and World War II. One \nveteran in southern Illinois who was in the Philippines couldn't come \nto my meeting because ``I just can't face talking about it.'' This was \n60 years after his experience. Veterans of Vietnam, coming home, facing \nanimosity from others, then being unable to address their emotional and \npsychological anguish and difficulty because they were afraid to even \nacknowledge they were veterans. They were left tormented by this for \ndecades.\n  The ones that gripped my heart the most were the Iraqi veterans. I \nwill never forget these men and women. The one I sat next to at \nCollinsville, a bright, handsome, young Marine, talked about going into \nFallujah with his unit and how his point man was riddled with bullets, \nand he had to carry the parts of his body out of that street into some \nside corner where the remains could be evacuated. Then he took over his \nfriend's job as point man and went forward. A rocket-propelled grenade \nwas shot at him, and it bounced off his helmet. One of the insurgents \ncame up and shot him twice in the chest. This happened just this past \nNovember.\n  When he came home, he said he couldn't understand who he was because \nof what he had seen and been involved in. He had problems with his \nwife--difficult, violent problems, and he turned to the VA for help.\n  I said to this young Marine: I am almost afraid to ask you this, but \nhow old are you? He said, ``I am 19.''\n  Think of what he has been through. Thank goodness he is in the hands \nof counselors. Thank goodness he is getting some help and moving in the \nright direction.\n  But in another meeting in southern Illinois, another soldier said, in \nfront of the group, ``As part of this battle, I killed children, women. \nI killed old people. I am trying to come to grips with this in my mind \nas I try to come back into civilian life.''\n  A young woman, a member of the Illinois National Guard, said when she \nreturned to the United States, still in distress over what she had seen \nand done, she was released from active duty through Fort McCoy in \nWisconsin where the Army sat her down and asked, ``Any problems?'' Of \ncourse, that should have been the time for her to come forward and say: \nI have serious problems. She didn't. She'd heard that if you said you \nhad a problem, you had to stay at Fort McCoy for several more months. \nShe was so desperate to get home she said, ``No problems.''\n  She came home and finally realized that was not true. She had serious \npsychological problems over what she had been through. When she turned \nto the VA and asked for help, they said: You can come in and see a \ncounselor at the VA in a year.\n  What happens to these veterans, victims of post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, without counseling at an early stage? Sadly, many of them see \ntheir marriages destroyed. One I met was on his fourth marriage. Many \nof them self-medicate with alcohol, sometimes with drugs, desperate to \nfind some relief from the nightmares they face every night. These are \nthe real stories of real people, our sons and daughters, our brothers \nand sisters, our husbands and wives who go to battle to defend this \ncountry and come home with the promise that we will stand behind them.\n  So, in addition to the Vietnam, Gulf War and other veterans already \nbeing treated, it is clear that we will soon see large numbers of Iraq \nveterans coming to the VA for help with PTSD. What is our capacity to \nhelp them? Unfortunately, it does not look good.\n  Disturbingly, the Department of Veterans Affairs may lack the \ncapacity to treat those with PTSD. The Government Accountability Office \nrecently concluded, and the Department of Veterans Affairs concurred, \nthat the Department has not kept adequate accounting of the numbers of \npatients it currently treats for PTSD. Without any reliable numbers of \npatients currently receiving treatment, the VA cannot deliver to us any \nassurance about having the facilities or staff needed to treat the \ncoming influx of new veterans.\n  The VA has demonstrated an inability to forecast the number of \npatients it must be ready to treat. In three of the past four years, \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs has submitted budget requests that \nincluded patient estimates which turned out to be too low in four \ndifferent areas. In three of the past four years, the VA has \nunderestimated its number of acute hospital care patients, the number \nof medical visits, the dependents and survivors' hospital census, and \nthe numbers of dependent and survivor outpatients that it would see.\n\n[[Page S8680]]\n\n  Now, just a couple of weeks ago, the VA had to acknowledge that its \nbudget for the current fiscal year was going to be $1 billion short \nbecause they got their estimate of Iraq veteran patients wrong. The VA \nhad forecasted a 2.3 percent growth in healthcare demand this year but \nthe actual increase turned out to be 5.2 percent--more than twice the \nVA estimate. The VA budget assumed that 23,553 VA patients would be \nveterans of the Global War on Terrorism. The number of these patients \nin 2005 is now estimated to be 103,000--more than four times what VA \nhad estimated.\n  In the absence of reliable patient information and patient estimates \nfrom the Department of Veterans Affairs, how can we know that the VA \nhealthcare system lacks the capability to treat the incoming number of \nveterans needing PTSD treatment? That's easy--we can simply listen to \nthe VA medical professionals who provide the treatment.\n  In the course of conducting its investigation, the Government \nAccountability Office asked officials at VA facilities if they would be \nable to meet this coming demand. The answer they received was very \ndisturbing. Fully six out of these seven VA healthcare officials stated \nthat their facilities may be unable to handle the influx of new \nveterans needing PTSD treatment. Six out of seven!\n  In addition, another set of internal VA mental health professionals \nhas repeatedly recommended that VA expand its capability to treat PTSD. \nThe Department's own Special Committee on Post-Traumatic Stress \nDisorder has issued a long list of recommended improvements. When the \nGovernment Accountability Office studied the progress on implementing \nthese expert recommendations, it found that the Department of Veterans \nAffairs hadn't fully implemented any of them.\n  Enough is enough!\n  When the VA fails to count its current PTSD patients; when the VA \nconsistently underestimates its number of future patients; when the VA \nignores the improvement recommendations of its own internal mental \nhealth professionals it is time for Congress to step in, demonstrate \nthe leadership that is required, and take action to provide the \ntreatment capability that our veterans deserve.\n  The bill I am introducing today accomplishes this by requiring the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs to implement three of the key treatment \nimprovement recommendations made by the Department's own Special \nCommittee on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.\n  The bill requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to do three \nthings. First, it requires the Secretary to establish a Post-Traumatic \nStress Disorder Clinical Team at every Medical Center within the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. Second, it requires the Secretary to \nprovide a certified family therapist within each Vet Center. Finally, \nthe bill requires the appointment of a regional PTSD Coordinator within \neach Veteran Integrated Service Network (VISN) and Readjustment \nCounseling Service region to evaluate programs, promote best practices \nand make resource recommendations.\n  Let me explain the importance of these three provisions.\n  The majority of the major VA hospitals already have a clinical team \nof mental health experts focused on providing treatment for post-\ntraumatic stress disorder. These teams include psychiatrists, \npsychologists, and psychotherapists who bring their varied skills \ntogether. However, approximately 60 of our VA hospitals currently do \nnot have a PTSD clinical team. This bill requires that these teams be \nestablished.\n  Nationwide, the Department of Veterans Affairs operates 207 ``Vet \nCenters.'' The community-based, informal atmosphere of these centers \nhas proven to be a highly effective way to provide counseling and other \nservices to veterans who might not want or be able to go to a formal VA \nhospital for help. The Special Committee has recognized the importance \nof family relationships in helping veterans deal with their PTSD and \nhas recommended that there be a certified marriage and family therapist \nat each Vet Center.\n  Currently only 17 centers have these specialists on staff. This bill \nhelps keep families strong for our veterans by adding 190 family \ntherapists to Vet Centers nationwide.\n  Finally, the bill ensures that PTSD treatment capability gets the \nattention and management needed to keep it strong by requiring the \nappointment of PTSD coordinators at the regional level.\n  Altogether, this bill will add about 400 mental health professionals \nto the Department of Veterans Affairs' capability to treat those of our \nveterans whose wounds are not visible, whose thoughts are continually \ntroubled by the horrors of war, who need just a little help to get past \nthe nightmares and get their life back on track.\n  Even the toughest of warriors can have troubled feelings following \nthe stress of combat. It is no sign of weakness--it is no sign of \nfailure to ask for a little help in getting past some of those \nfeelings. That message must be clearly conveyed to all of our veterans.\n  By acting now, we can ensure that this help is available to our \nveterans when they return. This is crucial because the effects of post-\ntraumatic stress disorder are sometimes left undiagnosed and untreated \nfor years. If we delay, we virtually guarantee a future shortage of \ntreatment capability and, in so doing, we lay the groundwork for the \nplague of drug abuse, domestic violence, homelessness, unemployment and \neven suicide that so often is the result of post-traumatic stress \ndisorder which is left untreated.\n  America's newest generation of young veterans certainly deserve \nbetter than that!\n  We in the Congress can step up and require that the Department of \nVeterans Affairs hire a full staff of mental health professionals that \ncan help our veterans to move past the psychological trauma of war and \nto lead healthy, happy and productive lives.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting our returning \nveterans by supporting the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Treatment \nImprovement Act.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1448\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Consumer \nIdentity Protection and Security Act. This legislation provides \nconsumers the ability to place credit freezes on their credit reports.\n  My sole intent in introducing this legislation is to address a \njurisdictional question that has recently arisen with respect to the \nFair Credit Reporting Act. I want to make sure that the referral \nprecedent with respect to legislation that amends the Fair Credit \nReporting Act, or touches upon the substance covered by that Act, is \nentirely clear. I believe the Parliamentarian's decision to refer this \nbill to the Senate Banking Committee establishes that there is no \nquestion in this regard and that this subject matter is definitively \nand singularly in the jurisdiction of the Senate Banking Committee.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Corzine, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Bingaman, \n        Mr. Coleman, Mr. Talent, Mr. Salazar, Mrs. Dole, and Mr. Bayh):\n  S. 1462. A bill to promote peace and accountability in Sudan, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague Senator \nCorzine and 11 other cosponsors to introduce the Darfur Peace and \nAccountability Act of 2005. I applaud Senator Corzine for his tireless \nwork on this issue--he has traveled on several occasions to Sudan, and \nwas instrumental in moving the U.S. to declare the atrocities genocide. \nIn addition, there is a strong bipartisan coalition forming to address \none of the greatest moral issues that faces our world today.\n  I wish to thank many of my colleagues for their support for the \nDarfur Accountability Act that was introduced in March and passed \nunanimously by this body as an amendment to the Emergency Supplemental. \nUnfortunately, that provision was stripped in conference.\n  Since that time, several relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions \nhave been passed, NATO has committed to assisting the African Union \nMission in Sudan (AMIS), and the National Unity Government of Sudan was \nestablished just two weeks ago on July 9, following the Comprehensive \nPeace Agreement between the North and the South. While we applaud the \nrecent peace agreement ending the longest civil war in Africa, we pause \nwith great concern that genocide continues in Darfur. There can be no \ncomprehensive peace in Sudan until the crisis in Darfur has been \nresolved.\n  Just today news reports were swarming about the Sudanese officials \nwho manhandled Secretary Rice's staff and reporters during their \nmeeting with President Bashir. When a U.S. reporter asked a question \nabout the killing of innocent civilians, she was taken by the arm and \npromptly removed from the meeting.\n  It is unfortunate that the ``international incident'' not being \nreported is about the hundreds of thousands of lives lost, or the 2 \nmillion refugees who live day to day on inadequate portions of food and \nvery little clean water.\n  In remarks prior to the G-8 summit on June 30, 2005, President Bush \ndeclared, ``the violence in Darfur is clearly genocide,'' and ``the \nhuman cost is beyond calculation.''\n  While momentum for international support to end this crisis has been \nbuilding, the violence and humanitarian crisis continues. Rape is still \nbeing used as weapon against women. Some women who have become pregnant \ndue to brutal rape, have been forced to abort their babies and other \nwomen have been imprisoned for bearing illegitimate children. In \naddition, the government seems to be prepared to raze the Kalma refugee \ncamp of 120,000 people against their wishes, sending them back into \nareas where there is no security against these rapes and killings.\n\n  I remind my colleagues that it was one year ago, on July 22, we stood \ntogether in Congress to denounce the atrocities in Darfur as genocide. \nTwelve long months later is not the time to start thinking about easing \nsanctions or restoring certain diplomatic ties, rather it is time to \naddress the needs of the African Union and it is time to sanction those \nresponsible for genocide.\n  That is why we are joining with colleagues in the House to introduce \nnew bipartisan legislation called the Darfur Peace and Accountability \nact of 2005. This bill increases pressure on Khartoum, provides greater \nsupport to the African Union mission in Darfur to help protect \ncivilians, imposes sanctions on individuals responsible for atrocities, \nand encourages the appointment of a U.S. special envoy to help advance \na peace process for Darfur. I applaud our colleagues in the House, \nincluding Congressmen Hyde, Tancredo, Payne, Wolf, Smith and others, \nwho have diligently worked with us to ensure a strong piece of \nlegislation that we hope will move quickly and be enacted so that we \nmay provide further relief to the suffering victims.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this very important piece of \nlegislation. For the first time in history we publicly speak of \ngenocide while it is underway, yet we have broken our promise of \n``Never Again.'' We can no longer be indifferent to the suffering \nAfricans of Darfur. We have got to move beyond partisan politics, and \nagree on the fundamentals that will help save lives immediately.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Darfur \nPeace and Accountability Act. This bill, which is the latest version of \nlegislation Senator Brownback and I have been pushing for almost six \nmonths, will provide the tools and authorizations and put forth the \npolicies necessary to stop the genocide in Darfur. This bill also has \nsupport in the House, where it has been introduced by Representatives \nHyde, Payne and others.\n  Sudan is in the news today because of Secretary Rice's trip, and \nbecause of the rough treatment her entourage has received. But let's \nnot lose sight of what has happened in Sudan over the last two years, \nand what is still happening. 2 million Darfurian civilians have been \ndisplaced from their homes. 1.8 million have been forced into camps in \nDarfur. There are 200,000 Darfur refugees in Chad. Hundreds of \nthousands have died, with some estimates up to 400,000. The Government \nof Sudan and the janjaweed militias it supports are responsible for \nsystematic, targeted and premeditated violence, including murder and \nrape.\n  It was one year ago tomorrow that the Senate recognized these \natrocities as genocide. One long, horrible, violent, tragic year for \nthe people of Darfur.\n  We can stop this genocide, and we know how to do it. It just takes \nthe will.\n  Three months ago, the Senate passed the Darfur Accountability Act as \nan amendment to the Supplemental Appropriations bill. Despite \noverwhelming bipartisan support, it was stripped out in conference. \nMeanwhile, the genocide continued and now we are forced to revisit many \nof the same issues.\n  First, it is time we put real pressure on the Government of Sudan. \nWhile I welcome Secretary Rice's trip to Sudan, and Deputy Secretary \nZoellick's two trips, diplomacy only goes so far. When the world \nthreatens sanctions, Khartoum moderates its behavior. This bill calls \nfor a UN Security Council resolution to impose real sanctions on the \nGovernment of Sudan.\n  Second, we need boots on the ground. When I visited Darfur in August \nlast year, there were only a couple hundred African Union troops on the \nground. There are not more than 3,000. But this number is far from \nadequate to patrol a region the size of Texas. There are over 50,000 \npolice officers in Texas, yet we are still struggling to deploy 7,000 \nAU soldiers in Darfur, where genocide and civil war are raging, and \nwhere transportation and communications are limited.\n  The AU has been effective where it is deployed and I applaud the AU's \nleadership on this issue. But we have to be realistic about what they \nare up against. They need an explicit mandate to protect civilians and \nthey need much more support.\n  It also requires that, 30 days after we learn the names of those the \nUN has identified as having committed atrocities, the President report \nto Congress on whether he is sanctioning those people and the reasons \nfor his decision.\n  This is not about the past. Those who have committed genocide are \nstill\n\n[[Page S8682]]\n\ndoing so. While we debate this legislation, brutal killers continue to \nterrorize the people of Darfur with impunity. They must be named, they \nmust be sanctioned, and they must be brought to justice.\n  Fifth, we need a Special Presidential Envoy. Secretary Rice and \nDeputy Secretary Zoellick simply cannot devote themselves full time to \nthis crisis.\n  A high-profile envoy will make sustain the pressure on the \nGovernment, get the UN Security Council to act, keep tract of what the \nAfrican Union really needs to be effective and accelerate NATO \ninvolvement, and make sure that peace talks with the Darfur rebels \ndon't drift. A Special Envoy will be able to visit all of Darfur, not \njust the camps that have been cleaned up for visiting VIPs. And a \nSpecial Envoy will be able to address related problems, from northern \nUganda to Sudan's troubled East.\n  We can do all of this. We just need the political will But, that has \nalways been the problem. From Cambodia to the Balkans to Rwanda, we \nfailed to act or acted too late. And this time, we can't even claim not \nto know what is happening. We know all too well.\n  We can't claim that we haven't had the time to act. It's been a year \nsince we declared the atrocities in Darfur to be genocide. We can't \nclaim that we are not responsible. What greater responsibility can \nthere be than to stop a genocide?\n  We're out of excuses, and we're out of time. I hope this bipartisan \nbill and its House counterpart are quickly passed. I urge my colleagues \nto support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 1463. A bill to clarify that the Small Business Administration has \nauthority to provide emergency assistance to non-farm-related small \nbusiness concerns that have suffered substantial economic harm from \ndrought; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, drought continues to be a serious problem \nfor many States in this country, and I rise to re-introduce legislation \nto help small businesses that need disaster assistance but can't get it \nthrough the Small Business Administration's disaster loan program.\n  You see, the SBA doesn't treat all drought victims the same. The \nAgency only helps those small businesses whose income is tied to \nfarming and agriculture. However, farmers and ranchers are not the only \nsmall business owners whose livelihoods are at risk when drought hits \ntheir communities. The impact can be just as devastating to the owners \nof rafting businesses, marinas, and bait and tackle shops. Sadly, these \nsmall businesses cannot get help through the SBA's disaster loan \nprogram because of something taxpayers hate about government--\nburaucracy.\n  The SBA denies these businesses access to disaster loans because its \nlawyers say drought is not a sudden event and therefore it is not a \ndisaster by definition. However, contrary to the Agency's position that \ndrought is not a disaster, in July of 2002, when this Act was \noriginally introduced, the SBA had in effect drought disaster \ndeclarations in 36 States. As of July 2005, 11 States remain declared \ndrought disasters and 19 States are suffering from severe to extreme \ndrought conditions. Adding insult to injury, in those States where the \nAgency declares drought disaster, it limits assistance to only farm-\nrelated small businesses. Take, for instance, South Carolina. A couple \nof years ago that entire State had been declared a disaster by the SBA, \nbut the Administration would not help all drought victims. Let met read \nto you from the declaration:\n\n       Small businesses located in all 46 counties may apply for \n     economic injury disaster loan assistance through the SBA. \n     These are working capital loans to help the business continue \n     to meet its obligations until the business returns to normal \n     conditions. . . . Only small, non-farm agriculture dependent \n     and small agricultural cooperative are eligible to apply for \n     assistance. Nurseries are also eligible for economic injury \n     caused by drought conditions.\n\n  The SBA has the authority to help all small businesses hurt by \ndrought in declared disaster areas, but the Agency won't do it. For \nyears the Agency has been applying the law unfairly, helping some and \nnot others, and it is out of compliance with the law. The Small \nBusiness Drought Relief Act of 2005 would force SBA to comply with \nexisting law, restoring fairness to an unfair system, and get help to \nsmall business drought victims that need it.\n  Time is of the essence for drought victims, and I am hopeful that \nCongress will consider passing this legislation soon. This Act has been \nthoroughly reviewed, passing the committee of jurisdiction three times \nand the Senate twice, with supporters numbering up to 25, from both \nsides of the aisle. In addition to approval by the committee of \njurisdiction, OMB approved virtually identical legislation in 2003. The \nbill I am introducing today includes those changes we worked out with \nthe Administration, and I see no reason for delay.\n  I thank Senators Snowe and Bond, our current and past chairs, both of \nwhom have been supportive of this legislation each time it was \nintroduced and passed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1463\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE\n\n       This Act may be cited as the as the ``Small Business \n     Drought Relief Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) as of July 2002, when this Act was originally \n     introduced in the 107th Congress as Senate Bill S. 2734, more \n     than 36 States (including Massachusetts, Montana, Texas, and \n     Nevada) had suffered from continuing drought conditions;\n       (2) as of July 2005, drought continues to be a serious \n     national problem, with 19 States suffering from severe to \n     extreme drought conditions;\n       (3) droughts have a negative effect on State and regional \n     economies;\n       (4) many small businesses in the United States sell, \n     distribute, market, or otherwise engage in commerce related \n     to water and water sources, such as lakes, rivers, and \n     streams;\n       (5) many small businesses in the United States suffer \n     economic injury from drought conditions, leading to revenue \n     losses, job layoffs, and bankruptcies;\n       (6) these small businesses need access to low-interest \n     loans for business-related purposes, including paying their \n     bills and making payroll until business returns to normal;\n       (7) absent a legislative change, the practice of the Small \n     Business Administration of permitting only agriculture and \n     agriculture-related businesses to be eligible for Federal \n     disaster loan assistance as a result of drought conditions \n     would likely continue;\n       (8) during the past several years small businesses that \n     rely on the Great Lakes have suffered economic injury as a \n     result of lower than average water levels, resulting from low \n     precipitation and increased evaporation, and there are \n     concerns that small businesses in other regions could suffer \n     similar hardships beyond their control and that they should \n     also be eligible for assistance; and\n       (9) it is necessary to amend the Small Business Act to \n     clarify that non-farm-related small businesses that have \n     suffered economic injury from drought are eligible to receive \n     financial assistance through Small Business Administration \n     Economic Injury Disaster Loans.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 203\n\n       Whereas in the history of the United States more than \n     48,000,000 citizen-soldiers have served the United States in \n     uniform and more than 1,000,000 have given their lives as a \n     consequence of their duties;\n       Whereas as of July 21, 2005, there are more than 25,000,000 \n     living veterans;\n       Whereas on March 4, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln \n     expressed in his Second Inaugural Address the obligation of \n     the United States ``to care for him who shall have borne the \n     battle and for his widow and his orphan'';\n       Whereas on July 21, 1930, President Herbert Hoover issued \n     an executive order creating a new agency, the Veterans' \n     Administration, to ``consolidate and coordinate Government \n     activities affecting war veterans'';\n       Whereas on October 25, 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed \n     into law the Department of Veterans Affairs Act (Public Law \n     100-527; 102 Stat. 2635), effective March 15, 1989, \n     redesignating the Veterans' Administration as the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs and establishing it as an executive \n     department with the mission of providing Federal benefits to \n     veterans and their families; and\n       Whereas in 2005, the 230,000 employees of the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs continue the tradition of their predecessors \n     of caring for the veterans of the United States with \n     dedication and compassion and upholding the high standards \n     required of them as stewards of the gratitude of the public \n     to those veterans: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the 75th anniversary of the establishment of \n     the Veterans' Administration; and\n       (2) acknowledges the achievements of the employees of the \n     Veterans' Administration and the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs and commends these employees for serving the veterans \n     of the United States.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to submit a \nresolution recognizing the 75th anniversary of the establishment of the \nVeterans' Administration and acknowledging the achievements of the \nemployees, past and present, of the Veterans' Administration and the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. As Chairman of the Senate Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, I am honored to offer public recognition of this \nauspicious anniversary and, more importantly, the fine work being done \nevery day by over 230,000 VA employees.\n  The Veterans' Administration was created by an Executive Order signed \nby President Herbert Hoover on July 21, 1930, 75 years ago today. Prior \nto 1930, of course, Federal programs existed to assist war veterans. \nFor example, early in the Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress \ncreated the first veterans' benefits package, which included life-long \npensions for both disabled veterans and the survivors of soldiers \nkilled in battle. Other veterans benefits--for example, ``mustering \nout'' pay--were also provided to veterans of the War of 1812, the \nMexican War, the Civil War, the Indian wars, and the Spanish-American \nWar, and the first educational assistance benefits for veterans were \nenacted as part of the Rehabilitation Act of 1919 which provided for a \nmonthly education assistance allowance to disabled World War I \nveterans. But it was not until 1930--75 years ago today--that a Federal \nagency recognizable by today's standards was created by President \nHoover.\n  The VA has a unique place in history having administered one of the \nmost significant pieces of legislation ever enacted in the Nation's \nhistory, the ``Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944,'' better known as \nthe ``GI Bill of Rights.'' This legislation, it is now generally \nrecognized, revolutionized American society after World War II by \nproviding educational opportunity to an entire generation of \nAmericans--opportunity which otherwise would not have been available \nand which changed the Nation and ushered in the space age. During the \nperiod, VA's capability to provide medical care and rehabilitation \nservices to disabled and needy veterans also grew significantly, \nleading ultimately to a health care system which is today recognized as \na provider of ``the best care, anywhere.''\n  In the Nation's history, more than 48 million citizen-soldiers have \nworn the uniform, and more than 1 million have perished as a result of \ntheir service. More than 25 million men and women are alive today who \nproudly acknowledge the title ``veteran''. The Department of Veterans \nAffairs, as VA is designated today, exists solely for the reason \narticulated by President Abraham Lincoln in his Second Inaugural \nAddress: ``. . . to care for him who shall have borne the battle and \nfor his widow and his orphan.'' I applaud the efforts of the more than \n230,000 VA employees who keep faith, every day, with President \nLincoln's words.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the HELP \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 544 and the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 544) to amend title IX of Public Health Service \n     Act to provide for the improvement of patient safety and to \n     reduce the incidence of events that adversely affect patient \n     safety.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Enzi, Senator Gregg, \nSenator Jeffords, Senator Frist, and all of the other members of our \nHealth Committee who have done so much to achieve this bipartisan \nconsensus on the complex issue of preventing medical errors and \nimproving patient safety. I also commend our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives, especially Chairman Barton of the Committee on Energy \nand Commerce, and the ranking member of that committee, Representative \nDingell, for their willingness to work with us to resolve the \ndifferences between the House and Senate bills on this important issue.\n  For even one American to die from an avoidable medical error is a \ntragedy. When thousands die every year from such errors, it is a \nnational tragedy, and it is also a national disgrace, and an urgent \ncall to action.\n  Five years ago, the Institute of Medicine reported that medical \nerrors cause 98,000 deaths every year. That is an average of 268 deaths \na day, every day. If errors in aviation killed 200 passengers a day in \nplane crashes, we would do more than simply encourage voluntary \nreporting. If errors at factories caused the deaths of 200 workers a \nday, we would demand more than corporate reports. We would require real \nchanges.\n  Unfortunately, the culture of medicine has an expectation of \ninfallibility in health professionals, and this unrealistic assumption \nhas been reinforced by generations of medical training and medical \npractice.\n  When confronted with a mistake in health care, doctors and patients \nand citizens often ask, ``How can there be errors without negligence?'' \nObviously, the fear of legal liability or embarrassment among peers and \nin the press leads to strong pressure to cover up mistakes.\n  In many cases, however, the inadequate design and implementation of \nhealth systems are responsible for the problem, including excessive \nwork schedules and unreasonable time pressures.\n  We can do better. We can encourage the development of a safer health \ncare system. We can learn important lessons from other dangerous \nfields, such as the aviation industry and the military, which are \nskillful in designing ways to provide maximum feasible safety.\n  The Institute of Medicine has called for strong action, and our \nproposal is responding to that call. The Institute's series of reports \non health care quality contain numerous recommendations for improving \npatient safety, and if we work together, we can make more of them a \nreality.\n  The Institute recommended that health care professionals should be \nencouraged to report medical errors, without fearing that their reports \nwill be used against them. Our legislation implements this sensible \nrecommendation by establishing patient safety organizations to analyze \nmedical errors and recommend ways to avoid them in the future. The \nlegislation also creates a legal privilege for information reported to \nthe safety organizations, but still guaranteeing that original records, \nsuch as patients' charts will remain accessible to patients.\n  Drawing the boundaries of this privilege requires a careful balance, \nand I believe the legislation has found that balance. The bill is \nintended to make medical professionals feel secure in reporting errors \nwithout fear of punishment, and it is right to do so. But the bill \ntries to do so carefully, so that it does not accidentally shield \npersons who have negligently or intentionally caused harm to patients. \nThe legislation also upholds existing state laws on reporting patient \nsafety information.\n  The legislation can be the beginning of more effective action on \npatient safety, but other reforms are also necessary. The Federal \nGovernment should have a leading role in improving safety and improving \nthe quality of care for patients. The title of one of IOM's most \nimportant reports, Leadership by Example, highlights the central role \nthat the Federal Government should have on this issue.\n  Other actions are also necessary. Hospital systems that have improved \nhealth care quality have done so by making far-reaching reforms in \nwhich improving health care quality is a key part of the practice of \nmedicine. To turn best practices into everyday practices, hospitals \nhave created clinical guidelines and assessments of outcomes to help \nsee that every patient receives the best possible care.\n  The Senate is acting to approve needed legislation on the use of \ninformation technology in health care, such as in electronic medical \nrecords, decision support software, and computer reminders for needed \nscreening tests. These and other features of health IT systems can \nimprove overall health care. In a culture where doctors can learn from \nmistakes and near misses, these IT systems can dramatically improve \nhealth care for all Americans.\n  I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and both sides of \nthe Capitol, who came together to bring this major legislation to a \nvote, so that\n\n[[Page S8714]]\n\nevery patient in America will receive effective, high quality health \ncare.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1411\n\n  (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n  Mr. WARNER.
