Mr. President, let me welcome everyone here and everyone \nwatching at home to the Chamber of the U.S. Senate and to this historic \nfirst day of the 109th Congress.\n  When the Senate family gathers, it is always a special occasion. But \nthis is a day when the entire Senate family comes together and \ncelebrates this unique institution that indeed binds us as one.\n  So, for being here, I thank the distinguished Members of the Senate--\npast, present, and near future--Senate friends and our beloved \nfamilies, and our loyal and hardworking Senate staff.\n  My colleagues, our roots as representatives of the people are not \nrecent. They are ancient. They reach beyond the founding of our \nRepublic, to our earliest days as colonies. The first legislative \nassembly in the New World gathered during the scorching summer months \nof 1619 on Jamestown Island, Virginia. Twenty-two burgesses, a governor \nand his council, a clerk, and a sergeant of arms met to propose and \npass ``just laws for the happy guiding and governing of the people . . \n.''\n  If you visit Jamestown today, you can still see the stone foundation \nof the church where that first assembly conducted its business. It is \non those rocks that this House in which we stand today was built.\n  Over the course of nearly four centuries, the seeds of American \ndemocracy have swept across oceans and over mountains and through \njungles and deserts, taking root in land barren of the supposed \n``prerequisites'' for self- government. These seeds have grown into \nwhat President Reagan boldly called at the height of our war against \nSoviet totalitarianism ``a not-at-all-fragile flower.''\n\n  As U.S. Senators, we, with our colleagues in the House and our \nrespected President, are the stewards of this ancient and yet still \nliving and thriving tradition. And this, my friends, is no small burden \nto bear.\n  The American people--and indeed the people of the world--look upon \nthis Capitol and those of us who serve here for inspiration and \nleadership and unwavering devotion to our common cause.\n  So what is expected of us over the course of the next 2 years? What \nis our duty as the 100 Members of the world's greatest deliberative \nbody, the U.S. Senate?\n  We all take the same oath to support and defend the same sacred \ndocument. So, first and foremost, we are obligated--as individuals, as \nequals and, above all, as a body--to discharge our Constitutional \nduties.\n  We also have, as Senator Mike Mansfield once said, ``a primary \nresponsibility to the people whom [we] represent to face the \nlegislative issues of the nation.''\n  And I would add not just the issues of today, but the issues of \ntomorrow. This Senate must lead today on tomorrow's challenges.\n  Lastly, we have what our longest serving Member, Robert C. Byrd, \ncalls ``the duty beyond our duties.'' It is, as he so eloquently and \naccurately once stated: ``The duty to endeavor to inspire others and to \ndemonstrate, through personal example, that public service of all types \nought to be an honorable calling.''\n  Senator Byrd, I too believe public service is an honorable calling. \nAnd, my fellow Senators, you are all honorable men and women. It is a \nprivilege both to serve with you and to serve you as majority leader. \nGod bless you, our proceedings, the country we love, and the people we \nall aspire to faithfully represent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/04/senate-section/article/S5-3", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

Mr. President, I appreciate very much the remarks of the \nRepublican leader, and I think there is no better example of public \nservice than Bill Frist, a person who, if not the most prominent \ntransplant surgeon in the country, is one of the most prominent \ntransplant surgeons in the country, and he decided to become involved \nin public service and he has done it very well.\n  I repeat, there isn't a better example of public service than the \nleader.\n  When I was less than a week old, my father was working in the mine in \nChloride, AZ. It was a short way over the river from Searchlight. He \nwas working in a vertical shaft. They were sinking a shaft. He was \nworking with another man by the name of Carl Myers. They drilled holes \nand set the dynamite charges. In those days they did not have all the \nproduct liability protection we have today.\n\n  He lit the 10 fuses. One of them went off way before it was supposed \nto. He was hurt very badly. It blew him into the air, blew the soles \noff his shoes. He was in a state of shock. He knew he had to get out of \nthere because the other holes were burning. When they were sinking the \nshaft, they had a 10-foot ladder they would bring down, take it out \nwhen they climbed out of the hole, and leave it at the next level. He \nknew he had to get out of there. He put the ladder down and it would \nkeep falling. He did not realize a leg of the ladder had blown off and \nwhen he tried to climb out, it would fall.\n  On the next level was Carl Myers. He knew one of the holes went off; \nhe knew there were nine others. He did something heroic, to say the \nleast. He could not stop the other holes from going off because they \nwere covered with muck at the time, covered with dirt. So Carl Myers \nclimbed down. He was a smaller man than my dad. My dad was 6 feet tall \nand probably weighed 185 pounds. He carried him up to the next level \nand saved his life. As soon as he got up there, the holes went off.\n  I tell this story because the acts of one man did much. Among other \nthings, it allowed my mother not to be a widow, allowed her to have a \nhusband and a father for three boys. Later, another brother came into \nthe family.\n  Carl Myers received a Carnegie medal for heroism for what he did to \nsave my father's life. Lowell Thomas wrote about this episode involving \nmy father. He quoted Carl Myers as saying: To hell with the medal, \nHarry's alive, isn't he?\n  Carl Myers, from the time I was a little boy being raised in \nSearchlight, was a hero to me. Because of his decision our family was \nallowed to function.\n\n[[Page S6]]\n\n  Actions of U.S. Senators and the President of the Senate have \nconsequences, just as Carl's actions had consequences. In the Senate we \nmake decisions. We have a lot more time to make these decisions than \nCarl had deciding to go back down in the hole. The decisions we make \ntouch the lives of Americans. People all over America are affected by \nwhat we do in the Senate.\n  The citizens are counting on the Senate to make sure public schools \nare institutions that we as Americans are proud of. The American people \nare counting on us to make their life better by making medical care \neasier for them to come by. People are counting on the Senate so a \nchild's ability to go to college will not be determined by how much \nmoney the parents have. People are counting on Congress to make sure \nSocial Security is a stable fund they can depend on. People are \ncounting on Congress to make sure the environment is good, so the water \nwe drink is pure, the air we breathe is good. Women are depending on \nus. They are counting on us to make sure their wages are no longer 75 \ncents of every dollar we make as men. There is an article in the \nWashington Post today discussing a problem with more unintended \npregnancies than we anticipated. They are depending on us to do \nsomething about that. Citizens are depending on us to make sure our \nfiscal house is in order. They are depending on us to do our work in a \nbipartisan fashion to effect change in our country to the good.\n\n  I spoke to Senator Frist this past week. We are working on items for \nwhen we return in late January, items we can work on, on a bipartisan \nbasis, to show the American people that, yes, we can work together. \nThere are issues we can work on--maybe the highway bill. We did not do \nit last Congress; maybe we can do it this time. There are many other \nissues the leader and I talked about.\n  There are bipartisan opportunities, and I as the new Democratic \nleader speak on behalf of 45 Democratic Senators. We are here with our \narms open to work with the administration, the Speaker, the Republican \nleader, to accomplish good for this country. There is much we can do \nthat is going to make this country a better place.\n  Our decisions will affect the American people. We should never as a \nSenate forget that what we do has an impact on everyone.\n  I look forward to this new Congress, that we can forget what went on \nin the past, only call upon that which was positive in the past and \nlook to the future with a greater day, a nicer day, a more pleasant day \nahead.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

Mr. President, I send a resolution to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 4) expressing the sympathy and \n     pledging the support of the United States Senate and the \n     people of the United States for the victims of the powerful \n     earthquake and devastating tsunami that struck Bangladesh, \n     Burma, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, the Maldives, the \n     Seychelles, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Thailand, and other \n     areas of South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Africa, on December \n     26, 2004.\n\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Without objection, the resolution and its \npreamble are considered and agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 4), with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 4\n\n       Whereas on December 26, 2004, a tremendous earthquake, \n     registered at 9.0 on the Richter scale and centered 100 miles \n     off the coast of Northern Sumatra, Indonesia, triggered a \n     deadly tsunami that swept throughout the Indian Ocean and \n     beyond, devastating cities, towns, and communities, and \n     killing or injuring persons in Southeast Asia and South Asia, \n     through the island nations of the region, to Eastern Africa;\n       Whereas, as a result of the earthquake and ensuing tsunami, \n     more than 140,000 people have lost their lives to date, tens \n     of thousands of people are injured or missing, and the final \n     death toll could climb into the hundreds of thousands;\n       Whereas the victims also include thousands of nationals who \n     were visiting the region when the tsunami hit, including \n     significant numbers from Europe and North and South America;\n       Whereas millions of people throughout Southeast Asia and \n     South Asia have been left without food, shelter, or clean \n     water, and now face deadly diseases such as cholera, dengue \n     fever, dysentery, malaria, and typhoid;\n       Whereas thousands of children have been killed or injured, \n     by this disaster;\n       Whereas, as a result of this tragedy, thousands of children \n     have been separated from their families or orphaned and are \n     in need of re-unification or adoption;\n       Whereas whole coastal communities and cities throughout the \n     region were obliterated;\n       Whereas recovery, reconstruction, and clean-up of the \n     devastated areas likely will take years, billions of dollars, \n     and the concerted leadership of the United States working \n     together with the international community;\n       Whereas the people of the United States immediately \n     responded and expressed their sympathy and concern by sending \n     financial aid and other assistance currently totaling more \n     than $100,000,000, through nongovernmental organizations and \n     other means, to the victims of this disaster, and by offering \n     to volunteer in the disaster rescue, recovery, and \n     rebuilding;\n       Whereas soon after the earthquake and tsunami hit the \n     region, the United States\n\n[[Page S8]]\n\n     Government expressed its condolences and invoked six disaster \n     declarations for the nations hardest hit by this natural \n     disaster, thus triggering the release of emergency funding to \n     these countries;\n       Whereas less than 24 hours after these tragedies became \n     known, the United States announced an initial pledge of \n     $15,000,000 for emergency humanitarian assistance, which was \n     increased to $35,000,000 in the following days as the scope \n     of the tragedy unfolded;\n       Whereas President George W. Bush also dispatched more than \n     20 United States military cargo and patrol aircraft, \n     redirected a Marine expeditionary unit and a carrier task \n     force, and deployed several hundred United States military \n     personnel to the region to assist with the disaster response, \n     recovery, and delivery of relief supplies;\n       Whereas, in response to an early appeal by the \n     International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent \n     for $7,500,000, the United States provided $4,000,000 for the \n     distribution of emergency shelter materials and other relief \n     commodities, and provided more than 3,000 metric tons of rice \n     to the United Nations World Food Program for use in the \n     affected region;\n       Whereas President George W. Bush has established a regional \n     core group with Australia, Canada, India, Japan, and the \n     Netherlands, with the United Nations, to help coordinate \n     relief efforts, and sent a senior delegation of experts, led \n     by Secretary of State Colin Powell and Florida Governor Jeb \n     Bush, to meet with regional leaders and international \n     organizations to assess what additional aid can be provided \n     by the United States;\n       Whereas on December 31, 2004, President Bush increased the \n     United States pledge to $350,000,000 in aid and stated that \n     the United States' contributions to disaster relief and \n     recovery ``will continue to be revised as the full effects of \n     this terrible tragedy become clearer'';\n       Whereas pledges of assistance from all international \n     organizations, multilateral development banks, and \n     governments, including the United States, now exceed \n     $2,000,000,000; and\n       Whereas, on January 3, 2005, the President appointed former \n     Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton to lead a \n     nationwide charitable fund-raising effort to elicit greater \n     relief and assistance to the victims of the powerful \n     earthquake and devastating tsunami: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its heartfelt sympathy for the victims of the \n     powerful earthquake and devastating tsunami that struck \n     cities, towns, and communities throughout Southeast Asia, \n     South Asia, Eastern Africa, and the region on December 26, \n     2004;\n       (2) conveys its most sincere condolences to the families, \n     communities, and governments of the more than 140,000 people \n     that lost their lives in this terrible natural disaster;\n       (3) expresses its gratitude and respect for the courageous \n     and committed work of all aid and relief personnel, including \n     United States military personnel, who are saving lives and \n     providing relief assistance in the devastated areas of the \n     region;\n       (4) supports President George W. Bush's pledge of \n     $350,000,000 in direct financial assistance, and tens of \n     millions of dollars in additional indirect assistance through \n     the dispatch of United States military aircraft, naval \n     vessels, and personnel, and through the United States \n     Government's substantial voluntary and annual contributions \n     to international organizations and bodies;\n       (5) commends the ongoing international relief effort that \n     includes the work of individual countries, numerous \n     international organizations, and various relief and other \n     nongovernmental entities;\n       (6) reaffirms that the United States Government is \n     committed to providing relief and assistance in the most \n     effective and efficient means possible, and will continue to \n     assess, anticipate, and provide further assistance as needed \n     in the weeks and months ahead;\n       (7) recognizes that the support of the United States \n     Government will be greatly supplemented by private donations \n     and assistance from thousands of United States citizens, \n     charitable organizations, religious groups, and corporations \n     that routinely provide generous and significant amounts of \n     aid, support, and volunteers; and\n       (8) fully supports the long-term commitment and engagement \n     of the United States to provide financial aid and other forms \n     of direct and indirect assistance to the countries and \n     peoples of the region impacted by the powerful earthquake and \n     the devastating tsunami.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on the morning of December 26, one of the \nworst catastrophes the world has ever seen slammed the coast of \nSoutheast Asia, South Asia, and eastern Africa.\n  Deep in the Indian Ocean, an enormous earthquake, estimated at a \nmagnitude of 9.0 on the Richter Scale--possibly one of the most \npowerful earthquakes ever in history--caused a devastating tsunami \nwhich has now killed over 150,000 people, seriously injuring another \nhalf a million, and displacing as many as 5 million individuals from \ntheir demolished homes.\n  Thousands of people were literally washed out to sea as the enormous \nwall of water, traveling at speeds of up to 500 miles per hour in the \nopen ocean, struck the coasts of the Indian Ocean Rim. As those waves \nreceded, they took with them whole towns and villages. They took with \nthem families on holiday, fishermen at sea, and children who had gone \ndown to the beach that morning to play.\n  One only begins to comprehend the enormity of the tragedy as the \nindividual stories emerge, as they have over the last several days, \nsuch as the father who helped his daughter climb on to the roof of \ntheir hotel and drowned in his act of heroism or the 13-year-old boy \nwho held his grandmother afloat as long as he could before she \nsuccumbed to the waves.\n  The tragedy continues for these already devastated people. Survivors \nnow face the ``disaster after the disaster''--the risk of death from \ncholera, dysentery, malaria, typhoid, and diarrhea, all potentially on \nan epidemic scale. The lack of potable water and potential emergence of \nwaterborne illnesses pose an enormous public health threat.\n  In the last week, I have spent hours on the phone with ambassadors \nfrom the affected countries, with senior U.S. officials and private \ncitizens, to help coordinate some of those relief efforts. I am \ngratified--overwhelmed, in fact--by the generosity and commitment so \nmany people have shown at every level, from local communities to our \nGovernment. Their outpouring of support and concern is truly \nremarkable.\n  One friend of mine, Carl Lindner, has a son who is putting together \nmedical and relief supplies on a 747 charter to India this week.\n  Franklin Graham and my friends from Samaritan's Purse are in the \nfield right now with assessments and are investing heavily through \nSamaritan's Purse, especially in rural areas that are far from airports \nor far from towns or far from those areas we can reach as easily.\n  Condoleezza Rice and our U.S. officials are working tirelessly to \ncoordinate our efforts.\n  Fred Smith's company, FedEx, is transporting 150,000 pounds of \nPedialite formula donated by Ross Labs. The shipment was loaded onto a \nFedEx aircraft yesterday morning in Columbus, Ohio, and should arrive \nin Sri Lanka tomorrow.\n  And, of course, the American people have shown extraordinary \ncompassion and sympathy and empathy. By their own initiative, private \nindividuals and charities and nongovernment organizations and \nbusinesses have raised millions of dollars to aid the tsunami victims. \nI am filled with admiration for the compassion demonstrated by our \nfellow citizens.\n  As we return to Congress, we will act quickly on a clean tsunami \nsupplemental. President Bush announced on Friday that America has \npledged $350 million in relief assistance, with $15 million already \nspeeding toward the hands of relief organizations in the affected \ncountries. The administration will continue to revise this number as \nthe full extent of the disaster becomes known.\n\n  American military ships, airplanes, and helicopters are right now \ndelivering food. Over 48 helicopters right now are operating, \ndelivering these medical supplies and food and water. Medicine, tents, \nwater, ladders, food--all being delivered through the compassion of the \ninternational community. We have more than 20 patrol and cargo aircraft \nthat have been made available to assess the disaster and deliver relief \nsupplies. Twelve thousand of our men and women in uniform are working \naround the clock right now to reach survivors in remote corners of the \nregion and to participate in the delivery of that relief. Evacuation \nhelicopters are bringing stranded victims to safety.\n  The United States has set up a 24-hour, 7-day-a-week Disaster \nResponse Command Center at the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment headquarters here in Washington, along with regional \ncoordination centers in Thailand and Sri Lanka. Together with \ngovernments from around the world, America is leading the largest \ninternational relief effort in history.\n  As we speak, a delegation, led by Secretary Colin Powell and Governor \nJeb Bush, is meeting with leaders of the affected countries to show \nAmerica's support and solidarity, and to determine how we can continue \nto be effective, to maximize our effectiveness.\n  Later tonight I too will travel to the region to survey the damage, \nspending\n\n[[Page S9]]\n\nThursday in Sri Lanka touring disaster sites and visiting hospitals, \nsurveying our relief efforts, and lending my help wherever I can, \nincluding medical assistance. Following that, I and others will travel \nto the southeast coast of India on a similar mission.\n  The purpose of our trip is several fold: to assure the people of the \nregion that we are engaged and fully committed. The Senate is taking \nthese first steps as an institution by adopting the resolution \nexpressing our sympathy for the countries and victims affected and \npromising our full support of America's relief efforts.\n  While in the region, we will also make a personal assessment of what \nU.S. assistance is needed and will have the opportunity to meet with \nleaders of the affected countries and ask personally how America can \nbest help. I intend to ensure that aid is following as efficiently and \neffectively as possible.\n  The Senate is taking its first step here today as we consider and \nadopt the Senate resolution expressing sympathy and pledging support to \nthe victims of the earthquake and tsunami that struck the peoples of \nSoutheast Asia, South Asia, the island nations of the region, and \neastern Africa.\n  Senator Reid and I have worked closely on this effort in a bipartisan \nmanner to express the unanimous agreement of this body, the U.S. \nSenate.\n  I also thank Senator Dick Lugar, who has shown steadfast leadership \nin this time of crisis and who has worked closely on this resolution \nwith us as well. I know his committee in the coming weeks and months \nahead will be delving into many matters relating to this disaster. We \nextend our great thanks to him.\n  Let me close my remarks by offering, on behalf of myself, the U.S. \nSenate, and the American people, our deepest sympathies to the victims \nof this terrible tragedy.\n  Our hearts and prayers are with you--the victims, the survivors, and \ntheir families. The struggle to recover will be long. We all know that. \nIt will be difficult. There will be many sorrow-filled days as we learn \nthe full impact of this tragedy, but throughout the United States will \nstand shoulder to shoulder with the people of these devastated lands. \nWe are determined to help rebuild their communities and restore their \nhope.\n  America is a great nation because it is a compassionate nation. It is \nour solemn commitment and obligation as a free people to share the \nblessing of liberty, especially with those who are so desperately in \nneed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the day after the tsunami, I had the \nopportunity to meet with scores of people from Southeast Asia. There \nwere people from Sri Lanka. The person who put the event together was \nfrom Bangladesh. We had people from Thailand, India, many people. It \nwas an event in my honor. They had bought out a restaurant that night. \nIt was a festive occasion, but there was a pall over what we were doing \nas a result of the tsunami that had taken place.\n  This tsunami was so difficult. These people in Reno, NV, had come to \nour country for the opportunity to realize their hopes and dreams. Each \none of them love America, but of course they also feel an abiding love \nfor their native lands and cultures.\n  I have trouble comprehending the power of nature. I read that the \nearthquake that took place was a million times more powerful than the \nbomb dropped on Nagasaki--not one thousand times, a million times. It \nwas so powerful it threw off the Earth's rotation. This was a powerful \nact of nature.\n  In today's world, there is no such thing as an isolated event. It hit \n11 countries. We are all connected to those countries. One hundred or \nso years ago that wouldn't have been the case. Fifty years ago it would \nhave been less the case. The earthquake that caused the deadly tsunami \nwas estimated at 9.0 on the Richter Scale. It was first picked up in \nHawaii. They thought it was 8.0. I thought to myself, 8, 9, is that a \nbig difference? It is 100 times different.\n  The President pro tempore is from Alaska. It is my understanding that \nthe only earthquake in recent history that was stronger took place in \nAlaska. Fortunately, there were not a lot of people in Alaska and there \nwasn't the deadly tsunami that occurred following that earthquake.\n\n  We don't know the death toll. They found 6,000 more dead people \nyesterday, 9 or 10 days after the event. It is probably 150,000 and \ncounting. Tens of thousands of people are missing. Millions have lost \ntheir homes. We are all affected by this catastrophic loss. We all \nshare the anguish of a mother who lost a child, a father who lost a \nchild. We feel the bewilderment and fear of children who lost their \nparents. That is why I am happy this resolution contains a paragraph \ndealing with adoption.\n  We all want to help. Since this tragedy took place 9 days ago, the \nworld has seen an outpouring of aid for the victims of this tsunami. I \nspoke with the Democratic ranking member on the Finance Committee. He \nalso has to deal with Senator Grassley, the chairman. They are \nconcerned that the outpouring of charity by the people of the United \nStates will be recognized taxwise. We need to do that so they can get \nsome benefit for the money they gave before the end of the year. I hope \nwe can.\n  The American people have opened their hearts and wallets, donating \nmillions of dollars to groups such as the Red Cross that are working to \nprovide relief from this disaster. Two former Presidents with whom I \nhad the good fortune of serving in the Congress, Bill Clinton and \nGeorge Bush the first, have agreed to lead the charitable efforts for \nthe United States.\n  We got off to a slow start. There is no question about that. At the \nevent I talked about in Reno, we talked about Secretary Powell's press \nconference where he said we were going to provide $15 million. We were \nall terribly disappointed in that. I hoped that the Secretary didn't \nrealize the full impact of the tragedy that had taken place. I couldn't \nimagine he would have done that had he known. Fifteen million is half \nas much as we are spending on the inaugural ceremonies this month. And \nthen it took a while for the President to step forward. Let's put all \nthat behind us. America has now stepped forward. I am proud of what we \nhave done and what we are doing. We have a lot more to do.\n  I was glad to see the U.S. military, as stretched as we are, step \nforward with aircraft carriers and other resources that only the \nmilitary can put forward. I listened to something on Public Radio \ntoday. It said that on one island in Indonesia, they had instructed the \nAmerican helicopter pilots not to bring in any more wounded: People who \nare sick, we cannot take care of them. The American pilots brought them \nin anyway. As a result of that, the American military responded by \nsetting up a field hospital that will take care of those people. We are \ndoing a lot. We have more to do.\n  The magnitude of the disaster that befell this part of the world is \nunbelievable to most of us. I am glad that America is now responding. \nThat is why this resolution is so important. We have increased our \ncommitment. I have already talked about the aircraft, the ships, the \nhelicopters that deliver the food and water and clothing. One of those \naircraft carriers makes thousands and thousands of gallons of pure, \nfresh water every day. That will be taken off the aircraft carrier to \npeople who have despoiled water, water that is contaminated.\n\n  The response of the American people and our Government is important \nfor many reasons. Obviously, our efforts help relieve the suffering of \nthese victims, but they also help show the world what kind of a nation \nand people we are. David Ignatius wrote a wonderful column in the \nWashington Post where he talked about our ability to respond to world \nsituations when there is such a disaster. We are not going to be able \nto win the war against terror unless we are able to show the world that \nwe are a country based upon laws, not men, that we are a charitable \nnation, that we are a nation that is concerned about people's rights, \nhuman rights.\n  If we are able to show by virtue of the example we are setting with \nthe disaster that befell these 11 nations, we will be able to convert \npeople who are sympathetic to evil terrorists. We have a lot of people \nwho are sympathetic to what these evil terrorists are doing. With \nactions such as this, we will be\n\n[[Page S10]]\n\nable to show to those people who are sympathetic to the terrorists that \nmaybe their sympathy is not well placed. I am confident we can do that, \nand in the process we will win the war on terror that is being \nperpetrated against not only us but against the world.\n  I commend and applaud the majority leader for working to make the \nresolution the first order of legislative business in this session of \nCongress. It is important that we do that. Again, I appreciate the \nopportunity to speak.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the tidal waves, tsunamis, that traversed \nthe Indian Ocean and the Western Pacific on December 26 have caused \ndeath and destruction in at least 12 countries, particularly India, \nIndonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand. The tsunami disaster constitutes a \nhumanitarian tragedy of incredible proportions. Currently, experts \nestimate that more than 150,000 people have perished and countless \npeople are injured. Millions are homeless and at risk from disease. \nThese tragic numbers are expected to rise as we obtain additional \ninformation.\n  The United States is a compassionate country that will respond \ngenerously to this human catastrophe. Under the leadership of President \nBush, the agencies and resources of the U.S. Government have been \nmobilized to assist in the initial humanitarian effort. In addition, \ninnumerable individual Americans and U.S. businesses have donated \nmillions of dollars directly to international relief efforts. As the \nworld leader in international disaster assistance, the United States \nmust work closely with the international community to implement the \nmost effective response possible in the coming weeks and months.\n  Beyond the compelling humanitarian reasons for swift action, a stable \nand prosperous Asia is essential to the global effort on a range of \nshared problems, including weapons proliferation, terrorism, narcotics, \nand contagious diseases. The worldwide economic and political \nconsequences of this natural disaster could be even more severe unless \nwe commit ourselves to advancing a strong recovery in the region.\n  This resolution explains the gravity of the situation, offers \ncondolences to the victims and their loved ones, and sets the stage for \nCongress to make additional appropriations that will aid in the \nrecovery. Congress must work with the President for a generous \nsupplemental appropriation that goes well beyond the amounts of money \nalready committed.\n  A summit pledging conference is scheduled to occur in Jakarta, \nIndonesia on Thursday. The United States should be there in a \nleadership position. This will be an important opportunity to work with \nthe world community in responding to this tragedy. American \nhumanitarian, diplomatic, and national security interests will be \ndeeply affected by the outcome of this conference.\n  My heart goes out to the victims of this tragedy. While financial and \nin-kind assistance cannot replace the huge loss of life that countries \nin the region have suffered, the United States' contribution will, at \nleast, help the survivors rebuild their lives.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I express my sincere sympathy for the \nmillions of people affected by the devastating earthquake and tsunami \nthat struck Southeast Asia, South Asia, and East Africa on December 26. \nThe scale of this disaster is overwhelming, and the human losses are \nhorrifying. Families have been shattered and whole communities lost, \nand because so many international tourists were in the region, \nvirtually every part of the world--including the United States--is \nrepresented in the list of casualties.\n  I know the sorrow that I feel as I review the reports of devastating \nlosses is shared by the people of Wisconsin and by all Americans. I \nknow that we also share a sense of resolve--resolve to provide whatever \nassistance we can to the survivors and the affected communities, and \nresolve to be steadfast partners in the long-term reconstruction \nefforts that must follow the relief operations.\n  I vividly recall the powerful voices that rose up from all corners of \nthe globe in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. I \nremember how they conveyed a sense of solidarity and support that gave \nour country comfort and affirmed the bonds that unite all of humanity, \nregardless of nationality, ethnicity, or religion. Now, countless \nAmerican voices are also sounding loudly and clearly in that same \nspirit.\n  I am grateful for the efforts of so many around the world to come to \nthe aid of those in need, including U.S. military personnel who are \nworking day and night to help. Businesses and individuals from around \nWisconsin have contacted my office, looking for ways that they can \nhelp. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the resolution before the Senate \nthat expresses our sympathy and pledges our support to the victims of \nthis catastrophe, and I pledge to continue working with my colleagues \nto ensure that our words continue to be matched by our actions.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today the Senate expresses its \ncondolences over the recent tsunami disaster. Like most Americans, I \nwatched in horror over the holidays as a tsunami battered thousands of \nmiles of coastline across South Asia and Africa. The damage left in the \nwake of this disaster is almost overwhelming, and I feel a sense of \npersonal and professional obligation to do whatever can be done to help \nthose in need. Though the grim reports have varied in the days \nfollowing this disaster, it is becoming clear that nearly 150,000 \npeople have already lost their lives, and hundreds of thousands of \nothers are in grave jeopardy because of the damage inflicted by the \ntsunami. Still more families are searching for loved ones, hoping for \nany news regarding their family members' whereabouts.\n  In trying to guide a humanitarian effort through the aftermath of \nthis tragedy, the United States and the larger international community \nmust help these countries face longer term obstacles of disease, the \ndestruction of basic infrastructure, complete damage to coastal \neconomies and other fundamental hardship. America has itself been the \nvictim of great tragedies such as this, and indeed it appears that \nthousands of Americans living or traveling in South Asia and Africa \nhave themselves been affected by this horrible natural disaster.\n  My heart goes out to all these victims of the tsunami. It is time for \nthe world, particularly those nations that are most fortunate such as \nthe United States, to move rapidly with a relief and recovery effort \nthat is worthy of the size of this tragedy. I am encouraged that our \nGovernment, in cooperation with private sector charities and the \nbusiness community, has now begun to focus on what can be done to help \nthe affected countries. This tragedy provides America with an \nopportunity to show that we can lead the world, not just when it is our \nmilitary that is needed, but when we can offer our generosity and \nexpertise for a massive humanitarian effort. So many nations affected \nby this tragedy are looking to America for help and we have an \nopportunity to provide the world our leadership. In addition to it \nbeing the right thing to do, it is clearly in America's national \ninterest to be a leader in helping these countries to recover.\n  In this spirit, I wholeheartedly support the administration's pledge \nof $350 million to the relief effort. I also commend the involvement of \nformer Presidents Clinton and Bush in helping to organize a private \nrelief effort. I would also like to commend the work being done by our \nprivate sector, particularly by nongovernmental organizations and the \nbusiness community, to help those in need. This charitable work is \nquintessentially American, and these efforts are something for which we \ncan all be proud.\n  I also want to share with my colleagues that we should be aware that \nthe generosity of the American people in response to this disaster \nextends to the knowledge we have to share with the world regarding the \nmonitoring and reporting of oceanic and climatic events.\n  There is important research and monitoring already being done by the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on tsunami events, work \nthat involves the University of Washington in my State. Scientists are \nlearning how better to monitor patterns or impending developments in \nour oceans so we can be prepared for future possible events. We do not \nalways focus on the good work being done by NOAA, until something \ntragic like this tsunami occurs. Congress has\n\n[[Page S11]]\n\nan obligation to people on our coasts to fund NOAA and see that it can \ndo its job well, and we should work to fulfill that obligation.\n  In the United States, NOAA's National Weather Service operates two \ntsunami warning centers, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii \nand the West Coast/Alaska Tsunami Warning Center in Alaska. In the \nevent of a tsunami, the Centers will issue local tsunami advisories to \nthe Emergency Managers Office of each potentially affected State. The \ndecision to evacuate a coastal area rests with each responsible EM. The \nSeattle Post Intelligencer reported that the current U.S. network \nconsists of six deep-sea sensors in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Hawaii, \nand near the equator off the coast of Peru. In addition to the six \ntsunami buoys, the warning system takes advantage of existing tidal \nmonitoring stations and USGS seismic monitoring and reporting \ncapabilities. The NOAA official in charge of the system described the \ncurrent configuration as the ``bare minimum'' needed for adequate \nwarning. There are plans to expand the system to 20 tsunami buoys in \nthe next five years, 10 of which will be placed in the Aleutian \nIslands. NOAA is estimating one-time costs of $8.7 million and \nrecurring costs of $8.5 million to enhance the current system.\n  NOAA also runs a Tsunami Research Program out of the Pacific Marine \nEnvironmental Laboratory in Seattle. The objective of the Tsunami \nResearch Program is to improve warning guidance, hazard assessment, and \nimplementation planning. The Joint Institute for the Study of the \nAtmosphere and Ocean, a partnership between NOAA and UW, has also \nworked with the Tsunami Research Program on hazard assessment modeling.\n  PMEL has also developed instruments it has named tsunameters. With \nsix deployed in the middle of the Pacific since 2001 in waters 2.5 to 4 \nmiles deep, the tsunameters can detect the perturbations in water \npressure as a tsunami passes above. When it detects something, it sends \na signal by sound waves to a buoy on the surface. The signal is relayed \nto a satellite and then back to Earth to tsunami warning centers in \nHawaii and Alaska, a process that takes only 2 minutes.\n  No significant tsunamis have yet occurred in the Pacific for the \ntsunameters to detect, but they have prevented a false alarm. In \nNovember 2003, a magnitude 7.8 undersea earthquake occurred near the \nAleutian Islands, spurring officials to issue a tsunami warning. When \nthe wave passed over a tsunameter, they saw it was small and canceled \nthe warning.\n  In conclusion, I again express my condolences and those of \nWashingtonians to those who have lost family members in this tragedy. \nThe Senate should do all it can to help all those who face a long and \ndifficult cleanup.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I wish to express my profound condolences \nfor the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Southeast Asia, South \nAsia, and Africa. I commend our two leaders for writing S. Res. 4, \npassed unanimously by the Senate earlier this afternoon. It is right \nand fitting that on our first day of business in this Congress the \nSenate has united to send a message of hope and leadership to the \nvictims of this horrible disaster.\n  We were all mortified to learn of the devastation caused by this \ndisaster as we awoke after a day of Christmas celebrations. The news \nfrom this disaster has been arriving so fast and furious that it is \nhard to put the kinds of numbers we are talking about in perspective. \nWe know there are more than 150,000 people dead--that is 150,000 \npersonal tragedies. And there are hundreds of thousands of others who \nare homeless and whose lives have been turned upside down by this \ntragedy. We said clearly to their families and loved ones in our \nresolution today that we are here to help them recover and rebuild.\n  The generosity and compassion of America will be felt in Bangladesh, \nBurma, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, Maldives, Seychelles, \nSomalia, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, and Thailand. In fact, our troops and \nhumanitarian assistance professionals are already bringing hope to \nthose countries in the form of water, food and comfort. We thank our \ntroops for their hard work and for showing the world the best of \nAmerica, as they always do.\n  I am also mindful this afternoon that this terrible disaster has \nwreaked havoc in our own country and in my own state of Colorado. My \nthoughts and prayers go out to all the victims and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/04/senate-section/article/S11-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is with sadness that I rise to pay \ntribute to the life of a great friend, a great man who passed away on \nDecember 31. His name was Monsignor Ignatius McDermott and he was known \nas Father Mac, from the city of Chicago. He was a model of compassion, \ncommitment, and service.\n  On December 31, when he left this Earth, he was 95 years old. He made \nhis name in Chicago because of his dedication to some of the poorest \npeople who lived in that city. When he was a young priest, he had many \noptions. He worked in parishes and had different assignments, but he \nknew there was a special calling in his life, a calling that very few \npriests, very few people would even consider. Monsignor McDermott, \nFather Mac, dedicated his life to walking Chicago's meanest streets, \nskid row, and becoming the priest, the chaplain, of thousands of people \non those streets addicted to drugs and alcohol.\n  Ironically, he died on the 29th anniversary of the day that he \ncofounded Chicago's largest addiction treatment center, Haymarket \nCenter.\n  He was born in the ``Back of the Yards'' neighborhood. If you read \nUpton Sinclair's book ``The Jungle,'' you know what the stockyards \nmeant to the city of Chicago. That is where the immigrant families \nheaded. That is where they could find a job that required hard work and \na strong back and barely make a living. That is where he grew up.\n  He was known in his youth as just the kid brother of the famous \nalderman, Jim McDermott. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1936. He \nwas assigned to what is now known in Chicago as Maryville Academy, a \nhome for neglected and abandoned orphaned children. It was there that \nhe saw for the first time in his ministry how alcoholism affected \nfamilies.\n  He disagreed with the common sentiment in Chicago and across the \ncountry that alcoholism was just a character flaw: If you had a little \nbetter character, you might overcome that problem. He understood it was \na disease and it needed to be treated. So Father McDermott brought \nAlcoholics Anonymous, which in the late forties was really a creation \nfor the middle class of America, to the people of skid row in Chicago, \npeople whose alcoholism had left them in the worst possible plight.\n  In 1963, he founded the Central States Institute of Addiction because \nhe recognized the need for qualified treatment counselors and \neducators. It was there that Illinois's first program for offenders \nconvicted of driving under the influence of alcohol was created.\n  In the 1970s, he led the charge in our State to decriminalize public \ndrunkenness. On New Year's Eve 1975, along with Dr. James West, who \nwould go on to direct the Betty Ford Center in California, Father \nMcDermott founded Haymarket Center.\n  I have had the privilege in public life to meet some amazing people, \nand I count Monsignor McDermott--Father Mac--as one of those people.\n\n[[Page S12]]\n\n  When I first came to the Senate, the Irish-American clubs of Chicago \ncame to me and suggested we should have a postage stamp that would \nacknowledge the contribution of Irish immigrants to America. I was \nsurprised it had never happened. So the first phone call I made in the \nSenate was to my colleague, Senator Ted Kennedy. If there is anything \ndealing with Irish Americans, you better get Ted Kennedy on board. He \nthought it was a great idea. So we worked together, and we were \nsuccessful.\n  The Postal Commission decided to commission a commemorative stamp \ncommemorating the immigration of the Irish to Chicago. Ted and I tried \nto decide which one of us would announce the stamp. By seniority, he \nwas able to announce the first-day issue in Boston, the same day I \nwould unveil the stamp in Chicago.\n  I thought to myself: Who will I invite from this city of so many \ngreat Irish Americans to come and represent those of that ethnic origin \nat the unveiling of the stamp? I looked around at some of the obvious: \nFather John Smith of Maryville, the institution I mentioned earlier, \nwho did so much to help so many young children; Sister Rosemary of \nMisericordia Center, just an amazing, wonderful, and warm, touching \ncenter for children who were born with mental affliction and mental \nillness. I thought of Father Jim Close, who runs Mercy Home for boys \nand girls in Chicago. I thought what a great contribution he made. I \nthought of my pastor from my parish, Father Jack Wall from old Saint \nPat's, a downtown parish that serves so many people in that community. \nBut I also thought of Father Mac.\n\n  I brought them all together. They were up there with me on that stage \nwhen we unveiled the stamp. When I got up, I said: If you want to know \nthe contribution of the Irish people to the city of Chicago, look at \nthese five people and the dedication of their lives and what they have \ndone to help so many people. Had the Irish been pushed away and shunned \nfrom coming to America, would someone else have stepped into their \nroles?\n  I thought about that again when Father Mac passed away. He took an \nassignment most priests would not even consider: going to those mean \nstreets, those poor areas of Chicago. That was his ministry. How many \ntimes would each one of us, as we are walking along with our family on \nthe street, see someone who is obviously intoxicated or sick with \naddiction and maybe pick up our pace and walk a little faster? For \nFather Mac, that is exactly when he would slow down and stop to try to \ndetermine what he could do.\n  He dedicated his life to these people. There were so many amazing \nstories that came from it, lives that were saved, people who were given \na chance to succeed. When he opened the Haymarket Center--it is right \nbehind Greek Town in Chicago, if you happen to know the city a little \nbit. It used to be a part of the city that mainly was warehouses. Now \nit is becoming pretty gentrified with a lot of lofts and condominiums, \nwith a lot of people moving in, a lot of trendy restaurants, but when \nit was one of the poorest parts of Chicago, Father Mac established \nHaymarket Center because that is where he could find the people who \nneeded his help.\n  I have been there several times. He had a little chapel in Haymarket \nwhere he would hold mass on Sundays, and many people came to join him \nat that little service. As they walked around Haymarket Center, they \nunderstood that even though those were some of the poorest people in \nsome of the worst places in our city, Father Mac always treated them as \nhis brothers and sisters. He went out of his way to give them the \ndignity and attention they deserved.\n  Those of us who were privileged to have known Father Mac will \nremember his wonderful ability to always see good in people and to \nconvince those same people not to give up on themselves. He was a \nvisionary, he was a leader, and he was a friend. But he was more. When \nI think back on my life, on those I have met who made a profound \nimpression on me and who if they did not reach the level of sainthood \nwere knocking at the door, Father Mac was one of those people.\n  I extend my deepest condolences to all of those who join me in \ntreasuring the fond memories of Monsignor Ignatius McDermott. We start \nthe new year with a heavy heart but with a renewed commitment that each \nof us in some small way will try to continue the ministry of this \nwonderful man.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn).

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss \nbriefly the status of efforts to have asbestos tort reform legislation, \na matter which has been before the Congress of the United States for \nmore than two decades.\n  I had my first contact with the issue back in 1984 when then-Senator \nGary Hart of Colorado brought in a constituent to talk about asbestos. \nIt has been an issue which we have labored with long and hard, and in \nthe last Congress, Senator Hatch, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nadvanced legislation with the concept of a trust and a schedule of \npayments to avoid the costs and risks of litigation and to treat \nasbestos injuries very much like workers' compensation.\n  A bill was passed out of the Judiciary Committee last July, pretty \nmuch on a party-line vote, as the distinguished Presiding Officer, \nSenator Cornyn of Texas, knows because he was and is on the Judiciary \nCommittee and did a prodigious amount of work on this issue. The bill \nwas passed out with a number of problems. I voted for it to move it \nalong. I then enlisted the assistance of the former Chief Judge of the \nCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Edward R. Becker, who was in \nsenior status. Judge Becker convened a large group of so-called \nstakeholders in his chamber. For two full days in August, he met in his \nchambers with representatives of the manufacturers, representatives of \nthe AFL-CIO, representatives of the insurance industry, the reinsurance \nindustry, and trial lawyers to start to work through a large number of \nproblems which appeared to be intractable. We have worked through many \nof those problems, but some still remain.\n  There had been some talk about a draft bill being offered, but it is \nnot appropriate to offer legislation until later this month under the \nprocedures established by the majority leader, and the proposed draft \nlegislation is not quite ready, although a great deal of work has been \ndone on it.\n  There have been major issues raised as to what the total amount of \nthe trust fund should be. There have been issues raised as to how much \nmoney should be in the startup fund; how long the trust fund ought to \nfunction before giving the claimants the right to revert to the \njudicial system because the legislation necessarily takes away their \nright to jury trial in consideration of a certain amount of money to be \npaid under the trust fund; and the problems that many victims are \nhaving where they are unable to collect from anyone--people with \nmesothelioma, a deadly disease, with cancer, with many ailments from \nthe exposure to asbestos.\n  This would be the offset to giving up the right to a jury trial.\n  We have adopted an approach of reverting back to the right to jury \ntrial if the elaborate system does not work. I think the system is \nrealistically calculated to be successful.\n  Following the meetings in Judge Becker's chambers last August, there \nhave been some 32 sessions held in my conference room, presided over by \nJudge Becker with myself in attendance for most of those meetings.\n  To repeat, a lot of progress has been made. It is my hope to be able \nto circulate a draft bill as a vehicle for discussion. I call it a \ndiscussion draft bill. My hope is that it could be circulated before \nthe end of the week, but it is not possible to make any firm \ncommitments because candidly every time we come upon a sequence of \nnegotiations, other problems arise. If there is any way to reconcile \nthem and to have a consensus before going into print, we are trying to \ndo that.\n\n[[Page S13]]\n\n  It had been my hope last year, as we worked through the process, to \nhave a bill by consensus. Senator Frist and the then-Democratic leader, \nSenator Daschle, did a great deal of work and exchanged letters. At one \npoint we thought we were on the verge of a consensus, but it did not \nwork out.\n  In order to pass a bill, as we all know, in the last stages of a \nlegislative session, it has to be by consensus because any single \nSenator can hold up a bill in its final stages. That consensus was not \npossible, and although we were very close on many issues, there are \nsome issues where there is still some difference of opinion. The \ndifferences have been narrowed, and we have come a long way.\n  It is my hope to circulate a draft discussion bill, and there likely \nwill still be some blanks. We will fill in as many of the blanks as we \ncan, and then Judge Becker and I will be available to meet with the \nstakeholders in my conference room on Monday to talk about the areas \nwhere there has been agreement, to talk about the specifics on a draft \ndiscussion bill, and to talk about the areas where there are still \ndifferences as to how we might bridge that gap.\n  I have worked with Senator Leahy. I commend him for his work with \nChairman Hatch on this matter. We have talked about having a hearing \nnext Tuesday on January 11. I am not unaware of the fact that it is not \na convenient time, but Senator Leahy will be present and I think there \nwill be some other Senators present. We have given several weeks \nnotice. We are aware it is a difficult time, but there are many \nhearings held in the Senate with just a few Senators, the chairman, and \nthe ranking member present. I think it is important to move ahead.\n  At that time, it is the expectation that we will hear testimony from \nJudge Becker to lay out the draft discussion bill and then to hear \ntestimony from the stakeholders identifying the parts of the bill which \nthey choose to comment about where there are agreements or where there \nare disagreements. We know from experience that the early part of a \nlegislative session is necessarily slow, but that early on in February, \ncertainly in March, sometimes by mid-February, we begin to move ahead \nand the calendar begins to be crowded.\n  There are many items which the President has identified as \nlegislative priorities. We will have confirmation hearings starting \nwith White House Counsel Gonzales on Thursday and there will be other \nconfirmation hearings. So it is my hope to be able to present a bill \nthrough markup at a very early date. Whether that can be done in late \nJanuary or early February, frankly, remains to be seen.\n  When we marked up this bill the last Thursday of July of 2003, it was \na very long markup. It lasted more than 12 hours, as the distinguished \nPresiding Officer will recollect. In a sense, we had the longest markup \nin the history of the Senate with the sessions in Judge Becker's \nchambers and the 32 sessions in my conference room. I thought it would \nbe useful to briefly describe where we have been and in a sense where \nwe are going so our colleagues will know what the status is as fully as \nit can be described without actually circulating a draft discussion of \nthe bill, which will be done at the earliest possible time.\n  I thank the Chair. I commend him for his lonely vigil. This was a \nthriving Chamber three hours ago with standing room only and suddenly \nthe business of the Senate is not quite so pressing with only the \nPresiding Officer and this Senator present. So in the absence of any \nother Senator, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for as much time as I consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/04/senate-section/article/S13-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13-S15]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DELIVERING SOLUTIONS TO THE NATION'S PROBLEMS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \nexpand on what I discussed at the outset of this session, now about 3 \nhours ago. I would like to focus not just on what we must do as \nindividual Senators, but also on what this Senate can do and can \nachieve together, as a body. With the President and the House as \npartners, we can deliver meaningful solutions to the real problems that \nconfront our Nation. We can secure freedom and safety and a healthier \nfuture for generations of Americans to come.\n  We made much progress toward these goals in the last Congress and we \ndid so in a very narrowly divided Senate. Even with the rough and \ntumble of election year politics, we found ways to work together for \nthe common good of our country. We can, we must, and I believe we will \nachieve at least the same and hopefully even greater success in the \nSenate.\n  No doubt it will be a challenge. The makeup of this Senate is unique. \nThe margins between the majority and the minority may be wider, but the \nmargins at the ends of the ideological spectrum are wider still.\n  We also have our own prerogatives as equals, as individual Senators, \nas members of our respective caucuses. And we have principles, \nprinciples to which I hope each and every one of us will hold tight \nduring the next 2 years and throughout our careers in public service. \nBut we also have an obligation to this body and to the people and to \nthe Nation we serve to conduct that business with civility and with \nforesight and a sharp focus on those meaningful solutions. The agenda \nbefore us is simply too ambitious, too urgent, and too important to the \nfuture of our country and the world to do otherwise. Every Member of \nthis body can take pride in the accomplishments of the last Congress, \nthe 108th Congress. We took on big issues. We took on huge challenges. \nAnd our actions translated into solutions. Together we proudly moved \nAmerica forward.\n  For years Congress talked about providing seniors with relief from \nthe skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs through Medicare. Finally, \nin 2003, Congress took action and passed the first substantial \nimprovement to Medicare since the program was created 40 years ago. \nToday, more than 6 million seniors have prescription drug discount \ncards that are saving them 10 percent to 25 percent on their medicines; \ntens of thousands more are signing up every week; and within 12 months \nevery senior on Medicare will have affordable access to a comprehensive \nprescription drug benefit. Challenge; action; solutions.\n  Before President Bush took office, our economy was tilting toward \nrecession. Then the Internet bubble burst, corporate scandals rattled \ninvestor confidence, and terrorist attacks devastated our economy. We \ntook action. We cut taxes for every American who pays taxes and we \nreduced taxes on businesses, helping them invest and expand and be more \ncompetitive in the global economy. Since August 2003, our businesses \nhave created over 2.4 million jobs, we reduced the unemployment rate \nfrom a peak of 6.3 percent last June to 5.4 percent today, and aftertax \nincome is up by more than 10 percent since 2000. Challenge; action; \nsolutions.\n  On September 11, 2001, the United States was ruthlessly and brutally \nattacked by terrorists. More than 3,000 innocent men, women, and \nchildren were murdered. America and indeed the world changed forever. I \nam proud of the support this body has given to our Commander in Chief \nand the brave men and women who risk their lives every day to defend \nour country. We provided $87 billion to help our military buy equipment \nand support operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. To date, our forces \nhave killed or captured three quarters of al Qaida's leadership. They \nhave toppled two terrorist regimes, and in the process they have \nliberated 50 million people and put them on the path to self-\ngovernment.\n\n  The Senate also adopted the most sweeping overhaul of our \nintelligence system since the creation of the CIA itself. This will \nbolster and better organize our intelligence efforts to win the war on \nterror and face those new security threats of the 21st century. Again: \nChallenge; action; solutions.\n  These are just several of the achievements of the last Congress. But \nthe\n\n[[Page S14]]\n\npattern that has been set is clear. America faced urgent challenges. We \nacted with solutions, and with the heart and drive and genius of our \npeople we moved America forward.\n  Earlier today we witnessed 34 Members take that oath of office of a \nU.S. Senator. It is a wonderful tradition that dates back to that first \nCongress in 1789. The oath at that time was a simple 14-word phrase:\n\n       I do solemnly affirm that I will support the Constitution \n     of the United States.\n\n  Those same 14 words form the vital core of today's oath, the oath \nthat 34 Senators took now 3 hours ago. They bind us and all who have \nserved in this body before us, many of whom joined us today, to a \ncommon, a timeless, and a paramount cause.\n  Our first responsibility above all else is to do our constitutional \nduty. Nothing should come before it. Nothing should stand between it--\nnot party, not ideology, and certainly not politics.\n  Yet, in the last Congress I believe the Senate failed to perform an \nessential constitutional duty. It failed to offer advice and consent to \nthe President by filibustering ten judicial nominees and threatening to \nfilibuster another six. These filibusters were unprecedented. Never in \nthe history of the Senate has a minority filibustered a judicial \nnominee who had clear majority support. This was an abrupt and an \nunfortunate break in more than 200 years of Senate tradition, of Senate \nhistory. This tradition must be restored, not merely because we honor \nthe traditions of the Senate, but because this tradition reflects the \nproper role for this body, the Senate, as designed by our Framers in \nthe constitutional arrangement.\n  Next month we will have the opportunity to restore Senate tradition. \nI will bring one of the President's very capable, qualified, and \nexperienced judicial nominees to the floor. We can debate that \nnomination. We can vote to support it or to oppose it. And we must \noffer the President advice and consent by giving this and future \njudicial nominees who are brought to the floor up-or-down votes.\n  Some, I know, have suggested that the filibusters of the last \nCongress are reason enough to offer a procedural change today, right \nhere and right now, but at this moment I do not choose that path.\n  Democratic colleagues have new leadership. And in the spirit of \nbipartisanship, I want to extend my hand across the aisle.\n  I have a sincere hope that we can move forward past difficulties--\nbeyond the past difficulties we saw in the last Congress--and look \nforward to a future of cooperation.\n  I seek cooperation, not confrontation. Cooperation does not require \nsupport for the nominees. Cooperation simply means voting judicial \nnominees brought to the floor up or down.\n  So let me say this: If my Democratic colleagues exercise self-\nrestraint and do not filibuster judicial nominees, Senate traditions \nwill be restored. It will then be unnecessary to change Senate \nprocedures. Self-restraint on the use of the filibuster for \nnominations--the very same self-restraint that Senate minorities \nexercised for more than two centuries--will alleviate the need for any \naction. But if my Democratic colleagues continue to filibuster judicial \nnominees, the Senate will face this choice: Fail to do its \nconstitutional duty or reform itself and restore its traditions, and do \nwhat the Framers intended.\n  Right now, we cannot be certain judicial filibusters will cease. So I \nreserve the right to propose changes to Senate rule XXII, and do not \nacquiesce to carrying over all the rules from the last Congress.\n  As a public servant who has twice taken an oath to support and defend \nthe Constitution, I cannot stand idly by, nor should any of us, if the \nSenate fails to do its constitutional duty. We, as Senators, have our \nconstitutional duty to offer the President advice and consent.\n  Although our constitutional duties are paramount, we also have a \nlegislative responsibility to the people we serve and to the Nation. \nThis is our opportunity to take on the challenges that each of us \nsought public office to pursue. After all, we are here not just to \noccupy our offices but to lead, to be bold, to take action, and to get \nthings done.\n  First, there is work left undone from the last Congress, and we need \nto act on it.\n  America is long overdue for an energy policy. We need a plan in place \nto reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bolster conservation \nefforts. Last Congress, the Senate passed an energy bill that would \nhave done just that. I am hopeful we will be able to do the same this \nyear and work with House leaders and the President to finish the job.\n  We also need to eliminate frivolous lawsuits by reforming asbestos \nliability, medical liability, and our class action system. Frivolous \nlawsuits cost our economy more than $250 billion per year. That is more \nthan 2 percent of our gross domestic product--the equivalent of over \n$800 on every American. To keep our economy growing and competitive, we \nneed to act now.\n  I will bring class action reform to the floor early next month. I am \nconfident we will pass this bill and take a big first step to restoring \nsanity and fairness to our legal system.\n  Second, in the last Congress, we led on the most urgent issues facing \nAmerica. And we still need to keep our focus on issues such as \nprotecting our homeland from biological threats. But we must also lead \ntoday on tomorrow's challenges. We need to look to the horizon and \nask ourselves: What will be the cost in the future if we fail to act \nnow?\n\n  The President has put Social Security reform among his top priorities \nfor his second term. He has laid out wise and essential principles: \nprotecting the benefits of today's seniors, not raising payroll taxes, \nand giving younger Americans the opportunity to save, own, and invest a \nportion of their own Social Security dollars. But in the end, the \ndetails on how to accomplish Social Security reform will fall to \nCongress. This will require a tremendous amount of work, especially \nfrom our skilled committee chairmen. It will also require us to work \ntogether across the aisle--both parties in both Houses. If we do so, I \nbelieve we will be able to achieve the goal of putting a bill that \naddresses the short-term and long-term gaps in Social Security on the \nPresident's desk.\n  As we consider Social Security reform, we cannot turn a blind eye to \nother entitlements. Gathering on the horizon is a Medicare perfect \nstorm: skyrocketing health care costs that are affecting every family \nand an increasing number of seniors--a doubling in the number of \nseniors--over the next 30 years, and fewer and fewer workers paying \ninto the program.\n  Keeping the promise of Medicare to seniors will place an untenable \nburden on younger Americans and their children and their grandchildren. \nIn fact, the total unfunded liability in the Medicare Program far \nexceeds Social Security's unfunded liability. We have a moral \nresponsibility to begin to have a conversation about the long-term \nchallenges facing Medicare.\n  In the short term, we can work to reduce health care costs in \ngeneral. The fact is, our health care system--it is not even really a \nsystem. Our health care sector is fantastically inefficient. We can \nmake it much more productive.\n  Just think about it for a minute. We can access our bank accounts \nfrom nearly anywhere in the world with our ATM cards, but we can't \ntransfer our CAT scan results digitally from one hospital to another \nhospital across the street for a second opinion. We can pay bills on \nline, we can order groceries on line, and we can even apply for a \nmortgage on line--all in a matter of minutes. But if we happen to be in \na car accident, if we are knocked unconscious with our lives at stake, \nparamedics and emergency room doctors cannot quickly check for blood \ntype or allergies to our medicines.\n  It doesn't make sense. We can fix it by encouraging the use of \ninformation technology. By reforming our broken medical liability \nsystem, by expanding portable tax-free accounts, among other things, we \ncan begin to hold that line on health care costs and improve our \nsystem.\n  I am pleased the President is firmly committed to working with \nCongress to make health care more affordable and accessible.\n  He is also committed, as I am, to protecting the values that serve as \nthe foundation of a healthy society: Marriage, family, and a culture of \nlife that protects human dignity at every stage of development.\n\n[[Page S15]]\n\n  Finally, we need to elevate global issues of moral consequence.\n  This is becoming increasingly apparent in the past week. During the \nlast 9 days, we have all been deeply saddened by the unfolding tragedy \nin Southern Asia. Estimates now put the death toll at more than \n150,000, more than a third of which are children. And the statistics \ndon't capture the sorrow, the sadness, that sense of loss, the \npsychological impact that will leave longstanding scars.\n  When we resume our business later this month and the President \nrequests our assistance, we will set aside what we are working on to \nprovide funding quickly and cleanly.\n  Later tonight I will be leaving with several of our colleagues to \ntravel to the devastated areas. We will report back about what America \ncan do to aid relief and recovery efforts.\n  America is the most generous Nation in the world. We will step up \nwith all the resources, all the compassion, all the hope that we can \nmuster in these next few weeks and beyond. We have done so as a nation. \nWe have done so as a people many times before.\n\n  Last Congress we stepped up in the fight against global HIV/AIDS. We \nstepped up with an unprecedented $15 billion commitment. We will keep \nthat commitment strong. We need to work hard to bring peace, stability, \nand humanitarian support to war-torn nations such as Sudan.\n  Americans are a compassionate people. We, as Senators, can help \ncapture that and channel it for the good of the world. It is our \nresponsibility. We will do just that.\n  In his most recent news conference, President Bush said this about \nhis second-term agenda:\n\n       All of these goals require the energy and dedication of \n     members of both political parties. Working in a spirit of \n     bipartisanship, we will build the foundation of a stronger, \n     more prosperous country.\n\n  The President is exactly right. The challenges before this Congress \nare so vital to the future of our country. We must work together to \naddress them. Through our history, America has been served best by \nleaders who treat each other and their offices with respect and \ncivility and decency.\n  I think of George Washington who, at the age of just 16, copied out \nby hand a list of 110 Rules of Civility and Decent Behavior in Company \nand Conversation. This act shaped the early character of Washington and \nin turn the indelible character of our Nation.\n  In recent history, Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill come to mind. \nAlthough they stood on opposite sides of the ideological spectrum, they \nenjoyed a wonderful relationship, a fruitful friendship. On the \nSpeaker's 70th birthday, President Reagan invited him to the White \nHouse for a celebratory lunch. At the end of the meal, the President \nraised a glass of champagne and toasted the Speaker:\n\n       Tip, if I had a ticket to heaven and you didn't have one, \n     too, I'd sell mine and go to hell with you.\n\n  Many have enjoyed friendships just like that in the Senate. I know I \ndo, and so do many of our spouses. The Senate, as I have often said and \nreferred to in my remarks earlier today, is a family. The sense of \nfamily does not come across on the television screen and certainly \ndoesn't come across in the newspapers. What the American people too \noften see and what I don't believe they like is an extreme \npartisanship, a partisan bickering and a lack of cooperation. Some of \nthat is just the nature of the news. Conflict, as we all know, sells \nadvertising and catches people's attention, but it is also the nature \nof Washington today with all of the competing special interests.\n  There is still something else at work. Somehow, we have become more \ndefined by the forces that divide us than the common cause that unites \nus. The civility that once was the hallmark of this body has eroded \nover time. I recognize, we all recognize, it will take time to regain \nit. But we must begin. We must begin now and we will begin.\n  I applaud the orientation for new Members that Senators Carper and \nAlexander and others helped organize just this November. Our nine newly \nelected Senators worked with veterans of this body to learn, as my \ncolleague from Tennessee said, what it takes for the Senate to function \nas an institution and fulfill its constitutional role. We need more \nefforts just like this, such as in Senate policy forums, bipartisan \nleadership meetings, all of which would be a good start.\n  These are issues I have discussed with the Democratic leader. I ask \nour colleagues to come to Senator Reid and me with other suggestions \nthey may have over the next several weeks. Leaders on both sides of the \naisle need to set an example, but the whole body needs to share in this \neffort. We all need to commit to restoring civility in the Senate. If \nwe do, with time, I believe, the Senate again can become what it was in \nthe so-called golden age, what the great statesman and Senator, Daniel \nWebster, called in his last major address:\n\n       . . . A body not yet moved from its propriety, not lost to \n     a just sense of its own dignity and own responsibilities, and \n     a body to which the country looks, with confidence, for wise, \n     moderate, patriotic and healing counsels.\n\n  I close by expressing a concept that is by no means new but is \nessential to our deliberations and, in the end, to the future for \nAmerica. It is the concept that this body, the Senate, act as one.\n  During my decade of service in this body, I have seen extraordinary \nacts of courage. I have seen men and women endure overwhelming currents \nof political pressure. Sometimes they have done this standing alone and \nindependent; sometimes they have crossed the aisle and cast a deciding \nvote with the opposing party. Every time, however, it has been for one \nsimple reason: to do what their hearts told them was right for the \npeople they represent and for the Nation.\n  Where leaders perform such acts of courage, they subjugate their own \npolitical interests to the higher purpose of the whole. Although they \nmay pay a political price, they are rewarded with honor and with pride \nand with respect.\n  In the end, those rewards are priceless. Those rewards last--not only \nin the hearts of public servants but in the hearts of the people they \nrepresent.\n  The Senate's longest serving majority leader, the late Mike \nMansfield, said of this body:\n\n       In the end, it is not the Senators as individuals who are a \n     fundamental importance. In the end, it is the institution of \n     this Senate. It is the Senate itself as one of the \n     foundations of the Constitution. It is the Senate as one of \n     the rocks of the Republic.\n\n  Let us do the duty of U.S. Senators, our constitutional duty and our \nduty to our people and our Nation. Let us do so with respect and \ncivility and decency for this body and for each other. As we do, let us \nsecure for every American a freer, safer, and healthier future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/04/senate-section/article/S15-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15-S18]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the Chamber, I commend the \nmajority leader for his interest in health care, in particular. I have \nalways thought it is far away the most important issue at home. I have \ncome to the Senate to talk about some of the opportunities in this \nsession to work in a bipartisan way on these critical issues. In fact, \nI was going to mention that the Senator and I have pursued legislation \nto tackle the problem of child obesity. I appreciate the majority \nleader's interest in health care and look forward to working with him \nin this session.\n  Mr. President, colleagues, I have believed health care is the most \nimportant issue at home since my days as director of the Oregon Gray \nPanthers. I have thought health care was the most important issue \nbecause, in a sense, if our folks do not have their health, it is not \npossible to work, to learn, to raise children, or do much of anything \nthe American people value.\n  For me, this is the big priority at home. When we look at what is \nhappening today with medical costs gobbling up everything in sight, the \ndemographic revolution with so many more older people, the tremendous \nlifesaving technologies we have today which, of course, carry a big \nprice tag, all of these forces come together to present an issue that \njust cannot be ducked any longer. To put it in perspective, David \nWalker, the Comptroller General of the Government Accountability \nOffice, put it pretty well, saying that the Medicare problem is about \nseven times greater than the Social Security problem and it has gotten \nmuch worse. It is\n\n[[Page S16]]\n\nmuch bigger. It is more immediate. It is going to be much more \ndifficult to effectively address.\n  That is the view of the Comptroller General. He is talking about \nMedicare. But in my view, the concerns that David Walker talks about \nwith respect to Medicare extend to the health care system as a whole.\n  This afternoon for a few minutes I will chart a course as it relates \nto health care: first, a number of steps that could be taken right now \nthat would significantly help the American people as we deal with this \nhealth care challenge. Then I will discuss, for the longer term, \nanother bipartisan effort I have had a chance to team up with Senator \nHatch on that will be implemented over the next few weeks.\n\n  But if I might, I would like to start with Medicare. I think Senator \nFrist is right; these Medicare costs are soaring. For the prescription \ndrug legislation alone, it is clear now the price tag will be in the \nvicinity of $100 billion more than Congress originally calculated. That \nis the current estimate. Many have said it will be much greater. I \nthink it is critically important that steps be taken to contain costs, \nparticularly as relates to this fast-growing area that we will be faced \nwith, that is prescription drugs.\n  We all hear about it from our constituents. Every time we are home, \nfolks tell us about how skyrocketing prescription drug costs are such a \nhardship on them. They want to know what Congress is going to do to \nrespond to it.\n  One of the things I think has been so exacerbating about this issue \nof cost containment as it relates to prescription drugs is that the \nMedicare program is not even employing the kind of cost containment \ntools you see in the private sector. If you are talking, for example, \nabout a big timber company, the Presiding Officer (the Senator from \nIdaho) and I know big timber firms and other natural resources firms \nuse their bargaining power in order to try to hold down the cost of \nmedicine and other essentials. The Medicare program is not doing that. \nThe Medicare program is not using the kind of bargaining power that \nexists in the private sector today.\n  In fact, if you are an older person, and you go off and purchase your \nmedicine, either now or even in the future, under many of the plans \nthat will be offered under the new program, you have no bargaining \npower, and in effect you are subsidizing those big private-sector \nbuyers, whether they are steel firms, timber firms, auto companies, or \nvarious other kinds of concerns. I do not think that is right.\n  (Mr. TALENT assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am very pleased I have had a chance over the last few \nyears to team up with Senator Snowe of Maine on a bipartisan effort to \ncontain those prescription drug costs, using essentially the model of \nmore bargaining power the way private sector firms have.\n  Part of the Medicare prescription drug bill that I think is very \nunfortunate is a statutory ban on Medicare using its bargaining power \nto hold down the cost of medicine the way big private-sector buyers \nwould use their bargaining power. So Senator Snowe and I would like to \nchange that. We would like to lift that bargaining power restriction so \nMedicare would be in a position to use marketplace forces to hold down \nthe cost of prescription drugs.\n  A few weeks ago, we got a big boost for our bipartisan legislation \nwhen the outgoing Secretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary \nTommy Thompson, said he wished he had had the power the bipartisan \nSnowe-Wyden legislation would provide. Secretary Thompson gave a press \nconference, I believe on the day he announced his resignation, and \nspecifically said he wished he had had the tools that the bipartisan \nlegislation the Senator from Maine and I have authored would provide at \nthe time of his service because he could have made those scarce \nMedicare dollars stretch further.\n  So I think Secretary Thompson gave a pretty ringing bipartisan \nendorsement for the legislation Senator Snowe and I will be \nreintroducing very shortly. It seems to me to make sure that seniors \nget the best value in the marketplace, that taxpayers get their money's \nworth under the Medicare program, a program that is, of course, soaring \nin costs, we ought to make sure we use the kinds of tools the private \nsector uses.\n  In the bipartisan legislation I have written with Senator Snowe--it \nis called the MEND bill, the Medicare Enhancement for Needed Drugs \nlegislation--we would have a chance, in my view, to significantly rein \nin these costs using the power of the marketplace. But I bring this up \nfirst by way of saying this is just the beginning of what I think we \ncould do in this session of Congress.\n\n  I want to move now to the issue of catastrophic illness. The Senator \nfrom Missouri and I represent a lot of small businesses. We enjoyed our \nservice on the Small Business Committee when we were in the House. I \nthink we and our colleagues all understand if you have a small \nbusiness, say a hardware store with six people, and one or two of them \nget particularly sick, that essentially blows the whole health care \nsystem for that small hardware store or furniture shop or what have \nyou. In effect, if one or two of the people get sick at the small \nbusiness, the premiums go through the roof for everybody, and they \nessentially can go so high that it is not possible for the firm to \noffer coverage at all.\n  I was struck in the campaign by Senator Kerry's proposal because I \nthought it was a very innovative way to help those small businesses \nrein in their costs. In effect, he was going to use the concept of \nreinsurance for very large bills that would be faced by a small \nbusiness. If you have the Government picking up the very large bills \nfor the one or two people at the hardware store in Missouri who have \nthese illnesses, that can stabilize the rate system for everybody.\n  I thought the Kerry proposal was a good idea. I come to the floor to \nbring it up because I think if you compare the Kerry proposal to some \nof the ideas offered by the distinguished majority leader, Senator \nFrist, who was just on the floor, his Healthy Mae proposal, while \ndifferent than the Kerry proposal, certainly in a number of respects \nboth of them are looking at the same core concept, which is to use this \nidea of reinsurance to pick up the very large bills that would be faced \nby some of our small businesses.\n  I think when you look at the Kerry proposal, when you look at the \nFrist proposal, there is a lot of common ground there to tackle a \nhealth care issue of enormous concern to millions of families. All \nacross this country we have citizens who face the prospect of going to \nbed at night knowing that if the medical bills soar through the roof, \nthey could lose everything. They could lose their home, the capacity to \neducate their kids. They could lose virtually everything.\n  So I think it is important we enact a catastrophic illness program. \nThis idea, by the way, has percolated around for decades. Democratic \nPresidents have talked about it. Republican Presidents have talked \nabout it. Senator Kerry has authored an innovative proposal. Senator \nFrist has come up with ideas that I happen to think are attractive. \nWhat we ought to be doing as a body is looking for common ground and \nthe opportunity to work together. As Senator Snowe and I have done with \nprescription drug cost containment, I would hope the Senate could come \ntogether for a bipartisan catastrophic illness proposal that I think \nwould make a very meaningful dent in these huge expenses we so often \nface for catastrophic illness.\n  There are other areas that lend themselves to immediate action as \nwell. In this regard, I particularly commend the distinguished senior \nSenator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, and the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, for their outstanding work on mental \nhealth. We have been working for some time to try to ensure that there \nwould be mental health parity. Having had my late brother, Jeff, suffer \nfrom schizophrenia, I have watched these families jostled around in the \nhealth care system for years. I know colleagues of both political \nparties have as well. There is no reason why we cannot get a bipartisan \nmental health parity effort, a Domenici-Kennedy bill, working with the \nother body, get that enacted into law, and get it sent to the \nPresident--again, a chance for immediate action.\n  Finally, I mentioned briefly the issue of childhood obesity. It is \nobvious that\n\n[[Page S17]]\n\nwe now have literally an epidemic of childhood obesity problems \noccurring early on in life that produce other deadly and costly \nillnesses such as diabetes and heart disease. Senator Frist and I, \nworking with a group of health advocates for children and independent \nscientists, have put together a bipartisan bill. I hope we can use that \nlegislation as an opportunity for the Senate to come together.\n  Our proposal essentially involves a modest Government role, \nparticularly at the outset of the program. Then we use a foundation \napproach to generate additional funds in the private sector. But at the \nend of the day, under that legislation, we would have a grassroots \njuggernaut all across the country focused on our schools, on our \nfamilies, tackling this issue of childhood obesity. Again, there is no \nreason why we could not act immediately.\n  On these kinds of issues--and I have outlined four of them now--I \nbelieve Congress is on the cusp of success. Bipartisan efforts are \nunderway. Certainly they need some tweaking and some changes, going \nthrough the committee process and the negotiations that are essential \nto pass legislation, but for all practical purposes, in each of these \nareas--prescription drug cost containment, a program to deal with \ncatastrophic illness, mental health parity, and fighting childhood \nobesity--we have legislation that is camera-ready to tackle these very \nserious health care concerns. We ought to have it.\n  As the Congress moves on these initiatives, we have to also move to \naddress the health care system of tomorrow. In this regard, Senator \nHatch and I have worked for several years on the Health Care That Works \nfor All Americans Act. We got it funded finally last year as part of \nthe appropriations legislation. Now the Government Accountability \nOffice is moving to set in place the first stage of the legislation, \nwhich would involve naming the 14 individuals who would be part of the \nCitizens' Health Care Working Group.\n  The bipartisan effort Senator Hatch and I have pursued for several \nyears is built on the proposition that it is time for the country and \nthe Congress to try something different and to look at this in a \ndramatically altered way. This may be of some interest to the Presiding \nOfficer because essentially Harry Truman, in the 81st Congress in 1945, \ntried on the health care issue what Bill Clinton tried back in 1993 and \n1994, and essentially all Presidents have tried in between the 1940s \nand the 1990s. That was to write legislation in Washington, DC. The \nAmerican people would find these big Federal health reform bills \nincomprehensible. The various powerful interest groups would attack \neach other. And essentially nothing would happen. It was essentially \ndriven in the confines of the beltway in Washington. Literally for more \nthan five decades in the debate about creating a health care system \nthat works for everybody, we would essentially have paralysis.\n  What Senator Hatch and I have sought to do is to try something \ndifferent; that is, to essentially start this debate outside the \nbeltway, to try to involve the American people in the most important \nquestions, not the various arcane issues about what every single \npayroll tax level ought to be, but the big kinds of questions--I will \noutline a couple of those in a moment--and then use that kind of \neffort, where citizens could be involved in community meetings, \ncitizens could weigh in online, citizens could participate in a variety \nof ways, to try to build a consensus for the kinds of reforms that \nwould be needed to create a health care system that works for everyone.\n\n  Under our legislation, after the Citizens' Working Group is named by \nMr. Walker, the head of the Government Accountability Office, what \nhappens next is the working group essentially would put out for the \nAmerican people, in simple, straightforward English, information--it \ncould be available online, in booklets, senior centers, other places \nwhere folks gather--about where the health care dollar goes today. This \nyear we are going to spend in the vicinity of about $1.8 trillion on \nhealth care. That is what we are spending on health care, yet it is \nclear that as far as the country is concerned, there really is no sense \nwhere that $1.8 trillion goes now and what the alternatives are for \nperhaps spending it in a different fashion.\n  That would be the first task of the Citizens' Working Group, to put \nout online, in booklets available throughout our communities, \ninformation about where the health care dollar goes today and what the \nvarious options are for where it might be targeted as an alternative so \nAmericans would have a chance to say: Look, what I am interested in is \nthis kind of approach. Let's say a health savings account or the \nAssociated Health Plan concept, the health plan concept the Senator \nfrom Missouri has advocated.\n  Other citizens might say: I am interested in a single payer kind of \nsystem, perhaps in a small community. They think that is the approach \nthat makes sense for them. The point is, until you tell the American \npeople where the health care dollar is going now, it is hard to have a \ndebate with respect to changes that might be necessary so the Congress, \non a bipartisan basis, could in effect move forward with legislation \nthat would create a system that works for everybody.\n  When Senator Hatch and I began this effort, we made a systematic \neffort to make it as inclusive as we possibly could. The legislation \nearly on won the support of the Chamber of Commerce, the AFL-CIO, and \nthe American Association of Retired Persons--certainly a coalition that \ndoesn't agree all the time on health care or other kinds of issues. We \nhave had many groups endorse the effort since. The reason they have is \nthey believe it is critical that something new be tried.\n  What happens under our legislation, after the Citizens' Working Group \nhas made it possible for folks to see where the $1.8 trillion we are \nspending on health care goes now, is that our citizens will have a \nchance to participate in open community meetings, online, and other \nkinds of sessions so that they would have a chance to be heard on the \nsecond stage of this very different approach with respect to health \ncare reform.\n  After our citizens have had a chance to be heard, then the Citizens' \nWorking Group in effect takes that kind of sentiment they have heard \nfrom all corners of the Nation and tries to synthesize it into a set of \nrecommendations to the Congress. And under our legislation, within 60 \ndays after the Citizens' Working Group has provided the recommendations \nto the Congress with respect to what the American people have said, \neach committee of jurisdiction has to begin hearings on what has come \nfrom the Citizens' Working Group in terms of the recommendations of the \nAmerican people.\n  I want to close by giving a few examples of the kind of areas where I \nthink we have to have the input of the American people where they have \nnever been asked. For example, the issue of end-of-life care is \nabsolutely essential in terms of a new focus for health care reform. We \nknow that many of our health care dollars are spent in the last few \nmonths of an individual's life. We are told by many medical experts--\ndoctors, hospitals, and others--that in many of those instances there \nis nothing they can do that is medically effective, and there is \nnothing they can do to enhance the quality of life for the individual. \nSo the question for the country and for courageous political leadership \nis: What should we do with respect to end-of-life care?\n  If we are being told by our best doctors and hospitals that they \ncannot do anything that is medically effective, cannot do anything to \npromote a better quality of life for individuals, do we want to refocus \nthe health care dollars to make sure, for example, that there are \nbetter hospice programs and better end-of-life care programs for \nindividuals facing those kinds of health challenges? I personally think \nthat is where the American people are going to end up. Let's ask them, \nfor the first time, how they want to deal with these very difficult \nsocial and ethical issues with respect to American health care. I \nsubmit that financial issues with respect to health care are very \ndifficult, no question about that. I think the social and ethical \nissues, with respect to end-of-life care, where much of the health care \ndollar gets spent today, are even more challenging, but we have to act. \nThat is the kind of question that would be posed by the Citizens' \nWorking Group. I think other issues are important.\n  I am particularly interested in the issue of personal responsibility. \nI think that has been part of what has been driving the debate with \nrespect to health savings accounts and other such\n\n[[Page S18]]\n\napproaches. I have been discussing with my constituents in town hall \nmeetings the idea that if we are to have a system that works for \neverybody in terms of affordable quality health care, I am prepared to \nsay that an individual should, every time they use a medical service, \nif they are not destitute, have to make a payment on the spot so as to \nensure that there is a clear requirement of personal responsibility. \nCertainly, that will be controversial, but that is the kind of issue \nthat has to be discussed with respect to health reform.\n  Finally, I think the question of addressing health care--and \nparticularly Senator Hatch and I have tried to do it in a bipartisan \nway--means you have to get beyond the blame game. Sometimes when you \nhave a discussion about health care, the topic comes up that \nRepublicans say it is the trial lawyers' fault; nail the trial lawyers \nand everything is going to be fine. Then you go meet with Democrats and \nDemocrats say, yes, we have to have health reform. Go nail the \ninsurance companies; do that and everything will be fine. I think--and \nSenator Hatch and I have talked about this--if we are going to have a \nhealth care program that works for all Americans, we are going to have \nto get beyond the blame game. You bet changes need to be made in the \ninsurance sector, because they do skim the cream and take the healthy \npeople, and they do send sick people to Government programs that are \nsicker than they are. There do need to be changes in those insurance \npractices. I think we also understand that there are frivolous cases \nand abuses in the legal sector, and changes would be necessary there if \nwe are to have meaningful reform and a health care program that works \nfor all Americans.\n\n  It seems to me this is an issue that we cannot duck because come \n2010, 2011, 2012, medical costs will clearly consume just about \neverything in sight. I submit that the problems we are seeing today in \nterms of small business premium hikes, folks falling between the \ncracks--they are not old enough for Medicare or not poor enough for \nMedicaid; our Medicare providers are understandably frustrated by the \nreimbursement system--if we keep nibbling at the Medicare health care \nsystem, the problems we are seeing today are going to seem like small \npotatoes compared to what happens in 2010, 2011, and 2012. On New \nYear's Day in 2008, this demographic influx, in effect, of 7 million-\nplus retirees we will see over the next few years is going to start to \nretire. That happens New Year's Day 2008. So the reason I have come to \nthe floor this afternoon is I wanted to outline a number of steps--\nfour, specifically--that I thought Congress could tackle in a \nbipartisan way that would make a meaningful difference right now: the \nlegislation Senator Snowe and I have authored in terms of prescription \ndrug cost containment, using marketplace forces to hold down \nprescription drug costs; catastrophic illness, and looking particularly \nat ideas that Senators Kerry and Frist have talked about; the question \nof mental health parity; childhood obesity. Again, we can build where \nthere is a bipartisan foundation for congressional action. These are \nsteps we ought to take now. Then we ought to use the next couple of \nyears--as Senator Hatch and I have tried to do in a bipartisan kind of \nway--to build a health care system that works for all Americans. Our \nlegislation is moving ahead.\n  The Government Accountability Office is appointing the Citizens' \nHealth Care Working Group right now. The $3 million appropriated for \nthe legislation--and I am grateful to Senators Specter and Harkin for \nthat particular work--is going to allow us, in our Health Care That \nWorks For All Americans Act, to take a very different approach to break \nthis spiral which dates back to 1945, tried by Harry Truman in the 81st \nCongress, and continued literally up through the time of President \nClinton. Making sure the public has the facts is the first task of the \nCitizens' Health Care Working Group established in the legislation I \nhave authored with Senator Hatch. Second is to make sure the public \ngets a chance to weigh in. Finally, to ensure public accountability, \nthe Congress is under a requirement to move forward with hearings after \nthe Citizens' Working Group has reported.\n  So I think it is appropriate on this first day of the new session to \nzero in on the health care issue. I have been very closely following \nthe discussions colleagues on both sides of the aisle have made with \nrespect to the tragedy that has taken place overseas. I am very pleased \nto hear that Majority Leader Frist is leading a trip to the area and \nwill come back with ideas for bipartisan action on that terrible \ntragedy. I wanted to talk about what I think is the most pressing issue \nat home, the health care challenge, and particularly to outline \nbipartisan steps that could be taken now. I also look forward to \nworking with my colleagues as the legislation I have authored with \nSenator Hatch is implemented in the weeks ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for up to 45 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first let me say to my friend, Senator \nWyden, he has always been a champion of that cause. A lot of us with \ndifferent political philosophies rely on his judgment, his experience, \nhis background, and those things he has accomplished in the field of \nhealth care. I look forward to working with him in this coming year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/04/senate-section/article/S18-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18-S24]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GLOBAL WARMING DEBATE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, as I said on the Senate floor on July 28, \n2003, much of the debate over global warming is predicated on fear \nrather than science. I am the chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. In addition to its normal expected jurisdictions, the \ncommittee also has a lot to do with the Energy bill. We have probably \nas many provisions in the Energy bill as the Energy Committee does. It \nis one with which we have great concern.\n  We recognize we have an energy crisis in America. The House passed a \nvery good Energy bill last year. We should have passed it in the \nSenate. We did not. I hope we will pass it this time. In the meantime, \nwe need to do what I committed to do when I became chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee 2 years ago. We are going to \nencourage decisions that are made in Government to be made on sound \nscience.\n  Many times that is not the case, and such a case is the hoax referred \nto as ``global warming.'' I called the threat of catastrophic global \nwarming the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people in a \nstatement, to put it mildly, that was not viewed very kindly by the \nenvironmental extremists and their elitist organizations.\n  I also pointed out in a lengthy committee report that those same \nenvironmental extremists exploit the issue for fundraising purposes, \nraking in millions of dollars, even using Federal taxpayers' dollars to \nfinance the campaigns.\n  For these groups, the issue of catastrophic global warming is not \njust a favored fundraising tool. In truth, it is more fundamental than \nthat. Put simply, man-induced global warming is an article of religious \nfaith to the radical far left alarmists. Therefore, contending that its \ncentral tenets are flawed to them is heresy and of the most despicable \nkind. Furthermore, scientists who challenge its tenets are attacked \nsometimes personally for blindly ignoring the so-called scientific \nconsensus. That is not all. Because of their skeptical views, they are \ncontemptuous, dismissed for being ``out of the mainstream.''\n  This seems to me highly ironic. Aren't scientists to be nonconforming \nand question consensus? Nevertheless, it is not hard to read between \nthe lines. ``Skeptic'' and ``out of mainstream'' are their thinly \nveiled code phrases meaning anyone who doubts the alarmists' orthodoxy \nis, in short, a quack.\n  I have insisted all along that the climate change debate should be \nbased on fundamental principles and science, not religion. Ultimately, \nI hope it will be decided by hard facts and data and by serious \nscientists committed to the principles of sound science instead of \ncensoring skeptical viewpoints, as my alarmist friends favor.\n  These scientists must be heard, and I will do my part to make sure \nthey are\n\n[[Page S19]]\n\nheard. I am sure the Presiding Officer from Rhode Island is very much \nconcerned with the sound science with which we address this subject.\n  Since my detailed climate change speech in 2003, so-called skeptics \ncontinue to speak out. What they are saying is devastating to the \nalarmists. They amassed additional scientific evidence convincingly \nrefuting the alarmists' most cherished assumptions and beliefs. New \nevidence has emerged that further undermines their conclusions, most \nnotably those of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange, IPCC, one of the major pillars of the authorities cited by the \nextremists and climate alarmists.\n\n  I guess what I am saying is we are going to be looking at this new \nevidence. Just since we have adjourned and have come back in today to \nswear in our new Members, the scientists are almost entirely on the \nside that there is no sound science behind the idea that, No. 1, the \nclimate is changing and, No. 2, if it is that it is the result of \nmanmade gases. Evidence has come to light in very interesting times.\n  Just last month, the 10th Conference of the Parties--that is called \nthe COP-10--to the Framework Convention on Climate Change met in Buenos \nAires to discuss Kyoto's implementation and measures to pursue beyond \nKyoto.\n  As most of my colleagues know, Kyoto goes into effect on February 16. \nI think, with the exception of Russia, an exception I will explain \nlater, the nations that ratified Kyoto and agreed to submit to its \nmandates are making a very serious mistake.\n  I went to this meeting, the conference, COP-9, last year in Milan, \nItaly. It was shocking to see what was actually going on there. I was \ninvolved in a mission in west Africa. I saw a person I deal with on a \nregular basis from a little country in west Africa who was there. It \nhappens that his title in his country's government is Minister of the \nEnvironment. I said: What are you doing here? Do you really believe in \nthis Kyoto stuff?\n  He said: Oh, no, this is the biggest party of the year.\n  These people are paid for by the United Nations and paid for by this \ncountry, in an inordinate amount, percentage, to come up with and have \nbig parties for 3, 4, 5 days in some of the most exotic places in the \nworld just to show support for Kyoto. It is outrageous.\n  In addition, last month, a popular author, Dr. Michael Crichton, who \nhas questioned the wisdom of those who trumpet a scientific consensus, \nreleased a new book called ``State of Fear.'' You all know who Dr. \nMichael Crichton is. He is a medical doctor as well as a scientist and \nbest-selling author. This is all premised on the global warming debate.\n  I am happy to report Dr. Crichton's new book reached No. 3 on the New \nYork Times bestseller list. I highly recommend this book to the \nPresiding Officer. I will supply him with this book because I think it \nis imperative people see some of what is going on right now and how \npublic opinion is catching on to this hoax that has permeated our \ncountry for so long.\n  Dr. Crichton, as I said, is a medical doctor and scientist. He very \ncleverly weaved a very compelling presentation of the scientific facts \nof climate change--with ample footnotes and documentation throughout, I \nmight add--into a gripping plot. From what I can gather Dr. Crichton's \nbook is designed to bring some sanity to the global warming debate. In \nthe author's message at the end of his book, he refreshingly states \nwhat scientists have suspected for years. He says:\n\n       We are also in the midst of a natural warming trend that \n     began about 1850--\n\n  I do not know who will argue with that.\n\n       --as we emerged from a 400 year cold spell known as the \n     Little Ice Age.\n\n  Dr. Crichton states that ``nobody knows how much of the present \nwarming trend might be a natural phenomenon,'' and ``Nobody knows how \nmuch of the present trend might be man-made.''\n  For those who see impending disaster in the coming century, Dr. \nCrichton writes:\n\n       I suspect that people of 2100 will be much richer than we \n     are, consume much more energy, have a smaller global \n     population, and enjoy more wilderness than we have today. I \n     don't think we have to worry about them.\n\n  For those who do worry or induce such worries in others, ``State of \nFear'' has a very simple message: Stop worrying and stop spreading \nfear. Throughout the book, fictional environmental organizations are \nmore focused on raising money, principally by scaring potential \ncontributors with bogus scientific claims and predictions of the global \napocalypse, than they are with saving the environment.\n  As the saying goes, here we have art imitating life. As my colleagues \nwill remember from a floor speech I gave last year, this is part and \nparcel of what these organizations peddle to the general public. Their \nfearmongering knows no bounds. Just consider the debate over mercury \nemissions. President Bush proposed the first ever cap to reduce mercury \nemissions from powerplants by 70 percent. True to form, these groups \nsaid he was allowing more mercury into the air. Now stop and think \nabout it. Right now there is no cap on mercury. It is proposed by this \nPresident for the first time.\n  As I mentioned earlier, several nations, including the United States, \nmet in Buenos Aires in December for the 10th round of the international \nclimate change negotiations. I am happy to report that the U.S. \ndelegation held firm both in its categorical rejection of Kyoto and the \nquestionable science behind it.\n  Paula Dobriansky, Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs and the \nleader of the U.S. delegation, put it very well when she told the \nconference:\n\n       Science tells us that we cannot say with any certainty what \n     constitutes a dangerous level of warming, and therefore what \n     level must be avoided.\n\n  Ms. Dobriansky and her team also rebuffed attempts by the European \nUnion to drag the United States into discussions concerning post-Kyoto \nclimate change commitments. With the ink barely dry on Kyoto \nratification, not to mention what the science of climate change is \ntelling us, Ms. Dobriansky was right in dubbing post-2012 talks \npremature.\n  It was clear from discussions in Buenos Aires that Kyoto supporters \ndesperately want the United States to impose on itself mandatory \ngreenhouse emissions controls. Moreover, there was considerable \ndiscussion but no apparent resolution over how to address emissions \nfrom developing countries such as India and especially China, which \nover the coming decades will be the world's leading emitter of \ngreenhouse gases.\n  Developing nations, most notably China, remained adamant in Buenos \nAires in opposing any mandatory greenhouse gas reductions now or any \ntime in the future. Securing this commitment was a necessary component \nfor the U.S. ratification of Kyoto.\n  Now, some may not have been here at the time, but 2 years ago we \npassed the Byrd-Hagel resolution that said that if Kyoto treats \ndeveloping nations any different than developed nations, we will not \nratify it. That passed 95 to 0. Every Senator voted that way, and it \nwas very clear. So I think one can say with that commitment at least in \nthe United States that Kyoto is dead.\n  Kyoto goes into force on February 16. According to the European Union \nEnvironmental Ministry, most EU member states will not meet their Kyoto \ntargets. That is kind of interesting because the very people who are \nbehind it and are so adamant that, yes, we must do this, are the ones \nwho have not met their voluntary targets and have no real intention of \ndoing so. They may do so only on paper due to Russia's ratification of \nthe treaty.\n  Russia, of course, ratified Kyoto not because its government believes \nin catastrophic global warming--it does not--but because ratification \nwas Russia's key to joining the World Trade Organization. Also, under \nKyoto, Russia can profit from selling emission credits to the European \nUnion and continue business as usual without undertaking economically \nharmful emissions reductions.\n\n  Just stop and think about this now. We are talking about the huge, \nmassive country of Russia. I have been active in aviation for 48 years \nnow, and I had occasion a few years ago to fly an airplane around the \nworld, replicating the flight of Wiley Post. In doing so, I went all \nthe way across Siberia. I can remember going not just hour after hour \nbut time zone after time zone, seeing no signs of civilization, just \ngreat forests. Well, they ended up getting credits for all of that. \nWhen I talked to the\n\n[[Page S20]]\n\nRussian people last year in Milan, Italy, they were very \nstraightforward, saying: No, there is no science to it, but we stand to \nmake millions of dollars if we sign on to this thing.\n  That was my first indication that they were going to do so.\n  So as the talks in Buenos Aires revealed, if alarmists cannot get \nwhat they want at the negotiating table, they will try other means. I \nwas told by reliable sources that some delegation members of the \nEuropean Union suddenly hinted that America's rejection of Kyoto could \nbe grounds for a challenge under WTO. I surely hope this was just a \nhypothetical suggestion and not something our European friends are \nactively and seriously considering. I predict such a move would be \ndevastating to the United States and the United States-European Union \nrelations, not to mention the WTO itself.\n  I suspect it is not just hypothetical. The lawsuit is the stock and \ntrade of environmental activists. We are witnessing a new crop of \nglobal warming lawsuits now being leveled at individual U.S. companies \nand at the United States itself.\n  In Buenos Aires, Earth Justice, a San Francisco-based environmental \ngroup, and the Center for International Law announced plans to seek a \nruling from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights that the \nU.S., because of its supposed contribution to global warming, is \ncausing environmental degradation in the Arctic and therefore violating \nthe human rights of Alaska's Inuits, or Eskimos. As the New York Times \nwrote:\n\n       The commission, an investigative arm of the Organization of \n     American States, has no enforcement powers. But a declaration \n     that the United States has violated the Inuits' rights could \n     create the foundation for an eventual lawsuit, either against \n     the United States in an international court or against \n     American companies in a U.S. court, said a number of legal \n     experts, including some aligned with industry.\n\n  The Times did not mention that such lawsuits already have been filed \nwith the U.S.\n  Eliot Spitzer, New York's State attorney general, along with eight \nother State attorneys general, mainly from the Northeast, last year \nsued five coal burning electric utilities in the Midwest. The reason: \n``Given that these are among the largest carbon dioxide polluters in \nthe world,'' Mr. Spitzer wrote, ``it is essential that the court direct \nthem to reduce their emissions.''\n  To me, this is a clear-cut sign of desperation by the alarmists, but \nI am not surprised. President Bush has rejected Kyoto. The Senate has \nrejected Kyoto 95 to 0. The Senate rejected the McCain-Lieberman bill \nby 55 to 43, and there is little hope that Congress will pass \nmandatory greenhouse gas reduction, at least not in the near future. So \nresorting to the courts is their last hope. I hope the courts have \nenough sense in moderation to reject these lawsuits out of hand.\n\n  I am interested, for one, to see how Mr. Spitzer quantifies with \nscientific precision just how these particular companies have \ncontributed to climate change. How is it, one might ask, that \nemissions, specifically from American Electric Power, are causing \nrising sea levels, droughts, or hurricanes? Such efforts fly in the \nface of compelling new scientific evidence that makes a mockery of \nthese lawsuits.\n  By now most everyone familiar with the climate change debate knows \nabout the hockey stick graph constructed by Dr. Michael Mann and his \ncolleagues which shows that temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere \nremained relatively stable over 900 years and then spiked upward in the \n20th century. The hockey stick graph was featured prominently in IPCC's \nthird assessment report published in 2001. The conclusion inferred from \nthe hockey stick is that industrialization, which spawned widespread \nuse of fossil fuels, is causing the planet to warm.\n  I spent considerable time examining this work in my 2003 speech \nbecause Dr. Michael Mann effectively erased the well-known phenomena of \nthe medieval warming period. In other words, he never even recognized--\nI wish we had the chart because I have a chart that shows this, and one \ncan see the shaft of the hockey stick over 900 years go like this, but \nall of a sudden in the 20th century it starts up like this, and they \nfailed to realize that there was another blade in the hockey stick that \nwas the medieval warming period where the temperatures were warmer than \nthey are today. This has been going on since creation. I think the fact \nthat he did it--I was challenged in a speech that I made in Italy on \nthis subject. I said I believe Michael Mann must have intentionally \nleft that off because that completely destroys the credibility of his \nfindings.\n  But don't take my word for it. Just ask Dr. Hans Von Storch, a noted \nGerman climate researcher, who, along with colleagues, published a \ndevastating finding in the Sept. 30, 2004 issue of Science magazine. As \nthe authors wrote: ``We were able to show in a publication in Science \nthat this [hockey stick] graph contains assumptions that are not \npermissible. Methodologically it is wrong: Rubbish.''\n  Dr. Von Storch and colleagues discovered that the Mann hockey stick \nhad severely underestimated past climate variability. In a commentary \non Dr. von Storch's paper, T.J. Osborn and K.R. Briffa, prominent \npaleoclimatologists from the University of East Anglia, stressed the \nimportance of the findings. As they wrote, ``The message of the study \nby von Storch et al. is that existing reconstructions of the NH \n[northern hemisphere] temperature of recent centuries may \nsystematically underestimate the true centennial variability of \nclimate'' . . . and, ``If the true natural variability of NH [northern \nhemisphere] temperature is indeed greater than is currently accepted, \nthe extent to which recent warming can be viewed as `unusual' would \nneed to be reassessed.'' In other words, in obliterating the Medieval \nWarm Period and the Little Ice Age, Mann's hockey stick just doesn't \npass muster.\n  Dr. Von Storch is one of many critics of Michael Mann's hockey stick. \nTo recount just one example, three geophysicists from the University of \nUtah, in the April 7, 2004 issue of Geophysical Research Letters, \nconcluded that Mann's methods used to create his temperature \nreconstruction were deeply flawed. In fact, their judgment is harsher \nthan that. As they wrote, Mann's results are ``based on using end \npoints in computing changes in an oscillating series'' and are ``just \nbad science.'' I repeat: ``just bad science.''\n  As to the arctic climate assessment, these findings, alongside a \nspate of new reports, at least in the eyes of the media supposedly \nconfirm the ``consensus'' on global warming. ``The Arctic Climate \nImpact Assessment,'' released last fall, perfectly fits that mold. \n``Arctic Perils Seen in Warming,'' blared a headline by the New York \nTimes. As the Times wrote: ``The findings support the broad but \npolitically controversial scientific consensus that global warming is \ncaused mainly by rising atmosphere concentrations of heat-trapping \ngreenhouse gases, and that the Arctic is the first region to feel its \neffects.''\n  What do we really know about temperatures in the Arctic? Let's take a \ncloser look. As Oregon State University climatologist George Taylor has \nshown, Arctic temperatures are actually slightly cooler today than they \nwere in the 1930s. As Dr. Taylor has explained, it's all relative--in \nother words, it depends on the specific time period chosen in making \ntemperature comparisons. The Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, Dr. \nTaylor wrote: ``appears to be guilty of selective use of data. Many of \nthe trends described in the document begin in the 1960s or 1970s--cool \ndecades in much of the world--and end in the warmer 1990s or early \n2000s. So, for example, temperatures have warmed in the last 40 years, \nand the implication, `if present trends continue,' is that massive \nwarming will occur in the next century.''\n  Dr. Taylor concluded this way: ``Yet data are readily available for \nthe 1930s and early 1940s, when temperatures were comparable to (and \nprobably higher than) those observed today. Why not start the \ntrend there? Because there is no net warming over the last 65 years?\n\n  This is pretty convincing stuff. But, one might say, this is only one \nscientist, while nearly 300 scientists in several countries, including \nthe United States, signed onto the Arctic report. I want to submit for \nthe record a list of scientists, compiled by the Center For Science and \nPublic Policy, from several countries, including the United States, \nwhose published work shows current Arctic temperature is no higher than \ntemperatures in 1930s and 1940s.\n\n[[Page S21]]\n\nFor example, according to a group of 7 scientists in a 2003 issue of \nthe Journal of Climate: ``In contrast to the global and hemispheric \ntemperature, the maritime Arctic temperature was higher in the late \n1930s through the early 1940s than in the 1990s.'' Or how about this \nexcerpt from the 2000 International Journal of Climatology, by Dr. \nRajmund Przybylak, of Nicholas Copernicus University, in Torun, Poland: \n``The highest temperatures since the beginning of instrumental \nobservation occcured clearly in the 1930s and can be attributed to \nchanges in atmospheric circulation.''\n  I ask unanimous consent the list of scientists be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [See exhibit 1.]\n  Mr. INHOFE. Despite this evidence, alarmism is live and well. As you \ncan see behind me, the Washington Post today ran an editorial cartoon \nthat, yes, actually blames the Sumatra tsunami on global warming. Are \nwe to believe now that global warming is causing earthquakes? The \ntsunami, of course, was caused by an earthquake off Sumatra's coast \ndeep beneath the sea floor, completely disconnected from whatever the \nclimate was doing at the surface. Regrettably, the tsunami-warming \nconnection merely confirms the state of fear extremists are so eager to \ncreate. As Terence Corcoran of Canada's Financial Post wrote: ``The \nurge to capitalize on the horror in Asia is just too great for some to \nresist if it might help their cause . . . Green Web sites are already \nfilling up with references to tsunami risks associated with global \nwarming.''\n  There is something inhumane about that, that they would capitalize on \nthe tragedy of a hundred thousand people to push a hoax like global \nwarming.\n  To address this, let's ask some simple questions: Is global warming \ncausing more extreme weather events of greater intensity, and is it \ncausing sea levels to rise? The answer to all of these is emphatically \nno. Just look at this chart behind me. It's titled ``Climate Related \nDisasters in Asia: 1900 to 1990s.'' What does it show? It shows the \nnumber of such disasters in Asia, and the deaths attributed to them, \ndeclining fairly sharply over the last 30 years.\n  Let's take hurricanes. Alarmists linked last year's hurricanes that \ndevastated parts of Florida to global warming. But this is patently \nfalse. Credible meteorologists were quick to dismiss such claims. Hugh \nWilloughby, senior scientist at the International Hurricane Research \nCenter of Florida International University stated Plainly: ``This isn't \na global-warming sort of thing. . . It's a natural cycle,'' A team led \nby the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Dr. \nChristopher Landsea concluded that the relationship of global \ntemperatures to the number of intense land-falling hurricanes is either \nnon-existent or very weak. In this chart you can see that the overall \nnumber of hurricanes and the number of the strongest hurricanes \nfluctuated greatly during the last century, with a great number in the \n1940s. In fact, through the last decade, the intensity of these storms \nhas declined somewhat.\n  What about sea level rise? Alarmists have claimed for years that sea \nlevel, because of anthropogenic warming, is rising rapidly. Based on \nmodeling, the IPCC estimated that sea level will rise 1.8 millimeters \nannually, or about one-fourteenth of an inch.\n  But in a study published this year in Global and Planetary Change, \nDr. Nils-Axel Morner of Sweden found that sea level rise hysteria was \noverblown. In his study, which relied not only on observational \nrecords, but also on satellites he concluded that: ``there is a total \nabsence of any recent `acceleration in sea level rise' as often claimed \nby IPCC and related groups.'' Yet we still hear of a future world \noverwhelmed by floods due to global warming. Such claims are completely \nout of touch with science. As Sweden's Morner puts it, ``there is no \nfear of massive future flooding as claimed in most global warming \nscenarios.''\n  What I have outlined today will not appear in the New York Times. \nInstead you will read much about ``consensus'' and Kyoto and hand \nwringing by its editorial writers that unrestricted carbon dioxide \nemissions from the United States are harming the planet. You will read \nnothing, of course, about how Kyoto-like policies harm Americans, \nespecially the poor and minorities, causing higher energy prices, \nreduced economic growth, and fewer jobs. After all, that is the real \npurpose behind Kyoto, as Morgot Wallstrom, the EU's environment \nminister, said in a moment of candor. To her, Kyoto is about ``leveling \nthe playing field'' for businesses worldwide--in other words, we can't \ncompete, so let's use a feel-good treaty, based on shoddy science, \nfear, and alarmism, which will have no perceptible impact on the \nenvironment, to restrict America's economic growth and prosperity. \nUnfortunately for Ms. Wallstrom and Kyoto's staunchest advocates, \nAmerica was wise to the scheme, and it has rejected Kyoto and similar \npolicies convincingly. Whatever Kyoto is about--to some, such as French \nPresident Jacques Chirac, it's about forming ``an authentic global \ngovernance''--it's the wrong policy and it won't work, as many \nparticipants in Buenos Aires conceded.\n  I recommend--and I will include at the end of my remarks--the \neconomic study which was done by the Wharton School of Economics \ntalking about what would happen to America and the cost of global \nwarming. If we should sign on to Kyoto, what would it cost? They go \ninto detail. They talk about doubling the price of energy. They talk \nabout the price of fuel more than doubling.\n  Keep in mind this is the economic survey. They talk about the cost to \nthe average family of four in America being $2,715 a year by 2010.\n  People have to understand that the economic destruction of our \ncountry is something that would inure to the benefit of the European \nUnion and many others who are in competition with us. We have to \nunderstand that there is an economic motive behind it which one would \nhave to seriously consider.\n  Despite the bias, omissions, and distortions by the media and \nextremist groups, the real story about global warming is being told \nand, judging by the success of Michael Crichton's ``State of Fear,'' \nmuch to the dismay of certain groups, it is now being told to the \nAmerican public.\n  I think one thing which we all have to understand in this body is we \nhave to recognize the fact that we have an energy crisis in America \ntoday. Right now, there are a few people around the country who are now \ncatching on that it is true. We need all forms of energy to run this \ngreat machine called America. Our forms of energy can be nuclear, they \ncan be renewable, they can be fossil fuel, coal, oil, gas, all of the \nabove. It is what we will have to have in order to be competitive.\n  Chairing the committee and being active in the upcoming energy bill, \nwe anticipate being realistic in thinking about not just ourselves \ntoday--not just my four kids or my 12 grandchildren and future \ngenerations--but you are going to have to run this most successful, \nhighly industrialized machine ever conceived in the history of the \nworld. And you can't do it sitting around closing the door on all \nopportunities that we have for energy. Certainly one is coal.\n  Certainly we need to look at this whole issue of global warming and \nwhat the real motives are of these people who are behind this.\n  I gave a speech on this floor the last session and talked about the \namount of money--I am also going to insert that for the Record--being \npaid to elect people, money that is being filtered through a lot of \nthese organizations. There is a lot of money made out there by causing \npeople to be fearful, by making people afraid, by making people feel \nthat the world is coming to an end.

If a linear trend is taken through mean \n     annual temperatures, the average change over the last 5 \n     decades is about 3.0  deg.F. However, when analyzing the \n     trends for the four seasons, it can be seen that most of the \n     change has occurred in winter and spring, with less of a \n     change in summer and even slight cooling in autumn (see Table \n     below).\n       ``Considering just a linear trend can mask some important \n     variability characteristics in the time series.

Mr. President, the world's thoughts and prayers \ncontinue to be focused on the victims of the Asian tsunami. The \ninternational community, including governments, private businesses, and \nordinary citizens, is providing financial aid and material assistance \nto affected countries in that region. President Bush and other world \nleaders deserve praise for quickly providing substantial assistance and \nresources to disaster response efforts across that region. They have \nbrought hope and relief in the midst of despair.\n  I want to recognize in particular Japan's substantial pledge to \nongoing relief efforts. As chairman of the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee, I intend to continue to work closely with the \nadministration in the days and weeks to come to assess damage and \nprovide targeted relief.\n  Let me close with an observation on Burma. Predictably, information \non the extent of damage in Burma is unknown--this is the way the \nBurmese junta operates--with the official casualty tally placed by the \nillegitimate State Peace and Development Council at 59 people. Do \ninternational donors, regional governments, or humanitarian NGOs trust \nthis figure? The simple answer, as articulated by Secretary Powell \nearlier today, is we don't. We don't trust the figure. We don't have \nany idea how many people either died or are suffering in Burma.\n  The lack of action or interest in the welfare of the people of Burma, \nby the military junta, should not be lost on all of the ASEAN members \nand their dialog partners ahead of the SPDC's chairmanship of that \norganization in 2006.\n  I thank everybody on the ground--from personnel at the State \nDepartment, USAID, and the Department of Defense to the dedicated staff \nof humanitarian organizations--for working around the clock with \nrespective governments in those hard-hit countries. Their efforts have \nnot gone unnoticed in the Senate.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great \nAmerican, Armand DeKeyser, my chief of staff for 8 years, who is going \nout into the commercial world. This is a big event for me. It is \npainful, indeed, to lose one with whom I have been so closely \nassociated for so long. I have known him and worked with him for more \nthan 25 years. We met as we served together for nearly 10 years in the \nU.S. Army Reserve in Mobile, AL, the 1184th Transportation Terminal \nUnit. We went to annual training together and became good friends. \nArmand and his wife Beverly had returned to Mobile after he completed \nhis Active-Duty service with the U.S. Army in Germany. He first, after \nhe returned, worked in the seafood business, Star Fish and Oyster \nCompany, that had been in his family for over 80 years. After another \nbusiness experience, I hired him as a law enforcement coordinator when \nI became U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama.\n  Perhaps his most important contribution there was his leadership for \nthe Weed and Seed Program that revitalized the Martin Luther King \nneighborhood in Mobile, AL. He helped get the citizens of the community \ntogether and drew up a plan for a neighborhood redevelopment program. \nThe city, the county, and the Federal Government all worked together. \nHe did a superb job.\n  It was a great success. Today that neighborhood is an entirely \ndifferent community than it was in the early 1990s. I later told him, \nwhen they put you in the ground, this is one achievement you know made \nthe world better.\n\n  In 1994, I was elected attorney general of Alabama, and the office \nwas in the midst of a funding crisis--and I mean crisis; I do not mean \na 1, 2, or 3-percent shortfall. Spending was on track to exceed the \nfunds available to the office by $5 million, and the budget was a $10 \nmillion budget.\n  I chose Armand to be our administrative officer, and his performance \nwas superb. Automobiles were sold, all of them--virtually all of them. \nOffsite offices were closed. Nonmerit system employees were let go. \nOne-third of the office, virtually all nonmerit employees, had to be \nterminated--one-third of the Office of the Attorney General. The \nworkload had to be completely reorganized as a result, and Armand's \nwork during that time was nothing short of heroic.\n  Then in 1996, I was elected to the Senate, and I asked him to serve \nas my chief of staff. What a great decision that was. He and Beverly \nagreed to come to Washington--after he and I lived together and shared \nan apartment together here for a while, a three-story walkup--to take \non the task of helping this new and inexperienced Senator get started.\n  He worked harder and longer during his 8 years than any other \nemployee on our staff. He knows people all over our State, and they \nlike and trust him. He managed so ably we were able to return to the \nU.S. Treasury each year a substantial portion of the funds given to our \noffice by the Senate.\n  Most of all, he helped me and others on our staff achieve our best. \nHe subordinated himself to serve the office with\n\n[[Page S25]]\n\nfidelity, diligence, and integrity. Chief of staff is not an easy job, \nbut his gifts and graces were a perfect fit. Whether he was encouraging \nyoung staffers, dealing with Governors, generals, administration \nofficials, or the many constituents who call on us for help, he \nperformed superbly.\n  His military service, including Active Duty and the Army Reserve, was \na very valuable asset in his service to me. In fact, the 1184th, after \nI got out of it, was activated, and he spent almost a year in Kuwait as \npart of Desert Storm. He retired after 28 years of service with the \nmilitary at the rank of lieutenant colonel.\n  The key to Armand's success and his value to our office, I believe, \nwas his deep commitment to an America where the right thing is done and \nwhere there is an efficient and lawful process for doing the people's \nwork. He never forgot that the money we spend here has been extracted \nfrom some decent American who would otherwise find good use for it. \nArmand believes we must be good stewards of that money, and that \nprograms and spending are only worthwhile if they produce a valuable \nreturn. He feels passionately about this, and our shared values in this \nregard made us a good team, I think.\n  He has been a superb public servant, and by thousands of individual \nacts of accountability, frugality, and integrity--mostly unnoticed by \nthe press or anyone else particularly--he has saved the dutiful \ntaxpayers of America tens of millions of dollars. When he came to \nWashington, I told him that because of my poor abilities, I needed to \nhave the best staff we could put together. As a result of his \nleadership, I believe we created and have maintained a magnificent \nteam, without whose help I could not have been successful.\n\n  In addition to his wife Beverly, whom I admire so much and with whom \nhe attended Murphy High School in Mobile, where my daughter attended, \nand Auburn University, he has two fine sons: Phillip, a graduate of \nGeorgia Tech and now a consulting engineer, and David, who commenced as \na student at Boston College. He is and has every right to be extremely \nproud of them.\n  He and Beverly have opened their lives and home to my staff \nthroughout the years. Serving as a ``home away from home'' for many \nAlabamians in the area and staff people, Armand's house has been the \nsite of holiday and office gatherings on numerous occasions.\n  Over the years, his ability to make the staff feel more like a family \nhas earned him the friendship and affection of many. Many of our staff, \nas well as their parents, appreciate that.\n  I and all our team truly appreciate the open-door policy he has had \nwith staff and recognize all the work he has done to keep things \nrunning smoothly in the office.\n  He has served extraordinarily well and faithfully, and it is now \nappropriate and just that Armand undertake new opportunities.\n  While I am sad to see him leave, I know he is about to embark on a \ngreat new career as executive director of the Government Relations \nGroup at Kilpatrick Stockton, LLP, one of America's finest law firms. I \nam confident he will meet the challenge of the new job with the same \nprofessionalism and dedication he has shown for the past 8 years as my \nchief of staff. His years of public service may be over for now, but \nhis commitment to the Nation and the principles on which it was founded \nwill never waiver.\n  I wish him all the best. I close with one final remark close to \nArmand's Auburn heart: War eagle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/04/senate-section/article/S25-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S25-S26]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Lance Corporal Aaron Holland\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof Aaron Holland of Columbus, NE, a lance corporal in the U.S. Marine \nCorps. Lance Corporal Holland was killed in a car accident on December \n17, 2004 near Richfield, UT, while returning home to Columbus from his \nsecond tour of duty in Iraq. He was 21 years old.\n  Lance Corporal Holland graduated from Columbus High School and is \nsurvived by his mother Becky and stepfather Paul Knopick; two \nstepbrothers, Silas and Paul Knopick; grandparents, Lois and Edmund \nMueller; and uncle, Mark Mueller; all of Columbus. Our thoughts and \nprayers are with them at this difficult time. The United States of \nAmerica is proud of Aaron Holland's service and mourns his loss.\n  The 9/11 terrorist attacks on the U.S. fostered Holland's interest in \na military career and after graduating in 2002, he enlisted in the U.S. \nMarine Corps. After completing his training, he served with the 3rd \nMarine Aircraft Wing stationed at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in \nSan Diego, CA. Holland served two tours in Iraq, from February to July \n2003 and from February to August 2004. Lance Corporal Holland will be \nremembered as a loyal marine who had a strong sense of duty, honor, and \nlove of country. Thousands of brave Americans like Lance Corporal \nHolland are currently serving in Iraq.\n  For his service, bravery and sacrifice, I ask my colleagues to join \nme and all Americans in honoring LCpl Aaron Holland.\n\n\n                  Private First Class Joshua A. Ramsey\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man who lived in \nMarion, IN as a child. PFC Joshua Ramsey, 19 years old, died on \nDecember 12 when he was shot while carrying out his duties in Iraq. \nWith his entire life before him, Joshua risked everything to fight for \nthe values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around \nthe world.\n  After attending Oak Hill Junior High School for the eighth grade, \nJoshua moved to Defiance, OH where his father and stepmother live. \nJoshua, a 2003 graduate of the Four County Career Center, left a strong \nimpression not only on his classmates but his teachers as well. One of \nhis high school teachers, Tonya Fisher, shared some memories of her \nformer student with the Marion Chronicle Tribune saying, ``He was a \ngood student and a good classmate. He worked really hard in class and \nwas really dedicated. He knew he wanted to go to the military...He's \nvery family-oriented. He struggled with leaving his family, but he \nreally believed in what he was fighting for.'' Joshua's mother, Joy, \nrecalled her son's bravery during a conversation she had with him not \nlong ago. He told her, ``Mom, I have one of the most dangerous jobs in \nthe Army, but I wouldn't have it any other way.''\n  Joshua was the 42nd Hoosier soldier to be killed while serving his \ncountry in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was assigned to the 95th \nMilitary Police Battalion, Mannheim, Germany. This brave young soldier \nleaves behind his mother, Joy; his father, Bruce; and his stepmother, \nLeAnn.\n  Today, I join Joshua's family, his friends and the entire Hoosier \ncommunity in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow \nover this loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely \nfighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and \nstrength of character that people will remember when they think of \nJoshua, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days \nof conflict and grief.\n  Joshua was known for his dedication to others and his love of family \nand country. When looking back on Joshua's life, his grandmother, \nMargaret, told the Marion Chronicle Tribune that he had loved golf, was \non the wrestling team and ran track. Today and always, Joshua will be \nremembered by family members, friends and fellow Hoosiers as a true \nAmerican hero and we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully \nserving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Joshua's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Joshua's actions will live on far longer than any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Joshua Ramsey in the official \nrecord of the United States Senate for his\n\n[[Page S26]]\n\nservice to this country and for his profound commitment to freedom, \ndemocracy and peace.

I am saddened \nby his passing and my heart goes out to his family, friends and \nconstituents.\n  Those of us who knew Bob are richer for the experience, and the \ninstitution of Congress is poorer now that he is gone.\n  Shirley Chisholm too was a woman of strong belief and character.

Her unique friendships, bi-partisan style \nand staunch advocacy for the people she represented are a lesson to us \nall.

Mr. President, as we begin a new year and a new Congress, \nmore than 1.2 million Rotarians in 166 countries are beginning the \ncentennial celebration of Rotary International.\n  On February 23, 1905, the Rotary Club of Chicago was formed by Paul \nP. Harris, an attorney who wanted to recapture the friendly spirit of \nsmall-town America in a big-city professional club. The new group took \nits name from the practice of rotating club meetings among members' \noffices.\n  Rotary quickly grew, with clubs forming across the country and around \nthe world. At the same time, the organization's interests expanded from \nsocial and professional interests to community service.\n  Along with public service, Rotary has given the world a high standard \nof ethics known as the 4-Way Test. This test asks the following four \nquestions of the things we think, say, or do:\n  1. Is it the truth?\n  2. Is it fair to all concerned?\n  3. Will it build goodwill and better friendships?\n  4. Will it be beneficial to all concerned?\n  During and after World War II, Rotary International became deeply \ninvolved in efforts to promote global peace and understanding. Rotary \nmembers actively supported the founding of the United Nations and \nhelped to establish UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, \nand Cultural Organization.\n  In recent years, Rotary International has helped communities around \nthe world to address some of the critical needs of our day, including \ndisease, hunger, illiteracy, environmental degradation, and children at \nrisk. Rotary has been the lead organization in PolioPlus, a global \neffort to immunize all the world's children against polio.\n  On the occasion of the Rotary Centennial, I send my sincere \nappreciation and best wishes to Rotary International and Rotarians \neverywhere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/04/senate-section/article/S26-3", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S26-S27]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MAD COW DISEASE\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, in today's Federal Register, the United \nStates Department of Agriculture has published a final rule that could \nhave significant adverse impacts on our domestic cattle industry. The \nregulation I am referring to designates Canada as a ``minimal risk \nregion'' for BSE, known as mad cow disease, and allows Canada to export \nmore beef and beef products to the United States.\n  I understand the desire of the administration to work with Canada, \nand I know how frustrated Canadian cattlemen are with the current \nsituation. It is the same frustration my Montana cattlemen feel, as \nthey watch Australia and New Zealand expand market share in the Pacific \nRim, while those markets remain closed off to the U.S. But this rule \nhas some significant problems, and to the extent that those flaws could \nharm domestic consumer confidence and the reopening of international \nmarkets, I'm not going to support the administration's decision to open \nthe U.S.-Canadian border to increased Canadian exports.\n  As I am sure everyone recalls, in May 2003, Canada discovered a case \nof BSE in Alberta. To protect the safety of America's food supply, USDA \nbanned all imports of Canadian beef. In December of that same year, a \nCanadian-born dairy cow in Washington State with BSE was discovered and \nso we have the cow that stole Christmas. Important export markets \naround the world closed their doors to U.S. beef, the highest quality \nbeef in the world. USDA then instituted a rapid screening pilot program \nto test random cattle samples for BSE. To date, the United States \nthankfully has never had a case of BSE in a U.S.-born cow.\n  Since BSE jumped to the forefront of the cattle industry in 2003, \nUSDA has been working with other nations, such as Japan and Korea, to \nreopen markets to U.S. beef. In October 2004, Japan agreed in principle \nto begin accepting U.S. beef and beef products from cattle under 20 \nmonths of age. While that agreement represents an important step \nforward, exports have not yet started because of scientific and \ntechnical obstacles. I remain optimistic that exports will begin this \nspring, and would be very concerned about any decisions that could \njeopardize our relationship with Japan.\n  In addition to negotiating the resumption of U.S. exports, USDA has \nalso been working with Canada to resume imports of Canadian beef. USDA \nbegan accepting Canadian boneless beef from cattle under 30 months of \nage in August 2003. In October 2003, USDA first proposed designating \nCanada as a minimal risk region, but after the December 2003 discovery \nof BSE, the rule was delayed. With the exception of a few incidents, \nthat trade has generally been uneventful, and has had little impact on \nU.S. cattle prices. Most importantly, consumer confidence in the food \nsupply remains strong.\n  But today I fear USDA has gone too far.\n  The rule published in today's Federal Register, which takes effect on \nMarch 7, will allow Canada to export to the United States live cattle \nunder 30 months of age for feeding or immediate slaughter; sheep and \ngoats under 12 months of age for feeding or immediate slaughter; meat \nfrom cattle, sheep, goats and cervids--deer, elk, caribou, moose and \nreindeer; and certain other products and byproducts, including bovine \nlivers and tongues, gelatin, and tallow. Feeder cattle must be branded \nto indicate country of origin, must have an eartag so we can trace back \nto the premises of origin, and must be slaughtered before reaching 30 \nmonths of age. The identification requirements must be preserved only \nto the point of slaughter, not carried through to the retail level. \nCattle designed for immediate slaughter must move as a group in a \nsealed container to the facility and must be slaughtered as a group.\n  As I said, this regulation has some significant problems, most \nnotably, Canada's enforcement of its feed ban and the decision to allow \nbeef and beef products from cattle slaughtered at any age. USDA needs \nto withdraw this rule now and fix these problems.\n  USDA asserts that Canada has high levels of compliance with its feed \nban, but fails to provide the hard data that supports that finding. In \nfact, USDA's\n\n[[Page S27]]\n\nown risk assessment states that in 2002, 8 percent of feed mills were \nnot in compliance with the feed ban. This indicates that feed \ncontamination is a recent issue, rather than a concern taken care of \nyears ago.\n  Even more surprisingly, the risk analysis states that the fact that \nno cases of BSE have been found in animals born after the feed ban is \nevidence that the feed ban is working. USDA claims that this rule is \nbased only on science, but that is hardly a scientific assessment. It \ncould just as likely be evidence that Canada is not testing enough \nsamples in its rapid screening process. Montana ranchers are not going \nto rest easy based on these findings.\n  On Dec. 17, the Vancouver Sun ran an article indicating that nearly \n60 percent of Canadian feed contains ``undeclared animal parts'', but \nthat the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, CFIA, decided not to use DNA \ntesting to determine if the feed is contaminated with cattle materials. \nWhile the presence of animal parts does not necessarily indicate feed \nban violations, Canada should be willing to take necessary steps to \nreassure the United States, as well as its own cattle producers, that \nthe feed is not contaminated. Failing to act represents a lack of \ncommitment to enforcing the feed ban, in contrast to the effectiveness \nthat USDA is willing to presume. Industry sources quoted in that \narticle expressed concern about conflicting messages from CFIA, yet \nUSDA seems quite willing to rely on CFIA representations for its \nscientific assessments.\n  Similarly, the decision to allow beef and beef products from cattle \nslaughtered at any age is troubling. These products are likely to \ncontain animals born before Canada's 7-year feed ban. While USDA seems \ncertain that Canada can safeguard against contaminated beef, the rule \nprovides little evidence to support that claim. In fact, USDA clearly \nadmits that beef products could contain animals that have consumed \ncontaminated feed, but brushes off the risk as ``low.'' Let me repeat--\nI am certain of the safety of the U.S. food supply. However, I remain \nconcerned that USDA has not fully evaluated the impact on consumer \nconfidence of resuming Canadian imports.\n  In its risk assessments, USDA seems most focused on preventing a BSE \nepidemic. A look at the past year shows that just one case--even the \nsuspicion of a case--can throw the cattle markets into a tailspin. One \nsingle, non-native occurrence of BSE in the United States resulted in \ndozens of export markets closing to U.S. cattle producers. The economic \nand psychological impact of BSE needs to factor into USDA's analysis. \nCattlemen need to be able to trust their markets, and consumers need to \nbe able to trust their food.\n  If exports to Japan have not resumed by March, then Montana ranchers \nwill be in the unacceptable position of having to compete domestically \nagainst Canadian beef flowing through three Montana ports without \nhaving the option of exporting our products to other markets. In fact, \ngiven concerns already expressed by key export markets about Canadian \nbeef, the decision to allow expanded Canadian imports could prevent \nthose same markets from accepting U.S. beef. I cannot accept this \noutcome.\n  I have often said that I support free trade, as long as it is fair \ntrade. Right now, the situation facing Montana cattle producers is \nanything but fair. I urge USDA to reconsider some of the provisions of \nthis regulation, to ensure that Canadian beef coming into the U.S. does \nnot adversely impact the domestic cattle industry. There must be \nindependent assessments of Canada's enforcement of its food ban. The \n30-month limitation on beef and beef products deserves another look. \nLike many folks back home, I am anxious for the Japanese market to \nreopen and do not want anything to stand in the way. We must do what's \nright for the U.S. cattle industry first.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/04/senate-section/article/S27-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S27-S28]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               OBSTRUCTION OF BIPARTISAN COPYRIGHT BILLS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in the waning days, weeks and months of the \n108th Congress, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle were working \nhard to pass important bipartisan legislation that would have protected \nAmerica's innovators and artists, made more spectrum available for \nbroadband services, enhanced 911 services, and fixed a technical glitch \nthat was threatening the Universal Service Fund. Unfortunately, others \nwere apparently working just as hard to obstruct these measures. This \nobstruction was intended only to force the Senate into passing \nlegislation that everyone knew was doomed in the House. It was a flawed \nplan that was destined to fail. And fail it did, but not before it also \nprevented enactment of critically important and bipartisan intellectual \nproperty legislation.\n  The Family Entertainment and Copyright Act will go down as a victim \nof this obstructionism. This was an uncontroversial intellectual \nproperty bill that would have protected the rights of those who lead \nthe United States' intellectual property industry. That industry makes \nthe United States the global leader in innovation, and it deserves our \nsupport. Protecting these individuals from the theft of their work \nappeared to mean little to some of my colleagues. A Republican plan to \nhijack this important legislation, which lasted until the very last \nmoment of the 108th Congress, ensured that it would not pass in time \nfor the House to take it up and pass it. They succeeded in preventing \nthe bicameral passage of the most important intellectual property \nlegislation before the Congress this year. This was wrong.\n  The Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2004 contained \nimportant and uncontroversial measures. The ART Act, a bill that passed \nthe Judiciary Committee and then the full Senate by unanimous consent, \nwould have provided new tools in the fight against bootleg copies of \nmovies snatched from the big screen by camcorders smuggled into \ntheaters. And it would have adopted a creative solution developed by \nthe Copyright Office to address the growing problem of piracy of pre-\nrelease works. The Film Preservation Act would have helped ensure that \nthe Library of Congress is able to continue its important work in \narchiving our nation's fading film heritage. Some of America's oldest \nfilms--works that document who we were as a people in the beginning of \nthe 20th Century--are literally disintegrating faster than they can be \nsaved. The Preservation of Orphan Works bill would have allowed greater \naccess to certain works in the last years of their copyright term. The \nFraudulent Online Identity Sanctions Act would have protected against \nonline trademark infringement by prohibiting the use of fraudulent \nInternet addresses to commit such infringement. Finally, FECA would \nhave clarified that services allowing home viewers of prerecorded \nmovies to skip objectionable content does not violate the copyright \nlaws. Obstructionism from certain Republicans has ensured that all of \nthese problems are left unresolved by the 108th Congress.\n  Thankfully, two provisions of this bill were able to pass as stand \nalone bills. Thanks to the hard work of Senator Biden, the House \nversion of critical anti-counterfeiting legislation passed. \nUnfortunately, additional language on which Senator Biden worked \ntirelessly was passed too late for House action. Again, the Republican \nobstruction was at work and to blame. The Cooperative Research and \nTechnology Enhancement Act also passed both houses, largely because a \nSenate version had passed earlier in the year, and the Republican \nobstructionists in the Senate could not subvert that bill.\n  There is other legislation that has fallen to this ill-conceived plan \nto hijack popular legislation. The bipartisan Junk Fax bill would have \nprotected both consumers and many industries, by placing reasonable \nlimits on senders of unsolicited faxes. That bill, too, was passed too \nlate for House action on account of the Republican roadblock.\n  Thankfully, at the last minute, another important and bipartisan \npiece of legislation was allowed through the roadblock. The \ntelecommunications package contained critically important provisions \nthat will enhance 911 service, allow spectrum reallocation, and \npreserve the ability of the Universal Service Fund to do its important \nwork. These are not controversial or partisan provisions. E911 will \nensure that first responders can provide an essential public service. \nThe spectrum reallocation trust fund will free more space for\n\n[[Page S28]]\n\nwireless broadband services. This will help the American economy by \npromoting jobs and education. The Universal Service Fund provision will \nfix an accounting glitch that if left unattended will seriously impede \nthe USF as it goes about its critical work. Again, these \nuncontroversial provisions were held up and almost failed because of \nthis obstructionism.\n  All of these bills were hijacked and sidetracked, in order to coerce \nthe passage of a bill that everyone knew would not pass the House. I am \nthankful that the telecommunications legislation was eventually able to \npass, but what does it mean that the telecommunications bill became \nlaw, while the intellectual property bill is left unfinished? It seems \nthose responsible for this obstruction do not take the needs of \nAmerica's innovative leaders very seriously. That attitude will \nundermine the American economy, and threaten America's leadership in \nthe creative industries. So, because of this Republican roadblock, \nAmerica's innovators and artists will have to struggle through more \nuncertainty, without the tools they need to defend their rights. That \nis a shame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/04/senate-section/article/S28-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S28]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              HONORING THE NORTHERN STATE MARCHING WOLVES\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I publicly congratulate the \nNorthern State University Marching Wolves on being selected to march in \nthe Presidential Inaugural Parade on January 20, 2005. Northern State \nUniversity has been an integral part of Aberdeen, SD, for the past \ncentury. The Marching Wolves were founded by Harvey Moen in 1941 and \nhave represented Northern State University well for the past six \ndecades. Today they are led by Dr. Alan LaFave, the Director of Bands \nat Northern State University, and Mr. Boyd Perkins, the Director of the \nMarching Wolves.\n  The tradition of the Inaugural Parade is as old as the office of the \nPresident; as George Washington traveled from Mount Vernon to New York \nfor his swearing in, militia members began to walk behind him, joined \nby government officials and Members of Congress once he arrived in New \nYork on April 30, 1789. In 1801 Thomas Jefferson was the first \nPresident to be Inaugurated in Washington, DC, and Members of Congress \nand citizens walked with him from the Capitol to the White House to \nmusic played by the Marine Band. The Marine Band has played in the \nInaugural Parade every year since.\n  Though this will be the first time the Marching Wolves will \nparticipate in the Inaugural Parade, they have performed previously at \nprofessional football games and regional marching band competitions. \nThe band is comprised of 125-130 students, making it one of the largest \nstudent groups at Northern State University. They rehearse daily during \nfootball season, and their members show great dedication to this \nremarkable organization. The band rehearses 5 days a week for an hour \nand a half during the fall semester. In order to prepare for the \nparade, they will be practicing an additional 3 days and 2 nights \nbefore the spring semester begins. The Marching Wolves have a great \ntradition of leadership within their band which has served them well.\n  It is an honor to be chosen to perform in the Presidential Inaugural \nParade, and I am proud to have the Northern State University Marching \nWolves representing South Dakota. It is no surprise that an \norganization with the passion and dedication of the Marching Wolves was \nchosen for this privilege. It is with great honor that I share this \nimpressive accomplishment with my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/04/senate-section/article/S28-2", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S28]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNITION OF COLORADO'S PROFESSORS OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. ALLARD.

In 2001, Dr. Wieman was honored with the Nobel Prize in \nPhysics. He gives approximately 60 talks a year on the topic of physics \nresearch and science education.\n  This recognition represents the culmination of a great deal of hard \nwork and determined effort. It acknowledges their dedication to \nteaching and commitment to students. They should be very proud of this \nhonor.\n  Now more than ever, our Nation needs the skills and talents of \ncollege professors like Robert von Dassanowsky and Carl Wieman.

Res. 4\n\n       Whereas on December 26, 2004, a tremendous earthquake, \n     registered at 9.0 on the Richter scale and centered 100 miles \n     off the coast of Northern Sumatra, Indonesia, triggered a \n     deadly tsunami that swept throughout the Indian Ocean and \n     beyond, devastating cities, towns, and communities, and \n     killing or injuring persons in Southeast Asia and South Asia, \n     through the island nations of the region, to Eastern Africa;\n       Whereas, as a result of the earthquake and ensuing tsunami, \n     more than 140,000 people have lost their lives to date, tens \n     of thousands of people are injured or missing, and the final \n     death toll could climb into the hundreds of thousands;\n       Whereas the victims also include thousands of nationals who \n     were visiting the region when the tsunami hit, including \n     significant numbers from Europe and North and South America;\n       Whereas millions of people throughout Southeast Asia and \n     South Asia have been left without food, shelter, or clean \n     water, and now face deadly diseases such as cholera, dengue \n     fever, dysentery, malaria, and typhoid;\n       Whereas thousands of children have been killed or injured \n     by this disaster;\n       Whereas, as a result of this tragedy, thousands of children \n     have been separated from their families or orphaned and are \n     in need of re-unification or adoption;\n       Whereas whole coastal communities and cities throughout the \n     region were obliterated;\n       Whereas recovery, reconstruction, and clean-up of the \n     devastated areas likely will take years, billions of dollars, \n     and the concerted leadership of the United States working \n     together with the international community;\n       Whereas the people of the United States immediately \n     responded and expressed their sympathy and concern by sending \n     financial aid and other assistance currently totaling more \n     than $100,000,000, through nongovernmental organizations and \n     other means, to the victims of this disaster, and by offering \n     to volunteer in the disaster rescue, recovery, and \n     rebuilding;\n       Whereas soon after the earthquake and tsunami hit the \n     region, the United States Government expressed its \n     condolences and invoked six disaster declarations for the \n     nations hardest hit by this natural disaster, thus triggering \n     the release of emergency funding to these countries;\n       Whereas less than 24 hours after these tragedies became \n     known, the United States announced an initial pledge of \n     $15,000,000 for emergency humanitarian assistance, which was \n     increased to $35,000,000 in the following days as the scope \n     of the tragedy unfolded;\n       Whereas President George W. Bush also dispatched more than \n     20 United States military cargo and patrol aircraft, \n     redirected a Marine expeditionary unit and a carrier task \n     force, and deployed several hundred United States military \n     personnel to the region to assist with the disaster response, \n     recovery, and delivery of relief supplies;\n       Whereas, in response to an early appeal by the \n     International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent \n     for $7,500,000, the United States provided $4,000,000 for the \n     distribution of emergency shelter materials and other relief \n     commodities, and provided more than 3,000 metric tons of rice \n     to the United Nations World Food Program for use in the \n     affected region;\n       Whereas President George W. Bush has established a regional \n     core group with Australia, Canada, India, Japan, and the \n     Netherlands, with the United Nations, to help coordinate \n     relief efforts, and sent a senior delegation of experts, led \n     by Secretary of State Colin Powell and Florida Governor Jeb \n     Bush, to meet with regional leaders and international \n     organizations to assess what additional aid can be provided \n     by the United States;\n       Whereas on December 31, 2004, President Bush increased the \n     United States pledge to $350,000,000 in aid and stated that \n     the United States' contributions to disaster relief and \n     recovery ``will continue to be revised as the\n\n[[Page S30]]\n\n     full effects of this terrible tragedy become clearer'';\n       Whereas pledges of assistance from all international \n     organizations, multilateral development banks, and \n     governments, including the United States, now exceed \n     $2,000,000,000; and\n       Whereas, on January 3, 2005, the President appointed former \n     Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton to lead a \n     nationwide charitable fund-raising effort to elicit greater \n     relief and assistance to the victims of the powerful \n     earthquake and devastating tsunami: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its heartfelt sympathy for the victims of the \n     powerful earthquake and devastating tsunami that struck \n     cities, towns, and communities throughout Southeast Asia, \n     South Asia, Eastern Africa, and the region on December 26, \n     2004;\n       (2) conveys its most sincere condolences to the families, \n     communities, and governments of the more than 140,000 people \n     that lost their lives in this terrible natural disaster;\n       (3) expresses its gratitude and respect for the courageous \n     and committed work of all aid and relief personnel, including \n     United States military personnel, who are saving lives and \n     providing relief assistance in the devastated areas of the \n     region;\n       (4) supports President George W. Bush's pledge of \n     $350,000,000 in direct financial assistance, and tens of \n     millions of dollars in additional indirect assistance through \n     the dispatch of United States military aircraft, naval \n     vessels, and personnel, and through the United States \n     Government's substantial voluntary and annual contributions \n     to international organizations and bodies;\n       (5) commends the ongoing international relief effort that \n     includes the work of individual countries, numerous \n     international organizations, and various relief and other \n     nongovernmental entities;\n       (6) reaffirms that the United States Government is \n     committed to providing relief and assistance in the most \n     effective and efficient means possible, and will continue to \n     assess, anticipate, and provide further assistance as needed \n     in the weeks and months ahead;\n       (7) recognizes that the support of the United States \n     Government will be greatly supplemented by private donations \n     and assistance from thousands of United States citizens, \n     charitable organizations, religious groups, and corporations \n     that routinely provide generous and significant amounts of \n     aid, support, and volunteers; and\n       (8) fully supports the long-term commitment and engagement \n     of the United States to provide financial aid and other forms \n     of direct and indirect assistance to the countries and \n     peoples of the region impacted by the powerful earthquake and \n     the devastating tsunami.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 1--TO PROVIDE FOR THE COUNTING ON JANUARY \n6, 2005, OF THE ELECTORAL VOTES FOR PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE \n                             UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Lott) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                             S.

Mr. President, on Thursday morning the Senate will be in \nmorning business, and at 12:50 p.m. the Senate will proceed as a body \nto the House of Representatives for a joint session for the counting of \nelectoral votes. Members should gather in the Senate Chamber at 12:40 \nso that we may leave promptly at 12:50.\n  During Thursday's session, we expect to act on the committee \nresolution.\n  Members are wondering about rollcall votes for the week. At this \npoint, it is unclear, but we will notify all Members if a rollcall vote \nis possible before we finish our business this week.\n  Following close of business on Thursday, the Senate will adjourn \nuntil January 20.\n  I inform my colleagues that when the Senate reconvenes January 20, we \nwill immediately begin work on the President's nominations.\n  I will simply close by saying that we have had a remarkable day \ntoday. Six hours ago we began the swearing in of 34 Senators. It is \nalways a moving time to have family, friends, spouses, and constituents \nfrom so many different States coming to Washington, DC, to share in an \noccasion that we all remember--indelibly printed on our minds--when we \nput our right hand in the air and took that oath to this body and to \nthat Constitution. It has been a remarkable day for people. It has been \na great pleasure for us in leadership to be able to participate really \non the periphery as we celebrate with each and every one of them for \ntheir great public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/04/senate-section/article/S34-2", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S34]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ADJOURNMENT UNTIL THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 2005, AT 9:30 A.M.\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
