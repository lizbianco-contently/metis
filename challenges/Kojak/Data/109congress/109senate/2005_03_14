Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to consideration of S. Con. Res. 18, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 18) setting forth the \n     congressional budget for the United States Government for the \n     fiscal year 2006 and including the appropriate budgetary \n     levels for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 through 2010.\n\n\n                   recognition of the majority leader\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this morning we will immediately begin \nconsideration of the budget resolution which was reported from the \nBudget Committee last week. There are now 45 hours remaining of the \nstatutory 50-hour limit. The chairman and ranking member are ready for \nopening statements, and then it is our expectation to begin the \namendment process.\n  As we announced last week, we do anticipate a vote around 5:30 p.m. \ntoday in relation to an amendment. Once we get underway, we will alert \nSenators as to what amendment will be voted on this afternoon.\n  I also want to reiterate that this will be a busy week of Senate \nbusiness. We will complete the budget resolution this week. We will \nobviously have lengthy sessions over the course of each day and likely \nwell into the evening. I will be working with the Democratic leader to \nsee if we can keep a steady pace throughout the week so that we can \navoid what has come to be known as the vote-arama, if at all possible. \nI know the managers of the bill will be doing everything possible to \ncontinue to have this bill move in an orderly, systematic way. This \nwill require the cooperation of all Senators, and we have asked all to \nkeep their schedules flexible around the floor schedule.\n  We will need to keep the length of each rollcall vote to a reasonable \nlimit. We again request Members to come as soon as possible to vote \nwhen votes are called. If not, we will have to cut off the time with \nwhich we have flexibly in the past allowed our colleagues to meander \nover. We have to keep the bill moving expeditiously.\n  I thank everybody in advance for what I know will be a busy week, and \nI look forward to completing our work prior to the start of the Easter \nbreak.\n  I particularly thank Judd Gregg and Senator Conrad for their hard \nwork and leadership. They have worked very hard over the course of the \nlast several weeks completing the work of the budget at the committee \nlevel at the end of last week. As I said earlier, we will complete \naction on the bill before we adjourn for the March recess.\n  The budget is a tough budget. It is an austere budget. It is a \ndisciplined budget. That is what is appropriate at this point in time. \nIt restrains spending. It cuts the deficit in half over 5 years. It \nextends the progrowth tax relief that has continued to fuel the \neconomy. Some will say that it goes too far in terms of restrained \nspending; others will say it does not go far enough.\n  Budgets are never easy. This one is no different, but it is \nabsolutely essential that we complete the budget this week. It provides \nthe blueprint for just about everything else that occurs over the \nremainder of this session, most importantly the appropriations bills.\n  We have had good discussion among the leadership about focusing \namendments and making sure that amendments that are brought to the \nfloor are done so in an orderly way but also that the amendments that \nare brought to the floor are, indeed, substantive amendments. We don't \nwant dozens and dozens of amendments to be brought to the floor because \ntypically all these amendments can be overlapping and repetitive of \nearlier amendments. It is that sort of disorganization and chaos we \nwant to get rid of and focus on the important amendments, debate them \nunder the time agreements we have.\n  I was just talking to the Democratic manager, and that orderly \nprocess that the two managers are talking about is one that would give \nsome certainty as to when amendments would come to\n\n[[Page S2588]]\n\nthe floor. That is going to take planning right now and not having \namendments come flowing in at the very end. I do believe that if we \nwork together and keep our focus, we will take potentially a chaotic \nprocess and give it clear definition and clear order.\n  We will have a lively and spirited debate. Such debate was manifested \nin the committee last week, and it will continue on the Senate floor \nwith the broader participation of all of our colleagues over the next 4 \ndays. I look forward to delivering a blueprint that reflects our \ncommitment to fiscal responsibility, to economic growth, and a bill \nthat does keep America moving forward.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the staff of the Senate \nBudget Committee on the list I send to the desk be permitted to remain \non the Senate floor during consideration of S. Con. Res. 18 and the \nconference report thereon and that the list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Senate Budget Committee Floor Privileges List, 109th Congress\n\n       Amdur, Rochelle; Bailey, Stephen; Bargo, Kevin; Brandt, \n     Dan; Cheung, Rock E.; Dempsey, Don; Duckworth, Cara; Esquea, \n     Jim; Eyster, Sarah; Fisher, David; Friesen, Katherine; Green, \n     Vanessa; Gudes, Scott B.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today we begin discussion of the Federal \nbudget, which is, of course, one of the primary functions we are \nsupposed to do as a governing body in the Senate and the House. \nInterestingly enough, under the rules of the Congress, something which \nI don't think most people recognize, the President has no official role \nin the budget. It is a document which is produced by the Senate and the \nHouse. It is called a resolution. The President doesn't sign it. The \nPresident sends up his budget, but his budget is not officially part of \nthe process in the sense that he signs the final document. In a unique \nway, the Budget Act puts on the Congress the responsibility of doing a \nbudget.\n  Now, the President has sent up a budget. Of course, he is the leader \nof our party and of the country. As such, we have given it very \nsignificant credibility and have actually tracked it quite closely in \nthe budget which was produced by the Budget Committee.\n  Before we begin the specifics of the discussion on the budget, I want \nto thank the members of the Budget Committee for pursuing a very \nefficient and professional markup last Thursday. I especially thank \nmembers on my side, who were there for all of the votes. It is the only \ncommittee in the Senate that requires that you actually be there and \nphysically vote versus using a proxy. They participated aggressively in \nthe debate. I also thank the ranking member, Senator Conrad, and the \nmembers of his party for expediting the process. They had a lot of \namendments they wanted to put forward. They put them forward in an \nextraordinarily professional and effective way. As a result, we were \nable to move through the process and debate issues which are critical \nto the Nation.\n  A lot of issues are raised by the budget because it touches \neverything. There are two basic issues which I think our budget \nattempts to address. The first, of course, is how you control spending, \nhow you make sure that you do the most with the dollars you have, but \nthat you don't demand of the American people more dollars than they can \nafford to pay through taxes, and that you not end up passing on to your \nchildren and your children's children significant deficits, that you \nnot borrow excessively in order to fund the Government. The short-term \nissue which that involves is the fact that we have, for the last few \nyears, been running very significant deficits. Those deficits are, in \nmy opinion, a function of two basic events.\n  The first is that in the late 1990s, we saw the largest economic \nbubble in the history of the world. A bubble is an inflation of the \nmarket, a perversion, really, of the market and a period where you \nessentially find that the economics of the times, specifically the \nability to issue stock through IPOs, through creation of corporations, \nis creating artificial value, that the stock is not supported by real \nvalue. It is actually a form of printing money, for all intents and \npurposes.\n  In the history of the world there have been a lot of these bubbles. \nThe two most significant ones were the tulip bubble in Holland and the \nSouth Seas bubble involving the English investment in South Seas \ncompanies. As a percentage of the economy in the world at that time, \nthey were huge bubbles and they led to significant economic disruption \nand negative events.\n\n  They were nothing compared to the Internet bubble. When the Internet \nbubble burst, as all bubbles do--especially economic bubbles--there was \na significant downturn in the economy, and a huge recessionary event \nwas generated. Explosion of that bubble was also followed by, \nobviously, the attacks of 9/11. They had a massive impact on us. \nObviously, we lost many lives and it changed the whole culture of our \ncountry. But the economic impact was also dramatic. The economy slowed \ndramatically as a result of the attack. We had to reorient the Federal \nGovernment activity and we had to significantly, dramatically ramp up \nour commitment to national defense, homeland defense, make massive \ncapital expenditures that we had not anticipated making in the area of \nhomeland defense. Not only did the economy slow, which means revenues \nslowed, but spending had to go up dramatically as a result of that.\n  The effect of that was we headed toward a recession, went into a \nrecession, and revenues of the Federal Government dropped precipitously \nand spending went up to fight the war on terrorism.\n  Some would argue that the deficits were also a function of President \nBush's decision to reduce taxes during this period. I argue the \nopposite. I would say that the decision to reduce taxes, especially \ntaxes on people's income, was one of the best economic decisions of the \nperiod, because it meant more money was left with consumers and, as a \nresult, the economy had more money in it and, as a result, people were \nable to spend more money and, as a result, the recession was shallowed \nout. There would have been a much more severe, dramatic, and damaging \nrecession had those tax cuts not gone into place. We are seeing now, as \na result of those tax cuts, their benefit, which is that the economy is \ncoming back in an extremely strong way and\n\n[[Page S2589]]\n\nrevenues are starting to grow with equal strength. Last year, they grew \nat 9.5 percent. This year, they will grow by about 7 percent. For the \nforeseeable future, Federal revenues are going to grow over 6 percent, \nwhich is a function of the fact that we have changed the way taxes are \ncollected in this country, so we are incentivizing people to go out and \nbe productive and spend money to create jobs and, as a result, we are \nseeing more economic activity and we are seeing more revenues come in \nbecause there are more taxes being collected from the economic \nactivity.\n  Two of the most successful tax cuts during this period were, in my \nopinion, the dividend rate cut and the capital gains cut, both of which \nled specifically to dramatic increases in Federal revenue. The capital \ngains rates have seen huge jumps in revenues at the Federal level, \nwhich are a function of the fact that people who had been sitting on \neconomic growth and assets, capital gains, had just been sitting there. \nThey didn't want to pay the tax, so they were sitting on the assets. \nWith the capital gains cut, people said I can now sell this asset and \nreinvest. That has two very positive economic effects.\n  The first is it means more revenues for the Federal Treasury. Those \ngains would not have occurred without that rate cut because there would \nhave been no sale and no taxable event.\n  Second is that the money generated from those sales is being \nreinvested more efficiently in the economy because people are taking \ncash and reinvesting it in a way that it will earn more money. \nTherefore, you are creating more jobs as a result of putting more \ncapital more efficiently back into the marketplace.\n\n  The same could be said for the dividend cut. For years, corporations \nin America had basically piled up dividends, piled up resources, and \nnot paid them out to their stockholders because it was a double tax. \nFirst, they are taxed on profits at the corporate level at 32, 35 \npercent; and then when we pay out the profits out, the individual \ntaxpayer who happens to be an owner of the company, most of whom are \nworking Americans and have that ownership through their pension plan--\ntruck drivers, restaurant people, people who work in manufacturing \nfacilities--then pay another tax because they are hit with the tax as \nthe money is paid out in the form of tax on dividend income--double \ntaxation, rates from 50 to 70 percent as a result of double taxation. \nSo we cut the dividend rate. The practical effect of that was to say to \ncorporate America, you can now pay your stockholders, most of whom are \nworking Americans, who have a 401(k) or a pension plan--you can pay the \nAmericans who have invested in America through the stock market a \ndividend and you are not going to have to pay a punitive double tax \nevent. You are going to still pay double tax, but it will not be as \npunitive as before.\n  The effect of that was major corporations did pay dividends. \nMicrosoft alone, I think, paid out a $32 billion one-time dividend--a \nmassive dividend payout. The effect of that was to, I think in and of \nitself, create a 1-percent growth in the economy of the U.S.--or the \nnet worth of America, I think is the term that should be used--but a \nhuge benefit that was to Americans across the board who invested in \nMicrosoft. Millions of Americans working in technology jobs and in \nrestaurants and working in the military, who had stock through their \n401(k) or through various other investments, suddenly got this payment \nwhich managed to increase significantly their personal wealth and which \nthey could then use to reinvest, which they have, or which they could \nuse to consume, which they have, and as a result the economy is growing \nfaster than at any time since the mid-1990s. It grew 4.4 percent in the \nlast quarter. We have the lowest unemployment in years. All of this is \na function of having made the right decisions at the right time on the \nissue of cutting taxes.\n  That brings me back to the deficit. Now, the one cloud on our \nhorizon--there are actually two, and they are both tied to the fact \nthat the Federal Government is spending more than it is taking in in \nthe short term and long term. In the short term, that deficit is large. \nBy historical terms, it is not the largest we have had, but it is a \nlarge deficit. It is one that must be reduced in the short term. In the \nlong term, we have a much more significant problem. We know there are \nalready on the books Federal programs, specifically in the area of \nretirement, that are going to radically expand the cost of Government \nin the next generation. Those programs, which are Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid, are targeted on benefiting retired people.\n  We have in this country today a demographic specific that cannot be \ndenied. That is this: There are a lot more people headed toward \nretirement than has ever occurred in the history of America. The baby \nboom generation, the largest generation in America's history, is now \nheaded toward retirement. They will begin to retire in 4 years. When \nthat generation begins to retire, it is going to overwhelm the \nretirement system. This generation is so large that it has overwhelmed \nevery system it has ever hit. In the early 1950s, it overwhelmed the \ncountry to make baby carts and cribs. In the late 1950s, it overwhelmed \neducation through elementary schools having to be built. In the 1960s, \nit changed the culture by moving forward in civil rights and women's \nrights, and the war in Vietnam became a major issue. As we moved into \nthe 1970s and 1980s and 1990s, it has been the most productive \ngeneration in American history and, as a result, has caused America to \njump ahead in the area of personal wealth and economic opportunity.\n\n  Now this generation heads for retirement and it is going to take on a \nretirement system--Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security--which was \nnever structured to deal with this size of a generation. All of these \nmajor retirement systems were designed with the concepts of the 1940s \nand 1950s. The Franklin Roosevelt approach, the genius of Roosevelt in \nthe area of retirement systems, was that he and other people understood \nyou could support a pretty decent retirement system as long as you had \na lot more people working than retired. Back then, there were 16 people \nworking for every person who was retired. Those 16 people would pay a \nlittle bit of their income to make sure the person who is retired had a \ndecent lifestyle. That was the right approach. Today, we have 3\\1/2\\ \npeople working for every one person who is retired. The result is that \nwe can still support the system. But by the late 2020 period--or the \nmid-2020 period, when the baby boom generation is fully retired, we go \nfrom a pyramid to a rectangle, where there will be two people retired \nfor every person working. The practical effect of that is those two \npeople working for every one person retired are going to have to bear a \nmassive increase in taxes in order to support that one person who is \nretired.\n  It is a simple fact of statistics. If you had 16 people supporting 1 \nretired person--16 people working for 1 retired--and you go down to 2 \npeople working for every 1 retired, it is obvious those 2 people are \ngoing to have to bear a much higher burden than the 16. And we have at \nthe same time significantly increased the benefit structure for retired \npeople.\n  The practical effect of this is, the young people here as pages are \ngoing to go out and get jobs--and I am sure they are all going to get \njobs and be well employed Americans--they are going to find their \npayroll taxes to support my generation will have to double--double. \nTheir quality of life, therefore, will be radically reduced because \nthey will not have the extra spending power to send their kids to \ncollege. They will not have the extra spending power to buy a nicer \nhouse. They will not have the extra spending power to have a good life \nof maybe taking a vacation. They will have to give up all that to pay \ntaxes to support my generation in its retirement.\n  In fact, there is today on the books, according to the Comptroller \nGeneral of the United States, Mr. Walker, $44 trillion--that is \ntrillion dollars; it is hard to conceive what a trillion dollars is \nbut, believe me, it is a lot of money--$44 trillion of unfunded \nliability which the next generation has already been told they are \ngoing to have to pay because our generation has already put the laws in \nplace to require it. And of that $44 trillion, $26 trillion, over half \nof it, about 60 percent of it is directly tied to health care costs--\nMedicare and Medicaid. They are huge numbers, massive numbers.\n  To put in context, the entire net worth of America, if we took \neverything America owns today, is only $47\n\n[[Page S2590]]\n\ntrillion, and yet we have $44 trillion of debt on the books.\n  Put it in another context, if you take all the taxes paid in American \nhistory since George Washington crossed the Potomac, came over here and \nstarted this Capitol, $43 trillion, and yet we have a $44 trillion debt \non the books and almost the vast majority of it is health care debt \nrequired to pay for senior retirement. These are huge numbers we are \nplacing on our children.\n  To put it in another context, today the Federal Government consumes \nabout 20 percent of the gross national product of the United States, \nall the Federal Government--that is national defense, that is \neducation, that is environmental protection, that is Social Security, \nit is health care, everything, put it all together and historically it \nhas been about 20 percent of the gross national product. By the year \n2025, if you just take Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--those \nthree programs alone--they will absorb over 20 percent of the gross \nnational product and will be going up.\n  It will mean we are going to put the Federal Government in a historic \nposition: we cannot spend any money on national defense; we cannot \nspend any money on education; we cannot spend any money on \nenvironmental protection, roads, or anything else because it will all \nhave to be spent on this retired class.\n  What is the point of all this? The point is this: The short-term \ndeficit is a problem, and we have to address it. But the long-term \nthreat to our economy created by these entitlement programs, known as \nSocial Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, is even more dramatic, and we \nneed to do something about it.\n\n  We have an obligation to do something about it. That is our job as \npeople who have been sent here by our States to look at an issue which \nwe know is coming at us, an issue of public policy of such \nsignificance, and try to reduce its impact, try to make it a more \npositive event, try to make it an affordable event for our children and \nour children's children.\n  So the President's budget which was sent up has attempted to address \nboth these issues. He has first attempted to address the short-term \ndeficit and, second, to address this outyear problem of the entitlement \nspending. He has also, outside the budget, taken on one of the major \nentitlement issues, which is Social Security--how to make that system \nsolvent so that it gives decent benefits to those who are retired, but \nalso affordable so that young people, when they pay into the system, \nwhich they have to, will get something back on their investment.\n  You have to give him credit. He stepped into dangerous political \nwaters, but it is appropriate that we address the Social Security \nissue, and I congratulate him for that. But the budget is not about \nSocial Security because the law does not allow the budget to address \nSocial Security. The budget is about the other elements of Federal \nspending.\n  The Federal budget, as brought forward today, tracks fairly closely \nthe President's proposals. It does not reconcile taxes as much as the \nPresident asks or might have wanted, and it does not reduce the rate of \ngrowth of entitlements as much as he may have wanted, but generally it \ntracks the proposals the President has put forward.\n  In the short term, the budget that has been brought forward will \nreduce the deficit by half. That is over the next 5 years. In the long \nterm, this budget begins to address one of the three key elements of \nthe question of how we try to make the retirement benefits for my \ngeneration more affordable to our children, specifically in the area of \nMedicaid.\n  Let me go back and go through a few specifics, and then I will turn \nthe rostrum over to the Senator from North Dakota who has been generous \nto sit through all of this.\n  On the spending side, to try to get the deficit under control, what \nthis budget does is essentially sets a top number. The Budget Committee \ndoes not have the authority to develop programs. We are specifically \nexcluded from that authority. We can make suggestions, but both the \nAppropriations Committees and authorizing committees that are separate \nfrom us ignore our suggestions almost as a matter of course. The only \nplace they cannot ignore us is the upper line number. So we have set \nwhat is known as a hard number at the top.\n  On the discretionary side, discretionary spending making up about 30 \npercent of Federal spending, about half of which is defense spending, \nwe have set the top number at $843 billion. This number represents \nabout a 4.5-percent increase in defense spending, and it represents \nbasically a hard freeze on nondefense spending.\n  The defense number may seem large, but actually it is significantly \nless than what the Defense Department originally planned as part of \ntheir spending program. Their ox has been gored, and if you do not \nbelieve that, all you have to do is walk outside this room and you will \nrun into six or seven defense lobbyists who say they need more money \nfor more programs to deal with the Defense Department.\n\n  On the nondefense discretionary side, it is obviously a hard number, \na firm number where we are freezing. We raise that number a little bit \nin the next 2 years but not much. It is more than what the President \nasked for, but not a great deal. We cap these numbers with something \ncalled a budgetary cap, and that is the key. We essentially say that \nany Member of this Congress--this Senate anyway--who believes that a \ncommittee exceeded the allocation which it will get in the area of \ndiscretionary spending--is spending more, in other words, than this top \nline number as it is distributed amongst committees--that any Member \nwho believes that has happened may come to the floor of the Senate, \nobject to that spending, and get a vote of 60. A supermajority must be \nvoted in order to go forward with that spending. It is a pretty strong \nbudgetary tool for enforcement, and that is in this budget. So we have \nput in place stringent discretionary controls.\n  On the entitlement side, we cannot control entitlements with anything \nother than changes in entitlements. There is this philosophy of \nsomething called pay-go. It has no impact on entitlements unless we \ncreate new entitlements. The existing entitlements are the problem. \nThey represent about 57 percent of Federal spending, and nothing can \ncontrol that. They can grow as much as they want, and there is no \nbudgetary way to affect them unless we go back to those entitlements \nand say to the committees that have jurisdiction over those \nentitlements: Take another look; see if there is some way we can save \nsome money. And that is what we have done here.\n  It is not as much as the President asked. He asked we do $62 billion \nin net number. We have done about $32 billion of entitlement control. \nIt is called reconciliation.\n  Essentially, the key elements of this reconciliation bill involve the \nPBGC, which is a Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which needs to \nbe reformed. It is a huge outyear liability for us as a nation. It is \nmassive because so many of these companies that have gotten into \ntrouble have pension funds which are underfunded. This bill tries to \nbegin the process of reforming them, and that is a major positive \npublic policy step of this legislation, not mentioned much by anybody, \nbut it is a big one.\n  Second is Medicaid reform. This needs to be put in context because \nthere are a lot of people running around here today who are saying: We \ncannot cut Medicaid; we cannot cut Medicaid. To begin with, we are not \ncutting anything in the entitlement accounts. That is the nature of the \nbeast. Medicaid spending in the next 5 years will be approximately \n$1.12 trillion without any action. With this action, Medicaid spending \nwill be about $1.11 trillion, a little bit more. We are suggesting a \n14-percent reduction in the rate of growth of Medicaid spending over \nthe next 5 years off a $1.1 trillion base, which means we are \nsuggesting about a 1-percent reduction in the rate of growth of \nMedicaid.\n  Medicaid at that period will grow at about 39 percent instead of 41 \npercent. So we will still have a 39-percent rate of growth in Medicaid \ninstead of 41 percent. Remember, large functions of Medicaid today need \nreform and that reform will not impact the quality of care given to \npeople.\n  A significant amount of dollars in Medicaid today is used for general \nfunds for operations of States. We have\n\n[[Page S2591]]\n\nserious problems with the way pharmaceuticals are distributed under \nMedicaid. We have serious problems with the way insurance is handled \nunder Medicaid. There is a whole series of items where we can save \nmoney in Medicaid, and this is a minuscule amount of restraint in \ngrowth that we are proposing, and will not impact at all--in fact, \nprobably will improve--the delivery of service by giving Governors more \nflexibility to do more creative things.\n\n  That is our plan: to work with the Governors, to reach an agreement, \ntake that agreement to the Finance Committee, and have a concept put \nforward where the Governors are comfortable--many of the Governors are \ncomfortable--with a change which will give them significantly more \nflexibility with a little less rate of growth in the dollars.\n  It is a very doable event. The idea that it is not doable, the idea \nthat anybody would stand up here and say we cannot cut Medicaid's rate \nof growth by $14 billion off a $1.12 trillion base implies to me that \nindividual does not have any interest in our children or our children's \nchildren's future because if we do not get a handle on the health care \naccounts in this country--and this is just a minuscule attempt to do \nthat--we are essentially passing on to our children a no-win situation \nwhere they will never be able--never be able--to pay the cost of the \nretired population because we are going to grow so much and there are \ngoing to be so many of us.\n  If you deny this change, you are basically denying that you are \nwilling to take on your responsibility to govern, and you are going to \nkick that can down the road and at some point simply not going to be \nable to kick it any further. It is simply going to be a bill passed on \nto our kids.\n  This is not a big change. In fact, it is a marginal change at best. \nTo describe it as ``marginal'' is probably even an exaggeration. But it \nhas certainly engendered enough run-and-hide policies around here so \none would think it was big.\n  That is the entitlement side: $32 billion of reconciliation \ninstructions over the next 5 years on a base of something like--I have \nforgotten what the base is--$8 trillion, something like that. I have \nlost count of what the base is, making that $32 billion adjustment on, \nbut it is huge.\n  The last item of this budget, of course, is tax reconciliation. That \nis a point of legitimate contest between two parties. One party likes \nto raise taxes, and one party thinks people ought to keep their money \nand spend it themselves. The simple point is, we do not believe we \nshould raise the taxes that have already been put in place at certain \nrates. For example, we believe we should extend the R tax credit, the \ntuition tax credit, the dividend rate, the capital gains rate, and the \nsmall business tax expense. And that is what this package of \nreconciliation numbers involves, extending all of those.\n  There is an irony to the Congress. The irony is this: Spending \nprograms never die. They never die. They go on and on. This alleged \npay-go concept does not have any impact at all on them. If it is on the \nbooks, it keeps going. But if there is tax rate or a tax proposal that \nhas been put in place, they do lapse. They have to be reauthorized. So \nit suddenly becomes inappropriate to do that. It is called fiscally \nresponsible to have to pay for that, and yet there is no attempt to pay \nfor the extension of the entitlement programs, no attempt to justify \nthose at all. Inconsistency, ironic, and, to say the least, it takes \nthe attitude that the people's money is not their own, that the \npeople's money is Washington's. It is our money, you should not have it \nanyway. Let us have it and we will spend it for you. That is basically \nthe philosophy behind this approach to governance.\n\n  Well, it is not my philosophy. I believe we should maintain a low tax \nburden on people, or as low as we can afford. Let us remember that the \ntax revenues are going up dramatically all through this: 9\\1/2\\ percent \nlast year, 7 percent this year, 6\\1/2\\ percent next year. The tax \nrevenues are going up. The traditional level of taxes in this country \nhas been about 17.9 percent of gross national product. We are going to \nhit that number before this 5 years is over.\n  Sure, we are starting at a low base, but we are starting at a low \nbase because we went through a recession and an attack on 9/11. Now we \nare headed back up and revenues are headed up because people are \nproductive and they are taking the risk necessary to create jobs \nbecause they know their return will be higher as a result of the tax \nrates being reasonable.\n  So this concept that we should not be reconciling any taxes is a \nphilosophical difference. That is all there is.\n  So that is the budget we have prepared, what we brought forward. It \nis a budget which reduces the deficit over the next 5 years, puts in \nplace stringent enforcement on the discretionary side, addresses the \nentitlement side through minor reconciliation efforts, addresses the \ntaxes which may expire in this window.\n  I would note as an aside that the big fight on taxes occurred last \nyear, and the big fight on taxes is going to occur next year because \nlast year we had some major taxes expire, specifically the marriage tax \npenalty and the child credit. Next year, the window of the budget will \npull in the rate reduction, which will expire, and the death tax, which \nwill go back up if we do not do something.\n  Next year we will have a big tax fight, I am sure, but this year is a \nlull period. Every tax that is being considered under reconciliation is \na tax proposal that has a fair amount of support, whether it is the R \ntax credit, the dividend, the capital gains. These are not the biggies. \nThese are good policy items that should be extended. The tax fight is a \nlot more smoke than fire in this budget, but it has taken on a \npersonality of its own, and so I presume we will pursue it again.\n  In any event, as I mentioned, the budget controls discretionary \nspending with a hard cap. It tries to address the entitlement accounts \ngrowth but most specifically addresses the one health care account we \nare able to address, which is Medicaid--Medicare being off the table \nfor this year as a result of passage of the drug bill last year--and \naddresses tax reconciliation. There are three elements to it.\n  If it is passed, it will lead to the first budget since 1996 which \nfires with real bullets on the issue of controlling spending at the \nFederal level, and that is the most important point I want to end on.\n  This is a real budget in the area of pushing forward some fiscal \nresponsibility by having reconciliation instruction on the entitlement \naccounts.\n  The discretionary caps are also essential. They have lapsed because \nwe did not have a budget last year, and if we are going to get control \nover discretionary spending, we need them. So for the first in a long \ntime we have a budget that is serious about disciplining spending. I \npresume there are going to be a lot of amendments brought forward on \nthis floor to try to get around it because people do not like to \naddress the spending side of the ledger. They would rather spend money. \nIt is much easier.\n  The people who get the money are the most active in saying the money \nhas to be spent. The people who support spending restraint tend to be \nless vocal. It is human nature to want to accommodate the people who \ncome to our offices and say, I have to have this money for this program \nor this money for that program. So spending tends to go up, never goes \ndown.\n  This budget attempts to at least restrain it so it is affordable, and \nthat is what is critical--putting forward a budget which is legitimate \nand which attempts to restrain spending so we can begin the process of \npassing on to our children a fiscally healthy nation.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his courtesy in putting up \nwith this long talk, and I thank the President pro tempore for his \ncourtesy in sitting through it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from North Dakota \nis recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank my \ncolleague, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, for the many \ncourtesies he extended to me and to my staff during consideration of \nthe budget in the Budget Committee. He described it accurately and \nwell, that it was a very professional process and we had a good\n\n[[Page S2592]]\n\ndebate on a whole series of issues. Many of those debates will now be \nout on the Senate floor.\n  I do not think it will surprise people that my take on this budget is \nsomewhat different than the distinguished chairman's take on it. That \nis what debate is all about. That is what democracy is all about, the \nchance to have differences and to debate them and to vote on them. That \nis the genius of our system. The way we arrive at truth, to the extent \nwe do in this system, is we have a debate and a discussion, and we have \na contest over ideas. That is a healthy thing. It is a good thing. That \nis what we are about to go through.\n  As I look at this budget, I see something quite different than the \nchairman sees. I see a failure to face up to the major challenges \nconfronting the country. I agree with him in terms of his diagnosis of \nwhere this is headed with respect to deficits, debt, and the explosion \nof the costs of the entitlement programs. I agree with that diagnosis. \nWhere I disagree is that this budget does anything in any significant \nway to confront those challenges.\n  In fact, this budget makes it all worse. That is the fundamental \nreality. This budget digs a hole deeper. This budget produces more \ndeficits than if we did not have a budget resolution at all. If we put \nit on autopilot, we would be better off than what this budget does.\n  Each and every year of this budget, the deficit is increased over the \nso-called baseline budget. That is the reality. Perhaps to understand \nhow we got to this circumstance, we have to look back before we can \nlook forward. We have to look back first to 2001, when the President \ntold us:\n\n       [W]e can proceed with tax relief without fear of budget \n     deficits, even if the economy softens.\n\n  That is what the President told us in 2001. But look what happened. \nThe President was wrong. We went from a surplus in 2000, the year \nbefore President Bush came into office, and the deficit situation has \ndeclined each and every year to now record levels of deficit, the \nbiggest deficit in dollar terms we have ever had.\n  So when the President assured us we could have massive tax cuts and \nwe would not have deficits, he was simply wrong. But he was not just \nwrong on that issue, because the next year he told us:\n\n     . . . [O]ur budget will run a deficit that will be small and \n     short term . . .\n\n  He said this in his State of the Union Address on January 29, 2002. \nUnfortunately, that was wrong, too, because these deficits are not \nsmall and they are certainly not short term. In fact, what we see going \nforward to 2015 is an ocean of red ink, the biggest deficits we have \never had in dollar terms.\n  So when the President said they would be small, he was wrong. They \nare very large deficits. When he said they would be short term, he was \nwrong again. These are long-term deficits and deficits that are as far \nas the eye can see. That is not just my conclusion, that is the \nconclusion of the Congressional Budget Office as well.\n  If we put back the things the President has left out, the ongoing war \ncosts, the need for alternative minimum tax reform, and the money he is \ntaking from Social Security--it is an interesting thing because at the \nsame time the President says there is a shortfall in Social Security, \nunder his budget each and every year he takes every dime of Social \nSecurity money that is available to take and uses it to pay for other \nthings. Again, the President was wrong when he told us these deficits \nwere going to be small and short term.\n  The next year the President told us in his budget submission:\n\n       [O]ur budget gap is small by historical standards.\n\n  Again, the President has simply proved to be wrong. Let us put up \nthat next slide that shows a historical comparison of the deficits \nunder President Bush compared to the three previous administrations. \nThe President says the deficits he is writing are small by historical \nstandards. One can look at the last three administrations and see that \nhis deficits are by far the largest.\n  Let us go to the next slide. The President now says to us, well, we \nhave deficits, so forget about that assertion that there are not going \nto be any. They are clearly not small and short term. They are clearly \nnot small by historical standards. So now he assures us he is going to \ncut the deficits in half over the next 5 years. Well, let us look at \nthe reality with respect to that assertion, because what we find is \nsomething quite different.\n  This is the President's claim. He says the deficit is going to be cut \nin half over the next 5 years, but he gets that result simply by \nleaving out things. He leaves out war costs past September 30 of this \nyear. He leaves out the need to reform the alternative minimum tax, \nwhich is the old millionaire's tax which is rapidly becoming a middle-\nclass tax trap. It costs over $700 billion to fix. There is not a dime \nin this budget to do it. Surprisingly, he leaves out the cost of his \nmajor proposal, which is to change Social Security, and the cost of his \nproposed change is in the trillions of dollars, over $700 billion the \nfirst 10 years but over 20 years over $4 trillion of costs. He does not \nhave any of it in his budget.\n  The President also told us back in 2001:\n\n     . . . (M)y budget pays down a record amount of national debt. \n     We will pay off $2 trillion of debt over the next decade. \n     That will be the largest debt reduction of any country, ever. \n     Future generations shouldn't be forced to pay back money that \n     we have borrowed. We owe this kind of responsibility to our \n     children and grandchildren.\n\n  We can now look back and check the record and see if the President's \nassertions were correct or incorrect. Again, he was wrong with \nvirtually every major claim he made on the deficit. Unfortunately, the \nsame is true with respect to the debt. The President said he was going \nto pay down $2 trillion of debt. Unfortunately, we do not see any \npaydown in debt. The debt is exploding.\n  The assertion by the President that he was going to pay down the \nmaximum amount of debt available to pay down evaporated, like his \nclaims on the deficit. Instead, the debt is skyrocketing, and under the \nbudget the President has sent to us, we see nothing but continued \ngrowth of the debt.\n  When the President came into office, the publicly held debt was $3.3 \ntrillion. We now forecast by 2015 it will be $9.4 trillion, almost a \ntripling of the debt at a time the President said he was going to have \nmaximum paydown of the debt.\n  One of the most interesting claims I get from colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle is that these massive tax cuts have nothing to do \nwith the deficits and nothing to do with the growth of the debt. Well, \nhow is that? How can that possibly be true?\n  I remember very well this chart that the Congressional Budget Office \nshowed us back in January of 2001. This chart shows the range of \npossible outcomes for the deficit, and the administration chose the \nmidpoint of this range in telling us in 2001 we could expect $6 \ntrillion of surpluses over the next decade. But now we are able to go \nback and see what actually happened.\n  I remember so well, my colleagues on the other side told me, when I \nwarned them against taking this 10-year forecast in the Budget \nCommittee to the bank--I repeatedly warned it was very risky to count \non a 10-year forecast--many of my friends on the other side said: Kent, \nyou are being much too conservative. Don't you understand the tax cut \nwill generate even more revenue? Don't you understand, when we put in \nplace these tax cuts, we are going to get a tremendous revenue impact, \nmore revenue than is forecast? They told me we are going to be in the \ntop end of this range.\n  Let's look at what actually happened. We can now see the record. The \nrecord is the red line. This is what happened to the deficits. We \ndidn't get more money, we got less money, and the result is, combined \nwith more spending on defense and homeland security and rebuilding New \nYork, that the deficits are far worse than even the low end of the \nrange projected back in 2001.\n  Let's check reality. When our friends say if you cut taxes you get \nmore money, that has not been the experience. The experience has been \nvery clearly when you cut taxes, you get less money. In fact, we got a \nlot less money, 3 years in a row with less money than the year before. \nThat is unprecedented since World War II.\n  It is not just tax cuts. Tax cuts are about half the reason. The \nother half is economic downturn and forecasts that were overly \noptimistic.\n  Nonetheless, I want to go back to the point. I don't want anybody to \nmiss\n\n[[Page S2593]]\n\nthis point. Here is what is forecast, this possible range of outcomes. \nThey chose the midrange on which to base their spending and taxing \npolicies. Many said, with the massive tax cuts you will get more money. \nBut here is the reality. Here is what happened in the real world: A lot \nless money, much bigger deficits, and an exploding debt.\n  If we look at the budget turnaround since 2000, that is the \ndifference between what was projected and what actually occurred. What \nwe see is that the revenue loss accounts for the bulk of the budget \nturn around. In fact, reduction in revenue is three-quarters of the \nreason for the move from dramatic surpluses to dramatic and growing \ndeficits. I think it is very important for us to be dealing in facts \nhere, not rhetoric, not hope, not ideological belief, but facts. The \nfacts are that the revenue side of the equation collapsed.\n  Do you remember, back in 2000, revenue was running at almost 21 \npercent of GDP? The President said: That is very high by historical \nstandards. And he was right. He said: As a result we need to cut taxes. \nI must say I also supported cutting taxes. I didn't support the \nparticular plan that he advocated, but I believed we needed to cut \ntaxes to give lift to the economy at the time. But I also believed we \nneeded to reduce the amount of the tax cut over an extended period so \nthat we would avoid going back into deficit and debt. That is where the \nPresident and I parted ways. I believed we needed to have tax cuts. In \nfact, I supported greater tax cuts than the President proposed, to give \nlift to the economy at a time of economic weakness. But the President \nwanted to go much further, and here is what happened.\n  We had 21 percent of GDP in 2000 coming in, in revenue. Last year we \nwere down to 16.3 percent of GDP. That is the lowest it has been since \n1959. The revenue side of the equation collapsed. Again, about half of \nthat is due to tax cuts.\n  I listened very carefully to my colleague. He talked about the reason \nthe revenue had gone down. He never mentioned the single biggest \nreason. He never mentioned the tax cuts. But the tax cuts are the \nbiggest single reason for the revenue collapse. Again, I, too, \nsupported tax reductions at a time of economic weakness to give lift to \nthe economy. I didn't think the particular mix of tax cuts was the most \neffective because, unfortunately, the tax cuts that were put in place \nwere largely weighted to the wealthiest among us. I think we would have \nbeen much better targeting the middle class and lower middle class \nbecause those are the ones most likely to spend those tax cuts. But \nbeyond that, the question is, going forward, How much can we afford? \nWhat is the relationship between spending and revenue? That is what is \ncritical. That is what creates deficits.\n\n  Our friends on the other side only want to talk about spending. \nSpending is one-half of the equation, revenue is the other half of the \nequation. It is the difference between how much you are raising and how \nmuch you are spending that leads to deficits. This chart goes back to \n1980: The red line is the spending line, the green line is the revenue \nline. You can see very clearly back in the 1980s we had a big gap \nbetween spending and revenue. We were spending much more than we were \ntaking in. As a result, we had record deficits at the time.\n  Then we got spending under control. In fact, interestingly enough, \nduring a Democratic administration spending as a share of our national \nincome went down every year. Spending went down in a Democratic \nadministration and revenue went up. It was that combination of reducing \nspending and raising revenue that brought us back to balance. In fact, \nfor 3 years we were running surpluses. We even ran surpluses \nsufficiently strong to stop taking Social Security money and using it \nto pay for other things. We stopped the raid on Social Security.\n  Then President Bush came into office. We had the tax cuts, we had an \neconomic slowdown, and the revenue side of the equation plunged. We \ndidn't get more revenue from tax cuts, we got less revenue. Is anybody \nlistening? We didn't get more money with tax cuts, we got less money. \nAnd spending went up--though still far below where it was in the 1980s \nand 1990s, but spending went up. I am not faulting the President. We \nall agree spending had to go up on defense, on homeland security, on \naid for New York, on the bailout of the airlines, and 91 percent of \nthis increase in spending was in just those areas: Defense, homeland \nsecurity, aid for New York, and bailing out the airlines. That is where \nthe increase in spending occurred. Still, the spending is substantially \nbelow where it was in the 1980s and 1990s.\n  The biggest culprit in the explosion of deficits was on the revenue \nside of the ledger. These are facts. This is not an ideological \nargument. It is just facts. I think that is what we have to concentrate \non if we are going to get out of this mess. It is going to take \nspending discipline without question. We have to deal on this side of \nthe ledger. But we are also going to have to deal on the revenue side \nof the ledger, and our friends on the other side of the aisle never \nwant to talk about it.\n  This year, the President has said:\n\n       We've got to do something about the deficit. . . . it's \n     important.\n\n  He is right. We have to do something about the deficit because these \ndeficits are much too high, and as far as the eye can see there is no \nreduction anywhere in sight. If we look at the President's budget, what \nwe find in terms of doing something about the deficit is largely \nrhetorical. What the President's idea is of doing something about the \ndeficit is just leave out things. Leave things out of the budget and \nthat makes the numbers look better. It doesn't really change things \nthough. This is the way you fool yourself, and this is the way others \nmight get fooled. This is how institutions, companies, and individuals \nget into trouble. They start not quite telling the whole story. Maybe \nthey don't even quite tell the whole story to themselves.\n  When I look at the President's budget, that is what he and his people \nare doing. They are not really including everything. They are leaving \nthings out to make the numbers look better.\n  What have they left out? First of all, they switched from 10-year \nbudgeting to 5-year budgeting because they know right beyond the 5-year \nbudget window things look much worse.\n  They have left out funding for ongoing war costs beyond September 30 \nof this year. Just don't include it. They say to me: It is hard to \npredict what the war costs might be. That is true, it is hard to \npredict. That is what a budget is all about. Can you imagine a family \nleaving out their utility bills because they are hard to predict month \nto month? Can you imagine a family leaving out the food bill because it \nis hard to predict? But that is what the President has done. He has \nleft out the war costs past September 30 of this year because it is \nhard to predict.\n  He has left out the cost of alternative minimum tax reform. \nAlternative minimum tax, that is the old millionaire's tax. It affects \n3 million people now, and 10 years from now it is going to affect 40 \nmillion. It costs over $700 billion to fix. The President doesn't have \none dime in his budget to address this problem. Last year, \ninterestingly enough he had 1 year of fix in his budget. This year he \ndoesn't even do that. I can make a budget look pretty good if I leave \nthings out, and that is what the President is doing.\n  Most remarkably, he has left out completely the cost of his Social \nSecurity privatization plan. He doesn't have one dime in his budget to \ncover the cost of a Social Security privatization plan that in the \nfirst 10 years costs over $700 billion. He doesn't have a dime in his \nbudget. Over 20 years, his plan costs over $4 trillion. His answer is, \nborrow the money. On top of the already record deficits, borrow the \nmoney.\n  I am going to, in a minute, get into why that is a very risky course \nfor this country.\n  The President also does something very interesting in this budget. He \nonly provides details on discretionary spending. Those are accounts \nlike education, law enforcement, parks--he only provides what he \nintends to spend in those areas for 1 year. Not since 1989 has a \nPresident failed to tell Congress and tell the American people what the \noutyear effects of his programs are; what the future years' effects of \nhis programs are. But this President, for the first time since 1989, \nsays he is not going to tell us that.\n  I suspect the reason he is not going to tell us that is because it \ngets pretty grim by the time you get out to the third, fourth, and \nfifth year.\n\n[[Page S2594]]\n\n  When the President's people came to me and said they had a plan to \ncut the deficit in half over 5 years, and they showed me the plan, I \nsaid to them: Why don't you leave out some more things and claim you \nbalanced the budget because what you are doing is you are making \nprogress by denial, by leaving things out.\n  When I go back and add in what the President has left out, I get a \nvery different picture than is being presented on this floor about the \nbudget going forward. When I go back and add up the things the \nPresident has admitted--the need for alternative minimum tax reform and \nthe war costs, when I put in the amount of Social Security money that \nthe President is taking to pay for other things, to try to arrive at \nwhat the real operating deficit of the United States is, here is what I \nfind. I find an operating deficit in 2006 of $579 billion; increasing \nin 2007 to $584 billion; in 2008 to $586 billion; in 2009 to $595 \nbillion; and improving by $1 billion in 2007 to $594 billion.\n\n  These are my best estimates of what the operating deficits are going \nto be under the President's plan. Not an improvement. There is no \ncutting the deficit in half. Instead, massive operating deficits, \nadding to the debt by almost $600 billion a year, each and every year \nfor the next 5 years, and after 5 years, it gets much worse. This is \nnot what the American people deserve in terms of being told about the \nfiscal condition of their country.\n  Let me go back to the specifics of the things the President has left \nout. In war costs there is $82 billion in a budget supplemental put in \nthis year, but there is nothing past September 30th of this year in the \nPresident's budget. The Congressional Budget Office says $383 billion \nis what we can expect. There is $300 billion left on the cutting room \nfloor, real costs that a real budget would include.\n  It is not only that we see a hiding from the American people of how \nserious our fiscal condition is. The President's tax cut proposal is \nwhere it is most dramatic. The dotted line on this chart is the first 5 \nyears of the President's plan. Making the tax cuts permanent has a \nmodest cost in the first 5 years. But look what happens right outside \nthe budget window: The costs of the President's tax cut plan absolutely \nexplode. Is this, perhaps, a reason the President moved from 10-year \nbudgeting to 5-year budgeting? Did he want to disguise the full effect \nof what he is proposing from the American people? Did he want to hide \nit so that people did not see where this is all headed?\n  I have already shown in the next 5 years the operating deficits will \nbe running in the neighborhood of $600 billion a year. Look what will \nhappen if the President's plan is adopted. These deficits are going to \nskyrocket because the revenue hemorrhage will skyrocket.\n  It is not just the revenue hemorrhage but the other items as well. \nThis is, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the money that \nis needed to fix the alternative minimum tax. I said it was over $700 \nbillion. It is actually $774 billion. Not a dime of it is in the \nPresident's budget. And it gets much worse after the first 5 years. Of \ncourse, the President's budget has none of it. That is hidden from the \nAmerican people.\n  On the President's Social Security plan, the first 10 years cost $754 \nbillion. Here is what is in the President's budget: zero. Nothing. When \nwe get to the 20-year cost, others are saying even more than this. My \nown projection is $4.4 trillion for the cost of the President's \nprivatization plan. Why? Because if you take some of the payroll taxes \nand divert them into private accounts, you have to replace the money \nyou have taken from somewhere. The President's proposal is, borrow it. \nJust borrow another $4 trillion.\n  I am at a loss for words. I feel as though I am involved in a surreal \ndiscussion in a surreal exercise on the budget of the United States. We \nhave record deficits now. The President says, cut the revenue some more \nand add more to the spending, but he leaves a lot of it out of the \nbudget and says he is going to cut the deficit in half. He has been \nwrong on each and every one of his forecasts. Not wrong by a little \nbit, but wrong by a country mile.\n  Here is the Comptroller General of the United States, the head of the \nGovernment Accountability Office. He warns the fiscal outlook is worse \nthan claimed. He said to the National Press Club in February of this \nyear:\n\n       The simple truth is that our nation's financial condition \n     is much worse than advertised.\n\n  That is the truth. That is the truth, right here. Here is a guy who \nis telling the truth.\n\n       The simple truth is that our nation's financial condition \n     is much worse than advertised.\n\n  I go back to the chart. The President says he is going to cut the \ndeficit in half, but he gets there by leaving out things. When you put \nthe things back, what you see is massive deficits, massive additions to \nthe debt. In fact, by 2015, each family's share of the debt will total, \naccording to our calculations, over $73,000.\n  That is where these fiscal policies are leading. When the President \nsays ``the people's money,'' he is exactly right. It is the people's \nmoney. It is also the people's debt. The President says let's not pay \nthe people's bills. Let's borrow the money. Guess what. In whose name \nis he borrowing it? He is borrowing it in our names. He is borrowing it \nin the names of all of us who are responsible for ultimately paying off \nthis debt. When the President says the people's money, absolutely, it \nis the people's money; it is also the people's debt. The President is \nrunning up the debt in a record way and at the worst possible time, \nright before the baby boomers retire.\n  There is another part of this that I don't think is being shared with \nthe American people. Where are we borrowing all this money from? Where \nis it coming from? Increasingly, it is coming from abroad. Here is what \nhas happened. When the President came into office, we owed an external \ndebt. Foreign holdings of our debt were just over $1 trillion. In the \nshort time this President has been in office, that has almost doubled. \nForeign holdings of our debt have gone up 92 percent in the term of \noffice of this President. It took 200 years to get external debt of $1 \ntrillion and this President has taken us to $2 trillion in just over 3 \nyears.\n  Here is where the money is coming from. We have now borrowed over \n$700 billion from Japan. Hard to believe, isn't it? We have borrowed \nover $700 billion from Japan. I read in the paper the other day that \nJapan now holds $840 billion of United States dollars. They are sitting \non $840 billion of United States dollars. We have borrowed $712 billion \nfrom Japan. We borrowed $160 billion from England. We borrowed $69 \nbillion from the so-called Caribbean banking centers. We have borrowed \n$69 billion from South Korea. We have borrowed $60 billion from OPEC. \nThat is the oil exporting countries.\n  Here we are. We have borrowed money all over the world. And it is \nincreasing dramatically. So what? What difference does it make? The \ndifference it makes is it makes us more and more vulnerable to the \ndecisions of foreign central bankers as to the economic security of \nthis country. It is that simple. It is that important.\n  What happens to your relationship with the banker when you owe money \nversus when you have a big deposit? Does your relationship change? Sure \nit does. Our relationship is changing with the rest of the world \nbecause we have gone from being the biggest creditor nation in the \nworld to being the biggest debtor nation in the world. So now we are \nvery dependent. When we have a bond action to finance the credit and \ndebt, we are increasingly dependent on foreign governments and foreign \ncentral banks to buy this debt. This is a story from January from the \nFinancial Times. ``Central Banks Shun US Assets.'' ``Shifting reserves \nto eurozone will deepen Bush's difficulties in funding deficit.'' \n``Actions likely to undermine dollar's value further.''\n  Friends, that is the risk being run by these massive budget deficits, \nby these massive trade deficits. We are more and more dependent on \nothers. We are more and more dependent on Japan loaning us money; on \nChina loaning us money; on South Korea loaning us money.\n  What happens if they decide some day they are not going to continue \nloaning us money? What happens then? We have had a couple of \nindications in the last few months. A few weeks ago, February 23, Korea \nsaid they were going to limit their dollar holdings. ``Central bank's \nplan upsets exchanges.'' ``Fears flared anew yesterday that the United \nStates dollar \n\n[[Page S2595]]\n\nmight lose a crucial underpinning of support--purchases by the world's \ncentral banks--after South Korea's central bank said in a report that \nit plans to invest more of its holdings in the currencies of other \ncountries.''\n\n  What happened? ``news of the report,'' . . . ``sent the dollar \nskidding on foreign exchange markets. The Euro was trading at $1.3259 \nlate yesterday, up from Monday's close of $1.3067. The dollar fell \nagainst the 104.04 yen . . . '' and ``the greenback also sank against \nthe British pound, the Canadian dollar and Swiss franc. The dollar's \nslide, together with a rise in oil prices, drove stock prices sharply \nlower.''\n  These are the risks being run due to a reckless fiscal policy. This \nfiscal policy of massive record deficits with no end in sight and \nrecord massive trade deficits with no end in sight is putting the \neconomic strength of this country at risk.\n  It is not only Korea. On March 11, last week, Japan followed Korea:\n\n       Talk in Japan shakes dollar and treasuries.\n       The dollar fell and treasury yields rose yesterday after \n     the Japanese Prime Minister made remarks that suggested the \n     country's industrial bank could be shifting some of its huge \n     reserves out of dollars and treasury securities.\n\n  What happened? The dollar took another hit. So now we have Korea \nsaying they are going to diversify out of dollars. We have Japan, the \nbiggest lender to our country, warning of the same thing. What would \nhappen if they didn't show up at a bond auction? We hold an auction of \nUnited States securities to float the boat to cover these deficits, \nbecause when you are spending more money than you are taking in, you \nhave to borrow the money. In the past, we borrowed almost all of it \nfrom ourselves. Not anymore. Increasingly, we are borrowing from all \nover the world. And they are warning us: You are going too far; we \nmight not continue buying this debt.\n  What happens if they don't show up? We all know what happens. We \nwould have to dramatically increase interest rates to entice them back. \nThat would have severe consequences for our economy.\n  It is not only Koreans and Japanese. Here is one of the most \nsuccessful investors in the history of the United States, Warren \nBuffett. What is he saying? He says in 2005, he is still betting \nagainst the dollar. Warren Buffett, one of the most successful \ninvestors in America, is betting against the dollar.\n\n       When the stock market was soaring in the late 1990s, Warren \n     E. Buffett now says, he should have sold stocks rather than \n     just complain that they were overvalued. Now Mr. Buffett, the \n     billionaire investor, says he is acting on his view that the \n     dollar is still headed down, even though it makes him nervous \n     that so many agree with him.\n\n  So he has bet a huge amount of money that the dollar is going to \ncontinue to decline in value.\n  We have the South Koreans warning us. We owe them almost $70 billion. \nWe have the Japanese warning us. We owe them over $700 billion. And we \nhave Warren Buffett.\n\n  I can tell you, I was with a man who is one of the foremost financial \nadvisers in the country, and he told me last year he was at the annual \nmeeting of one of the wealthiest families in America and the discussion \nat their annual meeting was exactly what we are talking about here: the \nenormous risks being run by the United States with these massive budget \ndeficits, massive trade deficits, leading to unprecedented borrowing, \nnot only from our own people, but from countries around the world.\n  They saw that as a serious vulnerability--this, one of the wealthiest \nfamilies in America. And the debate was whether they should diversify \nout of dollar-denominated investments. They concluded, apparently, that \nthey would do that.\n  Now, all we have to do is look at what has happened to the dollar \nagainst the Euro since 2002 to see why they might be concerned. Look \nwhat has happened to the value of the dollar. It has declined 33 \npercent against the Euro in just that period of time. That is dramatic. \nEvery dollar we have has lost 33 percent of its value against the \nEuropean currency.\n  So if you are a central banker in Japan, you are a central banker in \nKorea, and you have loaned all this money to the United States, and you \nsee that those dollar holdings you have in your central banks have \ndeclined in value by almost a third against the European currency, \nmight you conclude that it is time to invest some of your money \nsomewhere else?\n  Friends, this is the risk that is being run by this policy of debt \nand deficits. These deficits are out of control. They are undermining \nconfidence in the American currency. They are undermining confidence in \nthe long-term economic strength of the country. And this budget does \nnot do anything about it. In fact, this budget makes it all worse. This \nbudget means bigger deficits, not smaller.\n  The Congressional Budget Office put out a baseline budget, if we made \nno policy changes, of what would happen. But this budget does make \npolicy changes, and you would think that given these facts, the \npolicies would be to reduce the deficits. That is not what this budget \ndoes. This budget increases the deficits each and every year compared \nto a policy of putting everything on automatic pilot. Now, that is a \nfact.\n  What are the potential consequences here? If the dollar were to \ndecline even more precipitously than it has already, there are very few \noptions left. You have to, first of all, dramatically increase interest \nrates. What difference would that make? Well, let's look for a typical \nAmerican family.\n  A 1-percent increase in interest rates will raise the payment on a \n30-year home mortgage of $150,000 by $1,200 a year. On a $300,000 \nmortgage, it would raise it $2,400 a year. On a $450,000 mortgage, it \nwould raise the payment $3,600 a year. And it would not be only on a \nhouse mortgage. It would be on a car payment, student loan payment, all \nthe corporate debt that is out there, and all the Government debt. If \ninterest rates rose dramatically in order to offset the effect of \nforeign central banks being unwilling to loan us more money, the \neconomic consequences here could be severe.\n  When I look at the tax policy that underlies this budget, it also \nraises the serious question of fairness. Because under the President's \nplan, the top 1 percent in our country, those who earn over $402,000 a \nyear, get 30 percent of the benefit. The top 1 percent get 30 percent \nof the benefit. The top 20 percent get over two-thirds of the benefit. \nThey get almost 69 percent of the benefit.\n  We hear a lot from our friends: Well, the higher income people pay \nmore in taxes. That is true. They pay more in income taxes. But our \nfriends on the other side always want to leave out the payroll taxes \nthat everybody else pays. And when you put the two together, you find \nthat the wealthiest among us do pay more, but they do not compare \nanywhere close to the proportion of the tax cuts they are getting.\n\n  When we look at 2004 and how the tax benefits stacked up in that \nyear, what we see is, from the combined effect of the 2001 and 2003 tax \ncuts, a middle-income household got $1,000 and the top 1 percent, those \nearning over $400,000, got $78,000. If we were going to have a bar on \nthe chart to compare what those earning over $400,000 got in tax \nbenefit as compared to what a middle-income household got, the bar \nwould have to go 17 feet higher. It would go almost to the ceiling of \nthis Chamber to compare what the top 1 percent got in comparison to the \nmiddle-income people in the country. Is that fair? That is what the \nPresident's tax policy says is fair. Give those who are the top 1 \npercent $78,000 in tax benefit; give the middle income $1,000.\n  In this budget is a continuation of the dividend and capital gains \ntax cut. Those cuts will provide a millionaire, on average, with a tax \ncut of $35,000. Somebody earning $50,000 to $200,000 gets $112. Let me \ngo through this again. This is the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center \nthat has done this calculation. The dividends and capital gains tax cut \nthat my colleague was praising gives those who earn less than $50,000 a \nyear, on average, a $6 tax reduction. That is the vast majority of \npeople in this country.\n  For these tax types--dividends and capital gains--the average savings \nfor an American earning less than $50,000 is $6. For somebody earning \n$50,000 to $200,000, they get a tax savings of $112. And the dividends \nand capital gains tax cuts are a major part of this budget.\n  For those earning $200,000 to $1 million, they get an average tax cut \nof $1,480. But for those who earn more than $1 million, they get, on \naverage, a tax cut of $35,000.\n\n[[Page S2596]]\n\n  Now, this is some people's sense of fairness; it is not mine: $6 to \nthose who earn less than $50,000 a year, and $35,000 to those who earn \nmore than $1 million. We have the biggest deficits in the history of \nthe country, and no end in sight, and this is what we are going to do? \nThat is what we are going to do if we pass this budget.\n  Our friends on the other side say: Well, those who are at the top pay \nmore in taxes. That is true. Those who are at the top pay more in \ntaxes. That is absolutely true. But do you know what, they are getting \n30 percent of the benefit of this tax cut, and they pay 16 percent of \nthe tax burden. So they pay more, but they are getting much bigger \nbenefit than what they pay.\n  My friends, at some point we are going to have to deal with reality. \nThe reality is, we are not paying our bills in this country. We are not \ncoming anywhere close to paying our bills. And our friends on the other \nside come with a budget that says we have no intention of paying our \nbills any time in the foreseeable future. We are not going to come \nanywhere close to paying our bills.\n  Then you get to the question of priorities, which is a very important \nquestion as we go forward. Let me say to my colleagues, for those \nearning over $1 million in 2006, the total cost of the President's tax \ncut proposals for that 1 year alone is $32 billion. Let me repeat that. \nFor those earning over $1 million a year in 2006, the tax cuts to them \ncost $32 billion in that year alone.\n  On the other hand, the cost to maintain veterans funding at the 2005 \nlevel would be about $300 million. So in this budget, they are saying \nit is 100 times as important to give the Bush tax cuts to those earning \nover $1 million a year as it is to maintain funding for our veterans. \nIs it 100 times as important? Is it 100 times as important?\n  Well, it is not only veterans. That same question can be asked of the \nCOPS Program that has put 100,000 police on the street to make our \ncities and towns safer. Again, the cost of the tax cut for those \nearning over $1 million a year in 2006 is $32 billion for that year \nalone. The money to restore the COPS Program would be $500 million. So \nwhat you have to ask yourself is, is it 60 times as important or could \nthe very wealthiest among us, those earning over $1 million a year, \ngive up one-sixtieth of their tax cut for that year to keep 100,000 \npolice on the street? I think that is a question we should ask. I know \nwhat my answer would be.\n\n  Education. It would cost $4.8 billion to restore the education \nprograms cut in the President's budget. Again, for that same year, the \ntax cuts for those earning over $1 million cost $32 billion. Would the \nwealthiest among us be willing to give up one-sixth of their tax cut to \nrestore the cuts to education?\n  The same applies to community development funding. I have heard from \nvirtually every mayor in my State. It costs $1.7 billion to restore the \ncuts there. At the same time, we are going to give a $32 billion tax \ncut to those earning over $1 million a year in that 1 year alone.\n  Low-income heating assistance. It costs $220 million to restore the \nmoney, a little tiny sliver on the chart--$220 million. At the same \ntime, we are going to spend $32 billion on tax cuts for those earning \nover $1 million a year.\n  For agriculture, this chart looks at it in a little different way. \nThe President is cutting $7.5 billion there. The cost, over the same \nperiod of time, for those earning over $1 million a year is $185 \nbillion. That is 25 times as much.\n  My friends on the other side say that somehow this budget is going to \nreduce the deficit. No, this budget does not reduce the deficit. If we \ncompare it to the Congressional Budget Office's baseline--there are no \npolicy changes; we continue what we are doing now--this budget \nincreases the deficit each and every year.\n  The biggest increase is in the next year--$63 billion of additional \ndeficit if we pass this budget compared to continuing what we are doing \nnow. If we make no policy changes, just continue what we are doing now, \nwe would have $63 billion less in deficit than if we pass this budget.\n  I want anybody who votes for this budget to go out and explain to the \nAmerican people why, at a time of record budget deficits, they are \npassing a budget that increases the deficit. I want to hear that \nexplanation.\n  Again, when we go back and look at the things that have been left out \nof this budget compared to, if we go back and include the additional \nwar cost that is left out of this budget, the alternative minimum tax \nexpense that is excluded, if we take the money that is being diverted \nfrom Social Security and used to pay for other things, here are the \noperating deficits we see under the budget that is before us. It is a \nlittle better than the President's, but not much: $587 billion, $583 \nbillion, $582 billion, $582 billion.\n  What is all this talk about cutting deficits in half? The only way \nthey get there is they leave out things. They leave out the money they \nare taking from Social Security. They leave out the money for the war. \nThey leave out the money for the alternative minimum tax. Just leave \nout things. If you put them back, massive deficits.\n  This is what is going to get added to the debt, not the numbers they \nare talking about. This is what is going to be added to the debt.\n  And if you doubt this is the case, let's look in their budget. Let's \nlook at their own document. This is their own budget resolution. Let's \nlook year by year. I have said that they are going to be adding almost \n$600 billion a year to the debt. I understated it. I apologize. They \nare going to be adding much more to the debt than that. I was just \ndoing an operating budget.\n  If we look at what their own document says, they are going to add to \nthe debt every year. For 2005, $669 billion is going to get added to \nthe debt, according to their own calculations. Next year they are going \nto add $636 billion to the debt. The next year is $624 billion. The \nnext year is 622. By the fifth year, 611. Where is the cutting of the \ndeficit? Where is it? It is magical. There is no cutting. This is what \nthey say about their own budget.\n\n  This is what they say they are going to add to the debt. This isn't \nmy number. This isn't my presentation. This is theirs. This is from \ntheir own budget document. And what does it say? They are going to add \nto the debt $600 billion every year of this budget.\n  The President says it is important to do something about the deficit. \nThey say it is important to do something about the deficit. They are \nnot doing anything about the deficit. That is their own calculation \nabout what is going to happen.\n  Remember what the President told us about 2008. He told us in January \nof 2001 that there would be virtually no debt left by 2008. That is \nwhat he told us. This is what we now believe the debt will be in 2008. \nInstead of virtually no debt, we are going to have almost $6 trillion \nof debt. This is what he said was going to happen. This is what is \nreally happening.\n  The President of the United States has been wrong by a country mile \non every one of his major assertions about the fiscal condition of our \ncountry. It has real consequences.\n  When we look at the budget that our Senate Republican colleagues have \nput up, let me just say it is a little bit better than the President's \nin some ways. But it still has additions to the deficit, bigger \ndeficits, more debt by their own calculations. It still has flawed \npriorities. Here is veterans funding. It costs $300 million to maintain \nveterans funding. They are going to give $32 billion in tax cuts to \nthose earning over $1 million a year. On the COPS Program, it costs \n$500 million to restore the cuts in the COPS Program and put 100,000 \npolice on the street. But they would rather give--in fact, by a \nsixtyfold margin--tax cuts to the wealthiest among us. That is more \nimportant to them.\n  It is more important to them to give those tax cuts to those earning \nover $1 million a year than it is to restore the cuts to education, six \ntimes as important. Are those really the priorities of this country? Is \nthat what this country thinks is important?\n  I will have more to say about this budget as we go forward. But this \nis a budget that is not facing up to the real challenges facing our \nNation. This is a budget that basically ducks and runs. This is a \nbudget that basically says: We don't have to worry about that. We will \ntalk as though we are worried. We will use the words. But the actual \nbudget is not going to do anything about these mounting deficits and \ndebt that fundamentally threaten the economic security of the country.\n\n[[Page S2597]]\n\n  We should be doing much better than this. At some point, I hope it is \nnot a crisis that gets us that. I still believe we have the ability and \nthe will to act to face up to the crisis rather than letting it \novercome us. But this budget doesn't face up to it. This budget doesn't \ndo that. This budget just lets the good times roll--more tax cuts, more \nspending, even though we cannot pay our bills now. I believe deeply \nthat is a fundamental threat to the economic security of our country \nbecause we are not just borrowing this money from ourselves anymore, we \nare borrowing from countries all over the world. That makes us \nvulnerable to their decisions about whether they are going to continue \nto loan us money.\n  I believe it is past time for the President to reverse course and to \ncall on Congress and to put his administration to the task of an \noverall plan to face up to the shortfalls in Medicare, in Medicaid--by \nthe way, the shortfall in Medicare is eight times the shortfall in \nSocial Security. The President has no plan to deal with that, none. He \nwould rather focus on Social Security, which is a challenge, a long-\nterm funding problem. I will repeat, the funding problem with Medicare \nis eight times as big as in Social Security. My own view is that we \nought to be working on it all. We ought to have everything on the \ntable--Medicare, Medicaid. I salute my colleague from New Hampshire who \nput a focus on Medicaid, where spending is going through the roof in \nStates and for the Federal Government, but we ought to be putting the \nfocus on all of these areas, including the budget deficits, because I \nbelieve only in that way will we come up with a plan that really \nstrengthens the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for \nhis presentation. I wanted to respond to a couple of items. I think \nthey go to the essence of the issue here. First, the vast majority of \nthe Senator's time has been spent discussing the President's budget. We \nare not voting on the President's budget. I will admit that the \nblueprint for our budget was based off of a large percentage of what \nthe President proposed. But there are very significant items the \nPresident didn't have in his budget that we have in ours.\n  Specifically, as to this argument that there is no funding for the \nwar, our budget has funding for the war. We have a reserve fund of $50 \nbillion, the purpose of which is to pay the cost of the war in the next \nbudget. No, it doesn't have reserve beyond that because, hopefully, we \nwill be out of the war when 2007 rolls around. Even if it is not, it is \nappropriate to wait until the 2007 budget before we go forward with \nanother reserve account, when we will have a more accurate estimate. \nBut the $50 billion for 2006 is reasonable. Progress is being made \nthere.\n  It is very interesting that folks in this body who for so long have \ncriticized the President for pursuing terrorism through the war in \nIraq, which has been one of the primary issues in the fight on \nterrorism--now when things are going fairly well, they are suddenly \ncomplaining we are not putting in the money to fight the war in Iraq. \nThings in the Mideast, as a result of this President standing up and \nfollowing through in the face of a lot of naysayers and second-guessers \nand Monday morning quarterbacks and folks who simply don't have \nconfidence that we as a nation can project liberty across the globe--\nthose naysayers have found that maybe they were wrong. They are not \nwilling to admit it yet, but an election in Iraq was a huge success; \nthe Palestinians holding an election, a huge success; movement toward \npeace between Palestine and the Israeli Government, a huge success; \nSyria pulling out of Lebanon, a huge success with people in the streets \ndemonstrating for peace. Egypt is moving toward an election--not \nnecessarily the most open election--freeing the No. 1 dissident and \nopposition party leader just this weekend. Democracy seems to be making \nprogress in that part of the world, and with that we are undermining \nthe breeding grounds of fundamentalist Islam which has targeted America \nbecause we stand for freedom around the globe, and because we stand for \nwomen's rights, because we stand for a market economy. We are making \nprogress.\n  Now they want to have it both ways. They want to say Iraq was \nterrible, wrong, and should not have occurred, even though things are \nprogressing there and it looks as if there is an end in sight. Then \nthey say, Now you have to budget for 5 years from now to be in Iraq \nbecause that is what we are planning to do, when, of course, that is \nnot what we are planning. These are one-time items, the fighting of the \nwar in Iraq. It should not be built into the defense base. We did not \nbuild it in because 2 or 3 years from now, when we are no longer in \nIraq, I don't want the defense base inflated by that number. I want it \naccurate according to what the Defense Department calls for relative to \nits needs. So we put in the $50 billion for fighting the war in Iraq.\n  So when the Senator from North Dakota talks about the failure to \naddress the issue of reserving for the war in Iraq, he is referring to \nthe President's budget, not the budget that is before us.\n\n  On the issue of Social Security, the Budget Committee doesn't address \nSocial Security. That is by law. There will be a lot of talk about it \non the floor, but we have no authority to do anything in Social \nSecurity. The idea that we should actually account for Social Security, \nwhen the Democratic Party has said they are not going to do anything on \nSocial Security--they are going to bury their head in the sand on it \nand walk in lockstep on Social Security, relative to burying their \nheads in the sand, so that the likelihood of moving legislation through \nthis body is significantly less because it takes 60 votes to move it \nthrough here. When you are facing that type of stonewalling on a \ncritical issue that should be addressed, why would anybody put it in \nthe budget when, first off, we are not supposed to address Social \nSecurity? Why would they put it in the budget when you cannot legally \nput it in? And even if you could, why would you put it in in the face \nof that type of opposition, especially when it is such a fluid \nsituation?\n  On the issue of revenues hemorrhaging, again, the Senator from North \nDakota referred to charts with red lines going here and there. They \nwere the President's numbers, they were not the budget numbers. The \nbudget has basically not taken that tack. We have talked about the 5-\nyear window, and it is an accurate discussion of that 5-year window. \nWhat is important to note, however, from the proposals from the other \nside is that there is no proposal, no budget being brought forward. \nThere is a lot of criticism about the budget but no budget being \nbrought forward.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota said in the markup: Listen to our \namendments to see our budget structure. Fine, we will listen to their \namendments. I note that in the markup, when the Democratic Senators had \nthe opportunity to put forward a budget, they did not. But they did put \nforward a lot of amendments. They put forward about 10 or 12 amendments \non just about everything from worthless programs, such as ATP, to \nprograms that have value but we have not necessarily figured out how we \nare going to pay for them, such as CDBG.\n  In the total, their amendments added up to $229.8 billion of new \nspending, and then their amendments added up to either $244.9 billion \nof new taxes or $276.9 billion of new taxes, depending on how you \naccount for the tax on the top income people in this country. They did \nput forward a proposal. It was their budget, and it was your classic \ntax-and-spend budget, $229 billion in new spending and $244 billion or \npotentially $270 billion in new taxes.\n  Why is it important to mention that? It is important, first, because \nthat is the definition they gave to their budget, but it is also \nimportant to understand the difference of opinion here. You cannot on \none hand talk about need for fiscal responsibility when on the other \nhand you are proposing $229 billion of new spending. You cannot \ndiscipline the Federal Government by raising spending.\n  The American people are not a fundamentally undertaxed people. The \nAmerican people pay a lot of taxes. The concept that you can continue \nto raise taxes and continue to spend money does not work. You have to \ndiscipline the spending side of the ledger.\n  We have done it. Granted, we have not done it as well as I would \nlike; I\n\n[[Page S2598]]\n\nwould like us to slow spending a lot more, but we have done it. We have \nfrozen nondefense discretionary, we slowed the rate of defense \ndiscretionary to 4.5 percent, and we did not stick our little toe in \nthe water, but we came to the water's edge and looked down at the issue \nof entitlement accounts, specifically Medicaid. That is what is \nimportant about this debate. This is the essence of the budget, the \nquestion of how we deal with Medicaid.\n  The Senator from North Dakota and I agree on this subject--we agree \non a number of issues, but what we agree on is that the outyear issue \nin this country is entitlement spending, and at the essence of that \nissue is health care spending. And there are two accounts, Medicare and \nMedicaid. The Senator was correct, this budget does not address \nMedicare. Hopefully we will do it later on. But it does address the \nother major leg of this problem--there are three legs to this issue; it \ndoes not address Social Security--and that is Medicaid. The three legs \nare Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.\n  This is the essence, this is the point of this question: You cannot \ntax your way out of this problem. You cannot raise taxes enough on the \nnext generation that they will ever be able to afford the present \nprogrammatic activities we have on the books in the area of retirement \nbenefits in this country. You cannot do it. We are not as a nation \ngoing to physically be able to do it, and this chart is the essence of \nthat point. I do not use a lot of charts because sometimes they do not \nshow up, but in this case, I am going to use this chart.\n  The historic spending of the Federal Government is 20 percent. If You \nget much over 20 percent, you have put in a tax rate which people \ncannot absorb. They do not make enough money to pay for it and still \nhave a decent lifestyle. It reduces productivity and job creation if \nyou start taxing people at rates over 20 percent, even over 18 percent, \nfor that matter.\n\n  The cost of Medicaid, Social Security, and Medicare, by the year \n2027, 2028, will absorb 20 percent of America's spending; 20 percent of \nthe GDP of this country will be spent on those programs. And it keeps \ngoing up. So you cannot possibly raise taxes enough.\n  You could confiscate the wealth of every American in the top two \nbrackets, which may be a proposal that will come at some date from the \nother side of the aisle--that was a proposal before Ronald Reagan was \nPresident when the 70-percent rates were in effect--and you still could \nnot pay for the cost of these programs. The only way you can handle \nthis is to begin to get ahold of the rate of growth of these programs, \nto put in place some structure that will control the rate of growth of \nthese programs.\n  Social Security is being addressed in a forum outside this budget, in \na debate outside this budget, although it is going to be brought into \nthis budget--the debate will, the substance will not. With respect to \nMedicare, last year we passed the Part D program and, therefore, there \nis a desire to let that percolate until we figure out how that shakes \nout before we move on that.\n  The last leg of the stool is Medicaid. This budget begins a minor \neffort in the area of Medicaid. As I said in my opening talk, there is \n$14 billion of restraint in growth on a $1.12 trillion spending \npackage, reducing the rate of growth from 41 percent to 39 percent over \nthe next 5 years, all of which can be done without impacting the \nquality of services and, in fact, I suspect we will run into a lot of \nGovernors who think it can be done and improve the quality of service \nby giving them more flexibility in how they distribute the benefits \namongst their people in the States more efficiently than being subject \nto a lot of strings out of Washington.\n  This Medicaid issue is the core question and, of course, we look \nforward to the Democratic response to that, whether there will be a \nposition that Medicaid reconciliation should be knocked out of this \nbill and a majority on the other side votes for it, or all on the other \nside of the aisle, for that matter.\n  The Senator from North Dakota also addressed this issue of borrowing. \nThis issue needs to be touched on briefly because it is a big issue. \nThe value of the dollar as the currency that is basically the currency \nof the world is one of our great benefits as a nation. It has been \nweakening. The dollar has been weakening.\n  The practical effect of a weaker dollar, of course, is that we export \nmore goods. There is a lag time, so we have not seen it immediately, \nbut over time, we will see more goods exported, and also the cost of \noil being $55 a barrel undermines the ability to export, the ability to \noffset that trade balance.\n  We cannot afford to have the dollar weakened too much. We cannot \nafford it for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is the need to \nhave capital flowing into the United States. We want capital from \naround the world coming to the United States. I do not find it \nobjectionable that the people of Japan find it safer to invest in the \nUnited States than in Japan. That says something about the strength of \nour economy.\n\n  I do not find it objectionable that the people of France, when they \nlook around the world and decide where they want to put their money, do \nnot want to put it in some company in France but want to put it in a \ncompany in America. I think that is probably a pretty good sign that we \nhave a pretty darn strong economy and a place where people feel they \ncan invest and invest safely and get a decent return. But their \nwillingness to continue to do that means the dollar cannot depreciate \nagainst the franc they put in here or against the yen they put in here. \nIt is that simple.\n  If you are going to invest a yen--say 1 yen is worth 50 cents, \nsomething like that; I do not know what the yen is today; it is nowhere \nnear that--you are not going to want to invest if that dollar is going \nto weaken so that when you take your yen back out, you have lost money \nsimply on the exchange rate, even though you may have made a good \ninvestment in the United States.\n  So having the dollar drop precipitously is a huge problem for us, but \nit is not a problem from a standpoint of exports, and it is not a \nproblem right now of people willing to invest here. Those are signs of \ngood economic values. But it is a problem if, over the long run, it \ncauses the dollar to weaken to a point where people do not feel \ncomfortable investing here because they feel they will lose money in \nthe exchange rate, even though they may make a good investment.\n  Critical to maintaining the confidence of the international community \nin the dollar is, quite simply, our willingness as a Federal Government \nto be fiscally disciplined. They are looking at this budget process and \nthey are saying, hold it.\n  If the position of the Democratic Party is that the way we get fiscal \ndiscipline is by spending an extra $229 billion over the next 5 years, \nthat is not discipline. Fiscal discipline means one contracts--or not \ncontracts; we never contract. At least the rate of growth of Federal \nspending in core accounts is slowed down.\n  Yes, we are fighting a war, but those are one-time expenditures and \nthey will be over. When they are over, they will be taken out of the \nbase. They will not even be in the base, hopefully. So we do need to \nput in place some mechanisms which will say to the world markets and \nour own financial markets, yes, the Federal Government is serious about \ndisciplining the rate of growth.\n  Two of those key elements are, one, a strict cap on spending on the \ndiscretionary side, which is in this bill, 3-year caps enforceable with \na 60-vote point of order, and two, a move on entitlement issues so that \nwe restrain the growth of the entitlements through reconciliation. Both \nof those elements are in this bill. The time restraints are not as big \nas I like, but they are there. Yet, as I listen to the other side of \nthe aisle, all I hear about from their amendments is, let us knock \nthose restraints out, let us shoot through those restraints, let us \nlift that cap, let us knock out those reconciliation instructions, and \nlet us spend more money. We will raise taxes to do it, but we are going \nto still spend more money. That is not disciplining the Federal \nGovernment, and it is not going to improve the value of the dollar if \nwe do that.\n  So this issue of borrowing is a complex one, but it does make a \nstatement about where we are as a matter of policy, and if we wish to \nimprove the value of the dollar, we need to pass a budget that has \nfiscal restraint in it.\n\n[[Page S2599]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the words of my colleague are right on \ntarget. I wish the budget matched the words. The Senator acknowledges \nthe need for fiscal discipline. This budget does not provide it. As I \nhave indicated and shown from their own numbers, the debt goes up $600 \nbillion a year under the budget the Senator advocates. That is fiscal \ndiscipline? No, no.\n  My belief is that fiscal discipline represents a deficit going down, \nnot going up. My view of fiscal discipline is one that reduces the \ndebt, not increases the debt.\n  The Senator's own budget documents show that he is going to add to \nthe debt $600 billion a year each and every year for the next 5 years. \nAnd they call that fiscal discipline? I mean really, this stands words \non their head.\n  It reminds me of Orwell: War is peace, love is hate. Fiscal \ndiscipline is adding $600 billion a year to the debt? Please.\n  Now, the Senator says we did not offer an alternative in the Budget \nCommittee. That is true. We offered alternatives by amendments. The \nSenator says we would have added spending. The Senator is correct. We \npaid for every dime of it and over and above. What was the spending we \nadded? The Senator says we added over $200 billion in spending. The \nSenator is correct, and $200 billion of it was to pay for the war they \ndo not pay for. Now, who is being straight with the American people--\nthose of us who paid for the war or those who make believe they do not \nhave to pay for it?\n  We provided the revenue to cover the cost. That is a new idea around \nhere, to actually pay for something. Those are the amendments we \noffered. If we take out our amendment to cover the war costs, we \noffered $20 billion of spending and $47 billion of deficit reduction. \nWe had more in deficit reduction than we had in spending, and we paid \nfor the war. That is fiscal responsibility.\n\n  There is no fiscal responsibility in a budget that adds, by its own \nterms, by its own calculations, $600 billion a year in debt. That is \nnot my estimate; that is theirs.\n  Let us review the history because history is important. This goes \nback to 1980. The red line is the spending line of the United States. \nThe green line is the revenue line. One thing our Republican friends \nhave been very consistent about is massive deficits. That is what \nhappened the last time they were in charge back in the 1980s: massive \ndeficits, much more spending than revenue. Then the Democrats took \nover. The spending went down.\n  The Senator says spending never goes down. Wrong. Spending went down \nas a share of gross domestic product, which is what the economists say \nis the best way to measure it because it takes out the effects of \ninflation. Spending went down from 22 percent of gross domestic product \nto just over 18 percent of gross domestic product when the Democrats \nwere in charge. The revenue went up. Yes, we raised taxes on the \nwealthiest among us so we could balance budgets, so we could pay for \nthings.\n  What was the result of those policies? The longest economic expansion \nin our Nation's history, the lowest unemployment in 30 years, the \nlowest inflation in 30 years, and one of the strongest periods of \nbusiness investment in the Nation's history. That is the result of \nthose policies combined with private sector initiatives made possible \nby real fiscal responsibility.\n  Our friends always want to concentrate on the spending side. They \nforget that deficits are the result of the relationship between \nspending and revenue. They never want to talk about the revenue side \nbecause look what happened on the revenue side on their watch. It \ncollapsed. Even with spending that increased again under their watch--I \nam not faulting them for this increase in spending because it was \nlargely defense and homeland security--the fact is the spending \nincreased.\n  Look going forward; their spending continues to go up.\n  Meanwhile, the revenue goes up a little bit, but it is far short of \nwhat they want to spend. So what they are telling the American people \nis, more deficits, more debt, more deficits, more debt. That is their \nplan. And then what? What are they going to do when the baby boomers \nretire? I can tell everyone what they are going to do. They are going \nto slash Social Security. They are going to slash Medicare. That is \ngoing to be their answer. Meanwhile, deeper and deeper into debt we \nsink.\n  Is my colleague seeking time? I am happy to yield time to the Senator \noff the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have listened with interest this morning \nto a fascinating debate and discussion about this country's budget \npriorities.\n  My colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, knows of a man I have \nspoken about previously on the Senate floor. His name is John Smith. \nJohn Smith is called the Flying Farmer from Makoti, ND. What John Smith \ndoes is he gets these old cars and he goes to county fairs. He builds a \nramp and jumps three or four other cars. He is kind of a daredevil. He \nworks in a machine shop in Makoti, ND, and then he bills himself as the \nFlying Farmer from Makoti. During the summer, he goes to all these \ncounty fairs and does daredevil stunts.\n  The Flying Farmer, John Smith, is actually in the Guinness Book of \nWorld Records, and here is what his distinction is:\n  He drove a car 500 miles in reverse, averaging 36 miles an hour. Let \nme say that again. He is in the Guinness Book of World Records for \ndriving a car 500 miles in reverse, averaging 36 miles an hour. That \nrecord might well be supplanted by this budget resolution, talking \nabout going in reverse consistently for a long period of time. He may \nhave nothing over the budget resolution that came out of this \ncommittee. This moves this country backward. In my judgment, it does \nnothing to address the central issues facing us in fiscal policy. I \nbelieve my colleague described the accurate numbers. If we go to page \n5, for example, what we find is this: Federal debt subject to limit. \nLine 6 says, in fiscal year 2005, that Federal debt subject to limit is \ngoing to be $7.9 trillion, and then at the end of the fifth year of the \nbudget, it is going to be $11.1 trillion. So this budget resolution \ncalls for a dramatic increase in the Federal debt. Yet we have people \ncoming out saying look at this budget resolution, what a responsible \nthing this is. It moves us in exactly the right direction.\n\n  That is nonsense. This is what it does. On page 5 it says we are \ngoing to dramatically increase Federal indebtedness from $7.9 trillion \nto $11.1 trillion over 5 years.\n  That is one thing. And this increase, incidentally, games the system \nbecause it doesn't include money for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nIt doesn't have money for many other things. But even with what it does \nhave money for, on page 5, line 11, it tells you the truth of the \nmatter. The truth is, this budget document calls for a dramatic \nincrease in Federal indebtedness over the 5 years. Does that mean we \nare going in the right direction, or does that mean we are going in \nreverse? We know the answer to that.\n  The debate about the budget is more than just a debate about numbers. \nIt is a debate also about values. What does this country stand for? \nWhat are our choices and priorities? What is our value system?\n  One hundred years from now everyone in this Chamber will be dead. \nEveryone now serving in the Senate will be dead 100 years from now. But \nthe one lasting impression of who we were, what we stood for, what we \nthought was important, what our value system was, will be found in a \nbudget document that says: here is what they decided to invest in. Here \nis what they spent money on. Here is what represented their value \nsystem. It is all historians will have to evaluate who we were and what \ndid we decide was important in our lifetime.\n  This budget submission has some budget cuts. Let me describe what \nthey are. We are spending less money on veterans than we need to spend \nto keep the current veterans programs funded. This budget includes a \ncut in veterans programs. The same is true in education, not enough \nmoney for current funding to continue, and the same for law enforcement \nand agriculture.\n  You can take a look at these and say, ``veterans,'' that's just a \nword. It is a lot more than a word. It is folks who\n\n[[Page S2600]]\n\nput on this country's uniform and went anywhere in the world they were \nasked to go and fought for this country.\n  I told my colleagues previously about a wonderful veteran. I pinned a \nmedal on his pajama top one Sunday morning in a veterans hospital. He \nwas an American Indian who fought in Africa, fought in Normandy and \nacross Europe, came back and lived on the Indian reservation. He never \nhad much, had a tough life.\n  His sister said: Can you get my brother his medals? He never got his \nmedals from the World War II service. So I got his medals for him. He \nwas very sick with lung cancer. At the VA hospital one Sunday we \ncranked his bed up to a seating position, and I pinned the medals on \nEdmund Young Eagle's pajama top 7 days before he died of lung cancer. \nAnd Edmund Young Eagle said, ``This is one of the proudest days of my \nlife,'' because he served his country, and his country was saying thank \nyou for what he did for America.\n  He didn't have very much in his life, but he was proud in his \nservice. We have veterans coming back today, every day, who served in \nIraq. We have World War II veterans who are reaching that age now where \nthey need substantial health care help. At this very time we discover \nthere is not enough money for veterans health care.\n  I asked the Secretary of Defense the other day, What is the \ndifference between a soldier who is on active duty and a soldier who is \nnow off active duty, trying to cope with a leg that is gone or a \nshrapnel wound in the head? What is the difference between those \nsoldiers? They both fought for this country. There ought to be no \ndifference. They both represent the cost of war: the cost of a soldier \non active duty, or the cost of health care for a soldier who comes back \nand is now part of the health care system and needs some assistance.\n  The question is, What is our value system when we say as a country, \nveterans health care, that is not quite so important? That sort of gets \nshort shrift. It takes second place to, let's say, a tax cut. In fact, \nthis budget resolution says we need tax cuts more than we need to fully \nfund health care for veterans. What kind of a value system is that? \nWhose priorities are those?\n\n  Education--we all understand the value of education. This is more \nthan spending. This is an investment. Our future is what our kids will \nbe and what our kids allow America to become. So when we invest in \neducation we invest in America's future. When we decide there are \nthings more important than education, such as tax cuts for wealthy \nAmericans, we shortchange our country's future. Yet we are told there \nis not enough money to fully fund veterans health care. There is not \nenough money to fully fund education.\n  Law enforcement: we know the scourge of methamphetamine addiction and \nproduction in rural areas of the country. This budget cuts Byrne \ngrants, and the other programs that are so important for local law \nenforcement officials to wage this battle and make this fight. But we \nare told in this budget resolution we don't have enough money for that.\n  And family farming--these are America's economic all-stars. They are \nthe ones who get up in the morning under that yard light that was lit \nall night long over that farm family. They say: We are going to work \ntoday to try to grow some food, make that soil produce a crop and then \nsell that crop at the elevator to feed a hungry world.\n  We are told we now have to change the rules on the farm program. That \nwhich we promised farmers, for an ability to get over periods when we \nhave lower prices or tough times, we have to revoke that promise.\n  So these are the priorities in this budget resolution. We can't \nafford health care for veterans, education, law enforcement, \nagriculture.\n  Let's look at what they can afford. They can afford tax cuts. For \nexample, this budget resolution allows for the permanent repeal of the \nso-called death tax. There is no death tax. I don't know how you \npermanently repeal something that doesn't exist. My colleague, the \nformer Senator Gramm, and I had this debate on the floor before he \nleft. I said: God forbid you die, but when you do your wife will own \neverything you own. There will be no death tax. There is a 100-percent \nspousal exemption. So there is no death tax.\n  However, there is a tax on inherited wealth in this country. And the \nmajority party is intent on relieving this burden on the largest \nestates in this country. We have, by the way, one-half of the world's \nbillionaires living in our country. The major party is so intent on \nrelieving the tax burden on those multibillion-dollar estates, they are \nwilling to make that a higher priority than funding veterans health \ncare or funding education or funding law enforcement or funding family \nfarmers. Permanently repealing the estate tax is a higher priority for \nthem than doing all these things.\n  They do have a problem with the death tax, as they call it. They have \ncreated a Byzantine system which begins to phase out the tax on \ninherited wealth until the year 2010. Then in 2011, this tax on \ninherited wealth, or estate tax, is fully restored. So in 2010 tax on \ninherited wealth is completely repealed. Then in 2011 it is restored. \nOf course, no one understands that. It is one of the goofiest things \never done in this Chamber, but nonetheless it was done. So now they say \nthis budget resolution allows for the permanent repeal of the estate \ntax.\n  This resolution also allows for the extension of the lower tax rates \non capital gains and dividends. This is an interesting issue as well. \nIt is always a very popular subject around here, if you can reduce the \ntax on capital gains and other investment income. The President and the \nmajority party would like to have no tax on capital gains. In fact, \nthey would like to tax work and exempt all investment from tax.\n  Here is what Warren Buffet, the world's second richest man, said \nabout that issue in an op-ed piece that was published in the Washington \nPost some while ago. He described it in terms of his receptionist \nworking in his office. Mr. Buffet said that he, the world's second \nrichest man, and his receptionist paid about the same tax rate of 30 \npercent. She pays that high a rate because she pays a payroll tax on \nall of her earnings. He is one of the wealthiest people in the world. \nHe pays a mix of different taxes on his salary, capital gains and so \non. They each end up paying about a 30 percent tax rate, the world's \nsecond richest man and the receptionist who works in his office.\n\n  If the majority party and the President had their way, and we had a \ntax system that taxes work and exempts dividends, Mr. Buffett said: At \nthat point my receptionist will be paying a tax rate that is 10 times \nhigher than my tax rate. Warren Buffett said: My tax rate will be 3 \npercent, and my receptionist's tax rate will be 30 percent. The world's \nsecond richest man will pay a 3-percent tax rate, and the receptionist \nin his office will pay a 30-percent tax rate.\n  It is almost everything that is wrong with the philosophy of what is \nin this budget. I have told my colleagues often about a line from an \nold song by Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys in the 1930s: The little \nbee sucks the blossom, and the big bee gets the honey. The little guy \npicks the cotton, and the big guy gets the money.\n  It is right in the middle of this budget resolution: unburden the big \ninterests and burden the small interests. Give the big guy a break. \nGive the big guy a tax cut, and lay it on the shoulders of working \nAmericans.\n  In addition to the budget cuts I have just described, there are other \nthings that are omitted in this budget. For example, there is not \nsufficient money here for Iraq and Afghanistan. Despite the fact that \nCongress asked for that to be included, we now have before this Senate \nan $82 billion emergency request for Iraq and Afghanistan. We knew Iraq \nwas going to cost money. We are spending about $5 billion a month for \nongoing efforts in those two countries. I was here a year ago and said: \nLook, this should be part of the budget. Let's at least have some \nreasonable estimate of how much it will cost. Guess what they put in \nthe budget last year. Zero. Zero. So now we have an $82 billion \nemergency request before the Senate.\n  In the budget for the next year, what did the President have \nincluded? Zero. No money. Is this a budget game? And this gets paid \nhow? And the Committee mark includes just a token amount. Senator \nConrad talks about an amendment offered in the committee that\n\n[[Page S2601]]\n\nsays, maybe we ought to pay for this. If we are going to go to war, \nmaybe not just the soldiers should sacrifice; maybe the American people \nshould be behind them and pay for the costs of it.\n  No. God forbid in this Chamber we ask anyone to pay for it. In fact, \nwe will not even put a realistic amount of money in the resolution, let \nalone ask anyone to pay for it. We will have some amendments dealing \nwith that subject.\n  The President does ask in his budget and this proposal assumes some \nspending increases. For example, we need to build, they say, a new \nnuclear weapons earth-penetrating bunker buster. We did not have enough \nnuclear weapons? There are roughly 30,000 nuclear weapons in the world. \nWe do not have enough, someone says. We need to build a new designer \nnuclear weapon to penetrate bunkers. We need a penetrating bunker \nbuster nuclear weapon. What a foolish thing to be talking about. Our \ngoal ought to be to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, not talking \nabout building new nuclear weapons. Yet that is exactly what this \nbudget does. We do not have enough money for veterans health care, but \nwe have enough money to build new nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons we \ndo not need with money we do not have.\n  Of course, there are other areas of spending. Sometimes you can see \nthe broader picture by taking a look at some of the smaller issues. \nThere is one baffling to me. The administration proposes, and this \nbudget would fund, a doubling of the amount of money to broadcast \ntelevision signals to Cuba in something called Television Marti. It is \nours. We create television broadcasts and signals, and we send those \nsignals to Cuba to tell the Cuban people what democracy and freedom are \nreally like. Of course, they hear that every day on Miami radio \nstations but, nonetheless, we are telling the Cuban people with \ntelevision signals how great it is in our country.\n\n  There is one problem with that. The Cuban people cannot see the \nsignals. The signals are broadcast from 3 a.m. to 8 a.m., and Castro \njams the signals. So we have something called Fat Albert, which is an \naerostat balloon. At 20,000 feet on a big tether, it broadcasts \ntelevision signals to Cuba that the Cubans cannot see, and we will \nspend $10 million to do that. And guess what. The President--and this \nbudget--says that is not enough, let's double the funding. If the Cuban \npeople cannot see the signals now, let's double the funding.\n  It is not as if this budget brings some Spartan approach to spending. \nThere are some areas in the budget where we increase spending at the \nleast opportune time, especially this. We might as well dig a hole and \nthrow money in the hole and cover it up. Just throw money down a \nrathole. It does not make any sense at all, but they want to double the \nfunding. Do you know why? Instead of using Fat Albert and an aerostat \nballoon that got away from them once and they had to chase it down into \nthe Everglades, now they want to buy an $8 million airplane so they can \nbroadcast signals that Castro will jam so the American people will feel \nbetter, somehow, for having sent signals to Cuba that the Cuban people \ncannot see. Double the funding. We cannot afford veterans health care, \nbut, boy, there is no limit on what we want to do in building new \nnuclear weapons or building broadcast devices to the Cuban people that \nthe Cuban people can never see.\n  When we talk about spending, maybe we ought to talk about some of the \nsmall things that represent the message about larger issues and ask the \nquestion: Why is it you want to spend so much money on all the wrong \nthings?\n  My colleague, Senator Conrad, talked this morning about the long term \ndifficulty we have, and it is serious. I notice in the Newsweek \nMagazine this week ``The Incredible Shrinking Dollar'' is the cover \nstory. And then inside, on page 38:\n\n     . . . greenback's fall is stoking fears of a global crisis. \n     Behind the slide, a world economy wildly out of balance.\n\n  It says that if you have been following closely, you know that the \ndollar has been declining steadily against many foreign currencies. \nFrom recent highs, reached in mid 2001 or early 2002, the dollar has \ndropped 38 percent against the Euro, 23 percent against the yen, and 25 \npercent against the Canadian dollar. And then it goes on to explain at \ngreat length what the prospect could be:\n\n       Worst case scenario, foreign central banks and investors \n     might lose confidence in their dollar holdings, rush to sell \n     American stocks and bonds, consumer and business confidence \n     would drop, and a recession in the United States and abroad \n     might follow.\n\n  This is serious.\n  This year, just this year, we have a budget and a trade deficit that \nfar exceed $1 trillion. Far exceed $1 trillion. The combined trade \ndeficit is around $620 or $630 billion, but the merchandise trade \ndeficit is even higher, and you add to that the budget deficit, we have \na country that is seriously out of balance with respect to its fiscal \npolicies and its trade policies. You cannot hide it. The rest of the \nworld knows it.\n  It is not that the proposed resolution does not attempt to hide it. \nThis budget, incidentally, on page 5 and 4, brings us a 5-year \nprojection. Why? Why only 5 years? Do you know why? Because they want \nto tell us things are getting better when they know, and we know, if \nyou go out 10 years, which is what we have always looked at before, in \n10 years, this thing just blows out of sight--huge deficits, huge \nincreases in Federal debt. The fact is, because they hide it and don't \nprint it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. My colleague, Senator Conrad, \ndescribed at great length this morning the danger of that.\n\n  Let me talk about a couple of other issues. The Federal Reserve sits \ndown in this concrete bunker downtown with about $11.1 billion in \naccrued surplus account.\n  Let me say that again. The Federal Reserve system now has $11.1 \nbillion squirreled away in a rainy day fund, in case they might suffer \na loss. It is pretty hard to see how the Federal agency that creates \nmoney is ever going to lose money, but they have squirreled away about \n$11 billion just in case they do. This Congress has an obligation to \nsay to the Fed, enough of this. You don't need $11.1 billion squirreled \naway somewhere in the vault.\n  By the way, I won't go into Alan Greenspan at great length except to \nsay he has been one of the great enablers for the current fiscal policy \nbeing so widely out of balance. He is the man who stood up in 2001 at \nthe time many of us were cautioning--I know Senator Conrad was on the \nSenate floor--saying you can't see 10 years when there was a prediction \nof 10 years of robust budget surpluses, and saying maybe we ought to be \nconservative. Maybe you can't see 10 years, but let us at least slow \ndown a bit. The majority said no. President Bush said, no, we want big \ntax cuts right now locked in place for the long term. Mr. Greenspan, at \nthat propitious moment, weighed in the only way he could. He said: My \ngreatest concern is we are going to pay down the Federal debt too fast.\n  They need to change the air-vac system in his building. He says: My \nproblem is I worry they are going to pay down the debt too fast. Maybe \nhe ought to be asked now is that his problem? Because now from the \nlargest surpluses in the history of this country we have record \ndeficits and debt on a yearly basis. And I wonder what he is worried \nabout at the moment. Last week he was the enabler, once again. He came \nback to Capitol Hill and seemed to say: I kind of like these privatized \naccounts in Social Security.\n  He didn't highlight the point, of course, that it is going to cost \ntrillions of dollars of additional indebtedness.\n  I just come back to say that they have $11.1 billion squirreled away.\n  I say to my colleagues, Senator Conrad and Senator Gregg, maybe we \nought to take a look at that. I hope to do so by amendment.\n  Finally, I am going to offer an amendment during the deliberation on \nthe budget that asks us to vote one more time on an issue that ought to \nbe simple but one we can't seem to get passed through the Senate. Under \ncurrent law, we tell U.S. companies if you close your American \nmanufacturing plants, fire all the workers and move your production to \nChina, Sri Lanka, or Bangladesh, we will give you a big tax cut.\n  I previously offered on the floor of the Senate an amendment that is \nvery simple. It says if a company shuts down its American manufacturing \nplant and moves its manufacturing abroad and then sells those now \nforeign-made products back into America,\n\n[[Page S2602]]\n\nyou don't get what is called the deferral tax break. It is the most \nperverse tax break in our entire Tax Code.\n  If we can't take the first baby step to shut down the tax break that \nrewards companies for shipping U.S. jobs overseas, you can't do \nanything that is worthy in this Chamber, in my judgment. So we will \nvote on that amendment.\n  The last time we voted on it, 60 Senators said, no, we want to keep \nthe tax break that companies get when they ship U.S. jobs overseas. We \nbelieve that is a worthy thing to do.\n  I wonder if now, nearly a year later, they still think it is a worthy \nthing to do.\n  I might observe that none of them in dark blue suits have been among \nthe 2.7 million people who have lost their manufacturing jobs. No one \nin this Chamber has lost their job because of outsourcing. Maybe that \nis why there is not quite the urgency in this Chamber that there ought \nto be. If we can't take the first baby step to shut down this perverse \ntax break rewarding companies that ship American jobs overseas for the \nsole purpose of producing goods to be sent back into the American \nmarketplace, then we ought to hang our heads.\n\n  I think the question for this Congress is, Where is leadership?\n  I have described previously as well the John Adams book written by \nMcCullough in which John Adams would write back to Abigail as he was \ntraveling representing our country in England and France. He would \nplaintively write to Abigail: Where will the leadership come from to \nhelp put this new country of ours together? Where would the leadership \nemerge? Who will be the leaders to put together this new country?\n  Then, in the next letter, he would plaintively say: There is only us \nto provide leadership. There is Thomas Jefferson, there is George \nWashington, there is Ben Franklin, there is Mason, and there is \nMadison. There is only us.\n  Every generation of Americans ask the same questions. Who will be the \nleaders to help steer this country toward a better future and toward \nexpanded opportunities? Who will be those leaders?\n  I regret that this budget resolution provides no leadership at all on \nthe issues critical to our future.\n  I admit that both sides now talk about the long-term problems we \nhave. What is going on is unsustainable. Both sides have talked about \nthat.\n  But the majority that controls the White House, controls the House \nand controls the Senate continues to try to hide the seriousness of \nthat by bringing us budgets like this and then saying things are really \nlooking up. Things are getting better. They are not.\n  I ask anyone who wishes to know to go to page 5 and line 11. That is \nall you need to know. You don't need to know 10 numbers, or 5 numbers--\njust 1. In the year 2010, we will have a Federal debt of $11.1 \ntrillion. That is the only number you need to know. Is that number \nincreasing or decreasing? It is increasing rapidly. You know the \nnumber, you know the direction, and then draw your own conclusion. Are \nwe moving in the right direction, or do we need to make a U-turn? Are \nwe really a people who have decided that our highest priority is to \nprotect from taxation the assets of those who have made billions of \ndollars and who are now subject to an estate tax, a tax on inherited \nwealth? Is that a higher priority than helping veterans who need health \ncare? Is that a higher priority than helping little kids who are \nentering our classroom doors, than all of the other things we are \ntalking about? Do we really believe that?\n  That is exactly what this budget says.\n  This country will overcome this period. We will at some point have a \nfiscal policy that is thoughtful, in balance, and moving this country \nin the right direction. But it is not this fiscal policy.\n  My colleague, Senator Conrad, is prone to use a lot of charts. I have \nkidded him saying he is the only Member of the Senate who finds charts \nerotic. But charts are very useful to describe what is happening.\n  I think the chart that he used earlier today which is so important is \nthis chart. It shows the burden of indebtedness that the American \npeople will have to assume, unless we change course. I admit changing \ncourse is not easy. But we don't have many choices left.\n  About 4 years ago, we put in place a fiscal policy that I did not \nvote. I thought it was the wrong approach because I worried that things \nwould happen that we didn't anticipate; and they did--a recession, an \nattack on 9/11, a terrorist attack, a war in Afghanistan, and a war in \nIraq. And sure enough, those budget surpluses turned to budget \ndeficits. But that didn't seem to deter anybody on either side. They \nacted as if none of that happened, except to the extent they want to \nextract some mechanism to deal with it. They want to take it out of \nveterans, kids, and those kinds of priorities.\n  I think, again, when the question is asked by this generation of \nAmericans, Where will the leadership come from, it is not from the \nWhite House at this point, and it is not from those who control the \nHouse and the Senate.\n  My hope is that in the coming days we have the opportunity to cast \nvotes on these issues. We can consider a series of amendments, have \ndebate, vote, and begin to turn some of this around and begin to see if \nwe can't create an economy and create economic opportunity that will \nallow the rest of the world to look at this Congress and say they did \nsomething that finally recognized the dilemma we are in, and finally \nmade a U-turn to move in the right direction.\n  My colleague, the Senator from New Hampshire, has said that raising \ntaxes will not solve any problems. I don't know of anybody who is \ntalking about raising a lot of taxes, but I am talking about choices. \nDeciding that protecting the wealthiest Americans from a tax on \ninherited wealth is more important than dealing with veterans who \ndesperately need health care is a bad choice. I think it is a bad \npriority. It is not about raising taxes. We have every right to revisit \ntax cuts that were ill-advised.\n  I would like to have a longer debate, and I shall not do it now. But \nI would like to have a longer debate about the question of, Why do we \ndecide work has less value than investment? Why is it that this \nmajority decides they want to tax work and exempt investment? Is work \nless worthy? Why is it they want Warren Buffett to pay a tax that is \none-tenth the tax paid by the receptionist in his outer office? That is \nby his account. He does not agree with them, by the way. He does not \nthink they ought to do that. But that is exactly what they want to do.\n  It is about choices. It is about priorities. My hope is, at the end \nof the day, with amendments--I described a couple--we will be able to \ndramatically improve this budget document.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I assume the time is being allocated \nrelative to speakers by the side for which they are speaking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I will briefly comment on a couple of \nthings the Senator from North Dakota said. I agree with his view of the \ncharts of the senior Senator from North Dakota--or maybe he is the \njunior Senator; actually, I think he is the senior Senator; I never \nfigured it out because he took a year off and came back. But, in any \nevent, I agree with his view of the charts and I want to identify \nmyself with the Senator's thoughts on the Senator's charts.\n  Independent of that, the Senator got into quite a discussion about \nRadio Marti and how they wanted $8 million for a new plane and so on. \nWe are going to hear about a lot of amendments brought up on the floor \nwhich are targeted on specific discretionary spending activity the \nFederal Government is pursuing. They have no relevance to what is \nhappening here in this budget debate because the budget has no specific \nimpact on programmatic activity on the discretionary side. All we do as \na Budget Committee is send to the Appropriations Committee an upper-\nline number, in this case $843 billion, which becomes an enforceable \nnumber.\n  The Appropriations Committee then takes that number unilaterally, and \nI assure you with virtually no input from the Budget Committee, and \ndivides that between the different subcommittees in what is known as a \n302(b) allocation.\n\n[[Page S2603]]\n\n  The President sends up his proposal, which again we are not signing \non. This is not the President's budget. The President does not sign \nthis budget. We as a Congress do this budget. It is a resolution of the \nCongress. We have used the President's budget as an outline off of \nwhich to develop some of our positions, but the President's budget, \nagain, is a statement of where the President would go on these \nprograms.\n\n  The final decision on these programs is going to be made by the \ncommittee of jurisdiction, which will be the authorizing committee and \nthe subcommittees of the Appropriations Committee. All we do as a \nBudget Committee is say: You, Mr. Appropriations Committee, have this \namount of money to spend. You can allocate it wherever you want amongst \nyour different programmatic activities.\n  So for Members to come out here and offer a resolution to increase \nveterans funding or to increase funding for education or to increase \nfunding for highways, all that does as an amendment is raise the amount \nof spending which we do. It goes over the cap. There is no obligation \nunder such amendments for that money to be spent where the sponsors of \nthe amendment allege they are going to spend it. Not at all. There is \nno way to tie the hands of the appropriators or the authorizers, and \nthere should not be. That is their responsibility.\n  The point we make as a Budget Committee is that we give a top-line \nnumber, and then we expect, and we know, that the Appropriations \nCommittee and, to some extent, the authorizing committees, within that \nnumber will make their decisions as to how best to spend the money. You \nwill have a fight of priorities. And that is the way it should be.\n  But any amendment on this floor which says I am going to increase \nRadio Marti or I am going to increase veterans funding is actually an \namendment which is simply saying I am going to increase general \nspending of the Federal Government. I am going to raise that top line. \nI am not going to live by that cap. That cap doesn't work for me. I \nwant it to be higher. I want to spend more money. That is what that \namendment says. And it does not say that money is going to go to that \nprogram which they allege they want to spend more money.\n  I think this is an important point to make. I intend to make it over \nand over because we are going to hear amendment after amendment which \nis specific to some program and in which there will be no impact on \nthat program if it were to pass.\n  In the Budget Committee, there were offered about 13 different \namendments by the other side of the aisle, totaling about--more than 13 \namendments, but the amendments that spent money totaled up to about \n$229 billion. They would have raised the cap $229 billion. On the other \nside, they would have raised taxes by $240 billion or $250 billion. I \nlost track of how much money they were going to tax and spend. But not \none of those amendments would have had the practical effect of actually \nmoving money into the programmatic activity that they claimed it would \nhave gone into. It would have simply freed up money to go above the \ncap, except in the rare instances where those amendments were targeted \non reserve funds, in which case they are treated differently. But, \nagain, they would end up raising the cap in all those reserve fund \naccounts.\n  So it is important to understand what we are dealing with here as a \nbudget technically, which is that we are dealing with top-line numbers \non the discretionary side and the specific numbers that we give to the \ndifferent authorizing committees on the reconciliation side. The rest \nof it is a lot of good show and good press releases, but not a heck of \na lot more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, again, my colleague referred to what \nDemocrats offered in the committee. To be clear, we offered amendments \ncosting $217 billion. We offset that with revenue of $245 billion. But \none amendment alone of ours cost $197 billion. What was it? It was to \npay for the war. It was to pay for the war. Our friends' budget does \nnot pay for the war. They make believe there are no costs. We do not \nthink it is responsible, so we put the war cost in the budget, and we \npaid for it. That is fiscally responsible. That is exactly what a \nbudget is supposed to be about.\n  The President sent up a budget with no war cost past September 30 and \nsaid it is hard to estimate. Of course it is hard to estimate. That is \nwhat a budget is about. There is no family in America which leaves out \nthe utility bill because it is hard to estimate. There is no family in \nAmerica which leaves out the food cost because it is hard to estimate.\n  They leave out things. It is no wonder we are in deep deficit and a \nmassive increase in debt when they come with a budget and they leave \nthings out.\n  My colleague says the mark has no assumptions concerning \ndiscretionary policy, that all he is providing to the Appropriations \nCommittee is a budget authority total and an outlay total. It is true \nthat the budget resolution does not dictate policy decisions to the \nAppropriations Committee. However, it is also true that there are \npolicy assumptions embodied in the numbers. This is not just numbers on \na page. That is not what a budget is about. There are assumptions about \nhow you get to those numbers. And while it is true the Budget Committee \ncannot and does not dictate to the Appropriations Committee how they \nuse the money allocated to them, it is true there are assumptions \nbehind the budget.\n  As we look at the assumptions in this budget, we see a striking \nresemblance to those of the President's. Are we to assume it is a mere \ncoincidence that the chairman's mark is nearly identical to the \nPresident's request? Did that just somehow happen but it is not \nconnected to any policy recommendations? The President has made quite \nclear in his budget what he anticipates cutting and what he anticipates \nincreasing. In the budget offered by our colleagues in the Senate, the \nnumbers--the big numbers--are the same as the President's numbers.\n  Now, do they have the same assumptions or different assumptions? \nLook, I think we all know that they have carefully tracked the \nPresident's proposal. They have said that to us themselves. We also \nknow that at the end of the day the Budget Committee says this is the \namount of money available; that is it. When you get past that money, it \nis not going to be available.\n  The budget determines how much money is available for the \nAppropriations Committee to spend.\n  We don't dictate how they do it. We don't dictate how the Finance \nCommittee raises the money. We tell them how much money to raise. We \ntell them how much money they have to spend. But these numbers didn't \npop out of nowhere. They are based on assumptions of how much each of \nthe committees would get for all of the purposes contained in their \narea of responsibility. We know this budget is tightly linked to the \nPresident's budget. In fact, the numbers of spending are the same. \nThese amendments do send a clear signal on what the priorities are of \nthe Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to make one point. The Senator from \nNorth Dakota continues to return to the concept that this budget does \nnot account for the war. It is important to note that this budget \naccounts for the war in the year of the budget. This budget is a 2006 \nbudget. There is $50 billion of money put into a reserve fund for the \npurpose of paying for the war in the 2006 budget. The President's \nbudget didn't do that, but this budget does.\n  In my opening statement I explained why we decided not to go to the \n2007 number or the 2008 number, both of which are very difficult \nnumbers to reach, because this war is hopefully going to be winding \ndown by then and we can reduce the number significantly, and why we \ndidn't put it in the base, which would have been a mistake, because we \ndon't want to inflate the defense budget by an amount which should be a \none-time item which is the need to fight the war.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me respond briefly by saying, I \ncommend the Senator for putting $50 billion in his budget. I referred \nin my earlier remarks to the President's budget that had no money past \nSeptember 30 of this year for the war. In the Senator's budget, it is \ntrue, he has put in $50 billion\n\n[[Page S2604]]\n\nfor the coming year. But that is well short of what the Congressional \nBudget Office tells us is going to be necessary. The amendment we \noffered on our side in committee was to fully fund the war obligations \naccording to what the Congressional Budget Office has told us would be \nrequired.\n  Mr. President, I am happy to yield 20 minutes to my colleague, the \nSenator from Oregon, who is a valuable member of the Senate Budget \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized for 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  I come to the floor this afternoon to talk about the way this budget \ndeals with the fastest rising costs in America, and those are our \nmedical bills. I am going to talk about two areas--Medicaid, and the \nquestion of prescription drug coverage under Medicare.\n  I want to start by saying that regrettably in this budget, health \ncare is done wrong. It is set up in a way that we are going to regret, \nand we are going to regret greatly. I want to take a few minutes to \ntalk about why this budget gets it wrong on the health care issue. \nHealth care is so important because of the demographic changes with \nwhich we are faced.\n  First, with respect to the Medicaid program, the way I would describe \nthis Medicaid budget is hurt the poor now, talk about reform later. I \nsay this recognizing that I know that is not the intent of the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire. It is certainly not the \nintent of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Mike Leavitt, who \nI know means well. But regrettably, that is what is going to happen \nunder this Medicaid budget.\n  The distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, when he talks about \nMedicaid, constantly says: We are not cutting Medicaid. The Senator \nfrom New Hampshire is correct in saying he is not cutting Medicaid. But \nhe is certainly going to hold down the rate of growth in the program. \nSo the Senator from New Hampshire cuts the ability of State and local \ngovernments at a crucial time when they are getting more people \nenrolled because of the hardships in the economy and when there has \nbeen a failure to deal with the long-term care issue. These factors are \ndriving up the cost of Medicaid. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nright that this is about the rate of growth. But this budget is going \nto cut the ability of local governments and States and poor people to \npay for these medical costs at the very time when States are going to \nneed the dollars in order to deal with the increases in enrollment and \nthe fact that long-term care under Medicaid has not been dealt with.\n  In effect, what we are going to see is States and the poor get hit \nwith a double whammy. States and the poor are going to have fewer \ndollars while at the same time States will not get relief from some of \nthe bureaucratic water torture that is imposed on them.\n  My home State of Oregon is perhaps the leader in desiring to have \ninnovative approaches in Medicaid. Sometimes I jokingly say: I am a \nSenator from ``Waiver'', because my State consistently wants to waive \nout of the one-size-fits-all approach that is so often taken in health \ncare. Oregon has seen this kind of bureaucratic water torture in a lot \nof different ways as we have tried to deal with a tough economy and \nmaking changes in the Oregon Health Plan. We saw that very often when \nsomething innovative was done elsewhere, you couldn't even expedite \napproval to do that in Oregon or in other states. We see the bias \nagainst home and community-based services in Medicaid. I very much want \nto see the more flexible approach, the more innovative approach that \nlets the States be used as a laboratory for innovation in the health \ncare area.\n  But make no mistake about it: Under this budget there are going to be \nfewer dollars for the kinds of reforms and innovations that are badly \nneeded.\n  In effect, the real mistake in this budget with respect to Medicaid \nis it essentially says: Let's put the cuts in funds first before we go \nahead with reform. I and others have no dispute at all with the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire and colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle about the need for reform in Medicaid. There is no \nquestion about the fact that innovative approaches used in the private \nsector have not yet found their way into the Medicaid program.\n  What the dispute is about is that we think it is going to be harder \nto get the reforms, harder to get the innovations if you cut off the \ndollars to the States and the localities right at the time they are \nhaving increases in enrollment, at the time that long-term care has not \nbeen dealt with, and certainly make it less likely that they will have \nthe dollars they need to put in place the reforms.\n  Senator Corzine and Senator Rockefeller, others, and I will be, \nthrough the course of this week, seeking to improve this budget \nresolution as it relates to the Medicaid program, because regrettably a \nlot of poor people and a lot of States are going to get hurt now. The \ndiscussion about reform will come later. Under this particular budget, \nit is going to be hard to get in place some of the reforms that I and \nGovernors around the country, on a bipartisan basis, believe are \nnecessary.\n  The second area I would like to talk about as it relates to this \nbudget is the question of Medicare and prescription drugs. Where we are \nheaded now is the prospect that early in 2006, the Federal Government \nwill be spending a ton of money on a prescription drug program and \ncovering a very small number of people. That doesn't seem to me to be \nacceptable in this kind of belt-tightening climate and certainly is not \nacceptable with respect to the scarce use of Government resources. A \ngroup of Senators and I, on a bipartisan basis--Senators Snowe, McCain, \nFeingold, and others--have been seeking unsuccessfully to do what the \nSenator from New Hampshire has said he wanted, which is to find real \nsavings.\n  Here is what the Congressional Budget Office said. I see the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire here. I want to read to him the sentence \nspecifically from the Congressional Budget Office letter of March 3, \n2004.\n  Paraphrasing, the Congressional Budget Office said: Giving the \nSecretary an additional tool would put greater pressure on \nmanufacturers and could produce additional savings.\n  In March 2004, the Congressional Budget Office found, with respect to \nsingle-source drugs, there was the opportunity to have leverage like \nthe private sector has, and there would be some savings.\n  You are going to hear during the course of the week that there are no \nsavings. I hope my colleagues will look at the letter dated March 3, \n2004, from CBO that attests to the fact that they believe there is a \npotential for additional savings. Of course, this was the kind of \nconcern that motivated Tommy Thompson, in his last days as Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, to say he wished he had the power and clout \nthat the legislation I have authored with Senators Snowe, McCain, and \nothers, would provide.\n  I believe that if we are going to adhere to the suggestion of the \nSenator from New Hampshire that we put a real focus on additional \nsavings, we should not pass up the kind of opportunities that the \nprivate sector is using to generate savings, that Tommy Thompson said \nwould be an invaluable tool for him, and the CBO said in March 2004 \nwould provide the potential for additional savings.\n  I say to the Senator from New Hampshire that, with all of that \nevidence--the private sector, the Secretary, Congressional Budget \nOffice, and just plain common sense--nobody would shop for medicine the \nway Medicare is about to shop for medicine. I have compared it to the \nfellow standing in Price Club buying toilet paper one roll at a time, \nnot using bargaining power. Nobody in the private sector uses their \nshopping opportunities in that way, but that is where we are headed \nwith respect to the Federal Government. That is what I would like to \nchange.\n  Senator Snowe and I and others will be on the Senate floor during the \ncourse of the week. I am very hopeful that my colleagues will listen \ncarefully. At a minimum, I believe that giving this opportunity, \nparticularly as it relates to what are called the fallback plans and if \nthe private drug plans ask for help is important. For the life of me, I \ncannot figure out how this will do any harm. The Secretary would have \nthe discretion to make the decision as to whether to use this power\n\n[[Page S2605]]\n\noverall, but it certainly cannot do any harm to start the kind of smart \nshopping approach that goes on in the private sector every day. That is \nthe way timber companies do it, that is the way auto companies do it. \nEverybody says: Look, if you are buying something and you are going to \nbuy more of it, you ask the people for a discount for the additional \npurchases you are making. That is what Senator Snowe, Senator McCain, \nmyself, and others are going to seek to do.\n  I also hope that as we discuss this in the course of the week, \ncolleagues see that this will perhaps be the only vote in this Senate \non the question of prescription drug cost containment through \nbargaining power. If the Senate Finance Committee, on which I serve, \ndoesn't offer it as part of a piece of legislation coming through the \nFinance Committee, this could be the only opportunity for the Senate to \ngo on record with respect to pharmaceutical cost containment. I say to \nmy colleagues, when you go home and people ask you about the prices \nseniors are going to be paying for prescription drugs under Medicare--\nlook at the prices they are paying right now--I would not want to have \nto explain why I was against having the kind of bargaining power you \nsee in the private sector every single day. So when I come to the floor \nthis week with Senator Snowe and others, I hope colleagues will see--\nand maybe there are other ideas out there--that this will be the only \nopportunity perhaps this year to hold down the costs of prescription \ndrugs before the program is to be implemented next year.\n  So when colleagues open the newspaper and see that the cost of the \nprogram has gone from $400 billion to $500 billion and to $700 \nbillion--and I guess next we will hear about a trillion dollars--I hope \nthey will remember that when they vote on the Snowe-Wyden legislation \nin the course of the week. This is legislation that Tommy Thompson said \nhe wished he had, and CBO says it certainly has the potential to save \nfor single-source drugs, and that goes on in the private sector all the \ntime. The Secretary of Health and Human Services still will have \nsubstantial discretion under this legislation. So I hope colleagues \nwill look at it.\n\n  I also make the point, in closing, that this is not just removing \nwhat has been called the noninterference language. This goes beyond the \nso-called noninterference language and says that the Secretary would \nhave to respond when private plans say they need that additional tool, \nand for what are called fallback plans, where it is deemed that there \nis inadequate competition.\n  The question of health care is certainly going to be more important \nin the days and years ahead. It is going to be very important in the \ncontext of this budget because the proposal that deals with the \nMedicaid program is misguided. It cuts before it reforms. I believe \nthat is going to hurt the poor and it is going to hurt the States.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire will say--and will say correctly--that \nit is really not a cut; there is still going to be growth. But the \nbottom line is that it takes dollars out of the States and local \ngovernments to serve the poor when there is a time of increased \nenrollment and difficulties in paying for long-term care coverage. That \nis why it is wrong. In addition to the Medicaid part of the budget, the \nbudget does not address cost containment in Medicare prescription \ndrugs. I am very sad we were unable in the committee--on partisan vote, \nwe lost by 2 votes--to get some private sector bargaining power into \nthe Medicare prescription drug program at a time when the costs \ncontinue to escalate. Senator Snowe and I will be on the floor this \nweek about this.\n  I urge my colleagues to, as they consider this vote, recognize that \nthis, perhaps, will be the only opportunity in this session of the \nSenate to vote to contain the cost of the prescription drug program \nbefore it starts in 2006. I hope the Senate will heed the words of \nSecretary Thompson, who said in his last days in office he wished he \nhad this power. Under our bipartisan legislation there is an \nopportunity to respond when the private sector believes it needs \nadditional leverage. It is just common sense.\n  Unlike the concerns expressed earlier by the Senator from New \nHampshire, who was concerned about additional spending, this is going \nto be about deficit reduction. This is going to be about saving money \nin one of the fastest growing parts of the Federal budget. It is about \ngetting serious as we try to reign in the costs of health care that are \nescalating beyond those of any other in our society.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. Let \nme begin by congratulating the Senator from New Hampshire, chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, for the hard work he has put in, along with \nmembers of his committee, in crafting and getting a budget to the floor \nof the Senate and explaining in very clear and convincing terms not \nonly the state of the economy right now but the basis for the budget \nthat has been submitted. I compliment him for his hard work in that \nregard.\n  I am going to talk for a moment about the economic growth we have \nenjoyed in this country in the last couple of years and why I think \nthat economic growth has occurred and, to some extent, discuss some of \nthe ideas that have been propounded about increasing the tax rates that \nwe had earlier reduced in the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts of President Bush, \nwhich sunset, and they will be increased unless we extend those tax \ncuts.\n  In the budget that the chairman of the Budget Committee has \npresented, there is assumed an amount of money for tax reduction that \nis reconciled, and among that would be a couple of years' worth of \nextension of the tax cuts that we passed with respect to capital gains \nrates and the rate for taxing dividends. In both cases, we reduced the \namount of the tax to 15 percent. Both of those expire in the year 2008.\n  In addition, there are some other tax cuts that expire before then, \nand part of this budget assumes that those tax cuts will be extended \nthrough the life of this budget, which is 5 years or, in other words, \nthrough the end of the year 2010. The effect of that is to conform \nthose tax rate cuts with the other tax rate cuts on marginal income \ntaxes, for example, as well as the others that we extended last year so \nthat they would all expire at the same time. We already have at that \nsame time the estate tax being eliminated in the year 2010. So at least \nwe would be sending a couple strong signals as a result of adopting \nthis part of the budget that, No. 1, we believe in these tax cuts, and, \nNo. 2, that we have no intention of letting them expire.\n  The reason for that is we all want to have in place Government \npolicies that promote economic growth. We all know that the economy is \nneither created nor sustained by the Government. Sometimes the best we \ncan do is get the Government out of the way and let the entrepreneurial \nspirit of the American people provide the kind of growth we have come \nto enjoy. We know a growing economy increases not only opportunities \nfor Americans, provides better jobs, and improves our standard of \nliving, but it also does something else. From a Government standpoint, \nit helps to bring in more revenue to the Treasury because the more \nrobust the economy, the higher the taxes paid into the U.S. Government \nTreasury. So there are a lot of different reasons to have a robust \neconomy, not the least of which is to bring in more revenue to the \nTreasury.\n  We have created almost 3 million jobs since May of 2003, not even \nquite 2 years ago, at the time these tax cuts of 2003 were enacted. The \nGDP growth for 2004 was 4.4 percent, and real aftertax income was up by \nover 11 percent since the end of 2000. Household wealth is at\n\n[[Page S2606]]\n\nan all-time high. I just saw the statistics for my own State of \nArizona. Unemployment is 4.1 percent, and for my hometown of Phoenix, \nit has to be a whole lot less than that.\n  The bottom line is that all over this country, we are enjoying great \neconomic growth which has created opportunities for everyone. As I \nsaid, this comes from private economic activity, not the Government. It \nis the people of our country who undertake this activity. They either \nperform a service or they make something, and sometimes they lend and \ninvest money as well, which helps the economy, because they hope to \nmake money with their individual efforts.\n  We know if tax rates get too high, then people lose some of the \nincentive to work because the aftertax reward is worthless. In other \nwords, when the tax rate says if you work any more than this, the \nGovernment is going to take an increasingly large percent of your \nmoney, you do not work more than that. And when people work less, \nproductivity falls. That hurts economic growth and, ironically, it \ndecreases tax revenues to the Federal Treasury.\n  If governments raise taxes in an attempt to make up this shortfall, \nthe downward spiral is perpetuated because as you take more money out \nof the private sector, it has less money to generate the capital, the \njob creation, and the growth that we have come to expect, and, \ntherefore, the economy does not do as well. If it does not do as well, \nyou end up with less tax revenue coming to the Treasury.\n  So raising taxes may sound like a good idea in the short run, but in \nthe long run it not only hurts revenues to the Treasury, it hurts the \neconomy as a whole.\n  The best thing the Government can do is to support private economic \nactivity by minimizing Government constraints on productivity. \nAccording to economists, keeping tax rates low on work, savings, and \ninvestment is what generates sustained economic growth.\n  I have had the opportunity to meet a very interesting Arizonian. He \nis the 2004 winner of the Nobel Prize in economics, Dr. Edward \nPrescott. He is from Arizona State University. He has studied the \neffect of high tax rates on a person's willingness to work and found, \nnot surprisingly I think, that people do work less as tax rates on \nlabor increase.\n  It is a classic study of how high marginal tax rates; that is the tax \nrate imposed on a person's next dollar earned, cause people to actually \nwork less. When people work less, they are less productive. Less \nproductivity translates into less tax revenues for the Government.\n  If we stop and think about this for a moment, if one wanted to \nincrease taxes and bring in a lot of revenue, why they would set a tax \nrate of 100 percent. And what would happen if we had a tax rate of 100 \npercent on our income? Well, why work? All of it is going to be taken \nby the Government. The same thing is true if it is at 95 or 90 or 85 or \n80.\n  Some of the European countries, in particular the Scandinavian \ncountries, found this to be true. If taxes are raised too high, people \nsimply will not work because they are giving all of their money to the \ngovernment. It simply is not the case that more money is brought in by \nraising tax rates. This Nobel Prize winner found the exact opposite is \ntrue.\n  Similarly, savings and investment generate economic growth by giving \nbusinesses access to capital that they need to grow and invest in \ninnovation and to create more good-paying jobs.\n  The reduced tax rate on dividends and capital gains that I mentioned \nbefore encourages private individuals to let business use their money \nto help expand the economic pie.\n  There is an interesting argument that it is consumer spending that \ndrives economic growth, but the truth is that consumer spending alone, \nor even primarily, does not generate sustained economic growth because \nconsumers buy what has already been made, while economic growth \nrequires a provision of increasing amounts of goods and services.\n  Moreover, our society hardly has a problem with too little consumer \nspending. In fact, during the last recession consumer spending stayed \nvery strong at the same time that investment had fallen off very \nsharply. When investment was encouraged by reducing the tax rates on \ndividends and capital gains, investment rebounded and so did the \neconomy and job creation.\n  The economic downturn from which our economy has strongly rebounded \nnow is responsible for about half of our Federal budget deficit. Most \nof the remainder is a result of the spending proclivities of the \nCongress.\n  When taxpayers--and that includes both businesses and individuals--\nearn less money as a result of a recession, they owe less money in \ntaxes. So we can see the effect of the recession on Federal revenues. \nThey went down. The economy lost more than 900,000 jobs from December \n2000 to September 2001 and then lost almost another 900,000 jobs as a \nresult of the September 11 terrorist attacks. So these attacks, \ncombined with the collapse of investment following the tech bubble of \nthe late 1990s, as well as the high profile corporate corruption \nscandals that ensued, triggered a recession and resulted in a \nprecipitous drop in tax revenues which are now beginning to return to \nnormal levels.\n  At the current level of taxation, the average level of revenue to the \nTreasury will be achieved by the year 2010, which is the year through \nwhich this current budget goes. There is no reason then to modify the \ntax rates by causing them to go up in order to bring in more revenue. \nBy extending the 2001 and 2003 tax rate cuts through the year 2010, we \nwill be producing the average amount of revenue that has existed ever \nsince the end of World War II. So the suggestion that Congress repeal \nthe 2001 and 2003 tax cuts in order to alleviate the deficit would be \nthe economic equivalent of cutting off one's nose to spite one's face.\n\n  The economic activity encouraged by the tax cuts has pulled our \neconomy out of the recession, and we should not get rid of these \nsuccessful tax cuts to address an issue, namely the deficit, that is \nalready being addressed very effectively by the budget submitted by the \nBudget Committee, which will reduce the deficit to 1.3 percent of GDP \nby 2010.\n  The final point I address is why we should not use what is called \npay-go for policies that would end up hurting our economic growth by \napplying this so-called pay-go rule to the tax reductions called for in \nthe budget. To understand why it makes no sense to pay for tax \nreductions in the same way that it makes sense to pay for spending \nincreases, one has to look at how each affects the economy differently. \nPay-go, or the requirement that one offset a theoretical loss of \nrevenue on one hand with an increase in revenue on another to net out \nso that there is the same amount of money, pay-go for taxes is based on \ntwo false presumptions: first, that the money belongs to the Government \nand, second, that it must always be replaced and never reduced.\n  When we stop and think about it, that is a fairly ridiculous notion, \nthat there is only one level of income to the Government that is \nappropriate forever and ever. The correct presumptions are that the \nmoney belongs to the people who earn it in the first place in the \nprivate sector; and secondly, that taxes must be justified by their \ncost to the economy, which must be growing in order to produce \nrevenues. So it is not the cost to the Government revenues in the first \ninstance that is important. It is the cost to the economy which is what \nproduces those revenues that is important.\n  When Congress cuts taxes, it leaves the money in the private economy \nwhere it can be used most efficiently. It does not cost the Government \nanything to leave the money in the economy. In fact, as I discussed \nearlier, when Congress cuts tax rates, it restores some of the \nincentives for increased work and savings and investment in the \neconomy. So tax cuts such as these not only expand the economic pie for \neveryone, but they can also bring additional revenue into the Treasury.\n  There are two recent examples that demonstrate this effect. \nHistorical analysis of revenues to the Treasury from capital gains \ndemonstrates that revenues to the Treasury increased when the tax rates \nare cut. There are three reasons that a reduction in the capital gains \ntax rate tends to increase tax revenues. First, the unlocking effect, \nwhich expands the tax base, because realizations increase in response\n\n[[Page S2607]]\n\nto the lower tax rate. An investor might have been reluctant to sell \nstock or land or whatever it might be that had appreciated \nsignificantly in value because of the tax that would have to be paid at \nthat time. When the tax rate is cut, the investors are then able to \ndecide, hey, the tax rate is cut. I will not have to pay as much in \ntaxes. I will go ahead and sell this stock or this piece of land and \nrealize my gain and have to pay less on it. So it is the unlocking \neffect.\n  Secondly, more efficient decisions by investors. When tax rates are \nlow and constant, fewer investors will avoid selling stocks purely for \ntax reasons, making their investment decisions much more efficient and \nsensible. This is related to the unlocking effect but also has to do \nwith investors paying less attention to tax considerations in the first \nplace, which is how we would like to have the Tax Code operate.\n  Finally, an increase in the value of existing assets. When capital \ngains taxes are lowered, the value of existing assets necessarily \nincreases. Tax revenue rises as owners of stock pay taxes on the higher \nvalue of their assets when realized.\n  So for all three reasons, one can actually see there is an increase \nin revenue to the Treasury as a result of reducing the rate at which \ncapital gains are taxed.\n  The recent progrowth tax cuts have actually increased revenues to the \nTreasury. This is because, as the economy grows, people in businesses \nhave more income on which to pay more taxes, even if they are paying \nlower rates. How do we know this is true? In the second half of 2004, \nindividual income tax revenue was up 10.5 percent compared to the same \nperiod in 2003. So the evidence is there.\n  Now, why should pay-go not apply to tax cuts but apply to Government \nspending? As I said, if Congress raises taxes to offset tax cuts, it \nbasically cancels out the benefit of economic effects by not leaving on \nnet any additional money in the private economy where it can be used to \nexpand the economic pie. So if the whole point is to allow more money \nto stay in the private sector, the point is totally defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. You totally defeat the point, if you have to replace the \nrevenue by taking it out of the economy somewhere else, if you have to \nreplace it in the Federal Treasury. So it makes no sense to put more \nmoney back in up here and then be required to take it out down here.\n  But the exact opposite is the case with respect to Government \nspending because it takes money out of the private economy, if you are \ngoing to finance that spending. Taking resources out of the private \neconomy hurts economic growth because these resources could be used \nmore efficiently by private actors than the Government. So if Congress \nraises marginal tax rates to finance the spending, it will hurt the \neconomy even more by reducing beneficial incentives to work and save \nand invest. But with respect to spending, pay-go makes every bit of \nsense in the world. If Congress increases Government spending in one \narea and then pays for it by reducing Government spending in another \narea, Congress has not taken resources, net resources from the private \neconomy, alleviating at least some of the negative economic effects of \nexcess Government spending. And by not further adding to the deficit, \nCongress is acting more responsibly with taxpayer dollars that it does \ncollect.\n  So the bottom line is that pay-go makes absolutely no sense with \nrespect to tax cuts, the whole point of which is to leave more revenue \nin the private sector. It makes every bit of sense with respect to \nspending increases because there your whole point is to try to keep \nspending level. So if you increase it in one area, obviously you need \nto cut it by a like amount in another area, thus the so-called pay-go.\n  I hope these remarks help to make the point that we have a great and \nrobust economy, and that we can sustain that growth by the sensible \npolicies that are embodied in the budget that has been presented by the \nBudget Committee. I certainly encourage my colleagues, as this debate \nunfolds, to appreciate the arguments that we have made today and to \nsupport the budget that has been submitted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time? The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself one-half-hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 30 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Americans are a strong and generous \npeople, but this is a weak and selfish budget. It gives more to those \nwho already have the most and further deprives those who have the \nleast. It gives the rich and powerful what they want while denying our \nfamilies, our communities, our Nation what they need.\n  Our national budget should reflect the generosity of spirit and the \ncommitment to fairness and opportunity that characterizes the American \npeople. Instead, this budget lacks the courage of American convictions. \nIt betrays our most fundamental beliefs as a nation. As religious \nleaders of many faiths wrote Congress, this budget turns its back on \nour Nation's oldest and most enduring values of compassion, justice, \nand honesty. It demands an unequal sacrifice and so is unworthy of who \nwe are as children of God.\n  As Americans, we are known for our rugged individualism. We are \nstirred, even today, by the heroic images of pioneers pushing westward \nto build new lives for themselves and their families. But we are also \ngood neighbors. The settlers traveled to the West in wagon trains \nbecause they knew that the survival of their families depended on \nstrong communities working together for the common good. They lived by \nthe Golden Rule, not only as a moral mandate but as a necessity. That \nis our American heritage, neighbor helping neighbor, all of us \ncontributing to our communities and to our Nation to make us stronger.\n  But this budget turns its back on those values. It assumes that \nAmericans are selfish, that they prefer more tax breaks for wealthy \nindividuals than greater opportunity for everyone. It assumes that \nAmericans are selfish, by cutting back on access to higher education \nand training instead of enhancing our strength and competitiveness so \nthat more of our citizens can fulfill the American dream in the global \neconomy. It assumes that Americans are selfish, by increasing \ninvestments in defense without also increasing our commitment to \nreducing child poverty in America. It assumes that Americans are \nselfish, by borrowing billions more each year from Social Security to \ncover President Bush's distorted priorities instead of paying back the \ntrillions of dollars that the White House has already taken from Social \nSecurity to pay for its tax breaks for the wealthy and the \ncorporations.\n\n  It assumes that Americans are selfish by providing $70 billion more \nin tax breaks, primarily benefitting the wealthiest taxpayers, while \ncutting billions from Medicaid that would go to provide health care for \nour poorest citizens. The tax cuts on dividend and capital gains income \nprovided for in this budget will give billionaires an average annual \ntax break of over $35,000 while families with incomes under $50,000 \nwill receive only $6 per year in tax savings. To assure continuing \nopportunity for our citizens, we must strengthen our commitment to \neducation and health care. Without these commitments we weaken the \nAmerican middle class, and the challenge of poverty will continue to \ngrow.\n  In just the past 4 years, middle-class families have seen their \nhealth insurance premiums jump 59 percent, college tuition rising some \n35 percent, housing going up some 33 percent, and gasoline up 22 \npercent.\n  At the same time, their jobs, the middle class jobs, are being \nshipped overseas and the new jobs created in today's economy make it \nharder and harder to provide for their families and plan for their \nfuture. The newer jobs provide lower wages, less health care, and fewer \nopportunities to save for a good retirement.\n  The answer to this challenge is not to lower our wages but to raise \nour skills. We must invest more in education and job training.\n  Just a week ago we had the debate on the floor of the United States \nSenate\n\n[[Page S2608]]\n\nabout increasing the minimum wage. We thank all of our colleagues on \nthis side of the aisle for voting for it, and thank the handful of \nthose on the other side voting for an increase in the minimum wage. \nBritain has now raised its minimum wage to $9.75 an hour, and it will \nbe $10.29 an hour in the year 2006. It has seen a decline in \nunemployment, a steadying of its inflation rate, and has moved over a \nmillion children out of poverty.\n  Nonetheless, we refuse to give hard-working Americans an increase in \ntheir minimum wage at a time when those who have opposed our minimum \nwage are talking about more tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals \nin the dividend tax rate they are going to propose in this budget. A \nweek hasn't even gone by since they said no to those interested in a \nraise in the minimum wage, and it is yes to those who are going to get \na nice tax break.\n  When it comes to equipping our citizens for job opportunities for the \nfuture, this budget actually cuts back on our national commitment to \neducation for the first time in a decade. The cuts in education over \nthe next 5 years will total over $40 billion.\n  Look at this chart, ``The Proposed Education and Training Budget.'' \n``Cumulative Cut of $40 Billion Over the Next 5 Years.''\n  The United States responded to the challenge of the Industrial \nRevolution by developing our high schools. Then came World War II, and \nwhat was our response? We had the GI bill. What the figures show is \nthat every dollar that was invested in those veterans of the greatest \ngeneration was returned sevenfold into the Federal Treasury.\n  Then we were faced with the sputniks in 1957. What did we do, cut \nback on education? Cut back on training? Absolutely not. We went from \nabout 2 cents out of our Federal dollar to 5 cents out of our Federal \ndollar. Now we are in a downward spiral in terms of supporting \neducation over the period of the next 5 years. This is cumulative some \n$40 billion. We ought to be investing in our young people, providing \nthem with continuing education and providing them with continuing \nskills. This budget cuts back on education and cuts back on the skills.\n  This chart reflects this budget that is before the Senate. They are \nadvocating increased tax breaks for wealthy individuals, and this chart \nindicates where those tax breaks are going to come from.\n\n  I have shown in the past these budget cuts in a favorite proposal, No \nChild Left Behind. We will hear from the other side: We have increased \nit 20, 30, 40 percent over a period of years. But these are the number \nof children who are going to be left behind in the Bush budget that is \nbefore us at the present time. Don't ask those of us who are opposed to \nthis budget, who think it doesn't reflect the best of our national \npriorities. Go and ask the head master at your local school. Go ask \nyour school board. Go ask your teachers. Go visit the classrooms. Find \nthe overcrowded classrooms. Ask your children if they are being \nchallenged, whether they are getting the supplementary services? They \nwill tell you they are not.\n  It is amazing. When we passed the No Child Left Behind, we thought \nincluded in that legislation was that at the end of 12 years every \nchild in America was supposed to be proficient. That is in the \nlegislation. Every child in America was supposed to be proficient. How \nare we going to have every child in America proficient when you are \nleaving out almost half them a year when we are supposed to have the No \nChild Left Behind?\n  When we passed Social Security, we didn't say we are going to leave \nout 20 or 30 percent; we said all seniors are going to be eligible. \nWhen we passed Medicare, we didn't say we are going to just do it for \n80 percent or 70 percent; we said it is all Americans.\n  I liken this to if President Kennedy said we are going to go to the \nMoon and we went to the Moon and left the astronauts there. Included in \ngoing to the Moon was getting the astronauts back down. Not in the No \nChild Left Behind. We are leaving out all of these children. This \nbudget continues it.\n  Again, money isn't the only answer in education, but it is a pretty \nclear reflection of what a Nation's priorities are. In this \nlegislation, we are cutting back on student loans. Tiny increases to \nthe Pell grants will mean college is still less affordable next year \nfor 673,000 young Americans. Cuts are out there in the Gear-Up Program, \nin the TRIO Program, Upward Bound Programs--initiatives that will open \nup college doors for millions of young Americans--cuts in vocational \neducation, cuts in adult education. Cuts in job training means that \nmillions of our citizens will be unable to obtain the jobs they need to \nprovide for their families and their communities.\n  Just look at what is happening now in America. This is the national \naverage of what is happening in our schools across the country. Out of \nevery 100 ninth graders, 68 of these 100 will graduate from high \nschool. Out of every 100 ninth graders, 40 of them will enroll in \ncollege, and 27 will stay enrolled as a sophomore. Out of the 100 ninth \ngraders, 18 will graduate on time. This is what is happening in the \nUnited States of America with K-12.\n  We don't say we have all the answers, but we have some. We know you \nhave to have a well-trained teacher in the classroom. We know you have \nto have a small enough classroom so the teacher can teach the children. \nYou know you have to have parental involvement. You know you have to be \nable to test children to find out why they are falling a little bit \nbehind so you can get them supplementary services so they can catch up. \nWe know what needs to be done. You have to give some of those limited \nEnglish speaking students some additional help. You have to be \nsensitive to the needs of special needs children.\n  We know what needs to be done, but this is what is happening now in \nthe United States of America. What does this budget do about it? \nVirtually nothing. It cuts back on further support. The Bingaman \namendment addresses this issue and provides some help and relief in \nterms of the children.\n  We will come back to the issues on education, but I want to say \nanother word about what this budget does with regard to Medicaid, which \nis a lifeline for 50 million poor women, children, elderly, and the \ndisabled. In fact, a third of all newborns in America and their mothers \nrely on Medicaid for care.\n  The Republican Party and the Bush administration say they are for a \nculture of life, but this action makes that an empty claim. Cutting \nMedicaid is one of the most damaging actions to a culture of life any \nadministration could take. This budget fails to reduce by a single \nperson the 45 million Americans who are without health insurance today. \nThe number is growing when it should be a high priority for Congress \nand the administration to ensure that no American goes without adequate \nhealth care.\n  I don't know about the rest of our colleagues, but when I travel \naround my State of Massachusetts, people say: What in the world are you \ndoing in the Senate in terms of health care, coverage, and cost, and \nthe cost of prescription drugs? When are you going to deal with it? You \nare taking care of the large corporate interests with your class action \nbill, and you have taken care of the credit card companies with the \nbankruptcy bill. Now you are considering a budget that is cutting back \non the education and cutting back on the lifeline to many of the \nneediest people in our society and cutting back on Medicaid. It cuts \nback on children, it cuts back on the disabled, and it cuts back on the \ndisabled who have been wounded, actually, in Iraq. They will depend \nupon the Medicaid Program because of their disability, and this program \nis being cut back. Still we see these reductions.\n\n  This budget freezes the fund for health research at the National \nInstitutes of Health. We are in the period of a life science century \nwith what we have seen in terms of mapping of the human genome, the \nsequencing of the gene, all of the possibilities that are out there at \nthe present time, unlimited possibilities. If we saw the potential cure \nfor Alzheimer's, we would empty two-thirds of the nursing home beds in \nmy State of Massachusetts. We are at the brink of that. What does this \nbudget do? It cuts back on those kinds of possibilities. It makes no \nsense whatsoever.\n  It cuts back on our commitment for disease prevention, for \ncontrolling the flu, the epidemics, minority health care, for \nchildren's hospitals. We are training the pediatricians--this budget\n\n[[Page S2609]]\n\ncuts back in that support. It cuts back in rural hospitals, the \ntraining for nursing, and the bioterrorism preparedness.\n  We worked in the area of bioterror preparedness to get our homeland \nsecurity--to be able to detect it. We need to get support for the \npublic health services and contain it. That is where you need the \nhospitals and the teams to be able to do it. You have to build up that \ninfrastructure in order to be able to retain it, and you have to be \nable to treat the people affected by it. What we have seen in this \nlegislation is the reduction in terms of those extremely important \nelements in our battle to deal with bioterrorism.\n  I thank the budget chair and the ranking members for including a \nprovision in this reserve fund for using information technology that \nmay be very helpful to us in terms of getting a handle on the issue of \nhealth care and health care costs, and also for the work that was done \nwith regard to the pension system which we are dealing with at the \npresent time.\n  I believe this budget fails the basic test of fairness and equity for \nthe American people. It certainly does with regard to the education \nprograms in this country.\n  I want to add a word of strong support for the Bingaman amendment \nwhich we will be considering very shortly, particularly the aspects of \nthe Bingaman amendment that relate to school dropouts.\n  Dropout prevention is such an incredibly important program. We have \nareas in the country where we have as high as 30 or 40 percent in \ndropouts. That program has effectively been eliminated. The champion \nfor that dropout prevention program is the Senator from New Mexico. I \nadmire his perseverance and his commitment. Where we have dropout \nprevention programs, it makes a great deal of difference in keeping \nchildren in school rather than having them drop out into a life that \nlacks meaning and purpose. He has made this effort not only in the \ndropout program but also in the Gear-Up and in the TRIO Program.\n  Let me mention very quickly what the Gear-Up Program really says.\n  About 82 or 83 percent of our children in Boston are participating in \nthe Gear-Up Program, which takes a whole class of children of the \ncities, and ties them, in effect, to our schools and our universities \nand our colleges of higher learning. We bring the colleges and the \nstudents together by the classes to provide help and assistance to the \nclass itself, so the class has a sense that it is moving along and \nmoving along together. It has had an extremely important and \nsignificant result. It has had a very important impact and result on \nthe children that are part of the whole class that is moving up, to \nthink that there are other children or young people and students who \nare in colleges that will work with them, spend time, volunteer, work \nwith them on whatever their particular needs are.\n  And it has had a dramatic impact on children in college who have \nbenefited, who have a sense of what it means to get back to these \nstudents.\n  Nonetheless, we see those programs--the Gear-Up Program and the TRIO \nProgram--heavily undermined. The Bingaman amendment provides extremely \nimportant help and assistance.\n  Finally, on the education. We passed last week, under the excellent \ndirection of our friend and colleague Senator Enzi, the career and \ntechnical program Perkins legislation, which had such extraordinary \nsupport in providing skills to individuals. The graduates in my State, \neven though we have one of the highest unemployment rates of any of the \nindustrial States, are in excess of 90 percent. It has been that way \nfor a very significant period of time. Better than 90 percent are \npassing the general academic tests. These young people are getting good \nacademic training and are acquiring skills which are necessary in the \nnew economy.\n  What are we saying to them? After we have a vote in the Senate of 99 \nto 0--not a single vote in opposition--we are effectively undermining \nthat program in a dramatic way. The Bingaman amendment addressed that.\n  Before this budget debate is completed, I intend to offer an \namendment that puts this Nation on the road and on the pathway of \neliminating child poverty in this Nation. Let me show where we are with \nchild poverty. The United States has the highest child poverty rate in \nthe industrial world at the present time. It has grown over the last 3 \nyears to an absolutely unacceptable rate. Over the last 3 years, the \nnumber of children now in poverty has grown by 1.3 million. This is \ncompletely unacceptable for this Nation.\n  This chart shows one in five American children now live in poverty. \nIt is particularly endemic in terms of the national average now at 18 \npercent; 30 percent Latino, 34 percent for African Americans.\n  The children are much more likely to live in poverty than adults or \nthe elderly. Adults 18 to 61, 11 percent; seniors 65 and older, 10 \npercent; children 18 years and under is 18 percent. This is a matter of \nnational urgency. It is a matter of national disgrace.\n  I intend to offer an amendment for a 1-percent surtax on the taxes \nbeing paid by millionaires to be designated to battle the problems of \nchild poverty in this Nation, with the goal of cutting it in half in \nthe next 10 years. We will have an opportunity to do that.\n  I thank Members on our side, the Senator from North Dakota and our \ncolleagues, for raising many of the issues on health and education in \nthe course of the discussion and debate. Hopefully, some of these \namendments will be favorably considered. If a budget is to reflect a \nnation's priorities, this budget needs a great deal of strengthening. I \nlook forward to the debate and, hopefully, to the acceptance of some of \nthese amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I will briefly respond to a couple of \npoints raised by two of the prior speakers, the Senator from Oregon and \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, relative to the Medicaid issue. It is \ncritical to understand this issue in the context of Medicaid spending \ngenerally and more importantly in the context of the type of reform \nbeing proposed here by the President and through the President's lead \ncounsel and promoter on this, Governor Leavitt, the former Governor of \nUtah, now head of HHS.\n  One would think from listening to the other side, especially the \nSenator from Oregon and the Senator from Massachusetts, that we were \ncreating a scorched-earth policy against all poor children in America \nby initiating some sort of Medicaid reform. The hyperbole is rather \nexcessive and does not comport with the numbers or with the actual \nproposal.\n  This chart reflects the rate of growth of Medicaid over the next few \nyears on an annualized basis. Today we spend $191 billion in Medicaid. \nUnder the proposal being put forward, we will spend $256 billion on \nMedicaid in the year 2007. That compares with the projected rate of \ngrowth of Medicaid of $260 billion for Medicaid. In other words, over a \n5-year period, the actual reduction in rate of growth will be almost \nnegligible by the terms of what the Federal Government looks at \nrelative to numbers. It is obviously a big number, but it is still not, \ncompared to the overall number, a large number. In fact, it is about 1 \npercent in the reduction of the rate of growth. To cite the numbers \nagain, over the next 5 years we will spend $1.12 trillion on Medicaid.\n  The President has suggested we try to find $14 billion, that we \nrestrain that rate of growth by $14 billion, which means a 1-percent \nreduction in the rate of growth, which is hardly dramatic and certainly \nnot scorched earth, to say the least.\n  Members can only accept that type of hyperbole if you are not willing \nto accept the facts of what has actually occurred. That rate of growth \nwill therefore be a 39-percent rate of growth over this period of time \ncompared with what would have been a 40-percent rate of growth had we \nnot made this reduction in the rate of growth. Hardly dramatic in terms \nof the overall context of either the program or the Federal budget, but \nanyone would think it was devastating.\n  To make this type of an adjustment, are we going to have to impact \nprograms for children? No. Are we going to have to impact programs for \nsenior citizens who want to go in nursing homes and who are poor? No, \nwe do not have to impact either of those. There are at least seven or \neight elements of the Medicaid Program that, working with the \nGovernors, we could change which would significantly improve the\n\n[[Page S2610]]\n\ndelivery of service and, at the same time, reduce the rate of growth of \nMedicaid to come up with these numbers.\n  Right at the top--everyone is familiar with it--is intergovernmental \ntransfer taxes. Basically, what has happened for the last 12 years is \nthat States have used Medicaid money through an intergovernmental \ntransfer tax where they essentially spend money on the nursing home, \nthey send Federal money to the nursing home, tax the nursing home, take \nthe money from the nursing home, leave the nursing homes with a small \npercentage of what they were actually paid under the Federal program, \ntake the balance off--sometimes 90 percent of it--put it into the \ngeneral funds operation of the State and then run back to the nursing \nhome another small percentage so that in the end the State government \nuses 80 or 90 percent of these funds for general operation accounts, \nfor running the State government, but not for helping people who are on \nthe Medicaid system. That is a game that has been played.\n  Every Governor knew 5 years ago this process was going to come to an \nend. And, in fact, there was a glidepath set up under the Clinton \nadministration because the Clinton administration had about the same \nfrustrations with this approach as the Bush administration did, a \nglidepath for basically weaning the States from this process of using \nMedicaid money for general operations accounts.\n  That glidepath was supposed to end about 2 years ago, maybe 3 years \nago now. It did not. It has continued to bump along this process of \ntaking money from Medicaid to fund general operations. This \nadministration is suggesting we put an end to it. It may not be the \napproach the administration takes, but if it were to take that \napproach, that would be $5.5 billion potentially of the $14 billion \nnumber.\n  One of the other approaches which might be considered would be to \nlimit the Medicaid pharmaceutical reimbursement to the average sales \nprice plus some percent, say 6 percent. That is a reasonable approach, \nbasically saying you cannot pay more for pharmaceuticals than the \naverage price being paid out there plus some percentage. That would \nsave $5.2 billion. So you already have over $10.2 billion worth of \nsavings if you took those two. And you don't have to take those two \nbecause there are about six more.\n  You can close the loophole that permits managed care organizations to \navoid Medicaid rules. That is about a $1.2 billion number. That is not \ngoing to hurt anybody out there other than the folks who have been \ngaming the system, again, the insurers in this case, through managed \ncare systems.\n  You could permit States to require additional copays. That is also a \nreasonable approach, quite honestly, because there are a lot of folks \nout there who could afford additional copays. It would be up to the \nStates to set that policy. That would save significant amounts, \nprobably $2, $3 billion.\n  You could give States greater flexibility to allow them to use SCHIP \nto apply their benefit structure around. This issue of flexibility \ncould actually, in this case, end up expanding coverage to many more \nkids while still probably saving the States money, depending on how the \nStates manage this. That could be a significant savings.\n  There are literally, as I mentioned, 7, 8, maybe 10 different \nproposals out there which would get you the $14 billion without having \nany impact at all--any impact at all--on the number of kids covered by \nMedicaid or the number of people going into nursing homes, other than \nmaybe expanding the numbers, because you have given Governors more \nflexibility with the dollars they will presently have. And most \nGovernors will use it more efficiently and create more money.\n  One other issue I think Governors would like to address and could \naddress is this whole situation of gaming the system. A lot of people \nare spending down. You can go on a Web site, especially in Florida, and \nyou can see where they will tell you how to get rid of your assets so \nyou can become a ward of the Federal Government and your assets are \npassed on to somebody else who happens to be a friend or family member, \nwhich is hardly fair to the rest of the taxpayers in this country who \nare then going to have to take care of you because you have decided to \ngame the system with a spend-down proposal.\n  So the programmatic activity is clearly available. And how is this \ngoing to be approached? Well, essentially, we have suggested this $14 \nbillion number. To put it in context, here is a chart that shows the \n$1.1 trillion that is going to be spent over the next 5 years. Here is \nthe $14 billion. You can't see it on the chart because it is a very \nsmall line, but that number would be what we would ask the Finance \nCommittee to reduce in the rate of growth of spending in the Federal \nMedicaid account. So they drop from 40 percent to 39 percent over the \nnext 5 years.\n\n  To reach that number, how are they going to do it? I don't know how \nthey are going to do it. But in meeting with Governors and in meeting \nwith Governor Leavitt, it became very clear that there is, I believe, a \nwillingness to develop a consensus as to how to approach this issue, \nand there is a genuine desire to do it. There is a genuine desire to \naccomplish this.\n  I suspect that before the Finance Committee marks up--and we actually \nput some flexibility on timing here relative to reconciliation so the \nFinance Committee will have time to work with the Governors--there will \nbe a consensus position amongst many of the Governors, hopefully \nbipartisan--I suspect it might be bipartisan--as to how to set up this \nprogrammatic activity necessary to restrain the rate of growth in \nMedicaid and still deliver more services to more kids and more elderly \nwho are moving into nursing homes. This will mean that although this \nbill states a number, it does not set the policy, but the policy will \ninstead be set working in conjunction with the Governors, with Governor \nLeavitt leading the effort, and then working with the Finance \nCommittee.\n  But why is the number so important? Why is it so important to have a \nreconciliation instruction rather than virtually saying to the Finance \nCommittee, go ahead, you take care of this, you can do it on your own? \nWell, it is so important because without a number to drive the process, \nwithout a reconciliation instruction driving the process, nothing is \ngoing to happen. That is the nature of the beast. That is what happens. \nIf we do not have some forcing mechanism, some catalyst to get \neverybody in a room together to say, well, we better do something \nbecause we have to act, nothing is going to happen.\n  Equally important, obviously, anything such as Medicaid reform is \ngoing to be very hard to get 60 votes on because there are a lot of \nfolks around here who tend to be scared of their own shadow and don't \nwant to vote on something that is going to put them in a position where \nthey would actually have to make a reduction in the rate of growth of \nspending of anything, especially Medicaid. So it is critical to get to \nwhere we need to go. It will first be the catalyst which energizes the \nGovernors coming together--they already are coming together, but it \nactually energizes an agreement, I believe. And it will give the \nFinance Committee the necessary guidance.\n  Why is this so important? Well, I return to the chart that is the \nessence of the argument around this debate of this budget, which is, \nwhat are we going to do about the outyear crises which we are facing as \na nation? What are we going to do about the fact that our generation, \nwhen it retires, is going to have placed such a huge demand on our \nchildren that they simply are not going to be able to afford the decent \nlifestyle we have?\n  This chart puts it in stark terms. The Senator from North Dakota has \na lot of charts that appear to be stark, but this is a truly stark \nchart because it makes it very clear that these three elements of the \nFederal Government--Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security, the three \nretirement elements--will be unaffordable and will make the Federal \nGovernment inoperable within about 20 years from now unless we start to \naddress it.\n  I wish Medicare were on the table. It is not. And maybe next year we \ncan do that. But we are transitioning into a new Medicare system with \nthe Part D drug program and people did not want to take on that issue \nright at this time. And I hope Social Security will be discussed at \nsome point by the Senate and we will act on that. But that cannot be \ndone by the budget because the budget does not have that authority.\n\n[[Page S2611]]\n\n  That leaves us one more option, one place where we can actually make \na conscientious effort to try to get something going in the area of \naddressing the outyear costs of this Nation, and that is Medicaid. That \nis why every time somebody comes to this floor and talks about how this \nMedicaid number is inappropriate and is going to have a dastardly \neffect on some poor and suffering population, I am going to rise and \npoint out that is a lot of baloney, that the simple fact is the numbers \npoint out just the opposite.\n  This is a very small restraint in the rate of growth of one of the \nthree most critical programs we have in the area of entitlements. All \nthe restraint which is proposed in this reconciliation instruction can \nbe accomplished by addressing the provider groups and addressing better \nmanagement of the system and addressing the fact that States have been \ngaming the system.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 142\n\n  Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request. I send a technical \namendment to the desk. This has been agreed to on both sides. I ask \nthat the amendment be agreed to by unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 142) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 142\n\n(Purpose: To make technical corrections in the printing of S. Con. Res. \n                                  18)\n\n       On page 8, line 14, strike the amount $491,526,000,000 and \n     insert $491,562,000,000. On page 30, line 17, strike the \n     amount $70,154,000 and insert $70,154,000,000.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I believe I have some time left. Do I? I \nask if I would be able to have 3 minutes. I don't think I used all my \ntime. Perhaps I yielded it back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator was originally allotted 30 minutes \nand had 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask to reclaim 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would ask my friend and colleague from \nNorth Dakota--we heard about how plush the Medicaid Program is and that \nthere are no alternatives left. It is my understanding in this \nparticular proposal there is a $70 billion tax cut. Am I correct, there \nis approximately $70 billion that will be included in this budget?\n  So there are questions of priorities, that there will be $70 billion \nin tax cuts at a time when we are listening to those talking about the \npressures that are on the States in terms of Medicaid. I am wondering \nwhether the Senator would agree with me that we have seen a loss of \nhealth insurance for 5 million American workers, a growth in poverty \namong children--nearly three quarters of a million more children fell \ninto poverty between 2002 and 2003, and 4 million more Americans fell \ninto poverty in the last four years, and the States are hard pressed. \nWould the Senator not agree with me that all of us are strongly against \nthe kind of asset protection frauds that take place? That isn't what we \nare talking about here. My understanding of this is that there are \ngoing to be some real cuts for people and real benefits for people. I \nwas interested in what the Senator from North Dakota felt about these \npriorities.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator is correct on both counts. No. \n1, there is $70 billion of tax cuts that are in this budget before us; \nthat is, net tax cuts. Ironic, given the fact that we are running \nrecord budget deficits. Secondly, with respect to Medicaid, the two \ndrivers that are very adversely affecting Medicaid are, No. 1, we have \nhad millions of additional people come into the system, so the number \nof people who are dependent on Medicaid is growing dramatically. Of \ncourse, as the Senator well knows, medical inflation is running much \nhigher than the underlying rate of inflation. That has put enormous \npressure on the Medicaid program.\n  It is also fair to say it is undeniable that there are people who are \nengaged in spend-down schemes to reduce their assets so they qualify \nfor Medicaid. That is also putting pressure on the overall circumstance \nwe face. We have had, between 2000 and 2003, 8.4 million new \nenrollments in Medicaid. That is because, as the Senator so well knows, \nof the economic downturn. The recession meant millions of additional \npeople were pushed onto the Medicaid rolls. That has put enormous \npressure on spending.\n  We also have the hard reality, as I mentioned this morning, of the \nUnited States not being able to pay its bills. We face an incredible \nchallenge going forward with respect to Medicare. In fact, the \nshortfall in Medicare is many times the shortfall in Social Security. I \nindicated this morning, the shortfall in Medicare is eight times the \nshortfall in Social Security.\n  I wanted to talk a little bit about the Social Security problem \nbecause we are going to be addressing that a lot. One of the things \nthat gets too little attention is the underlying assumption about \nSocial Security. The forecast for economic growth that is the basis for \nthe concern about Social Security is a very low rate of economic growth \nover the next 75 years. They are projecting a rate of economic growth \nof about 1.8 to 1.9 percent. Economic growth over the previous 75 years \nwas 3.4 percent.\n  One of the major components of economic growth is productivity \ngrowth. This chart shows the Social Security actuaries are assuming \nproductivity growth at this red line. They are assuming productivity \ngrowth of 1.6 percent for the next 75 years. Yet in recent years, we \nhave been getting much higher rates of productivity growth than their \nestimates. You can see in 2000 to 2004, the productivity growth has \nbeen in the range of 3.6 percent.\n  It is important for people to know that the underlying assumptions \nabout a problem in Social Security assume quite pessimistic views of \neconomic growth, and of course productivity growth is one of the \ncentral components of economic growth going forward. The actuaries are \nassuming over the next 75 years productivity growth of 1.6 percent, \nwhen in the most recent 4 years we have had productivity growth of more \nthan double that amount.\n\n  Here is the problem we face with Social Security, and we face this \nproblem with Medicare and, to an extent, we face it with Medicaid as \nwell. This is the number of Social Security beneficiaries who are going \nto retire. Currently we are at about 40 million beneficiaries. As this \nchart shows, that number is going to grow dramatically to over 81 \nmillion by 2050. It is this demographic bulge that is putting enormous \npressure on the Social Security Program, Medicare Program, the Medicaid \nProgram, and what makes the overall budget circumstance utterly \nunsustainable.\n  Curiously enough, the President acknowledges we have a shortfall in \nSocial Security of $3.7 trillion. But in his budget, the first thing he \ndoes is take another $2.5 trillion out of Social Security over the next \n10 years. I want to be clear about this. The President says we have a \nshortfall in Social Security. He is right. The estimates are widely put \nat $3.7 trillion over the next 75 years. Again, that is based on a very \npessimistic forecast of economic growth, much lower economic growth for \nthe next 75 years than we have had over the previous 75 years.\n  The President's first move is to take all the money that is available \nto take out of Social Security over the next decade, $2.5 trillion \nworth, something he had promised not to do. So he is making the problem \nmuch worse.\n  In fact, when the President submitted his budget in 2002, he said:\n\n       None of the Social Security surplus will be used to fund \n     other spending initiatives or tax relief.\n\n  Now let's look at what he is doing. He is doing precisely the \nopposite. He is taking every penny of Social Security money that is \navailable and using it to pay for other things. Over the next 10 years, \nfrom 2006 to 2015, here are the Social Security surpluses during that \nperiod. I use the word ``surpluses'' advisedly because it is really not \nsurplus. It is a temporary surplus. There is more money coming in from \nthe Social Security trust fund than is going out in each of these years \nfor the next 10 years, $184 billion in 2006 income over and above \noutgo. That builds up by 2015 to a $300 billion surplus in Social \nSecurity. That is, we are getting more revenue than we are spending in \nbenefits.\n\n[[Page S2612]]\n\n  Under the President's budget and under the budget that has been \nsubmitted by our colleagues, every penny of this money is being used to \npay for other things, every penny of it, instead of being used to \nprepay the liability or pay down the debt to better position us to meet \nthe promise of Social Security. Instead, under the President's plan, he \nis taking all of it, $2.5 trillion, and using it to pay for other \nthings.\n  When the President says there is a shortfall in Social Security of \n$3.7 trillion, again that is based on an assumption. The assumption is \nthe economy is going to grow at about 1.8 or 1.9 percent every year for \nthe next 75 years.\n  In the previous 75 years, the economy has grown at 3.4 percent. So \nthis is a very pessimistic forecast. But using that forecast, the \nshortfall of Social Security over 75 years is $3.7 trillion. Over the \nsame period, the cost of the President's tax cuts is much more--$11.6 \ntrillion. So I hope that helps to put this in some perspective for \nthose who are listening.\n  The President's answer is to, first of all, cut the benefits \ndramatically. He proposes moving from an indexing of the benefits from \na so-called wage indexing to price indexing. The benefit reductions \nthat flow from that decision are the following: Those retiring in 2022 \nwould see a 10-percent reduction; in 2042, a 26-percent reduction; in \n2075, almost a 50-percent reduction. So that is what happens to those \nfolks.\n  Then there is another part of the President's proposal that deserves \nattention, and it has gotten virtually none. That is the offset \nprovision. The way the offset provision works is quite unusual. Under \nthe President's plan, if you set aside money for your private account--\nlet's say you set aside, over 40 years, $1,000 a year. That account \nbalance assumes a real rate of return of 3.7 percent. Real rate of \nreturn is rate of return plus inflation. The rate of return is 6.5 \npercent. The loan is compounded at a 5.8-percent nominal rate. To put \nit in plain English, say you put aside $1,000 a year and you get a 6.5-\npercent rate of return during that period. At the end of the period, \nyou would have $92,000 in your account in today's dollars. But that is \nnot yours free and clear under the President's plan, because they \nassume the Social Security trust fund loaned you that money. They want \nto get paid back and they want to get paid back with interest. So when \nyou hear the President say that is your account, you got your name on \nit, nobody can take it away from you, that is true as far as it goes. \nBut it leaves out a very important fact. The very important fact it \nleaves out is that you owe the money--underlying money, the thousand \ndollars a year plus interest--you owe it back. But you don't pay it \nback out of your individual account. You pay it back out of your other \nSocial Security benefits. Under this scenario, where you have put aside \n$1,000 a year and you have gotten a 6.5-percent rate of return, you \nwould owe back $1,000 plus the real rate of return of 3 percent, or \nroughly 5.8 percent, including inflation. So you would owe back \n$78,000--not out of your individual account, but out of your already \nreduced Social Security benefits.\n  I have never heard the President describe it this way, but I have \ngone over his plan in great detail with his people and that is how it \nworks.\n  Let me give you another possibility, because you know this is \nassuming--the first chart here--a 6.5-percent rate of return. What if \nyou don't get that good a rate? What if you get a lower rate than 6.5 \npercent on your investment? Under the President's plan, workers earning \n5 percent must repay 120 percent of the value of their individual \naccounts. I know that sounds unbelievable, but that is the way it \nworks, because they are making an assumption that the money that went \ninto your individual account was loaned to you by the Social Security \ntrust fund; they expect to be paid back and they expect to be paid back \nwith interest. Whether you made money on your account or not, they are \nexpecting you to be paying back the money that was theoretically loaned \nto you, plus interest. So in this case, let's assume you put $1,000 a \nyear aside in your account, and that your account only got a 5-percent \nrate of return. At the end of the period, you would have $64,000 in \nyour account, but you would owe back $78,000 because they are expecting \nthat thousand dollars a year back, plus interest. They are expecting a \nreal rate of return--3 percent plus inflation--roughly 5.8-percent rate \nof return on what you have to pay back.\n  Now, I want to go through this again because I don't think a lot of \npeople understand that is how these private accounts work. I hope it is \nclear to people from looking at this, you could wind up owing back more \nthan you have in your account. OK. Let's go over it one more time so \nthat people have a chance to see how this works.\n  Under the President's plan, you are able to put aside $1,000 a year \ninto your account. You are able to earn a return on that. In this \nexample, over a 30-year period, if you set aside $1,000 a year and you \nhave a 6.5-percent rate of return, you would have $92,000 in your \naccount in today's dollars. But, remember, you have to pay back what \nwas theoretically loaned to you from the Social Security trust fund. \nYou have to pay back the $1,000 a year, plus interest. The interest \nthat they are expecting to get back is 5.8 percent. So you owe back, \nunder this example, $78,000 in today's dollars. Again, you don't pay it \nout of your individual account or your personal account; you owe it \nback out of your traditional Social Security benefits.\n  I am going to conclude on this example. I see the leader is here. I \nwant to make sure we go to him next. He has a lot of other things to \ndo.\n  In this example, let's say you only earned 5 percent a year for 30 \nyears. Actually, this example is over 40 years. If you only earned 5 \npercent a year, you would have $64,000 in your account, but you would \nowe back $78,000--again, not out of your personal account, but out of \nyour already reduced Social Security benefits. So I think it is very \nimportant for people to understand how this works.\n  The final point I will make is, at the very time the trust funds of \nSocial Security and Medicare go cash negative, the cost of the \nPresident's tax cuts explodes. Remember, he is making these tax cuts \npermanent. The cost increases dramatically over time. What this chart \nshows is the green bars, which are the Social Security trust fund, \nrunning, as we described, surpluses now. The blue bar is the Medicare \ntrust fund. When those go cash negative out here, at that time, the \ncost of the President's tax cuts explodes, driving us right over a \ncliff into huge deficit and debt.\n  This is a plan that does not add up. It does not make sense and it \nfundamentally threatens the economic security of the country.\n  I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today, we begin a critical and important \ndebate on the Federal budget. We will be on that debate over the course \nof the week. I know it will be a good debate and a spirited debate, as \nit has been over the course of the day. The budget blueprint we adopt \nin the Senate will guide all of our spending and tax legislation for \nthe remainder of the first session of the 109th Congress. It is \nabsolutely critical that we pass this resolution before we leave at the \nend of the week and that we stay on track to have a conference \nagreement with the House of Representatives following the Easter recess \nperiod.\n  I do want to begin by congratulating the chairman of the Senate \nBudget Committee, Senator Gregg, and his committee members for bringing \nforth before the entire Senate today this resolution. This is Senator \nGregg's first budget resolution as chairman, and having been a member \nof the Budget Committee and working with Senators Conrad, Nickles, and \nDomenici in the past, I know what a difficult challenge, indeed a \nstruggle, it can be to put together the budget. It is a hard task. It \nis a thankless task in many ways. But in record time the chairman has \nsucceeded in reporting a budget to this body.\n  I also thank the ranking member, Senator Conrad, and the Democratic \nmembers of the committee. While I know Senator Conrad and his \ncolleagues do not support the resolution as it is today, I thank him \nand members for cooperating and allowing this process to proceed so we \ncan begin this important task and begin the debate, as I mentioned \nearlier, that will be\n\n[[Page S2613]]\n\nspirited and will be important and substantive over the course of the \nday and the next several days.\n  We, as elected representatives of our respective States, do have a \nresponsibility to our constituents, to the Members of our delegations \nand, indeed, to the country to govern. Governing requires budgeting, \nand budgeting is governing. Households and families across the country \nknow when they sit down and do their own budgets that many times their \nwants go much further and much larger than what revenues and resources \nthey might have. What will play out here over the course of this week, \nI believe, in our Federal budget is really no different than what \nindividual families and households must do--many times seeing that our \nwants go much further than our resources.\n  The first President Bush captured this in his inaugural address when \nhe noted:\n\n       Our country's will is often greater than our wallet.\n\n  So, yes, budgeting requires tough decisions, difficult decisions, and \nmany times unpopular decisions. Budgeting not only requires allocating \nthose limited resources in ways that address the real threats we face \ntoday, but also the challenges we inevitably will face tomorrow. It \nrequires allocating those resources on programs that are needed today \nand away from those unneeded, those unnecessary programs from the past. \nIt is a matter of prioritizing.\n  Budgeting requires allocating the taxpayers' dollars in the most \neffective and the most efficient ways possible, while recognizing that \nnot everything in the Federal Government today, in terms of the funding \nthe Federal Government does today, has to be funded tomorrow. Budgeting \ndoes require making choices, it requires making tradeoffs, and it \nrequires making sacrifices.\n  The budget resolution that Chairman Gregg's committee has brought \nbefore the Senate does set priorities and does make those difficult \ntradeoffs. The budget resolution before us today for some does not do \nenough, and for others it does too much. For some, it reduces the rate \nof Government spending too much, and for others it simply does not \nreduce it enough. For some, it reduces taxes too much; for others, it \ndoes not reduce taxes enough.\n  There are several things this budget does accomplish.\n  The budget, first and foremost, cuts the deficit in half within the \nnext 5 years. The Federal deficit is projected to decline from nearly \n$400 billion this year to nearly $200 billion 5 years from now, from \n3.2 percent of our economy to 1.3 percent over this 5-year period.\n  The budget resolution we debate does allocate resources to winning \nthe war on terrorism, providing the necessary support for our military \nmen and women overseas. It is an honest budget in that it accounts for \nthe $82 billion war on terror supplemental for this year that we will \nbe debating just after the next recess, and it sets aside $50 billion \nfor next year to continue, if needed, funding for the war.\n  The budget resolution does make the difficult and hard decision to \nlimit the growth of spending in other areas of the budget, and for that \narea of the budget annually appropriated for nondefense programs, this \nbudget is tough, essentially freezing that area of the budget next year \nand beyond. By setting priorities and not funding unneeded and \ninefficient programs as identified in the administration's program \nassessment and rating tool, called PART, education, HIV/AIDS, highways, \nhealth research, and other high-priority programs could receive \nincreased funding even within the overall restraint imposed.\n\n  This budget resolution for the first time in almost a decade also \ntackles that area of the budget known as entitlements. Entitlements \nwill consume nearly $7.7 trillion over the next 5 years. Some will \nargue that by restraining entitlement spending $34 billion over the \nnext 5 years, it does not do enough in this area of the budget that \nwill, and I repeat, consume $7.7 trillion over this same period of \ntime. What is in this budget amounts to about a 0.4-percent reduction. \nOthers will say it does too much. It is a balance. It is a beginning in \nan area that has been too long neglected.\n  Finally, this budget resolution does make room for the extension of \nexpiring tax provisions. It is projected that the Federal Government \nwill collect over $12.5 trillion in taxes over the next 5 years. \nExtending tax provisions that promote a growing economy, reducing taxes \nby $70 billion--and that is about 0.5 percent of the total collected \nover the next 5 years--is a small investment for maintaining and \ncontinuing our growing economy.\n  Let me be clear about one other thing. For those who might be \nwatching the debate this week, this is a congressional budget. Yes, it \nreflects the principles outlined by President Bush in his executive \nbudget submitted to Congress a little over a month ago, but what we \nwill be debating this week is the congressional budget resolution, not \nthe executive budget. It is ours, it is this body's to mold and adjust \nas we reflect on our responsibilities to govern and to make those what \nwe know will be difficult tradeoffs.\n  It is also the beginning of the congressional budget process. It is \nnot the end. We will not be appropriating moneys in this resolution for \nspecific programs, but we will be saying how much of our resources \nshould be devoted to annually appropriated programs.\n  We will not be dictating specific policies to reduce entitlement \nspending, such as Medicaid, farm programs, or student loans, but we \nwill be saying that it is time for Congress to lessen the overall \ngrowth of these programs that threaten our fiscal future.\n  We will not be writing the tax bill this week in this resolution, but \nwe will be saying to the tax-writing committees: You have the authority \nto extend expiring tax provisions or make other changes in tax laws to \ncontinue to support economic growth in the future.\n  The budget resolution is a broad outline of what this Congress thinks \nshould be the level of spending, the level of revenues, and the level \nof deficits or surpluses over the next 5 years. It is not substantive \nlaw, but once adopted it will guide substantive law for the remainder \nof this session. Once adopted, it will become the blueprint upon which \nour fiscal house is built throughout the spring and summer.\n  In closing, over the 30 years that the Congressional Budget and \nImpoundment Control Act has been in existence, Congress has failed only \nthree times to agree to a budget resolution. Only once in that 30-year \nhistory did the Senate not even consider a budget resolution. \nUnfortunately, two of those three times that we failed to adopt a \nbudget resolution have been in the last 4 years--in 2001 and then again \nlast year. Once it happened under Democratic control, and once it \nhappened under Republican control. Yes, we patched together in those \nyears ways to have some fiscal guidelines on the appropriations \nprocess, but other critically important, other vital elements of the \ncongressional budget process were simply lost. They were unavailable.\n  This budget resolution will restore those needed enforcement \nprovisions. Agreeing to a budget is becoming a more challenging event \nevery year. But I ask, are the issues that we confront at home and \naround the world today so much more challenging than they were when \nPresident Carter faced a daunting energy crisis at home? Or when \nPresident Reagan confronted the Soviet Union and won the Cold War? Or \nwhen President Bush faced a brutal dictator invading the neighbor \nKuwait? Or when President Clinton observed in late 1998 that we then \nhad a historic opportunity to save Social Security for the 21st \ncentury?\n  In all those years, we confronted major challenges, but we still \nworked within the framework of a budget. It is our responsibility to \ngovern. It is our responsibility to produce a budget. It is our \nresponsibility to move America forward. I do not expect that this year \nwill be any easier than in the recent past, but I am confident that for \nthe sake of this institution and the congressional budget process, we \nwill do the most basic of our responsibilities this year--produce a \nbudget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I will take a couple of brief minutes to \nrespond to the leader and indicate that the problem I see is the words \ncontinue to be good, but the words are almost totally divorced from the \nreality of this budget. The longer I am here, the\n\n[[Page S2614]]\n\nmore stunned I am at what a gap there is between rhetoric and reality.\n  The rhetoric is all about fiscal responsibility and restraint, but \nthat is not what this budget does. That has almost no connection to \nthis budget.\n  What am I talking about? I am talking about going back and looking at \nwhat this budget is doing and adding back the costs it has omitted. The \nmajority leader talked about the $80 billion of the supplemental it has \nfor the war. Yes, it does. Unlike the President, he has no money for \nthe war past September 30. At least this budget has $50 billion in a \nreserve fund for the war, but nothing beyond that.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says that is not the cost of the war. \nThe cost of the war is over $380 billion, not $130 billion. There is a \n$250 billion difference. Well, if we put that back in and we put back \nin the alternative minimum tax that costs $700 billion to fix, there is \nnot a dime in this budget to do it. We all know it is going to have to \nbe done. Three million people were affected last year. Ten years from \nnow it is going to be 40 million people. Does anybody believe we are \nnot going to do anything?\n  Last year, the President at least said, here is the money for 1 year. \nNow he has nothing. This budget from our colleagues has nothing. The \n$700 billion is left out. I said to the President's people when they \nshowed me this budget, why did you not leave out some more things and \nclaim you balanced the budget?\n  They said they are going to cut the deficit in half. They are going \nto cut the deficit in half by imagining. They are going to cut the \ndeficit in half by leaving things out. When we put back the Social \nSecurity money that they are taking, $2.5 trillion that they do not \ncount, here is what one sees: Operating deficits every year approaching \n$600 billion.\n\n  Somebody out there may be saying, well, that is Senator Conrad. He is \nfrom the other side. He is the loyal opposition. He is giving his view \nof it.\n  No, it is not just my view of it, this is their own budget document. \nLooking at their own budget document, this is what it shows. This is \ntheir projection of what the debt will increase by every year of this \nbudget. This is a copy of their budget document, page 5. Here is what \nit shows. This is their estimate of how much the debt is going to \nincrease every year if their budget is adopted.\n  Remember what the words were that we just heard. He said the deficit \nis going to get cut in half over the next 5 years. Is that not what he \nsaid? Did he not say he is going to cut the deficit in half over the \nnext 5 years?\n  Well, here is what their budget document says is going to happen. \nThey say the debt is going to increase in 2006 by $636 billion. This \nyear, they say it is going to increase by $669 billion, then $636 \nbillion, then $624 billion, then $622 billion, $611 billion. Does one \nsee it getting cut in half? Where is it getting cut in half?\n  They are talking about a deficit projection that leaves out things. \nWhen the things are put back that are left out, the amount that is \ngetting added to the debt every year is not getting cut in half. It is \nhardly being cut at all. This is their budget document.\n  In this town, words seem to matter more than reality. If the deficit \nis going down, how can it be the debt is going up so fast? Could it be \nsomething is being left out?\n  Here is what has happened to the debt: $3.3 trillion in 2001, headed \nfor $9.4 trillion in 2015. This debt is going up like a scalded cat. \nAnd that is the publicly held debt. Here is the gross debt: $5.8 \ntrillion in 2001. We are headed for $15.8 trillion in 2015, all at the \nworst possible time, right before the baby boomers retire.\n  They can put any characterization they want on this budget. They can \nuse any words they want. They can talk about fiscal restraint and \ngetting serious about the deficit. The numbers do not lie. The numbers \nin their own budget show the debt going up $600 billion a year every \nyear of this budget. Those are their numbers. So when they say they are \ncutting the deficit in half and they are being fiscally responsible, it \nis all words, but it is totally detached from the reality of this \ndocument, and it is totally detached from the reality of this budget \nbecause their own numbers show--and I will go back to it. This is their \ndocument out of their budget. They say the debt is going to go up $669 \nbillion, and then the next year it is going to go up $636 billion, and \nthen the next year it is going to go up $624 billion, and then the next \nyear $622 billion, and the next year $611 billion. Where is the deficit \ngetting cut in half?\n  These are not my numbers. These are their numbers in their budget \ndocument. None of this adds up. Running massive budget deficits, \nrunning massive trade deficits, $600 billion a year of trade deficits, \nwe are borrowing money all over the world.\n  Foreign borrowing by this President has gone up 92 percent. We had a \ntrillion dollars of foreign holdings of our debt in the first 200 years \nof this country. Under this President, in 4 years it has gone up almost \n100 percent. As a result, we owe Japan over $700 billion. We owe China \nalmost $200 billion. We even owe South Korea $69 billion. So what? What \ndifference does it make? The difference it makes we have seen twice in \nthe last 2 months. We saw South Korea announce they were going to \ndiversify out of dollar-denominated securities. The stock market went \ndown 170 points in a day. The dollar went down sharply. Then, just a \nweek ago, the head of Japan said they are going to diversify out of \ndollar-denominated securities. The dollar took another big hit. The \ndollar is down 33 percent against the Euro in the last 2.5 years. Is \nanybody watching? Is anybody paying attention? Does anybody care? Does \nanybody understand the consequences of the risks that are being run \nhere, of massive deficits, of massive debt, of massive borrowing from \ncountries all around the world that makes us more and more vulnerable \nto decisions they make in their central banks, and the warning signs?\n\n  First South Korea says: Boy, I don't know about holding all these \ndollars. These dollars keep going down in value. Why should we hold \nonto them? Maybe we should get into some other currency.\n  The head of Japan says: Boy, this is risky business. I don't know if \nwe should keep doing this.\n  Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors in the world, \nsays he is betting against the dollar in 2005. Last year, he made a \n$300 million bet against the U.S. currency, and he made a lot of money \non that bet. This is risky business.\n  I indicated the last few weeks I talked with somebody who, last year, \nhad been at the annual meeting of one of the most wealthy families in \nAmerica. They told him they are getting ready to diversify out of \ndollar-denominated securities because of these massive deficits that \nare being run and the risks of a run on the dollar. This budget just \ncontinues that risky strategy.\n  I see the Senator from New Mexico is here. I yield 20 minutes off the \nresolution to the Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 143\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] for himself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n     Harkin, and Mr. Obama, proposes an amendment numbered 143.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Madam President, the amendment I have sent to the desk \nrelates to the level of funding in this budget for education. It \nproposes to restore the funding level to the level we are currently \noperating under here in 2005, so that in 2006 we would have as much \nFederal funding going out for education as we had in 2005. We would not \nhave any more. We would not have enough to account for additional \ninflation. We would not have enough to account for additional students, \nchildren coming into the school system. But we would have the same \namount if my amendment is adopted.\n  The budget resolution before us embraces and adopts the worst \neducation budget the country has seen for well over 10 years. Writing \nbudgets is about setting priorities. Anyone who reads this budget must \nconclude that education is not a priority for this Congress or for \nanyone who supports this budget. Simply put, the budget proposal before \nus does not provide sufficient funding to sustain current funding \nlevels in many education programs. In title I, in IDEA, it provides no \nsignificant increases in funding. There is really no funding provided \nfor the new initiatives which had been talked about by the \nadministration. The resolution adopts the President's budget and, by \nimplication, it endorses the cuts the President has called for.\n  The budget would eliminate 48 educational programs and would \ndrastically cut funding for several other programs. My amendment, as I \nsaid before, would merely restore the $4.8 billion in funding for these \nprograms. It also provides for deficit reduction as part of the same \namendment.\n  In December of 2001, there were 87 of us here in the Senate who voted \nin support of No Child Left Behind. I was one of those. We recognized \nthere was an unacceptable achievement gap in this country between low-\nincome students and more affluent students, or students of more \naffluent families. So, with broad bipartisan support, we decided to \nhold schools accountable for the academic achievement of all students, \nbut we did so with the recognition that the Federal Government was \nobligated to support these reforms and to implement them wisely. On a \nbipartisan basis we calculated what it would cost for States and \nschools to implement the law, and we authorized the programs \naccordingly.\n  The administration assured many of us that it would support these \ncommitments of funding. Three years later, however, we find the \nprograms authorized under No Child Left Behind underfunded by about $12 \nbillion this year alone. Since enactment, we have actually seen a \ncumulative shortfall of almost $27 billion. That is reflected on this \nchart, starting in fiscal year 2002 and 2003, 2004, 2005. The first \nyear, the shortfall was $4.22 billion; the next year, $5.38 billion; \nthe next year, $7.55 billion. These are not added together on this \nchart. These are the shortfalls for each year. But the cumulative \nshortfall in No Child Left Behind programs, when you include this \nbudget that has come before us now, would approximate $39 billion.\n  I do not believe there is a Member in the Senate who has not heard \nabout the challenges their States and their school districts face in \nattempting to implement the No Child Left Behind legislation. Yet the \nresolution fails to provide adequate funding to help the States and to \nhelp our school districts implement the law. It provides minimal \nincreases for title I grants to States which serve the country's most \nimpoverished schools; minimal increases for IDEA. To make matters \nworse, because there are no increases in overall funding, these \ninadequate increases are paid for by proposals to eliminate and slash \nother critical education programs.\n\n  Since the passage of No Child Left Behind, we found that the number \nof schools failing to meet adequate yearly progress--and that is the \nkey phrase in the legislation: AYP, adequate yearly progress--the \nnumber of schools failing to meet adequate yearly progress for 2 or \nmore years has nearly doubled. It is nearly 11,000 schools nationwide. \nThese schools are facing sanctions under No Child Left Behind.\n  What we mean by sanctions is that they will be required to expend an \namount equal to as much as 20 percent of their title I grant to provide \nschool choice and supplemental services; that is, transportation to \nother schools and supplemental services. These schools require \nresources. They will require technical assistance and expertise and \neffective strategies if they are actually going to improve. Many of \nthese schools will not find the resources they need to turn themselves \naround.\n  Further, No Child Left Behind requires that all core academic \nteachers be ``highly qualified'' by the end of the 2005-2006 school \nyear. That is this next school year. Our schools are gearing up to try \nto meet that requirement. Yet, astonishingly, this budget fails to \nprovide any increases in title 2 for teacher and principal training and \nrecruitment. In fact, it eliminates or slashes a number of teacher \npreparation programs. At a time when educators around the country are \nfighting to meet the challenges of No Child Left Behind, rather than \nproviding them with the necessary resources, this budget actually cuts \nthe ground out from under them. The committee may actually undermine \ntheir best efforts to improve student achievement and teacher quality \nand to meet our goal of closing the achievement gap.\n\n  Moreover, I am afraid the budget resolution can be seen as something \nof a shell game. The resolution set a nearly identical level of \ndiscretionary spending as is in the President's budget. There is just \none exception: the President's budget sets a very clear policy decision \nand identifies where the severe cuts are to occur. This resolution \nadopts the President's budget, but it obfuscates policy decisions by \nfailing to provide budget assumptions.\n  The level of funding in the budget resolution is nearly identical to \nthe President's. It is insufficient to meet the needs of current \nspending and meet the need of the President's priorities, and it fails \nto say where the cuts will actually occur.\n  The resolution endorses the President's budget but hides the truth \nabout from where those cuts will come. Since it endorses the \nPresident's budget, the only thing we can assume is that it endorses \nthe President's priorities as well as his cuts.\n  These are the programs the budget eliminates. Let me show chart 2, \nwhich is a list of educational programs the President has recommended \nwe eliminate. There are 48. I know it is impossible to read from any \ndistance, but I will have a chance in the rest of my remarks to point \nout that many of these programs are meritorious and deserve our \ncontinued support.\n  The shell game nature of what is going on here is most evident in the \ncontext of high school reform. The\n\n[[Page S2616]]\n\nPresident proposes a $1.5 billion high school reform initiative. Who \ncould not support that? It sounds like a great idea, but, \nunfortunately, it is paid for by eliminating a number of critical high \nschool programs, including Perkins Vocational Education.\n  Just last week, here in the Senate we voted 99 to 0 in favor of \nreauthorizing the Perkins Vocational Education Act. Through the \nleadership of the chair and ranking member of the HELP Committee, we \ncrafted a strong career and technical educational program in a \nbipartisan manner, and we did so despite the President's call to \neliminate the Perkins program entirely. Clearly, 99 of our colleagues \nrecognized that career and technical education is an important part of \nstrengthening our high schools. This budget, however, does not provide \nsufficient funds for both the Perkins program, which we all endorsed \nlast week, and the high school reform initiative that the President \nindicated he supports. Ninety-nine members voted in support of Perkins, \nbut obviously that support is not real if we do not support it with \nfunding. The budget resolution does not do that.\n  The chair of the Budget Committee cosponsored the Perkins \nlegislation, spoke on the floor in support of the program, but the \nbudget resolution would eliminate the program. In the budget that was \nsent to the Congress, the President proposed a new $1.5 billion high \nschool reform initiative. Most of us agree that we need to do more at \nthe high school level.\n  Forty percent of our high school graduates are not ready for the \ndemands of college or the competitive workforce. Clearly, I support \nwhat the President has recommended by way of increases to advance \nplacement and math and science partnerships and reading programs. But \nthe President would pay for these increases by eliminating or slashing \nother high school programs--the vocational education program that I \njust mentioned, the Smaller Learning Communities Program, the TRIO \nProgram, the GEAR UP Program. Obviously, the President is entitled to \nbelieve that those programs I just listed do not work, although the \nevidence, in my view, proves otherwise. I believe most Members of the \nSenate believe otherwise. We need to be clear to the American public, \nthough, that this resolution does not provide support for these \ncritical programs.\n\n  I believe we all want to strengthen our high schools, and there are \neffective ways to do so. It is noted on the Department of Education's \nWeb site, which anyone can log on to.\n  When the size of the learning community and the learning environment \nis reduced, and closer student-teacher relationships are provided, the \nbenefits for student learning become apparent very quickly. Students \nlearn better in smaller learning communities. They experience a greater \nsense of belonging to their school. They have fewer discipline \nproblems. Crime and violence, gang, and alcohol and tobacco abuse \ndecline. This budget, however, eliminates the $95 million that we have \nin current funding for smaller learning communities.\n  The TRIO and the GEAR UP programs have helped millions of \nunderrepresented student populations prepare for and succeed in \ncollege.\n  To understand the breadth and success of these programs, it is worth \nnoting that TRIO serves more than 55,000 students in Texas, 25,000 \nstudents in Pennsylvania, 6,000 students in Maine, and 9,000 students \nin Montana. Nevertheless, the budget would eliminate the program.\n  GEAR UP, which currently serves more than 1 million students \nnationwide, has been extremely effective in preparing low-income \nstudents for postsecondary education, as well as improving the academic \nachievement of the students who participate in this program in high \nschool. I know how effective the program has been in my State of New \nMexico. ENLACE, a GEAR UP program in our State, has been very \nsuccessful in helping Hispanic students to develop leadership skills, \nprepare for college, and advocate for their own education. This budget \nwould eliminate funding for more than 4,000 students who participate in \nthe program in Virginia and 7,000 students in Rhode Island.\n  With regard to graduation rates, this country is facing a crisis. The \nbest estimate we have is that only 68 percent of our Nation's high \nschool students actually graduate with a high school diploma in the \ntime allotted for high school completion. The number is significantly \nworse if the student happens to be African American or Hispanic or \nNative American.\n  I am pleased to hear the administration talking about increasing \ngraduation rates. The low graduation rate of our students is a national \ndisgrace. We recognized this problem in the No Child Left Behind Act, \nand we required States and schools to increase graduation rates as part \nof adequate yearly progress, or AYP. But we also recognized the \nchallenges of mandating higher graduation rates without adequate \nresources, and we authorized $125 million for States and school \ndistricts to develop innovative dropout prevention programs. The \nPresident has proposed to eliminate that program.\n  With all due respect, we cannot talk about increasing graduation \nrates and at the same time propose to eliminate efforts that would help \ndecrease dropouts.\n  This program received less than $5 million last year. The \nadministration calls for its elimination because it is too small and \ntoo ineffective.\n  The argument is circular. If we funded the program anywhere near the \nlevel that it is authorized, then it would not be too small, and it \nwould not be ineffective.\n  Members talk about stemming the tide of dropouts, but eliminating \ndropout prevention programs is not the way to do that.\n  We have real challenges. Too many of our students are leaving high \nschool unprepared to meet the demands of college and a competitive \nworkforce.\n  This budget eliminates critical and effective programs, such as \ncomprehensive school reform, education technology, Safe and Drug-Free \nSchools, parent information centers, gifted and talented programs, \nschool counseling, Ready to Teach, Arts in Education, Even Start, \nNational Writing Project, foreign language assistance, and school \nleadership.\n  The administration claims that programs such as mental health \nintegration and school counseling are not a priority or they are funded \nelsewhere. Unfortunately, when you look at where they are funded \nelsewhere, the funds there are also being cut.\n  The administration claims that many programs are too small, or funds \nfor programs such as Safe and Drug-Free Schools are spread too thin to \nbe effective. I think the evidence is clearly to the contrary. Students \nin Oregon learn about the dangers of steroids because of that Safe and \nDrugfree Schools program. Safe and Drugfree Schools helps families in \nIowa, helps prevent alcohol and drug abuse in Minnesota, helps \nstrengthen families in Iowa, provides critical funding to prevent youth \nviolence in Richmond, VA, and on and on. There are many examples. My \nown State loses $3 million under the proposed budget of the \nadministration and that this budget resolution contains.\n\n  Taking a step backward, in my view, the budget eliminates education \ntechnology grants. We need to build on efforts to integrate technology \ninto learning, not cut back on those efforts. Particularly, this is \nimportant for rural schools. We need to increase access to courses, \nequip teachers with advances in technology, and provide students with \nthe means to compete in the global economy.\n  There is substantial money involved in education technology funding. \nSchools in Pennsylvania receive $17 million; schools in Texas, $42 \nmillion; Florida, $23 million; Colorado, $4 million; Georgia, $15 \nmillion; Virginia, $8 million; my home State of New Mexico, $4 million.\n  By eliminating these critical programs, we will be causing real harm \nto real students and schools. Using the Department of Education data, \nhere is a sample of who participates in these programs. Some of the \nprograms I have listed have a substantial number of students involved. \nComprehensive school reform: 2,473 schools benefit from that, \napproximately, and 1.18 million children benefit from that program. \nSmall learning communities: 591 schools and 591,000 students were to be \nserved in 2004. It is clear there are actual effects on students from \nthe cuts we are proposing.\n  The budget also slashes funding for other critical programs such as \nadult\n\n[[Page S2617]]\n\nbasic education and literacy, Grants for Innovative Programs, and \nAdvanced Credentialing.\n  My colleagues tout increases in title I spending since the President \ntook office. There have been increases of Title I spending. A \nsignificant amount of that increase has been added by the Congress and \nnot requested by the administration. There have been increases and the \nadministration asked for some of those increases. But we are still \nsubstantially below what we authorized.\n  The level of funding is still cumulatively, if this budget is \napproved, $39 billion less than what we authorized for No Child Left \nBehind Programs, and $30.8 billion less than authorized for title I. \nThe level is $3.6 billion less than the amount we authorized for this, \nthis year in IDEA when that was reauthorized a few months ago.\n  It is also important to note that the increases were significant in \nonly the first couple of years of No Child Left Behind. Last year, we \nsaw an increase of less than $400 million in title I spending. This \nyear's proposed increase is only about $600 million. In fact, the small \nincreases are offset by changes in the poverty data and resulted in \nmore than half of the Nation's school districts receiving fewer title I \nfunds for the 2004/2005 school year. Ten States had their title I funds \ncut from the previous year's level. For this school year, Connecticut, \nIowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, and \nOregon all see cuts from last year's title I allocation.\n  This chart shows a sample of the school districts in my State and the \namounts they can expect. They have already been advised by the \nDepartment of Education that these lower amounts will be provided \nthrough title I funding for them from the current school year. The \nbudget resolution would further complicate and add to those cuts that \nhave already been made.\n  In my view, there is no higher priority for the future well-being of \nthe country than the education of our children. I offer this amendment \nto bring the level of funding for education back to where it is in the \ncurrent year. That is not too much to ask if we do believe that \neducation is a priority.\n  I urge my colleagues to support education in this budget and to adopt \nmy amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent at 5:30 today the \nSenate proceed to a vote in relationship to the Bingaman amendment, \nwith no amendments in order to the amendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, the game plan now is to recognize the \nSenator from Tennessee and then the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CONRAD. At this point, if we could get an order for Senator \nAlexander and Senator Sarbanes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I also ask, after the vote is completed at 5:30 on the \nBingaman amendment, if we could recognize Senator Bennett at that time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. For what period of time?\n  Mr. GREGG. For half an hour.\n  Mr. CONRAD. All right.\n  Mr. GREGG. We yield to Senator Alexander such time as he may use off \nour side of the bill and then we go over to Senator Sarbanes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, the Senator from New Mexico and I \nhave a number of common interests in energy and science technology, and \none of our common interests is making certain as we move into a more \ncompetitive world marketplace that we maintain our brain power in the \nUnited States of America because over the last period of time since \nWorld War II, about half of our good new jobs have come from there. I \nlook forward to continuing the work within this budget, to set \npriorities that do that.\n  In this first year of a little bit of fiscal discipline, which is \nabout all we are exercising this year, we may not do as much of that as \nwe may be able to in the future, but I for one want to make sure that \nover the next 5 to 10 years while we are dealing with unsustainable \ngrowth in what we call mandatory spending--Medicaid and Medicare, \nspending that is on automatic pilot--as we try to deal with that \ngrowth, we do not squeeze out the investments in science and technology \nand higher education and advanced computing that we need to maintain \nour standard of living.\n  This budget is, in my view, a good budget. It does begin to exercise \nsome fiscal discipline, but it is a modest exercise of fiscal \ndiscipline.\n  The bottom line is if we were to adopt the budget as presented, we \nspend $2.6 trillion--a number none of us can imagine. One way to get it \ninto reality is to say it is $100 billion more than we spent this year. \nSo, $100 billion, how much is that? It is enough to run the State of \nTennessee for 8 years, and the State of Tennessee is not the biggest \nState; it is the sixteenth largest State. It collects about $12.5 \nbillion a year of State taxes. We are spending a lot more money next \nyear. We are not cutting the amount of money the Federal Government is \nspending of taxpayers' money; we are increasing it by $100 billion next \nyear within this budget.\n  The Senator from North Dakota, who is as compelling and persuasive a \nspeaker as we have on the Senate floor and has a wonderful way of \npresenting his charts, was making the point repeatedly. I heard him \ntoday saying that the debt is going up. He is right. The debt is going \nup. We are arguing about proposing to reduce the size of the annual \ndeficit and to cut that amount in half, which means that every year we \ndo not take down to zero the annual deficit, the debt goes up. I \nsuppose his chart includes Social Security funding, too, so the debt \ngoes up.\n  But this is a modest effort at fiscal discipline that means if this \nbudget were adopted, we believe the deficits each year would be cut in \nhalf.\n  Now, these spending constraints are never easy, and they involve \nsetting priorities. The President is right. I believe the budget we \nhave proposed is right, to start, by trying to be as committed to the \nmilitary men and women of this country as they are to this country. So \nit raises overall defense spending by 4.8 percent so we can provide our \nmilitary with the equipment they need to safely and successfully finish \ntheir jobs of spreading democracy in the world.\n  The President's tax initiatives are continued. But within this budget \nthere are significant investments other than for military and homeland \nsecurity, which are our first priority.\n  Let me see if I can talk a moment about education since that was the \nsubject of the statement by the Senator from New Mexico. Some of the \nfigures that were used I did not quite understand because I have done \nmy own calculating. For example, there is this constant reference to \nshortfalls in funding of No Child Left Behind. Now, I was not here when \nthat happened. I do not know what the deals were that were made, what \narrangements were made, and with whom. But the Senator from New Mexico \nsaid there was a $39 billion shortfall. I cannot imagine where that \nfigure comes from because this year we only spent $37.8 billion on all \nof K-12 education.\n  The U.S. Government only contributes about 7 percent of the funding \nfor our local schools in 15,000 school districts across the country. \nThat is all it has ever contributed. It is not likely to contribute a \nmuch larger percentage. So there cannot be a $39 billion shortfall in \nNo Child Left Behind since we only spent less than that total amount of \nmoney from the Federal Government.\n  In addition to that, let's look at what happened over the last five \nBush budgets. There has been a 46-percent actual increase in Federal \nspending on No Child Left Behind. By comparison--I don't know what \nperiod of time that is for the Clinton years, so I won't say. But let's \ntalk about President Bush. There has been a 46-percent increase over 5 \nyears.\n  I checked in the State of Tennessee, where I am from, and the amount \nof increase in State spending for kindergarten through the 12th grade, \nthrough this period of time, would be more like 15 or 16 or 17 percent. \nFederal spending for kindergarten through the 12th grade during the \nBush years, the last 5 years, has increased at the rate of about three \ntimes of what State spending has been. So if there is a tin cup, it\n\n[[Page S2618]]\n\nis not in Washington, it is at the State capital.\n  I think it is very important that even in this time of fiscal \nrestraint, when we cannot increase spending this year as much as some \nof us might like, that over the 5 years it has increased 46 percent.\n  This budget does include enough money for another $1 billion for No \nChild Left Behind, another $500 million for special education.\n  This is not an isolated commitment. Let's take another example of \nwhat has happened over the last 5 years. There has been a 34-percent \nincrease in total U.S. Department of Education discretionary funding.\n  Title I was mentioned. Title I is the Federal education program that \nis directed, with a lot of flexibility, toward poor children. Now, it \nmay not be reaching the poorest children. It goes directly to schools. \nAnd my guess is that the reason why the Senator from New Mexico was \nable to point out that some States were getting less and some States \nwere getting more is that maybe No Child Left Behind is directing more \nof the Federal dollars where they are supposed to go; which is, to help \nour poorest children who are not learning reading and math.\n  In any event, there has been a 52-percent increase in title I \nspending over the last 5 years, at a time when State spending has been \nincreasing at less than 20 percent, which is 35 or 40 percent of the \nFederal spending increase.\n  It is the same story with special education. There has been a 75-\npercent increase in Federal spending on special education over the last \n5 years. Improving teacher quality: a 38-percent increase over the last \n5 years under President Bush and this Congress.\n\n  Let's remember, the President does not appropriate a penny. We are \nshortchanging ourselves when we stand here and say No Child Left Behind \nwas not properly funded. We do all the appropriating. They do not do \nany of it down at the White House. They send a budget up here, and we \ndon't have to pay any attention it to at all. We do what we want to do.\n  What we have done over the last 5 years--I was only here for 2--is \nincrease Federal spending for education at a Federal rate of two or \nthree times as fast as it has increased in the States.\n  Let me give an example of improving teacher quality. There is an \naccount in Washington in No Child Left Behind that gives about $50 \nmillion a year to the State of Tennessee for improving teacher quality. \nIf all that money were spent on teachers, it would give each teacher in \nTennessee about a $900 pay increase. It is a lot of money. Now, half \nthat money came from closing another account. So let's say there is \nonly $25 million new No Child Left Behind dollars for the teachers of \nTennessee. That would be $400 or $500 per teacher. That is a \nsubstantial investment by the Federal Government, on an annual basis, \nto help those teachers improve their quality and become highly \nqualified teachers.\n  Now, if the State of Tennessee chooses to spend that on some other \npurpose, whether it is education or something else, that is the \nbusiness of the State of Tennessee. But the money was appropriated here \nin Washington for that purpose.\n  And finally, all of us are interested in continuing higher education \nfor the largest number of Americans. Sixty percent of our college \nstudents have a Federal grant or loan that follows them to the college \nor university of their choice. It is perhaps the most successful set of \ngrant and loan programs anywhere in the world. It has created an \nopportunity for more Americans, a higher percentage of them, to go to \ncollege than anywhere in the world. We have the best system of colleges \nand universities anywhere in the world, primarily because we respect \nthe autonomy of those colleges, and we appropriate a lot of Federal \nmoney, and we let students choose the college or institution of their \nchoice to attend.\n  What has this Congress done over the last 5 years, including this \nbudget that is proposed? There has been a 56-percent increase in actual \nFederal dollars for Pell grants. So when we talk about education, let's \nnot sell ourselves short. We have been putting a very high priority, \nurged on by President Bush, on education over the last 4 years, and in \nthis budget as well.\n  Let me mention three other areas about this budget. One has to do \nwith opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil exploration. \nOver the next few weeks, gasoline prices across this country are going \nto go up by about a quarter. Gas prices are already pretty high. We are \nbringing in oil from other places in the world, 70 percent of our \nnation's need. That does not make a lot of sense when we have a lot \nhere on our own. We could bring in a million barrels of oil a day from \nAlaska if we would only vote to do it. That is about as much oil as \nTexas produces. We could begin to reduce our dependence on the rest of \nthe world and lower our gasoline prices. We ought to do that.\n  In 1985 and 1986 I was chairman of President Reagan's Commission on \nAmericans Outdoors. We recommended that we begin taking some of the \nmoney we use for drilling oil and gas on Federal lands and putting it \ninto conservation purposes. Specifically, we said, let's create a \nbillion-dollar fund for the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  I am pleased to say that under Chairman Gregg's leadership, this \nbudget includes a provision that begins to follow that recommendation \nof the President's Commission on Americans Outdoors. It says if this \nCongress decides to allow exploration of oil in Alaska in the ANWR area \nthat for 4 years $350 million will come from those revenues into a \nconservation reserve fund, and that then will be used for the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund, for wildlife preservation, for coastal \nprotection, and for other purposes.\n  Our Commission thought, in 1985 and 1986, it made sense when we place \nany environmental burden that we balance it with an environmental \nbenefit. We believe this is a sensible way to do it, and I hope other \nMembers of the Senate will notice this important provision.\n  There is also in this budget something I want to talk about in a \nmoment that has to do with unfunded mandates. But the last part of the \nbudget I want to mention has to do with Medicaid.\n  There is a serious attempt in the budget proposed by our Budget \nCommittee to begin to deal with what we call mandatory spending, the \nspending that is on automatic pilot. It is basically Social Security, \nwhich the President is urging us to deal with, Medicaid, and Medicare. \nThe health care programs are about to consume all the money we have. If \nthey are left on automatic pilot, as they are, we won't have any money \nfor first-class universities, for preschool education, for implementing \nNo Child Left Behind, for national parks, for local policemen, for \nlocal firemen.\n  The testimony we heard in the Budget Committee showed that unfunded \nFederal liabilities over the next 75 years will begin to take 25 \npercent of the gross domestic product of the United States. The whole \nFederal budget today takes less than 20 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct.\n  We can't sustain that. So this budget suggests that we restrain the \ngrowth of Medicaid spending by $14 billion over the next 5 years. We \nwill be spending $1.12 trillion on Medicaid from the Federal Government \nover the next 5 years, and we are suggesting a $14 billion restraint in \ngrowth. No one should get a very big merit badge for that much fiscal \ndiscipline, but at least a little merit badge for trying.\n  That won't work unless we are willing to change some Federal laws \nbecause Medicaid is administered partly by the Federal Government and \npartly by the State government. But the trouble is, from a Governor's \nperspective, that the Federal Government sets the entitlement criteria. \nThere are a dozen or so programs that States must offer in their \nMedicaid programs. The Federal Government decides--the bureaucracy--\nwhether Governors get a lot of flexibility or none, and then the \nFederal courts increasingly have been saying that Governors can't take \nsteps even to change or amend or reduce optional services as a way of \nrestraining the growth of Medicaid so there will be money, for example, \nfor pre-kindergarten.\n  Let me suggest the principles on which I believe this body could help \nthe Federal Government and the State governments at the same time slow \nthe growth of Medicaid a little bit. We are\n\n[[Page S2619]]\n\nonly suggesting that we slow the growth from a projected 41-percent \ngrowth in funding over the next 5 years to 39 percent. It is not much, \nbut it is enough to cause some discomfort unless we make some changes. \nThe principles we should follow then are: One, any reforms that we \nrequire ought to save money for both the States and the Federal \nGovernment. Two, the reforms must be voluntary. The Governors who \nmanage these programs have to have flexibility. Three, we should not be \ncutting people off Medicaid who won't have any other health options.\n  There are some ways to do that which I will talk more about at \nanother time. But, for example, we could change the law to make it \neasier for Medicaid to avoid overpaying for prescription drugs. We \ncould change the law to permit States to crack down on Medicaid spend \ndown abuses when wealthier individuals give away their money with the \nexpectation that Medicaid will cover their health care costs. We could \nchange the law to allow Governors to require copayments for benefits \nfrom those optional Medicaid programs which Governors choose to offer \nthat the Federal Government doesn't require. We could change the law to \ngive States more flexibility to allow mothers and children to enroll in \nwhat we call the SCHIP Program. And finally, we could make it easier \nfor States to provide home- and community-based care for beneficiaries \nwho prefer it to more costly nursing home care.\n  It is never pleasant to restrain spending, but it is absolutely \nnecessary. Fifteen years ago, I spent my time as Governor trying to \nrestrain health care spending so I could create centers of excellence \nat the universities, so I could maintain low tuitions, so we could pay \nteachers more. We were successful. But when I left the Governor's \noffice in 1987, we were spending 51 cents out of every State dollar on \neducation. Today it is 40 cents. Why? Because then we were spending 15 \ncents on health care. Today it is 31 cents on health care and headed \nup. If we don't begin to try to control mandatory spending in Medicaid \nand then Medicare, we will not allow the States or ourselves to invest \nin those programs that have to do with job creation that help us \nmaintain our standard of living.\n\n  There is one other area I would like to mention. It has to do with a \nprovision in this budget which increases to 60 votes the number of \nvotes it would take to impose on State and local government what is \ncalled a Federal unfunded mandate. Tomorrow, March 15, is the 10th \nbirthday of the Federal Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, affectionately \nknown around Washington as UMRA.\n  Now, the Federal Unfunded Mandates Reform Act was supposed to stop \nthe one thing that made me mad as Governor, and that was some \nCongressman coming up with some big idea, passing a law, holding a \npress conference, bragging about it, and then sending the bill back to \nTennessee for me and the legislature to pay. And then the next weekend \nthat same Congressman would usually be back in Knoxville or Memphis \nmaking a big speech about local control. The Unfunded Mandates Act was \nsupposed to discourage the Federal Government from imposing new laws \nand new rules on State and local governments without paying for them.\n  I am sorry to say that it was a noble idea that was hard to pass 10 \nyears ago. It got a big vote in the end. But it hasn't worked very \nwell. It is raising property taxes to pay for new EPA storm water \nrunoff rules. School boards are taking money out of one classroom and \nputting it in another to meet Federal requirements for children with \ndisabilities. The National Council of State Legislatures has identified \n$29 billion in Federal cost shifts to States in transportation, health \ncare, education, environment, homeland security, election laws, and in \nother areas. And last year, in the name of lowering Internet access \ntaxes, some in this Congress tried to take away from State and local \nofficials local control over how to pay for governmental services.\n  Not long ago, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation \nthat will soon be before us that would turn 190 million State driver's \nlicenses into national ID cards with States paying most of the bill. \nAnd last week, Governors asked the President, when they met with him at \nthe White House: Mr. President, how can we reduce the growth of \nMedicaid spending in the States when Federal laws dictate eligibility \nstandards, Federal bureaucrats limit State flexibility, and Federal \ncourts just say no? These are just the unfunded Federal mandates I was \ndescribing.\n  Just as ominous a threat to a balanced partnership among Federal, \nState, and local governments is Congress's failure to act on important \nareas of policy which also are running up the cost to State and local \ngovernments. For example, Congress's failure to deal with 10 million \nillegal immigrants fills up hospital emergency rooms, schools, and \njails. Our failure to reform Medicaid has allowed a 40-percent increase \nin caseloads over the last 5 years to soak up State and local revenues \nthat might have been spent for schools, colleges, police, parks, and \nroads. And then the Federal courts have piled on, using outdated \nconsent decrees to run Medicaid in Tennessee, foster care in Utah, \ntransportation in Los Angeles, and the teaching of English to children \nin New York City.\n  During the last 10 years about the only part of the Federal \nGovernment that has recognized the importance of strong State and local \ngovernments in our Federal system is the U.S. Supreme Court, which has \nrediscovered the 10th amendment to the Constitution that reserves to \nStates powers that are not expressly granted to the central government.\n  So here is the picture of Federalism today. In Washington, DC, \nDemocrats still stuck in the New Deal are reflexively searching for \nnational solutions to local problems. We Republicans, having found \nourselves in charge, have decided it is more blessed to impose our \nviews rather than to liberate America from Washington's views. And \nacross America, Federal judges have discovered the joys of acting like \nGovernors and mayors without having to run for office.\n  Meanwhile, in the States and cities, Federal funds make up as much as \nhalf of State and local budgets, bringing with them more and more rules \nthat direct and limit what mayors and Governors are able to do with \nrevenues raised from State and local taxes.\n  As a result, the job of mayor and Governor is becoming more and more \nlike the job of university president, which I used to be; it looks like \nyou are in charge, but you are not.\n  That is why to celebrate the 10th birthday of the Unfunded Mandate \nReform Act, I propose 3 steps to give mayors and Governors, legislators \nand local councils, more authority to do what they were elected to do.\n  The first of those steps is in this budget resolution. It would amend \nthe Unfunded Mandate Reform Act to increase to 60 the number of Senate \nvotes it takes to enact legislation that imposes unfunded Federal \nmandates. This proposal was approved last Thursday by the Senate Budget \nCommittee. For the last 10 years, the number has been 50, and it hasn't \nbeen used once as a budget point of order. It was said that this point \nof order with 50 votes would become like a penalty flag. Well, it has \nbecome a penalty flag that hasn't been thrown for 10 years. Make it 60 \nvotes and it may do some good.\n  Second, I would propose making it easier for Governors and mayors to \nchange or vacate outdated Federal court consent decrees. This \nlegislation introduced last week by Senator Pryor of Arkansas, Senator \nNelson, Senator Kyl, Senator Cornyn, and myself would do that. It would \nput term limits on consent decrees and shift to plaintiffs the burden \nof proving that decrees need to be continued, and require courts to \ndraw decrees narrowly, with the objective of putting responsibility \nback in the hands of the elected officials as soon as possible.\n  Finally, the third proposal is do not allow any new Federal statute \nto preempt a local law, unless the new Federal law specifically states \nthere is a direct conflict with State and local law.\n  I am still optimistic about our Federal system. I am optimistic \nbecause I believe excessive centralization of Government runs against \nthe grain of what it means to be an American. Americans do expect \nWashington to take care of war, welfare, Social Security, health care, \nand debt. Americans do not want Washington running schools, colleges, \nlaw enforcement, fire departments, cities, parks, and most roads.\n\n[[Page S2620]]\n\n  Lest anyone think I am wrong, I invite them to step out with me on \nthe campaign trail. I remember our last referendum on federalism in the \nmid-1990s. Newt Gingrich and 300 Republicans stood on the Capitol steps \nand said: no more unfunded Federal mandates. Bob Dole, the new \nRepublican leader in the Senate in 1995, made the Unfunded Mandate \nReform Act S. 1, and then Senator Dole campaigned across the country \nreading the 10th amendment to his audiences.\n  I was doing my part. I was running for President, too--not so \nsuccessfully. I was walking across Iowa and New Hampshire wearing a \nred-and-black shirt, proposing to abolish the U.S. Department of \nEducation as we knew it, move the Agriculture Department from \nWashington, DC, to Des Moines, and to cut the pay of Congress in half \nand send them home for 6 months each year to spend more time with their \nneighbors instead of Washington lobbyists. You can imagine how popular \nI was in these chambers while proposing to cut their pay and send them \nhome. I can clearly remember in a Washington Post editorial meeting, \nwhen the late publisher Kay Graham asked me:\n\n       Governor Alexander, if you so dislike Washington, DC, why \n     would you come here?\n\n  That was a good question, and there is a good answer. One of the most \nimportant reasons to come to Washington to serve is to remind those \nalready here that a plane ticket to Washington doesn't make you any \nsmarter.\n\n  The parents and teachers of 50 million students in 15,000 districts \nusually can do more to improve a child's education than some national \nschool board. If Washington says you must spend more for Medicaid, that \nusually means less for preschool education, and someone who is elected \nand is closer to the problem ought to make that decision.\n  In some countries, that arrangement might work. In those countries \nthat are smaller and ethnically more the same, it may be possible to \nhave a national school board, state church, and a central government \ncalling most of the shots. We know that doesn't stand a prayer of \nworking in the United States. De Tocqueville, in his early writings \nabout America, pointed out that our country works community by \ncommunity. We are so big, we have so many different views, we come from \nso many backgrounds, we need a lot of places to work things out in \ndifferent ways. Put too many one-size-fits-all jackets on Americans and \nthe place explodes.\n  In our country, such explosions, thankfully, still occur at election \ntime. That is why most candidates for President run against Washington, \nDC. That is why U.S. Senators from Washington are rarely elected \nPresident and Governors from outside Washington often are. That is one \nreason why Americans elected the Republican Congress in 1994.\n  I am optimistic about federalism because Democrats are now looking \nfor a way to get into office, and we Republicans are looking for a way \nto stay in office. I believe that whoever wins that argument will have \nto get on the right side of the federalism issue. So as a good \nRepublican I am using this birthday celebration tomorrow of the \nUnfunded Federal Mandate Act to remind my Republican colleagues that we \npromised the people no more unfunded mandates. We said, ``If we break \nour promise, throw us out.'' I am sure if we forget our promise, our \nDemocrat friends will remind us of it.\n  Most of our policy debates in Congress involve conflicting \nprinciples. The principle of federalism should not always be the trump \ncard. There are other important principles to weigh: liberty, equal \nopportunity, laissez faire, and many others.\n  But the federalism that the Republican Congress was elected to \nprotect in 1994 has gotten lost in the weeds. It is time for us to find \nit and pick it up and to put it back up front where it belongs. Step \nNo. 1 would be to pass this budget, which would increase to 60 the \nnumber of votes it takes to enact an unfunded mandate. Then we should \nmove to put term limits on Federal court consent decrees, which has \nstrong bipartisan support in the House, as well as the Senate, and then \nrequire Congress to announce when it decides to preempt State and local \nlaw.\n  If we in Congress do that, then maybe on the 20th birthday of the \nUnfunded Federal Mandate Act, 10 years from now, we can celebrate an \nAmerican Federal system that has the kind of respect for mayors and \nGovernors, legislators and local council members that the Founders of \nthis great Republic envisioned.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, let me begin with the rather obvious \nobservation that the budget resolution is the single most important \ndocument we deal with in the Congress. The budget contains thousands of \ndecisions that are critical to our national life, and those decisions \nreflect our priorities as a nation--both those of the President who \nsubmits a budget and those of the Congress that passes a budget.\n  Are we more concerned about tax cuts for the wealthy or strengthening \nSocial Security? Are we more concerned with tax cuts for the wealthy or \nfunding important safety, housing, community development, education, \nand health needs? Are we more concerned with giving tax cuts than \nholding down the deficit?\n  All of those are decisions that are involved in making the budget. In \nits composite, the budget is a very important macroeconomic document, \nbecause it sets the fiscal path for dealing with the overall economy. \nWill the budget fund the programs that create jobs and strengthen our \neconomy? Will the budget create longrun structural deficits? What will \nbe the impact of those longrun structural deficits on our economic \nperformance? Will the budget move us toward full employment or away \nfrom it?\n  Now, it is asserted that we have to have these very substantial cuts \nin a number of important domestic programs because we have this large \ndeficit and we have to address the large deficit. On the road to \nprogress, we need to make investments in health, education, and \nprotecting the environment. But we are told, no, no, we have this big \ndeficit and therefore we cannot do these things.\n  Where did that big deficit come from? That is the question that needs \nto be asked, because once you go behind where the big deficit came \nfrom, you get a picture of what the priorities are and what the \nthinking is of those who have established this budget framework.\n  When President Bush came into office in 2001, he inherited a \nprojected $5.6 trillion surplus over the next 10-year period--a $5.6 \ntrillion surplus. In his first budget proposal, which included an \nexcessive tax cut primarily for those at the top of the income and \nwealth scale, he said:\n\n       We can proceed with tax relief without fear of budget \n     deficits.\n\n  The following year, with the budget already in deficit, the President \nadvocated for another tax cut while promising that ``Our budget will \nrun a deficit that will be small and short term.'' In fact, the \nPresident's budget that year stated that deficits would be so short \nterm that by today the Government would be back in surplus. How wrong \nhe was.\n  The President's Office of Management and Budget is projecting a \ndeficit this year of $427 billion. Instead of the $5.6 trillion 10-year \nsurplus projected out when the President took office, when you factor \nin some of the costs we know are coming, such as the continuing cost of \nthe war in Iraq, the cost of reforming the alternative minimum tax, the \ncost of some of the President's proposals, including making the tax \ncuts permanent, and the continuing defense buildup, the projections now \nare for a deficit over the same period of $3.7 trillion, instead of a \n$5.6 trillion surplus.\n  Think of that. We have gone from projecting a $5.6 trillion surplus \nin 2001, to projecting a $3.7 trillion deficit. That is a deterioration \nin our fiscal position of over $9 trillion--$9.3 trillion, to be \nspecific.\n  As a consequence, the Federal debt has skyrocketed. Back in January \n2001, the Congressional Budget Office was projecting that our net debt \nto the public would decline to $36 billion by 2008. Now the CBO is \nprojecting that publicly held debt will rise to $5.5 trillion in 2008. \nOf course, with increased debt comes increased interest payments. Net \ninterest payments on our debt are expected to consume more than $1 \ntrillion over the next 5 years, leaving us less able to invest in other \npriorities.\n\n[[Page S2621]]\n\n  There are a number of reasons for this fiscal reversal. Spending to \nrecover from the attacks of September 11 and to pay for operations in \nIraq and Afghanistan has played a part in creating these deficits. But \nthe deficits are not primarily the result of increased spending by the \nCongress. By far, the greatest factor contributing to the return of \ndeficits is on the revenue side.\n  Madam President, 74 percent of the change from the surplus in 2000 to \nthe projected deficit in 2005 stems from revenue loss, of which the \nPresident's tax cuts were a major part. Rather than saving the budget \nsurplus he inherited, thereby helping us to meet our long-term \nobligations, such as Social Security, the President chose to risk our \nfiscal future through excessive tax cuts targeted to those who need \nthem the least. Make no mistake about it, this is the priority that \nthis administration set and it continues to follow. Now we are living \nwith the consequences of that choice--deficits and debt as far as the \neye can see.\n  These massive and sustained deficits are not simply numbers on paper. \nThey have real consequences in terms of the United States' future \neconomic strength. The structural deficits that are built into this \nbudget will be extremely harmful to the economy as we move ahead. They \npromise to raise interest rates, reduce economic growth, decrease the \nnumber of jobs, and increase our vulnerability to sudden economic \ncrisis.\n  Addressing these deficits becomes even more critical when you \nconsider our international position. As recently as the early 1980s, \nthe United States was a creditor nation. Other countries owed us. Today \nthe U.S. is the world's largest debtor nation. Our external debt in \n2003 was $2.4 trillion. Last year we ran a trade deficit in excess of \n$600 billion, and once that gets included in the figures, we expect our \nexternal debt to be over $3 trillion. This sharp deterioration is \nproceeding as we continue to run enormous trade and current account \ndeficits. Our current account deficit is projected to reach a record \nhigh in 2005.\n\n  There was a story just this weekend in the newspaper, ``Trade Gap \nWidens on Record Imports. Deficit at Record Level. Trade Gap Expands. \nThe U.S. trade deficit widened in January to $58 billion''--for 1 \nmonth--``the second highest monthly gap on record.''\n  We were warned by the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New \nYork not long ago about this situation. Let me read what he said:\n\n       The size and concentration of external imbalances in the \n     system are at an unprecedented scale, between 5 to 6 percent \n     of GDP in the case of the U.S. current account deficit. The \n     counterpart of this deficit is a large inflow of capital from \n     the world's private savers and foreign central banks. The \n     expected trajectory for this imbalance produces a dramatic \n     deterioration in our net international position and cannot be \n     sustained indefinitely.\n\n  He concluded:\n\n       What's new is that we are significantly more dependent \n     today on the confidence of the rest of the world in U.S. \n     economic policy for the safety and stability of our financial \n     markets.\n\n  We are losing our financial independence and running the risk of a \ncrisis of confidence in the dollar.\n  Last summer, the Financial Times in an editorial warned:\n\n       Like Tennessee Williams' ill-fated character Blanche \n     Dubois, the United States has long been dependent on the \n     kindness of strangers. Foreigners' hitherto insatiable \n     appetite for dollar assets is what has enabled the U.S. to \n     keep running on credit for so long. Like Ms. Dubois' \n     dysfunctional relationships, this one is symbiotic but \n     potentially hazardous.\n\n  I am very frank to say that I believe this budget is seriously out of \nline with the needs of America's families. The basic thrust of the \nPresident's budget proposal is that we should allow tax cuts for very \nwealthy people to continue, but programs that help middle-class \nAmericans should be cut and the deficit continue to be a major problem.\n  Let me give a couple of examples to dramatize this contrast in \npriorities. In 2006, the President's tax cuts are scheduled to give $32 \nbillion to those making over $1 million a year. In other words, all the \npeople making over $1 million a year, who are a very small percentage \nof our population, will get $32 billion in tax cuts.\n  What might we be able to do with some of this money that is going for \ntax cuts for wealthy people? We could bring our first responders back \nup to the budget baseline with $1.6 billion, or 5 percent of this \nexcessive tax cut. We know the needs and challenges faced by those on \nthe front lines of our efforts to provide greater security to \ncommunities around the country. We know they need help. Another $1.9 \nbillion would restore full funding for the Community Development Block \nGrant Program, a program very important to State and local governments, \nto carry forward the renewal of their communities; that would be 6 \npercent of the $32 billion tax cut that will go to the millionaires. We \ncould restore funding for the HOPE VI program at a cost of $500 \nmillion. HOPE VI has helped eliminate the worst public housing and \nreplaced it with home ownership and has transformed the downtown areas \nof many cities in the country.\n  I could go on with these examples. The fact is, for a portion of that \nexcessive tax cut we could restore many of these programs, and the \nother portion could be used to bring down the deficit; in other words, \nwe could have a more balanced fiscal policy, one that responds to the \nneeds of our country and that lays the basis for our long-term strength \ninstead of taking us deeper into the hole with these twin deficits, our \ninternal budget deficit and our external trade and current account \ndeficit, which has taken the United States from being a creditor \nnation--in other words, others owed us--to where we are now the largest \ndebtor nation in the world.\n  Those are the choices that are being made in this budget. We are \nbeing told constantly that we have a deficit; we need to address the \ndeficit. Yet this budget provides $70 billion more in tax cuts for \nwealthy people, for people who, under any analysis of the case, are not \nin need of a tax cut. The working people could use a tax cut, but that \nis not where the tax cut goes. At the same time, when we talk about the \nprograms that are being cut for which there is such desperate need, we \nare told that we have to do that because we have this deficit problem.\n  If we have this deficit problem, why do we have to do the tax cuts \nthat are in this budget resolution? What is the rationale for doing \nthat? It is a matter of priorities. Very simply, those who have put \nthis resolution together place a greater premium on further tax cuts \nfor those who have already, in my judgment, received excessive tax \ncuts, than they do in holding down the deficit or funding some of these \nvery important programs that we need for our people.\n  So the basic question as we move ahead is, what are our priorities as \na nation? How should we invest our resources to get the best outcome in \nthe future? I do not believe that the priorities represented in this \nbudget reflect the right choices for America, and I urge my colleagues \nto vote to reject this budget resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, there is nobody I enjoy listening to more \nin this Chamber than Senator Sarbanes. I think all of my colleagues \nknow that over the weekend Senator Sarbanes announced that he will not \nseek reelection, and that is unfortunate for this Chamber and the \ncountry.\n  Senator Sarbanes is one of the finest Members of the Senate I have \nserved with in my 19 years. He is brilliant, a Rhodes scholar. More \nthan that, Paul Sarbanes is a wise person. In the time I have been \nhere, I have turned to him repeatedly for his remarkable sense of \njudgment.\n  Paul just reminded me that he will be here another 22 months. I say \nto Senator Sarbanes, that is not long enough. This country needs him, \nand if there was ever a time that it needs him it is now because nobody \nis perhaps more knowledgeable in this Chamber or in the entire Congress \non economic issues than Senator Paul Sarbanes. He has been an important \nmember of the Joint Economic Committee. He has been former chairman of \nthe Banking Committee. He has been a key member of the Budget \nCommittee.\n  I cannot think of anybody I would miss more than Senator Paul \nSarbanes, and I say with a heavy heart that I have to acknowledge his \ndetermination to retire. He certainly deserves a full and happy \nretirement, but\n\n[[Page S2622]]\n\nSenator Sarbanes is someone who is going to be sorely missed in this \nChamber and in this Congress. I cannot think of a finer man.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I want to thank my very able colleague from North \nDakota. He has been extremely generous in his comments. For me, it has \nbeen a great privilege to serve and work with him and to follow his \nleadership on the Budget Committee, which has just been extraordinary. \nSenator Conrad has laid out an analysis that spells out all of these \nissues that we have been talking about, and if the Nation would only \nlisten to him we would improve our fiscal position and strengthen our \neconomic position.\n  I say to my colleague, my term still has 22 months, so I want to \nassure him I am going to be here with him every day of that 22 months \nto make this fight as we seek to turn back this radical agenda of the \nBush administration, which I think contains great harm to our Nation \nand to its people. I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, when I read the headlines in the paper and \nsaw across the front page the top headline in the Washington Post, \n``Senator Sarbanes to Retire,'' I read that with a heavy heart because \nthere is no one who has made a stronger contribution in this body than \nSenator Paul Sarbanes. We are going to be expecting him to be helping \nevery day of these last 22 months, and I know that will be the case.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are headed for a vote at about 5:30 \njust so my colleagues who are listening are aware of that situation.\n  For a moment, I want to discuss the pending amendment of Senator \nBingaman.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator from Tennessee raised \nquestions about figures that Senator Bingaman was using in terms of the \nshortfall in the No Child Left Behind Act, and Senator Bingaman \napparently had referenced a shortfall of $39 billion in No Child Left \nBehind in the last 6 years. The Senator from Tennessee was challenging \nthat number and did not know how it was possible. Well, let me just \nshare with my colleagues why it is not only possible, but it is the \nreality.\n  Senator Bingaman was talking about the levels of funding that have \nbeen authorized in No Child Left Behind versus what has been \nappropriated. If one looks at 2002, one sees that the appropriation \ncompared to the authorization was $4.2 billion short. If we would look \nat the succeeding years, what we would find is that the combined \nshortfall, the difference between what was authorized and what was \nactually appropriated, is $38.98 billion below what was authorized.\n  I was not privy to the agreements that were made at the time, \nalthough I was serving in Congress, serving on the Budget Committee, \nbut the understanding was that new obligations were put on the States \nand that the Federal Government was going to fund those new \nrequirements. The determination at the time was the amount that was \nauthorized was the amount of money necessary for the Federal Government \nto cover the new obligations it was requiring.\n  The hard reality here is that the appropriations have not kept pace \nwith what was authorized. As I indicated, in 2002, it was $4.2 billion; \n2003, $5.4 billion; $7.6 billion short in 2004; $9.8 billion short in \n2005; $12 billion short in 2006; for a total combined shortfall of \n$38.98 billion.\n  Senator Bingaman was exactly right in his assertion. I just wanted to \nmake that clear.\n  I commend Senator Bingaman for offering his important education \namendment. It provides $4.8 billion to restore funding for more than 48 \neducation programs that are eliminated or significantly reduced in the \nSenate budget plan. I know the Budget Committee chairman will say that \nhis budget resolution does not eliminate or reduce funding for these \nprograms because his budget resolution does not contain specific \nprogrammatic assumptions and that the funding levels will be determined \nby the Appropriations Committee. It is true that the budget resolution \ndoes not dictate policy decisions to the Appropriations Committee. \nPolicy assumptions, nonetheless, are embodied in the numbers in the \nbudget resolution and allocated to the Appropriations Committee.\n  Since the spending levels in the Senate GOP budget plan for 2006 are \nthe same as those in the President's budget--except for a $100 increase \nin the Pell grant maximum, costing something over $400 million--I think \nit is only fair to assume that the resolution is tied to the \nPresident's policies. In fact, I have been assured on numerous \noccasions that is the case, that the budget they are putting before us \nin the Senate really embodies the President's priorities. I do not \nthink anybody would expect anything else given that the President's \nparty controls the Senate, controls the House, and they are, in effect, \npresenting the President's budget. That is why the amendment of Senator \nBingaman is important--to pay for these shortfalls in the programs that \nthe President's budget is cutting and that the Senate budget plan \nadopts.\n  Among the programs proposed for elimination are all vocational \neducation programs. Let me repeat that. The President's budget--and we \nassume by extension the budget before us by our colleagues on the \nSenate Budget Committee--eliminates all vocational education programs. \nVocational education programs are important. Not everybody is going to \ngo to college. Senator Kennedy presented information moments ago that \nshowed that 40 percent of those who are in the school-age population go \nto college. Only 18 percent complete college education on time. So a \nlot of people are dependent on vocational education programs to be \ncompetitive in this globalized world economy. If they are going to be \nable to compete with the best trained, best educated people in other \nparts of the world, they are going to need additional education. For \nmany people it is vocational programs that offer them that opportunity.\n  The President says eliminate vocational education programs. Eliminate \neducation technology State grants. I must say I think that is a \nmistake. I have been in the classes that benefit from the technology \ngrant program so that young people have an opportunity to learn the \nlatest technology. The President says eliminate that.\n\n  TRIO, Upward Bound and Talent Search--again, I have seen the TRIO \nPrograms and the difference they have made in schools all across my \nState. This provides an area of interest and opportunity for kids who \nmight not be interested in school otherwise. The President says \neliminate them.\n  Safe and drug-free State grants--the President's budget says \neliminate that. We have an epidemic in my State of methamphetamine \nabuse. Recently I was at a luncheon. A man was seated next to me whom I \nhave known very well for many years, and I could tell he was very down. \nHe seemed depressed to me.\n  I said to him: What's wrong?\n  He said: Nothing is wrong.\n  I knew something was wrong. I continued to press him. He finally told \nme that his son had just been picked up as a methamphetamine user, and \nthey had taken him to a treatment center. The treatment center told him \nthat morning that his son was addicted. This is something very \nprominent back in my home State of North Dakota. He was devastated. \nHere he has a son hooked on methamphetamine. It has been devastating \nfor the family. It has been a financial disaster. It has been a \ndisaster in every way for that family. We are going to say: We are just \nnot going to do drug-free State grants anymore, forget that--that is \nwhat the President's budget says--because it is more important, \napparently, much more important to give additional tax cuts to the \nwealthiest among us.\n  I indicated this morning that under the President's budget, tax cuts \nfor those earning over $1 million a year will cost $32 billion in this \nnext year, and $32 billion is the cost of the tax cuts just for those \nearning over $1 million year. We could restore the safe and drug-free \nState grants for $437 million. That is one-eightieth of what we are \ndoing for the very wealthiest among us. Comprehensive school reform, \nsmaller learning communities, teacher quality enhancement grants so \nthat teachers get additional training--he is going to eliminate them \nall.\n\n[[Page S2623]]\n\n  So Senator Bingaman has come before us and has said: No, we should \nnot be eliminating them all. That does not make sense. Instead, what we \nshould be doing is restoring those programs, and we should pay for it. \nHe says: Don't add to the deficit, don't just spend the money, raise \nthe money to pay for it. If education is critical to our future, and it \nis, if it is critical to our ability to compete in this intensely \ncompetitive world community, and it is, then let's pay for it. Senator \nBingaman does.\n  He doesn't just pay for it. He also provides a like amount of deficit \nreduction. How does he pay for it? He pays for it by closing certain \ncorporate tax loopholes. And, goodness knows, we have loads of them. \nWhen I was tax commissioner, I found one company that did business and \nhad a series of shell corporate entities, some of them operating out of \nthe Cayman Islands. The most profitable part of their worldwide company \nwas in the Cayman Islands with one employee. I used to say that was the \nmost successful, the most productive employee anywhere in the world \nbecause they showed hundreds of millions of dollars of profit in that \none entity because they avoided taxes everywhere else. They showed \ntheir profits in the Cayman Islands. They would have pricing between \nshell corporations, and they would sell at what it cost from one \ncorporation to another in places that had taxes, and then in the Cayman \nIslands they didn't have any taxes. All of a sudden, they showed \nhundreds of millions of dollars of profit. It is amazing--one person \ndoing all the work.\n\n  We have something going on in the country today that is a stunning \nabuse. We have individual cities and towns that are selling their sewer \nsystems and their transit systems. They are selling them to companies, \nand then depreciating those assets and taking the tax advantages from \nit, and then they make a big payment to the localities for the \nprivilege. If that isn't a dodge and a scam, I don't know what is.\n  Let me repeat that. It is hard to believe.\n  We have companies that go out and buy a sewer system from a town, and \nthen depreciate the sewer system, getting the tax advantages from the \ndepreciation. Those sewer systems were bought with taxpayer dollars in \nthe first place. Then the company gives the city a fee, buys the sewer \nsystem, at least gets it in their name for tax purposes, and then \ndepreciates the value of the system to cut down their taxes. They do \nthe same thing with transit systems and bus systems.\n  Congress moved, at the request of Senator Nickles and myself last \nyear, to close down some of these abusive operations, but more remain. \nThey didn't do them all. They didn't shut down all of them. We are \ntalking about billions of dollars.\n  Why wouldn't it be a better priority to shut down those scam \noperations and have vocational education in our schools? That is not \nwhat the President's budget does, and that is not what the budget \nbefore us does.\n  The largest reductions are in adult education assistance, which is \ncut by 63 percent in the budget before us. Some people may say, Adults \nshould have gotten educated when they were kids. It is a great idea, \nbut a lot of people didn't get educated when they were kids. They \ndidn't get sufficiently educated. Are we to say to them when they come \nback, Well, too bad, they are too late. Or, are we going to say, Good \nfor you, we are glad you have come back, and we are going to help make \nsure that you take every advantage of your God-given talents.\n  To me, that is a wise expenditure. The better educated we are, the \nbetter trained we are, the better we are going to do as a society. But \nthat is not the priority of this budget.\n  Let me say I think Senator Bingaman has done a favor to the body by \nbringing this matter to our attention. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport it.\n  On another matter, in these discussions today we have heard \nrepeatedly from our colleagues on the other side that if you cut taxes, \nyou get more money. I don't know where they came up with this idea: You \ncut taxes and you get more money. That is not what the evidence shows. \nYou cut taxes, you get less money. I have shown repeatedly on the floor \ntoday the charts that demonstrate the facts--not some ideological view, \nbut the facts.\n  The facts are that after 2001, with the significant tax cuts that \nwere passed and the subsequent tax cuts that were passed, signed by the \nPresident, the revenue of the United States dropped like a rock. For \nthe first time since World War II, we got less money year after year \nthan we had the year before. The last time we saw significant drops in \nrevenue was during the Reagan tax cuts of the 1980s.\n\n  I don't know where our friends get this idea that when you cut taxes \nyou get more money. It doesn't work that way. In the real world, we can \ntest these theories. It is fine to have a theory, but let us deal with \nfacts. The facts show conclusively that when taxes have been cut, we \nget less revenue than we would otherwise have received.\n  That doesn't mean you never have a tax cut. In 2001, I supported a \n$900 billion tax cut because our economy was weak, and it needed a \nlift. In fact, I supported a much bigger tax cut than the President's \ninitial proposal because he back-ended all of his tax cuts. He didn't \ndesign tax cuts to give lift to the economy at a time of weakness. He \nwas back-ending the tax cuts--small at the beginning and large at the \nend. We wound up with the worst of both. We wound up with large tax \ncuts in the beginning where we needed them to give lift to the economy \nand large at the end when we can't afford them, when the baby boomers \nare starting to retire.\n  I have showed the charts repeatedly here to demonstrate that the \nPresident has us on a course that does not and cannot possibly work. \nWhat we see in the President's plan is as the trust funds of Medicare \nand Social Security go cash negative, which happens in the next 20 \nyears, at that very time the cost of the President's tax cuts explodes, \ndriving us right over a cliff into deep deficits and deep debt. And we \nare already running record deficits. We are already running up \nunacceptable levels of debt. But for every problem, the President has \nthe same answer: Borrow the money. Got a problem with Social Security? \nBorrow--borrow over $4 trillion to solve it. You got a problem with \nfinancing tax cuts? Don't worry about it, borrow the money.\n  The President is fond of saying, It is the people's money. He is \nabsolutely right. It is the people's money. But guess what. It is also \nthe people's debt. This President is running up the people's debt at a \nrecord rate. The debt this year is going to increase by over $600 \nbillion. And every year of this budget that is before us--this budget \nwhich they have described as fiscally responsible, according to their \nown numbers--every year of this budget they are going to drive up the \ndebt of the country by another $600 billion--$600 billion, $600 \nbillion, $600 billion. Do that five times, that is $3 trillion in 5 \nyears of additional debt.\n  The President says, Well, there is a shortfall in Social Security. He \nis right. He says the shortfall over 75 years is $3.7 trillion. That is \nwhat the actuaries say.\n  What is the President's answer for the budget that he has sent us? \nHis answer is, First, take another $2.5 trillion out of Social Security \nto pay for his tax cuts and other things. Before you are done with \nthat, establish private accounts that cost another $750 billion over \nthe next 20 years. Take that out of Social Security, and borrow that.\n  The President ran as a compassionate conservative. The one thing I \nknow for certain is this is not conservative. There is nothing \nconservative about record deficits and record debt.\n  The President has said, Well, I came into office and we were \nattacked, and we had economic slowdown. Fair enough. That is true. We \nwere attacked, and that required us to spend more money. I think \nvirtually every Member here supported that. We had to spend more money \nfor defense and for homeland security. But the President also says he \ncame in a time of economic slowdown. That is also true. That is also \nfair. So we had tax cuts to give lift to the economy.\n\n  I didn't agree with his particular mix of tax cuts because they \noverwhelmingly benefited the wealthiest among us. The top 1 percent \nreceived 30 percent of the benefits of the President's tax cuts, and \nthey are not paying 30 percent of the tax load in this country. They \nare paying substantially less than 30 percent. Yet they got the biggest \nbenefit.\n\n[[Page S2624]]\n\n  We are past the point of having been attacked. We are still at war. \nThat is certainly the case. The President, in his budget, did not \nprovide the funding for the war past September 30 of this year. He did \nnot provide the money for this war. So that misleads the American \npeople as to our true fiscal condition. He did not provide the money to \nfix the alternative minimum tax. He did not provide the money to make \nthe Social Security changes that he has recommended. That is not really \na budget. I don't know exactly what I would term it, but it is not \nreally a budget. A budget is when you put down what you are going to \nspend and how much money we are going to bring in to pay for that \nspending.\n  The greatest fault I have with the budget before the Senate is it \nmakes no serious attempt to have the spending match the revenue. \nInstead, it tries to be all things to all people: More tax cuts for \nthose who want that, more spending for those who want that and, as a \nresult, massive deficits and a massive buildup in debt, all of it at \nthe worst possible time.\n  Why is it the worst possible time? It is the worst possible time \nbecause the baby boomers are about to retire. In 2008, just 3 years \naway, the leading edge of the baby boomers start to retire. Over a very \nshort period of time the number of people eligible for Medicare and \nSocial Security will double.\n  The President talks about that shortfall, but he does not do anything \nabout it. He said, no, he does not want to do anything about Medicare, \nalthough the shortfall there is eight times the shortfall of Social \nSecurity. He said we just passed a bill, so we should let that work \nbefore we do anything. That bill did not help reduce the Medicare \nshortfall, it increased it. It increased our unfunded liabilities by $8 \ntrillion.\n  The President said in his budget, cut the taxes more, increase the \nspending, leave out a lot of things that we know are going to cost us \nmoney and, lo and behold, he says, it will cut the deficit in half over \nthe next 5 years.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle say the same thing about \ntheir budget proposal. They say it will cut the deficit in half over \nthe next 5 years. But when you go to the budget document itself, what \nyou see is quite a different story. When we go to the budget document \nitself, what you see is what they predict the debt will increase by \nevery year of this budget. What we find is the debt will go up by $600 \nbillion a year each and every year of this 5-year budget. It is in \ntheir own document.\n  They say they are cutting the deficit in half. They have a very \ntortured definition of what the deficit is.\n  When I grew up a deficit was the shortfall. A deficit was a shortfall \nbetween what you are spending and what you are taking in. That is a \ndeficit. And the amount of the deficit is added to the debt. They have \nsaid in their document the debt will increase by $600 billion a year \nevery year for this 5-year budget. There is no cutting it in half. \nThere is no cutting it. It is almost the same year after year. And all \nof this before the baby boomers retire. The result is we are borrowing \nmoney from all over the world.\n  It is not only the budget deficit. The trade deficit is the biggest \nfactor. That is over $600 billion a year in a trade deficit. Our \nforeign borrowing in just 3 years under this President has increased \nalmost 100 percent. We had $1 trillion of foreign debt, debt held by \nforeigners in 2001. Now it is approaching $2 trillion. That is just \nthrough December of 2004. We ran a $600 billion trade deficit last \nyear, so the indebtedness, what we owe foreigners, has been \nskyrocketing. That is utterly unsustainable. That puts us at great \nrisk. If they decided not to show up to take our debt, we would be in \nbig trouble very fast.\n  This budget, I regret to say, does absolutely nothing about the \nserious problems facing our country. The overarching challenge facing \nAmerica is a buildup of deficits and debt, without question. The hard \nreality about this budget is it actually adds to the deficit in each \nand every year over just doing nothing. If we just put the Federal \nGovernment on autopilot and went home, we would be $130 billion better \noff in the deficit than if we pass this budget.\n  For 2006 alone this budget increases the deficit by $63 billion. Yet \nthey come to the Senate and talk about fiscal responsibility and fiscal \nrestraint and they are doing something about the deficit. They are \ndoing something about the deficit. They are making it worse. We do not \never hear them talk about doing anything about the debt because their \nbudget increases the debt every single year by over $600 billion, \naccording to their own calculations. They will increase the debt of \nthis country by $3 trillion in 5 years. And this is the crowd who said \nthey were going to have maximum paydown of the debt just 3 years ago. \nThe President told us he had a plan, that he could have these big tax \ncuts, defense buildup, massive tax cuts, that he was going to protect \nSocial Security, going to protect Medicare, and going to have maximum \npaydown of the debt.\n  The only problem with it is none of it worked. None of it added up. \nAnd the result is instead of paying down the debt, the debt has \nskyrocketed.\n  I see the Senator from Hawaii is in the Chamber. How much time would \nthe Senator like?\n  Mr. AKAKA. I ask for 10 minutes to speak on my amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield 10 minutes on the amendment off the \namendment time.\n\n\n                           Amendment no. 143\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for an \nimportant education amendment proposed by my colleague from New Mexico, \nSenator Bingaman, to S. Con. Res. 18, the fiscal year 2006 budget \nresolution.\n  Education is the key to our future. The continued economic growth and \nfuture prosperity of the United States depends on the quality of our \neducational system. But the President's fiscal year 2006 budget falls \nshort of that goal, and this resolution does nothing to remedy this \nfailure. It is the first budget in over a decade to cut funding for \neducation. Much of the cuts are directed towards new and unproven \ninitiatives at the expense of programs that almost everyone in the \neducation community supports. We must do everything we can to ensure \nthat children in this country get the best education available.\n  This budget resolution, like the President's budget, aims to \neliminate 48 effectual education programs for student success: programs \nthat prepare students to enter the workforce, such as adult education, \nprograms that help students to prepare for and thrive in college such \nas TRIO programs, Ppograms that improve teacher skills such as the \nTeacher Quality Enhancement program, programs that prepare children to \nbegin school such as Even Start, and programs that work to improve \nschools such as Comprehensive School Reform. S. Con. Res. 18 includes \nnothing to assure funding for these and other education programs.\n  One of the programs that the Bingaman amendment is working to restore \nis the Excellence in Economic Education Act. This program was included \nin the No Child Left Behind Act and works to promote economic and \nfinancial literacy in grades K through 12. There is a tremendous \nopportunity to instill in individuals the knowledge and skills that \nthey need to make good decisions throughout their lives during their \nyears in elementary and secondary education. This is particularly \nimportant as our students grow up in a world where we face more and \nmore complex decisions related to managing limited resources and \npreparing financially for the future.\n  The majority of the EEE's funding, after being competitively granted \nto a national organization, provides funds to State and local \npartnerships for teacher training, assistance to school districts \ndesiring to incorporate economics and personal finance into curricula, \nand evaluations of the impact of economic and financial literacy \neducation on students, related research, and school-based student \nactivities.\n  In Hawaii, a subgrant from the program is funding the development of \na pre- and post-test assessment tool that will allow the Hawaii Council \non Economic Education to measure the effectiveness of its teacher \ntraining courses and workshops. Another subgrant helped to fund a \ncalendar poster contest on basic economics concepts conducted among \nelementary school students in Hawaii. A final EEE subgrant is focusing \non enriching curriculum through economics. One of the wonderful things \nabout some of the projects\n\n[[Page S2625]]\n\nfunded by the EEE is that they are shared best practices, meaning that \nteachers and schools do not have to reinvent the wheel in the ways they \nconvey economics and personal finance education.\n  Entities across the country received much-needed resources for \neconomic and financial literacy through the EEE's first competitive \nsubgranting process in the year 2004. Although the results of the act's \nfirst-year grants have not yet been compiled for evaluation, the \nprogram needs a chance to work before it is arbitrarily terminated. I \nam pleased that the Bingaman amendment will work to give the program \nthis chance.\n  The cost for this and other programs included in the Bingaman \namendment will be $4.8 billion. However, this amendment is more than \noffset by various tax loophole closures and other reduction measures. \nNot only is this amendment revenue neutral, but it provides for \nfiscally responsible deficit reduction. Educating our children and \nreducing the budget deficit are both vital endeavors, and the Bingaman \namendment does both.\n  Mr. President, as I said at the start of my statement, this budget \nresolution is a false promise. It underfunds education and shortchanges \nour future. It deprives our schoolchildren of needed programs and \nopportunities. It underfunds some, and cancels others outright. But we \ncannot afford to shortchange our schools. We cannot afford to \nshortchange our students. We cannot afford to shortchange our \ncommunities. And we cannot afford to shortchange our future. Again, I \ncommend my colleague, Senator Bingaman, for offering this important \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I alert colleagues that we are going to \nhave a vote on the Bingaman amendment.\n  I ask the Chair, has that vote been set?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has been set for 5:30.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So in a half hour colleagues can expect a vote on the \nBingaman amendment. I urge colleagues who might want to comment on that \namendment or on the budget to take this time to come to the floor, and \nI remind colleagues that under the budget resolution we are limited to \n50 hours. We took 5 hours off before we started. Today we started at 10 \no'clock this morning, so we have used up another 7 hours. So we have \nroughly 38 hours left at this point. This is time that really should \nnot be wasted. I urge my colleagues to come, make their statements, \nspeak on the Bingaman amendment, and in a half hour we will be voting.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about the Bingaman \namendment. As I understand this amendment, it would increase spending \nby $4.7 billion, approximately, it would increase taxes by \napproximately $8 billion, and it would break the caps set in this \nresolution. The purpose of those caps is to try to control spending. \nThe first amendment out of the box breaks the caps--spends more money, \nraises more taxes. I think it can be justly characterized as a tax-and-\nspend amendment.\n  It is in an area where this President has done an extraordinary job \nof making a commitment of resources. In comparison to the prior \nPresident, for example, the numbers are quite staggering. This \nPresident has increased educational funding overall by almost 33.3 \npercent since coming to office. He has increased funding for No Child \nLeft Behind by almost 46 percent since it started. He has increased \ntitle I spending by 52 percent over the Clinton administration and IDEA \nfunding by 75 percent over the Clinton administration.\n  In fact, compared to the Clinton administration, which asked for no \nincreases in title I and no increases of any significance in special \neducation until the last year of his Presidency, this President has \nevery year asked for over a half a billion dollars in special education \nand over a billion dollars of increase in title I. As a result, there \nhas been a dramatic increase of resources flowing into those four core \nprograms of Federal education at the elementary school level.\n  In addition, in the Pell grant level, this administration has also \nmade a huge commitment, increasing funding over the last year of the \nClinton administration by almost 56 percent and adding literally \nmillions of more young students to the Pell grant program. And the \nbudget resolution goes even further. Right now you can get a $4,050 \nPell grant. This budget resolution will immediately move that up to \n$4,150 which costs about a half a billion dollars to do that, and we \nput in a special account to accomplish that.\n\n  In addition, we have structured this budget so that there is a \ncapacity to accelerate the forgiveness of loans to students and move \nthose loans over from the loan side to the grant side, the Pell side, \nso that a student under this budget will actually be able to get $5,100 \nin what amounts to Pell grants, if they go to school for 4 years, \ncomplete their education within 4 years, whether they to go a regular \n4-year college or a community college for 2 years and then transfer \ninto a 4-year college. That is a huge commitment to students who are \nworking to get their degrees in college and using Pell grants to assist \nthem. It is dramatic.\n  In addition, this budget sets up a $5.5 billion reserve fund to allow \nthe education committee, chaired by Senator Enzi, to pass out the \nHigher Education Act reauthorization. That is new money for the Higher \nEducation Act. And so this budget focuses a lot of energy on education. \nThis President has dramatically increased funding for education.\n  So what happened? Well, the President suggested that the way you get \nthis money for education, or part of it, is you look at all these \ndifferent programs that are filtered around the Federal Government. \nThey got there for well-intentioned purposes but mostly because \nsomebody had an idea, and they decided the Federal Government should \nhave a program here or a program there, and they are not major in the \nsense of money compared to title I or special education or Pell. They \nare not big pools of money. They are targeted initiatives.\n  The President said in his proposal: Let's look at those targeted \ninitiatives, see if they are still essential in comparison to what is \ncritical, which is that we make a strong commitment to special \neducation, a strong commitment to title I, a strong commitment to No \nChild Left Behind, and a strong commitment to Pell grants.\n  That is a reasonable approach. It is called prioritization. That is \nwhat we should do as a government because we are supposed to be \nconservators of our people's money--otherwise known as tax dollars--not \nsimply throw it at every program that comes down the road, but actually \ntry to pick out the ones that are successful and put the money behind \nwhat is legitimately the Federal role, not what is necessarily a State \nrole or a community role, which is what many of these individual \nsmaller programs are. They are programs that the States or the \ncommunities could decide to pursue, but we have decided to try to \nfederalize some small section of them because they make a good press \nrelease or in some instances they have strong constituencies.\n  So the President said: Let's look at this and try to prioritize. As a \nresult, we have come up with a budget which dramatically increases over \nthe last year of the Clinton administration the funding for title I, \nspecial education, No Child Left Behind, and Pell grants, and sets up a \nfund to be able to take care of higher education.\n  It is not appropriate, in light of this, that we should throw away \nfiscal constraint and essentially say we are no longer going to be \nconcerned about\n\n[[Page S2626]]\n\nmanaging the dollars that are spent here at the Federal level on \neducation; we are simply going to raise taxes and pay for all sorts of \nadditional programs.\n  This amendment breaches the cap by almost $5 billion, raises taxes by \nover $8 billion, and it is nothing more than a tax-and-spend amendment. \nIt should also be pointed out--and I will make this point on every one \nof these targeted amendments--that there is nothing in this amendment \nthat will require the Appropriations Committee or the authorizing \ncommittee to spend this money on education. This money could be spent \non roads, national defense, or homeland security. When you break the \ncap, when you raise these taxes, you do nothing more than put a number \nin the budget resolution that says we are going to break the cap by $5 \nbillion. We are going to raise taxes by over $8 billion--I believe it \nis $8 billion.\n  It is $9.5 billion. They are raising the taxes by $9.5 billion. I \nunderestimated them.\n  In any event, all you are going to do is increase the cap--increase \nspending and increase taxes--and there is absolutely no guarantee, or \neven a likelihood, that this money will flow as the sponsor of the \namendment wants it to because, for whatever reason, the Appropriations \nCommittee does not take seriously suggestions from the Budget \nCommittee. The Appropriations Committee does whatever it wants to do.\n  Under the rules of the Senate and under the law and under the Budget \nAct, that is the way it is supposed to work. We give them a top-line \nnumber, which happens to be $843 billion. If this amendment were to \npass, it would be $447 billion or $848 billion. We give them a top-line \nnumber, and they can spend it any way they want. So the representation \nthat this is going to take care of some education program that happened \nto be passed, one of these specific little programs that has been \nlisted here is just that--a representation--and it has very little \nviability or probability when it gets into the contest of other demands \nfor spending within the appropriating process.\n  So this amendment, which raises taxes by $9.5 billion and raises \nspending by $5 billion, or approximately that--$4.75 billion--\naccomplishes nothing more than to show that we are not a fiscally \ndisciplined exercise here, and the first amendment out of the box from \nthe other side of the aisle reinforces once again that fiscal \ndiscipline is not high on the agenda when it comes to this budget and \nwhen it comes to some Members of this body. I hope people will oppose \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, our dear colleague left out one very \nimportant fact about this amendment. This amendment does restore the \ncuts to education, but it does another thing: it reduces the deficit by \na like amount. So this amendment restores the cuts to education, but it \nraises additional money through the closing of corporate tax loopholes \nto also reduce the deficit by $4.75 billion.\n  When the Senator talks about fiscal responsibility--I know it is a \nnew idea on their side--fiscal responsibility is actually reducing the \ndeficit. This amendment supports education and reduces the deficit. \nThat is something that is critically important that we do. I know the \nbudget from our friends on the other side doesn't reduce the deficit, \nthough they say it does. If you examine the document itself, look on \npage 5 and see how it increases the debt each and every year by more \nthan $600 billion, by their own calculation. It demonstrates that this \nis not a fiscally responsible budget. To use ``fiscally responsible'' \nin attachment to this budget is truly farfetched.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is seeking time to speak. How much \ntime would the Senator like? We have the vote at 5:30. We should \nprobably retain some time for Senator Bingaman, if he would like to \nclose.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Five or 6 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts. If \nhe seeks additional time, we may be able to provide that as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a budget is supposed to be a reflection \nof our Nation's priorities. Unfortunately, when it comes to education, \nwhat we are saying in this national budget is we will spend 2 cents out \nof every Federal dollar on education. Do you hear me? If we went to any \ngroup of Americans across this country and asked them, what do you \nthink your priorities are, what do you think we ought to spend on \neducation, I bet 9 out of 10 would say, out of every dollar we ought to \nspend more than 2 cents. Under this budget, it is 2 cents out of every \ndollar. That is basically what this Budget Committee has given us.\n  This is against a background where the U.S. is falling further and \nfurther behind every other nation in the key ingredients. If you look \nat where the U.S. was in 1975 in terms of math and science, the U.S. \nwas third in the world. If you look at the year 2000, we are 15th in \nthe world. Why is it that after World War II, when we had the return of \nservice men and women who fought for this country, 5 cents out of the \nFederal budget went to education? Why is it that when the Russians \nchallenged us with Sputnik, we went to 5 cents out of every dollar in \neducation? Now we are going to 2 cents. We are challenged globally, not \nonly economically with the outsourcing of jobs and the rush of low-\npaying jobs, but we are going to be challenged in terms of national \nsecurity as well, make no mistake about it.\n  We are talking about investing in the young minds of this country. \nWhat we are finding is a continued deterioration in that commitment. \nYou can go back and fiddle around with all of the statistics and \npercentages you want--we are not, as a nation, investing in math and \nscience in the education of our young people. In this budget, under the \nRepublicans now, we find that there is ample opportunity to give \nanother $70 billion in tax breaks, but they will not provide that kind \nof investment in our children in terms of their future in math and \nscience and other education. That is the issue. Senator Conrad pointed \nout that this is paid for. Yes, this will also provide a reduction in \nour deficit. The question is: Do you want to invest in education of the \nyoung people of this country? We are seeing where we stand.\n  We need this amendment because this amendment will make a difference. \nIt makes a difference in a number of different areas. We just voted in \nthe Senate 98 to 0, in terms of the Perkins legislation, to provide \nadditional skills opportunities. I listened last week, when we wanted \nan increase in the minimum wage, to my friend from Wyoming say that \nwhat we need in this country is to give people skills. I believe we \nought to provide that opportunity. But under the administration and \nthis budget program, there is a cutback.\n  My friend from New Hampshire says: Oh, no, this isn't really a \ncutback. This budget is really an accumulation of our recommendations \nto the Senate. The fact is they have accepted completely the \nPresident's budget in terms of cuts. They say we will accept what the \nPresident recommended in terms of cuts, and those cuts are there in \neducation. There are cutbacks on training, skills, and on school \ndropout programs. Is there anyone in this body who has visited a school \nand has talked to teachers or parents or school boards or principals \nwho does not understand what we are facing in this Nation in terms of \nthe school dropouts, cutting back on education, trying to provide \nadditional technical education to the children of this country?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire points out all of the increases we \nhave seen in the Pell grants in recent years. He and I must have \ndifferent books because I have the Department of Education Fiscal Year \n2005 Budget Summary.\n  I have it right here. Under Pell grants, if you look at that, a third \nof the way down, it talks about 203, 204, and 205 requests, and they \nvirtually are identical.\n  Anybody in this Chamber who visits their local schools will find out \nthe challenges that are presented to those schools. This Nation better \nfigure out it better have more than 2 cents out of every dollar going \nto education. That is absolutely essential. The Bingaman amendment will \nmake an important difference, and I hope this body is willing to accept \nit.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S2627]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, after consulting with the Democratic leader \nof the committee, Senator Conrad, we reached the following agreement. I \nask unanimous consent that Senator Bennett be recognized after the vote \nfor half an hour; Senator Conrad will control the time until 8:45 p.m. \nAt 8:45 p.m., Senator Stevens will be recognized for an hour, and the \ntime running on the vote will be charged to both sides and come off the \ntime of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it is our understanding that when Senator \nStevens is done, we will end for the day.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct, except for wrap-up by the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the understanding of the Chair.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. With that, we have a good agreement, \nand we also understand between us that if there are Members who feel \nexcluded in some way we will work to be flexible and give people some \ntime, perhaps trade out time in some way to make sure people have a \nchance to speak.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator \nBingaman's amendment to restore funding for education. I am pleased to \nbe a co-sponsor of this critical amendment. And while I am unable to be \npresent in the Senate today to vote, I would like the Congressional \nRecord to reflect that if I were present, I would have voted aye.\n  The Republican budget is nothing short of an assault on education. It \ncuts education for the first time in a decade, does not provide \nsufficient funding to sustain current levels of funding for all \nprograms, provides virtually no increases to Title I or IDEA, and \nneglects to fund any new initiatives.\n  One of the most egregious examples is the lack of funding for No \nChild Left Behind, NCLB. At a time when our schools are struggling to \nmeet the requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act, the Republican \nbudget provides $12 billion less than was promised, including $947.5 \nmillion less for New York, bringing the total funding shortfall since \nNCLB was passed to almost $40 billion. If enacted, that would mean \n296,648 children who are eligible for Title I will be denied services. \nThis budget leaves behind 3 million disadvantaged students who would \nreceive services if the Republicans had kept their promise for funding \nfor No Child Left Behind.\n  This budget also fails to provide what is needed for special \neducation, and it does so just 3 months after the President signed the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act into law. This budget \nbetrays the bipartisan funding agreement contained in that law by \nfunding special education at $3.6 billion below the promised level. As \na result, funding for IDEA would provide just 18.6 percent of the \nnational average per-pupil expenditure toward meeting the excess cost \nof educating students with disabilities--still less than half of the 40 \npercent ``full funding'' level that Congress committed to paying when \nthe IDEA was first adopted 30 years ago.\n  The resolution before the Senate today provides minimal increases to \nTitle I and IDEA, but pays for them by abolishing and slashing funding \nfor programs that have a big impact on at-risk students. Among the \nprograms targeted for elimination are technology grants that help close \nthe digital divide, safe and drug-free schools, the dropout prevention \nprogram, alcohol abuse reduction, elementary school counseling, arts in \neducation, and smaller learning communities. The budget also abolishes \nthe school leadership initiative, a program that I was proud to help \ndesign back in 2001 and which has provided critical funding to recruit \nand retain talented principals to lead our troubled schools.\n  At the same time that the President has proposed to eliminate the \nschool counseling program, only 1 in 5 children with mental health \nproblems receives services in any given year. The current counselor-to-\nstudent ratio in elementary and secondary schools is 1 to 560, roughly \n9 percent higher than it was last year, and over double the ratio of 1 \nto 250 recommended by such organizations as the American School Health \nAssociation.\n\n  And while the President has proposed to eliminate the dropout \nprevention program, the Nation faces a dropout crisis. According to \nestimates by the Civil Rights Project and the Urban Institute, 50 \npercent of Black and 53 percent of Latino youth complete high school on \ntime.\n  The budget also eliminates several early intervention programs that \nhelp disadvantaged students prepare for and succeed in college. GEAR \nUP, a Clinton administration initiative that prepares entire grade \nlevels of low-income students for college, would be abolished; a move \nthat would deny services to 20,086 New York students. The TRIO programs \nUpward Bound and Talent Search, which provide tutoring, mentoring and \ncollege counseling services to 19,000 New York students, would suffer \nthe same fate. Senator Bingaman's amendment would restore these \nvaluable programs.\n  Senator Bingaman's amendment would also restore funding for Even \nStart, a family literacy program that serves low-income communities. \nLast year, New York received $19 million for this program. The \nRepublican budget provides nothing. I worked with Senator Snowe to \nspearhead a letter to the Appropriations Committee in October of last \nyear asking for $250 million for this program, and I will do so again \nif this amendment is unsuccessful.\n  Ironically, this budget also eliminates the Perkins Vocational \nEducation program, a program that this body voted 99 to 0 to maintain \nlast Thursday. In New York, the Perkins program helps approximately \n275,000 high school students and 200,000 postsecondary students in New \nYork attain technical skills to launch successful careers in the 21st \ncentury. Yet the Republicans propose to abolish it. Along with Senator \nCollins and 30 of my colleagues, I sent a letter to the Budget \nCommittee specifically asking them to maintain this program. I am \ndisappointed that the will of so many Senators was ignored.\n  Fundamentally, this budget is a reflection of our values and our \npriorities. And the message the Republican budget sends is loud and \nclear: our children and the schools they attend are low on the list. I \nhope this body will support Senator Bingaman's amendment, which takes \nan important step toward putting children closer to the top.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak very briefly. I gather \nwe will have a vote in 3 minutes on my amendment. I wish to speak very \nbriefly to summarize what it does and urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  The amendment very simply tries to restore in this budget the funds \nthat the President has recommended we eliminate for various educational \nprograms and that this budget also recommends we eliminate for various \neducational programs.\n  There is a long list of educational programs that is slated for \ntermination in this budget. There are 48 programs. Some of them are \nprograms about which many of us have spoken very eloquently. The \nVocational Education Program, the Perkins legislation we passed last \nweek, is a good example. We had a 99-to-0 vote in the Senate to \nreauthorize the legislation for vocational education, most of which is \nin our high schools, that is contained in that Perkins legislation.\n  This budget, the budget the President has sent us, would eliminate \nfunding for that program. We have a great many other programs--Arts in \nEducation; the GEAR UP program, which is focused on trying to assist \nminority students and economically disadvantaged students to go on to \ncollege; the TRIO program; the Upward Bound Program which, again, \nserves many students in my State and throughout the country. These are \nall programs that I\n\n[[Page S2628]]\n\nhear about when I go back to schools in my State. People say these are \ngood programs. They are programs that are helping our students. They \nare, in fact, strengthening our high schools.\n  I know the administration's position is that we should concentrate on \nhigh schools this year and perhaps next year. That is the President's \ndesire, that No Child Left Behind should also be extended into our high \nschools. I favor doing that, but I also believe very strongly that we \nneed to keep the programs in place that are helping our high schools. \nWe need to build on the successes we have had, not eliminate the \nsuccesses we have had.\n  I feel very strongly that unless we add this additional money and \nkeep these programs in place, we will, in fact, be putting our schools \nback rather than forward.\n  One other program I wish to mention which is slated for termination \nin the President's budget and, of course, in this budget that is \npresented to us in the Smaller Learning Communities Program. We are \nspending in the current year $94.5 million in that program. That is a \nprogram to help primarily high schools to restructure so they can \nprovide smaller learning environments for their students. This is an \nextremely important concept. I am persuaded that much of the dropout \nproblem in our schools is the result of the fact that we are sending \nstudents into very large high schools. We need to help them restructure \ninto smaller learning communities. These grants help to do that.\n  I believe very strongly that we should be increasing that funding, \nnot eliminating it. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support \nthe amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 143. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent.

Mr. President, for the information of Members, we will now \nhave a number of speakers, but there will be no additional votes this \nevening.\n  Senator Conrad and I are working on an agreement, hopefully, so we \ncan line up votes for tomorrow and debate for tomorrow morning, and \nhopefully on those amendments which will be related to Social Security, \nassuming agreement is reached.\n  At this time, I believe the unanimous consent agreement calls for \nSenator Bennett to be recognized for half an hour, followed by Senator \nConrad having the time until 8:45, at which time Senator Stevens will \nbe recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the Budget Act indicates that during \nevery budget debate there should be a period of time discussing the \ngeneral economy. As the past chair and current vice chair of the Joint \nEconomic Committee, I feel I am in a position to do that. I want to \nshare with my colleagues a statement of where the economy is now, and \nthen make a few comments about where it may be going and talk about the \nfuture.\n  Naturally, you can't have a conversation about the economy without \ncharts. That seems to be one of the essentials for any economic \ndiscussion. So I brought a fair number of charts to outline the economy \nto the Members of the Senate.\n  This first chart is an historic chart that goes back to the years of \nthe early 1970s. All of the bars above the lines are quarters of \neconomic growth. They are measured in GDP growth, the percentage of \ngrowth in the gross domestic product. The bars below the lines are \nquarters of gross domestic production shrinkage where the economy \ncontracted.\n  If we go back to this period in the early 1980s, we see what the \neconomists call the double dip, the dreaded period where the economy \ngoes into recession, comes out of it, and then slips back into \nrecession. Those who are old enough to remember the early 1980s \nremember how difficult a time that really was. I have a very clear \nmemory of one of my associates in that period of time who said to me: \nBob, be very, very grateful you have a job. Unemployment was high, \nbusiness activity was off, the economy was recovering, or attempting to \nrecover from the great inflation.\n  We talk about the 1930s as the days of the Great Depression. The late \n1970s were the days of the great inflation. All kinds of things were \nhappening. I remember running a business in this period and going to \nthe bank to borrow money and feeling very fortunate I was able to \nborrow money at a 21-percent interest rate to support my business. The \nfolks on the late-night comic shows were talking about the height of \nthe interest rates. I remember one who said Jimmy Carter is the only \nPresident in history whose approval rating is below the prime rate.\n  We came out of that period with the help of a combination of activity \nby the Federal Reserve with Paul Volcker, actions by the Congress, and \ntax cuts under President Ronald Reagan. We survived through this, and \nwe had a period of tremendous economic growth, the strong recovery out \nof the recession, and then, after that recovery had taken hold and \ngained traction, a period of good economic growth. Then we went into \nthe recession that occurred during the Presidency of the first \nPresident Bush--much milder than the dreaded double dip of the 1980s \nbut, nonetheless, a period of contraction. The recovery was not as \nstrong as this one following the double dip because it did not have \nthat much to rebound from. But we had that recovery and then a period \nof strong economic growth until we come to the recession from which we \nhave just emerged.\n  Interestingly, this, by technical definition, was not a recession \nbecause the technical definition of a recession is at least two \nsuccessive quarters of shrinkage in the gross domestic production. We \nnever had two successive quarters. What we had were three quarters, not \nin succession; by historic standards, we had a very mild contraction in \nthe size of the economy.\n  This was, perhaps, the shortest and shallowest recession that we have \nhad in our history. We did not have that strong a recovery.\n  When I asked Alan Greenspan why the recovery was not taking hold, he \nsaid because the recession was so short\n\n[[Page S2629]]\n\nand shallow. If you want a really strong recovery like the one we had \nafter the double dip, you have to be coming out of a recession as bad \nas the one at that time. So we can be grateful.\n  The recent recovery finally got traction in the second half of 2003, \nand we see now we are in a period of very strong economic growth, which \nby historic standards is as good as the economic growth we had in the \nother two areas. The light blue at the end is what the economists are \nforecasting for the balance of 2005. But interestingly enough, already \nthe newspapers are saying those forecasts may be too conservative. As \nthey go back and look at the business activity in the first quarter of \n2005, they are saying 2005 may very well be a better year than is being \nforecast. Those are the figures and the statistics for the economy as a \nwhole.\n  Now we will look at the question of jobs. We heard a lot of rhetoric \nprior to the election about how bad the job situation was. The \nbackground shaded areas in the figure are the areas of recession. You \nsee the unemployment numbers superimposed upon the historic periods of \nrecession. From the period of the double dip, we saw unemployment get \ninto double digits--10.8 percent was the peak. Then it came back down \nand in this area which is about 7 percent you would feel, OK, the \nemployment picture has gotten good again. We are down from 10.8 down \ninto the 7-percent range. Then, as the economy became even stronger, \nthe unemployment rate fell down. When the recession hit in the early \n1990s, unemployment came back up to 7.8 percent, a very large increase \nfrom where it had been, but in historic terms not that bad. When the \nrecovery took hold, this time unemployment came all the way down to \nabout 4 percent. Then the recession hit and unemployment spiked at 6.3 \npercent.\n\n  I remember when I took economics in college they told me 6-percent \nunemployment was full employment--that the economy could not employ \nmore people than that without heating up with inflation. We found out \nthat was not true here. True to the pattern, the peak was reached at \n6.3. It is now falling back. Unemployment is at 5.4 percent, well below \nthe averages of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. The economy in these \ncategories is behaving as it has throughout our past history.\n  Another look at jobs. Here are the jobs per month created since the \nrecovery took hold. We can see it was in the second half of 2003 that \nthe recovery took hold. We started creating new jobs in May of 2003, \nand while it was anemic for a while, then it really took off in the \nfirst part of 2004 and on through. We have had 21 months of increased \nemployment every single month, and we have created over 3 million jobs \nin that period of time. The economy continues to show signs of creating \njobs because jobless claims, which are the forecast of new jobs, have \nbeen falling.\n  Once again, this is the period of the recent recession and jobless \nclaims were going up and peaked in that period. They flattened out. \nWhen the recovery took hold in the middle of 2003, they started down in \n2003 and they continue to trend downward, indicating that the increase \nin jobs is something we can look forward to for a fairly good period of \ntime ahead.\n  Business activity, dividing between service and manufacturing \nactivity: We can see that for the manufacturing sector the recession \nwas very difficult. The blue line shows expansion or contraction. \nManufacturing started down in early 2000, went below the line and \nstayed there until 2002, briefly came back up, and then dipped below \nagain in the first part of 2003. Once again, that is when the recovery \ntook hold and manufacturing has been in positive territory ever since. \nServices have done better than manufacturing all the way and both of \nthem remain in the position of expansion.\n  During that period, however, inflation has remained well under \ncontrol. Here are the inflation numbers. The Consumer Price Index, in \nthe dark blue, has come down and remained fairly low, but the personal \nconsumption expenditures price index, which is the inflation measure \nthat the Federal Reserve uses to determine what is going on with \ninflation, is even lower and is staying more stable.\n  So the recovery has taken hold in all sectors, manufacturing as well \nas services. Jobs are coming back, and the forecasters say we will have \neconomic growth at or above the level we enjoyed during the 1990s, at \nleast through 2005.\n  What about the deficits? We keep hearing a lot of conversation about \ndeficits around here and people saying: Well, maybe the economy is \ndoing that well, but it is all because of runaway deficits.\n  Here again is the historic pattern of deficits. You can see the \ndeficits spiked as a percentage of GDP during the 1980 double dip. It \ngot to 6 percent GDP. In the recession of the early 1990s, it did not \nget that high. It was a little bit under 5 percent. This last one has \nbeen under 4 percent. The deficit peaked at a lower level than the \npeaks of the two preceding recessions. The dotted line that is shown \nhere is CBO's projection of where the deficit is going as a percentage \nof GDP.\n  Now, you can say: How can it be falling as a percentage of GDP when \nit is going up in total dollars? Well, if it is rising less rapidly \nthan GDP is growing, it is falling as a percentage of GDP.\n  Let's look at the numbers behind the deficit to see what is happening \nwith respect to revenues. Here are the tax revenues as a percentage of \nGDP, again in historic context. They peaked in 1969-1970. And then when \nthe recession hit, they fell. Here is the double dip, 1980-1982. Just \nbefore that recession, they peaked. The recession hit, and revenues \nfell dramatically.\n  The last one, 1990-1991, they did not come back up that much. But \nthey fell as soon as the recession came along.\n  Then we had the revenues to a historic high as a percentage of GDP, \nup over 21 percent, coming at the time of the dot-com bubble.\n  One of the things that was responsible for this tremendous rise was \nthe capital gains revenues. We in the Congress cut the capital gains \ntax rate from 28 percent to 20 percent and produced 5 times--5 times--\nthe capital gains realizations that CBO had projected. There were so \nmany people with so much inflated value in their stock who took \nadvantage of that capital gains tax cut, who cashed it all in and paid \nthat capital gains tax, and that pushed the revenue to unprecedented \nhighs as a percentage of GDP.\n  The combination of the collapse of the dot-com bubble, and the \ncollapse of the stock market that came along as a result, and the \nrecession drove receipts down. And, yes, the tax cuts played a role \nthere. There are those who were saying the tax cuts were solely \nresponsible for this. The data do not support that. But they came back \ndown.\n  What is happening is they are coming back up, as they always have. \nAfter every recession, revenues have come back as a percentage of GDP. \nAnd here are the specifics of how they have come up in fiscal 2005, in \nthe years we have been operating in this fiscal year. The corporate \nincome tax is up 50 percent from where it was a year ago. Payroll taxes \nare up 6 percent of where they were a year ago. Personal income taxes \nare up 10 percent of where they were a year ago. That is a clear \nindication, once again, that the recovery has taken hold and it is \nproducing the standard historic response to a recovery after a \nrecession. Revenues increase as the recovery takes hold.\n  The overall number is 9 percent. All total revenues are 9 percent \nhigher than they were in the previous year's corresponding months. \nTotal spending in that period is up 7 percent. That includes the war. \nThat includes the supplementals. That includes all of the things we \nhave done here. Total spending is up 7 percent higher than it was the \nprevious year. But total revenue is up 9 percent higher than it was the \nprevious year. So the recovery is taking hold and the deficit as a \npercentage of GDP is, in fact, staying within historic norms.\n\n  Now, I do not want to leave the impression from all of this that the \nfuture, therefore, is completely rosy and we do not need to worry about \nthe deficit or that we do not need to worry about the future of the \neconomy because lying there in our future is a major challenge. This \nhas been talked about many times on the floor by Senators from both \nsides of the aisle. But I want to dramatize it with this set of charts.\n  I go back to fiscal 1966. Why did I pick fiscal 1966? That was the \nfirst year we began to see spending for Medicare.\n\n[[Page S2630]]\n\nMedicare was passed prior to that time, but they had to gear up for it. \nThey had to do the kinds of preparations they are doing now with \nrespect to the drug benefit, so that the first time you began to see \nspending for Medicare was 1966.\n  All right. These colors on the chart demonstrate how the budget was \ndivided. The big portion of the budget, the dark blue, is defense \nspending. Defense spending in 1966 was 44 percent of the Federal \nbudget.\n  The light blue is non-defense discretionary spending. That was \neverything else. That was highways. That was education. That was \ncourthouses. That was the Customs Office. That was everything we did in \nGovernment, which was 23 percent. Interest costs on the national debt \nwere 7 percent. And the red, the mandatory spending, was 26 percent, \nthe mandatory spending primarily being Social Security.\n  All right. That is what it was when the Medicare spending started.\n  Now, look what has happened today. This is 2004. The mandatory \nspending has grown to 54 percent. It is like a Pac-Man beginning to \nclose in on everything else. The defense discretionary, even while we \nare at war, has shrunk to 20 percent of the budget. The nondefense \ndiscretionary is at 19 percent. It shrunk a little from where it was \nbefore, but close to the same. The interest costs are steady at 7 \npercent of the budget. But we have seen mandatory spending go from \nabout 25 percent in 1966 to 54 percent in 2004.\n  Now let's go out in a projection. This is not a projection into the \nfar distant future. This is only 10 years. We can be a little more \nconfident of a 10-year projection than we can a 20-or 30-year \nprojection. See how the Pac-Man portion of this circle is growing. \nMandatory spending is now up to 62 percent. Defense discretionary has \nshrunk to 14 percent. Nondefense discretionary has shrunk to 15 \npercent, and interest costs have grown to 8 percent.\n  If you project this out, as this begins to take over all of the \nchart, the one thing that will challenge it is not defense spending and \nnot discretionary spending, it is interest costs. As this begins to \ngrow to the point where we cannot cover it, then we borrow more and \nmore, and you will see the yellow begin to push the red back. You would \nsee the yellow begin to take over where the red took over first.\n\n  I make this point because, as we are dealing with this budget, we \nshould remember the impact of mandatory spending. I use this figure to \nillustrate this point to my constituents who say to us: The deficit \nmust be brought under control. You in Congress must stop spending. You \nhave to show some spending discipline, or the deficit will overwhelm \nus.\n  Let me give you two numbers. The President's budget proposal is for \n$2.7 trillion. The amount of discretionary spending that we are \ndebating in this budget is $843 billion, and that $843 billion includes \ndefense. That is why it says defense discretionary. If you take defense \noff the table on the grounds that we are at war and say, all right, you \nare going to have to balance the budget and bring the deficit under \ncontrol by controlling spending, the only portion of spending over \nwhich we have any authority becomes 19 percent of the total budget. The \nother 81 percent will go on regardless of what we do.\n  That is why we have to have the courage, looking ahead at this that \nis coming, to say somehow we have to roll back the mandatory spending. \nYou cannot balance a budget of $2.7 trillion by shaving down a \npercentage of discretionary spending. If we were to have an across-the-\nboard cut of 10 percent of all discretionary spending, we would have a \ncry of outrage on this floor that would be heard all over the country. \nA 10-percent across-the-board cut? A 10-percent across-the-board cut \nfor IDEA? A 10-percent across-the-board cut for food stamps? A 10-\npercent across-the-board cut for everything we do in Government? \nAbsolutely not. But if we were to enact that 10-percent across-the-\nboard cut, ignoring the mandatory spending, that would yield only about \n$80 billion out of a budget of $2.7 trillion. To use a phrase that all \nof the politicians in the room can understand, that is within the \nmargin of error. And $80 billion out of a budget of $2.7 trillion makes \nlittle or no impact.\n  That is why in this budget debate we should keep in mind two things: \nFirst, as I hope I have illustrated, right now the economy is strong. \nIt is robust. The recovery has taken hold. Jobs are being created. The \ndeficit is coming down as a percentage of GDP. Things are moving in the \nright direction virtually across the board.\n  However, if we do not now exhibit the courage to start taking steps \nto hold down mandatory spending, all of the present work that we have \ndone to make the economy solid, sound, and strong will be for naught. \nIt will be overwhelmed by a sea of red ink, coming not from the fact \nthat Congress is being profligate in the appropriations that we make \nand spending decisions we make, but coming from the fact that we did \nnot have the courage to deal with the mandatory programs.\n  Now I have talked about Medicare, and that is the one that seems to \nhave the greatest pressure. But we are also talking about Social \nSecurity, a mandatory program. We are talking about Medicaid, a \nmandatory program. We are talking about farm subsidies, a mandatory \nprogram. We are talking about the kinds of things that politicians have \na very tough time addressing. This budget begins to address the \nmandatory programs very slightly, very gently, and in very small \namounts. But they have already set off alarms of complaint around the \nCapitol that ``you are trying to balance the budget on the backs of the \npoor.'' That is a great slogan, and nobody wants to balance the budget \non the backs of the poor, but we have to recognize that if the economy \ngoes into the tank because of runaway spending, driven by mandatory, it \nwill be the poor who will pay the heaviest price.\n  I remember during the 1990s, when we were enjoying as much expansion \nas we were in the gross domestic product, one of my colleagues asked \nAlan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve: who benefited \nmost from this boom? He was expecting Greenspan to say it was the rich \nbecause look how rich they have become. He was a little surprised when \nChairman Greenspan said--and I agree with what he said: Without \nquestion, this good economy has primarily benefited the poor.\n\n  My colleague said: How can you say that because the poor have not \ngotten as big an amount of money as have the rich?\n  The chairman said: The poor have seen their life circumstances change \nfar more dramatically than the rich have. They can get jobs where they \ncould not before. They are beginning to buy homes in ways they could \nnot before. They are beginning to save money in ways they could not \nbefore. There is no question but what, in terms of the impact on \npeople's lives, this strong economy has benefited the poor more than \nanybody else.\n  That is why we should look at these numbers that I have shared with \nthe Senate today and realize that our primary stewardship must be to \nkeep the economy as strong as we possibly can, that there is nothing we \ncan do that would benefit the poor more than to see to it that this \nrecovery remains robust and that the future moves away from this chart \nback to the kinds of proportions that we have today on this chart, \nwhere mandatory spending is roughly half instead of two-thirds of the \ntotal obligations of the Federal Government.\n  I salute the chairman of the Budget Committee for his resolution and \ndetermination to see that we do that, and I hope the Members of the \nSenate will support the budget as it has been reported from the Budget \nCommittee.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nbetween now and when Senator Durbin arrives, up to 15 minutes, be \ndivided equally between the two sides. If Senator Durbin arrives before \nthen, his time will begin, obviously, when he starts to speak. Then the \ntime from when Senator Durbin starts to speak until 8:45 p.m. be \ncharged to the Democratic side, and at 8:45 p.m. the time will be \ncharged to our side when Senator Stevens controls the time.\n\n[[Page S2631]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise tonight to talk about the budget \nthat is now before the Senate. We have to remember that a budget is \nreally a statement of priorities. It talks about how we choose to \nallocate our resources, and it says a lot about the kind of country we \nwant to be and whether we want communities where opportunities are \navailable to a few or communities where opportunities are available for \neveryone.\n  When I was growing up, my father was a World War II veteran. When I \nwas in my teens, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Pretty soon \nhe was no longer able to work, and my mother had to go to work to \nsupport seven kids. Fortunately, with some help from our Government, \nshe got the help she needed to get a good job to take care of us and to \ntake care of my dad. Without that kind of help, I would not be sitting \nhere tonight as a Senator.\n  My family is not alone. Our country has a proud tradition of helping \nthose who fall on hard times and helping them to reach their full \npotential. That tradition comes from fundamental American values, and \none of those values is a belief in the importance of community.\n  The American philosophy says we all count and we are all in this \ntogether. It says that if I am doing well personally but my neighbors \nare suffering, I am not doing so well after all either. Today, those \ncommunity values, those American values, are under attack by a budget \nthat places too little value on the things ordinary Americans need. In \ndoing so, this budget imperils the American dream for every one of us. \nTo keep the American dream alive, I believe we have to put America \nfirst. For our Nation to be strong and continue to be an example to the \nworld when it comes to creating opportunities for a better life, we \nhave to be strong at home.\n  Unfortunately, this budget that is now before us does not put America \nfirst. This budget does not allow us to provide the kind of support \nAmericans need in a number of critical areas, ranging from support for \nour veterans, to education, to health care, to the environment, to \nfunding for our rail system. When this budget cuts funding to these \npriorities, it puts opportunities out of reach for ordinary working \nAmericans who play by the rules and want nothing better than a chance \nfor a better life for their families. They deserve the chance at a \nbetter life, and it is our responsibility to do all we can to give them \nthat chance by making the right investments so they can be safe, \nhealthy, and productive. We must not fail in or overlook this \nresponsibility to put America first. Future generations of Americans \nare relying on us to make the right decisions now, and the fact is we \nstill have the opportunity to do the right thing in this budget that is \nbefore us.\n  My first concern about this budget is that it is fiscally \nirresponsible. While the President and this Congress have consistently \nprioritized tax breaks in a time of war, the war itself has not been \nenough of a funding priority. It simply astounds me that this budget \ndoes not fund the true and full cost of the war in Iraq, which includes \nrebuilding. It also includes the cost of taking care of our veterans \nwhen they return home from their missions. At a time when our Nation is \nat war, our top priority has to be to support our men and women in \nuniform. I am deeply concerned that this budget fails to do so. \nInstead, we are asked to keep the cost of war offline as we pass that \ncost on to our children, our grandchildren, and future generations of \nAmericans. These costs are knowable. We have been there for years now, \nand the costs should be reflected in our budget.\n  This budget underfunds veterans' needs by nearly $3 billion, failing \nin our commitment to provide the health care and benefits they have \nbeen promised in return for the sacrifice they are making for all of \nus. We have an obligation to care for those who have taken care of us, \nand, unfortunately, this budget does not meet that obligation.\n  Access to first-class care should be a reality for all veterans, \nespecially while our Nation is at war. This budget may contain a few \nsteps in the right direction, but sadly it does not go far enough to \nmeet the needs of our veterans. If this budget is enacted, it will \nseverely damage veterans health care. Payroll and inflation increases \nfor doctors, nurses, and medications cost more than $1 billion, but \nthis budget proposes to give the VA only half of what it needs.\n  To make up for this shortfall, the budget forces more than 2 million \nmiddle-income veterans to pay more than double for their needed \nmedications and to pay a $250 enrollment fee. In addition, this budget \nactually continues to ban some veterans from coming to the VA for care, \nand so far under this flawed proposal 192,260 veterans have been turned \naway across the country, including more than 3,000 in my home State of \nWashington. That sends the wrong message to our troops who are serving \nus overseas. They need to know that we are there for them when they \nreturn home. This budget also imperils the relationship between the VA \nand the States. The VA has supported the cost of veterans residing in \nState VA nursing homes since the Civil War. Yet this budget calls on \nStates to cover the entire cost for many veterans in these cost-\neffective nursing homes.\n\n  To make this budget add up, this proposed budget calls for $590 \nmillion in unspecified efficiencies. That means thousands of nurses and \nother providers are going to be cut; thousands of nursing home beds are \ngoing to be shuttered; and more than a million veterans are no longer \ngoing to be able to come to the VA for the health care they were \npromised and they deserve.\n  This budget falls very short in providing the general public with the \nhealth care they need. Today there are 45 million Americans who are \nuninsured. Without the safety net of Medicare and Medicaid, those \nnumbers would be far greater. Let's take Medicaid as an example. \nMedicaid provides insurance to 40 million Americans and covers 55 \npercent of poor children. It also covers significant numbers of \ndisabled, of elderly, and it provides the bulk of long-term care. Far \ntoo many Americans rely on Medicaid to defund it now.\n  Whatever the final number of the proposed cuts, and even if we call \nthose improved flexibility, people are going to be hurt badly. The fact \nis, we should not forget that already-strapped States are going to be \nleft to make up the shortfall because of what we do here. That is not \nright, and I hope we can correct it as we go through the amendment \nprocess.\n  Let me also talk about education. We had an amendment a short while \nago, offered by Senator Bingaman. I think all of us need to remember \nthat States are being overburdened by cuts in our educational system. \nThis is another area where I believe this budget fails us as a \ncommunity and it reflects the wrong priorities. It fails to provide the \nsupport necessary to build a workforce with the skills and education \nnecessary so we can pass on a strong and secure economy.\n  This budget will cut educational funding for the first time in the \npast decade. It is going to eliminate 48 programs totaling $4.3 \nbillion--programs our children rely on. The programs that have been cut \ninclude critical early intervention and college readiness programs, \nprograms such as GEAR UP and TRIO that have been so successful.\n  This budget also fails employers because it fails to provide the \nfunding we need to bring skilled workers into tomorrow's workforce and \nto keep our economy growing by eliminating the $1.3 billion Perkins \nVocational and Technical Education Program. That is a bad move for \nstudents who are entering the workforce, it is a bad move for \nemployers, and a bad move for the future of our economy.\n  The supporters of the underlying budget say it does not contain the \nassumptions of the cuts. But appropriators will not have the option to \nincrease or even maintain current levels of funding in critical \neducational programs if we do not at least restore the\n\n[[Page S2632]]\n\nfunding for the programs that have been cut.\n  I offered an amendment in the Budget Committee to restore these cuts, \nand it failed on a party-line vote, just like the vote tonight in the \nSenate. We need to remember these cuts are real. They are going to \naffect real people.\n\n  Just last week, one of the last things we did was to reauthorize, \nhere in the Senate, the Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act, \nwhile at the same time the Republicans on the Budget Committee voted \ndown my amendment that would have restored the $1.3 billion that \nprogram needs to make it work. We are now considering a budget without \nthat amendment.\n  There are some increases for education in this budget, but they are \nvery deceptive. For example, instead of fulfilling the promise of No \nChild Left Behind, this budget funds a meager 1.3 percent increase to \nNo Child Left Behind and underfunds it by $12 billion.\n  This budget increases funding for title I, which is the program that \nfunds disadvantaged students, by 4.7 percent, but that is also very \ndeceptive. There is a shortfall of over $9 billion in this program. \nThat concerns me, as someone who knows. We have a responsibility to \nmake sure the generations that come after us have the skills they need \nto be productive so we will have a strong country that we can all count \non in the future.\n  Another area of deep concern for me is this budget's failure to fund \nAmtrak. This budget sets the overall levels for domestic discretionary \nspending at the level included in the President's budget. That proposal \nincludes his anticipated zero amount for Amtrak's traditional subsidy \nand $360 million for continuation of commuter service. If this budget \ngets adopted, I do not know how we are going to keep Amtrak operating \nnext year. If this system shuts down, we will hurt 25 million \npassengers, people who rely on the Amtrak system to get to work, to get \nhome, and almost 20,000 employees. Bankrupting Amtrak will be the wrong \nmove for the people who depend on the rail system for their livelihood, \nfor their mobility, and for their quality of life.\n  I am also really disappointed this budget includes language allowing \nfor drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. This improper use \nof the Senate's budget authority circumvents the appropriate avenue for \naddressing such a critically important and sensitive question.\n  Drilling in the Arctic is controversial and should be debated in the \ncontext of an energy bill. It has no place in this budget resolution, \nespecially as the overinflated revenues are based on unrealistic \nexpectations of oil and gas recovery.\n  I agree we have to work to achieve energy independence. But the fact \nis, energy independence can be achieved by tightening fuel economy \nstandards for passenger cars, especially light trucks and sport utility \nvehicles, and the greater use of renewable energy sources and further \nfocus on energy efficiency will do more to lessen reliance on foreign \noil than drilling the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Although we were \nnot able to remove this unnecessary provision in the markup, I know an \namendment is going to be offered, and I hope we can remove it on the \nfloor.\n  Before I close, I do want to mention that this budget does not do \nenough to support our Nation's farmers. When Congress passed the 2002 \nfarm bill, it was hailed as providing new economic development \nopportunities for rural areas and for ensuring that farmers have a \nsafety net to get them through the hard times. This budget will unravel \nthat safety net by asking farmers, rural communities, and the poor to \nfoot the bill for the support and opportunity that it is our \nresponsibility to provide. In my State alone, with farmers from \nWashington State reeling from years of low prices and natural disasters \nand closed foreign markets, this is the time we should be providing a \nleg up, not cutting back on research and investment.\n  These are just a few examples of where this budget shortchanges \nordinary Americans and does not put America first. I have other \nconcerns with this budget and I will address them throughout the \nprocess, but tonight I wanted to register my deep concern that the \npriorities in this budget proposal are out of line with the challenges \nwe face in this country in these difficult times. The sense of \ncommunity that makes our Nation great, the feeling that we are all in \nthis together is what got my family through its toughest times. It is \nwhat our country needs now more than ever. I believe that should be \nreflected in our Federal budget.\n  I believe we can do better, and I will work with my colleagues \nthroughout this process on amendments to help develop a responsible \nbudget that meets our country's needs and really reflects our true \nvalues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I seek recognition on the time allocated \nto the Democratic side and Senator Conrad on the budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague from the State of Washington who has \nspelled out with some detail what is included in this budget document. \nIt is hard to believe the Senate budget resolution for the budget of \nthe United States of America has been summarized for our consideration \non the floor into 65 pages: 65 pages for a budget in excess of $2 \ntrillion. This, of course, is a budget resolution which just describes \nthings in the most general terms. You have to really dig into this and \nyou have to understand some of the subtleties of this resolution to \nunderstand its importance. This really will chart the path for spending \nby our Federal Government for the next fiscal year, beginning in \nOctober. It is a critically important document because this budget \ndefines our priorities and tells us what we can expect in terms of our \nNation's spending.\n  Like the President's budget, this budget from the Republican-\ncontrolled Senate Budget Committee will make deficits and the debt \nworse and not better. Like the President's budget, this budget is \ndealing in fantasy not in fact. It does not include a penny, not 1 cent \nto implement President Bush's privatization of Social Security. I do \nnot believe that is a concession by the Republicans that this unpopular \nidea is dead. But it is an admission by the Republicans, who put this \ntogether, that they cannot pay for the President's privatization plan \non Social Security. The President cannot explain how he will pay for \nit. When the Senate Republicans were given that responsibility, they \ncould not either.\n  So here we have a plan that the President says is his acceptance of \nresponsibility of leadership to privatize Social Security, and yet \nneither the President nor the Senate Republicans on the Budget \nCommittee can tell us how they will pay for taking trillions of dollars \nout of the Social Security trust fund and gambling them in the stock \nmarket in the hope that those who invest would make more money than \nthey would lose. It is a big gap in this budget. There is not a penny \nin here to pay for privatization of Social Security.\n\n  Let me tell you that it also fails to pay for the full cost of the \nwar in Iraq after 2006. I have not heard any person in this \nadministration even suggest the possibility that all of the American \ntroops will be home by October 1 of this year. I don't believe that \nwill happen. I don't think Iraq is safe enough for our troops to come \nhome.\n  Recently, we were told by Secretary Rumsfeld that we had 157,000 \nsoldiers in Iraq. It is likely we will have that number, or perhaps \nslightly less, in Iraq next year. We are spending billions of dollars \nto support our troops. As far as I am concerned, I will spend and vote \nfor every penny those soldiers need to be safe, to perform their \nmission, to come home proud with their mission accomplished, but it is \ngoing to cost money. We should be honest about it.\n  How can this President as Commander in Chief offer his budget and how \ncan the Senate Republicans in the Budget Committee offer us a budget \nfor the United States of America for the next fiscal year and not \ninclude one penny for the cost of the war in Iraq after 2006? This \nisn't going to be done for nothing; it will cost us billions of \ndollars. Their failure to include the full cost of that war after 2006 \nin the budget resolution tells us they are not prepared to accept the \nreality and responsibility of leadership.\n\n[[Page S2633]]\n\n  The President will not tell us how to pay for privatization of Social \nSecurity and doesn't include it in his budget. He doesn't tell us how \nhe will pay for the war in Iraq and doesn't include it in his budget. \nWhen it comes to this Senate Budget Committee, again we find that it \ndoesn't include the full cost of the war in Iraq after 2006.\n  There are other things that challenge us, too.\n  The Tax Code needs to be reformed. I have said half in jest but more \nseriously as I think about it that the most important thing we can do \nto simplify the Tax Code is to require that every Member of Congress, \nevery Member of the House and every Member of the Senate, fill out and \ncomplete their own Federal income tax returns. We will simplify the Tax \nCode in a hurry if we can't send that material to the bookkeepers and \naccountants.\n  But one of the things that haunts us is the alternative minimum tax. \nThis was the tax that really came out of the revelation 20 or 30 years \nago that there were certain Americans who were very successful, making \na lot of money, and not paying a penny in taxes. So we created \nsomething called the alternative minimum tax which says that even if \nyour bookkeeper has found every way for you to escape paying Federal \ntaxes, in the end you are still going to pay a minimum tax. You can't \nget off the hook. You are lucky, buddy. You live in America, you made a \nbundle, and be prepared to pay a little back to this country to defend \nus, to defend our freedom, and give us a chance to live another year \nsuccessfully. That was the alternative minimum tax. I believe it is \npretty sound principle.\n  What has happened over the years when we didn't change the formula is \nthat inflation started moving the dollar amount of people who were \ngoing to be bound to pay this tax to higher levels, and then we find \nthat some middle-income families are now going to be trapped with the \nalternative minimum tax. Everyone I have spoken to on both sides of the \naisle says this is an outrage, this is unjust, and we need to make sure \nworking middle-income families don't pay the alternative minimum tax. \nThis budget offered by the Senate Republican Budget Committee does not \nfix the alternative minimum tax, which will affect more and more \nmiddle-class Americans next year.\n  It doesn't include the pay-go rule. For those who follow the arcane \nlanguage of budget debates in Washington, the pay-go rule is basically \nthis: If you want to cut taxes or increase spending on certain \nprograms, you have to pay for them. It is simple. You can't borrow the \nmoney; you can't anticipate debt; you have to pay for it. You want to \ncut a tax today, what other tax will you increase? What spending will \nyou decrease? That is the pay-as-you-go formula. This approach given to \nus by many people who described themselves as fiscal conservatives \ndoesn't have pay-go rules that require that new tax cuts be paid for. \nIn a moment, I will tell you what it does say about tax cuts. It is a \nharrowing possibility for future generations: more debt, debt that, \nunfortunately, will burden them and their children for years to come. \nIt contains the wrong priorities.\n\n  The budget we have before us calls for big cuts in domestic spending \non Medicaid, education, veterans, and transportation, even as it \nprovides new tax cuts financed by more borrowing from foreign \ncountries. The deficit under this approach is at record levels already. \nThis budget would increase by an additional $130 billion over the next \n5 years.\n  Despite that, we have been told by the President and others to cut \nthe Federal deficit in half. When you look at all the elements they \nleave out of here--the cost of the tax cuts, the cost of the war after \n2006, the cost of privatizing Social Security--it is clear that this a \nfantasy budget. This is a phony budget. It doesn't deal with the real \ncosts of government which the President knows if his policies go \nforward are going to be faced by many others in the future. If you \nfactor in the things the budget leaves out, this budget will create a \nrecord deficit of $570 billion in 2010.\n  I wanted to start this debate by showing this chart, which is nothing \nshort of amazing.\n  I was elected to Congress in the Reagan administration when we were \nexperiencing the largest deficits to that point in the history of the \nFederal Government. We didn't think we would ever find a day when we \nwould escape those deficits, but yet it happened. At the close of the \nClinton administration, we generated, for the first time in 30 years, \nif I am not mistaken, some $236 billion in surplus. We had cut \nspending, we had increased revenue, and we had the economy moving \nforward at a pace people just couldn't imagine. We generated a surplus.\n  What does a surplus in the Federal budget mean? It means we are being \nfiscally responsible, which happened under the Clinton administration, \nbut it also means less money was being taken out of the Social Security \ntrust fund to fund the Nation's debt.\n  Look what happens. Just as the Clinton administration ends and the \nBush years begin, this sea of red ink hits our Nation--the Bush \nadministration deficits. Then take a look at what the real deficits \nwill be if the President continues on his path--a path calling for more \ntax cuts, a path calling for more costs when it comes to Social \nSecurity, the deficit we have talked about, a path that drives us to \nthe point where we would be some $621 billion in debt by the year 2015. \nWhat a dramatic change in a short period of time--from the departure of \nPresident Clinton until 2015--brought on by President Bush's budget \npolicies, policies endorsed by the Republican side of the aisle.\n  The biggest cost, of course, left out of the President's budget is \nSocial Security reform. It will cost $754 billion over 10 years for the \nPresident's plan to privatize Social Security, growing to $4.9 trillion \nover 20 years. With this program left out, the budget does not \naccurately reflect our true fiscal situation. Including the $754 \nbillion cost, the President's Social Security reform makes a bad \ndeficit situation even worse with absolutely no end in sight.\n  Despite the exploding deficit, this budget goes along with the \nPresident and calls for $70 billion in new tax cuts. It does this even \nas it cuts spending on education, health care, and other areas of great \nAmerican need, cuts them to the bone. The President's tax cuts, which \nhave given much larger benefits to the wealthy than to the middle \nclass, have been the single largest factor in creating the deficits \nthat I have indicated to you today, according to the Center on Budget \nand Policy Priorities.\n  This budget brought to us by the Senate Republicans gives us more of \nthe same. Among the new tax cuts are dividend and capital gains cuts \nthat go overwhelmingly to wealthy taxpayers.\n  My next chart illustrates that fact. Take a look at dividends and \ncapital gains tax cuts being suggested and proposed in the Senate \nbudget resolution. Who benefits from these massive tax cuts? It turns \nout if you make less than $50,000 a year, on average you will benefit \nto the tune of $6. If you earn between $50,000 and $200,000, your tax \ncut is worth $112; $200,000 to $1 million income a year, your tax cut \nis $1,480. But if you are in the big leagues, making more than $1 \nmillion a year, President Bush's proposed tax cut, to make it \npermanent, that is endorsed by the Senate budget resolution, means for \nthose making over $1 million a year, you will get an additional tax cut \nof $35,491 on average. The source of this is the Brookings Tax Policy \nCenter.\n  Think about that for a moment. Do we believe it is in the best \ninterests of America to drive us deep into deficit, deep into debt, in \norder to give tax cuts of this magnitude to the wealthiest people in \nAmerica to the tune of $35,000? Someone making $1 million a year will \nnot even notice this, but $35,000 to someone in middle-income \ncategories would be dramatic.\n  Yet this Senate budget resolution proposed by the Republicans \nsuggests we go deep into debt to give a $35,000 tax cut to someone \nmaking over $1 million a year.\n  The budgets will give more of the same. The average millionaire's tax \ncuts will be that dramatic and middle-income Americans will get very \nlittle. To put things in perspective, millionaires will receive $32 \nbillion in tax cuts under the President's budget.\n  Let me compare that $32 billion figure with another figure. The tax \ncuts for people making over $1 million a year in income, coming to us \nfrom the President, coming to us from the Senate Republicans, will cost \n$32 billion. That is in 2006 alone, $32 billion out of our Treasury to \ngive tax cuts.\n\n[[Page S2634]]\n\n  What would it take for the President to restore spending on 48 \neducation programs that were eliminated this year? The amount is $4.8 \nbillion. How in the world can we live in a country where the leadership \nbelieves that funding education is less important than giving tax cuts \nto people making over $1 million a year?\n  Some people hear a Democrat talk about tax cuts for millionaires, and \nthey say, There they go again. That is what I expect to hear from \nDemocrats. This is not a change. But the numbers I have given today are \nfacts in this 65-page document: $32 billion in tax cuts while the \nPresident eliminates $4.8 billion in education programs.\n  Could we maybe say to the millionaires, we will only give you half as \nmuch as you expect, maybe only give you $18,000 a year in tax breaks, \ncapital gains, and dividends, and take the $16 billion and move it over \nhere to fund our education programs? Is that an outrageous idea? Is \nthat something hard for America to understand or accept? I don't think \nso. Restoring the cuts in 48 education programs, including vocational \neducation, would take $4.8 billion.\n  These huge deficits, of course, are also going to lead to a record \nlevel of debt. We will be spending more and more money to pay interest \non that debt. In 2006, we asked America's taxpayers to give us $270 \nbillion of their hard-earned money to pay interest on our national \ndebt. We pay more each year in interest on our debt than we spend on \nveterans, on education, or on the environment. Yet these programs face \ndeep cuts under this budget and the debt grows and grows.\n  Our huge deficit also makes us dependent on borrowing from foreign \ncountries. The vast majority of America's debt is being bought \noverseas, primarily by Japan and China. We ought to think about this \nand we ought to think about it long and hard.\n  Let me show an example of that. This chart shows the top 10 countries \nholding our national debt in the world. No. 1 is Japan. No. 2 is China. \nNo. 3 is the United Kingdom. Next is Caribbean banking centers, South \nKorea, OPEC, Taiwan, Germany, Hong Kong, and Switzerland. To try to \nexplain this in the simplest terms, if we are going to overspend in \nAmerica, we have to borrow money to do it. When we ask the American \npeople to buy our debts--U.S. Treasuries, for example--they come up \nwith a certain amount of money. But then we find out it is not enough. \nWe are so deeply in debt, we need to borrow so much money, we have to \ngo out of America and see if other countries will buy our debt. So \nthese countries become America's mortgageholders. These countries are \nholding our Nation's mortgage. No. 1 on the list, Japan; No. 2, China.\n\n  Why do they buy American debt? Because they believe it is profitable \nand sound. Profitable because we pay interest on that debt, naturally. \nSound, because the American economy is the strongest in the world and \nhas been for a long period of time. From their point of view, from \nJapan's and China's point of view, it makes sense to hold America's \ndebt. It pays good interest and it is from a sound debtor.\n  But we started noticing some changes recently. Two or 3 weeks ago, \nSouth Korea--you may remember them as one of our close allies that we \nwent to war to protect in the 1950s from the encroachment of \ncommunism--South Korea, a $69 billion creditor of the United States, a \ncouple weeks ago said, maybe the American economy is not as sound as we \nthought it was. If they continue to go deeply in debt, if they continue \nin America to produce budget documents that are a fantasy and do not \ntell the real story, then maybe this American economy is not as \nreliable and sound as we once thought it was. That mere suggestion by \nthe South Koreans sent this ripple of anxiety and fear around the \nworld. We saw it automatically in the money markets and in trading \naround the world.\n  My fear and the fear of many is the time will come when some of these \ncountries will decide that America's currency is not as safe and strong \nas they would like to see it so they may say, instead of holding \ndollars, we trust Euros. We think the European economies are more \nfiscally responsible. If that decision is made, the only way we can \nkeep our mortgageholders happy is to raise interest rates--the \nprofitability of their holding our debt. As we raise interest rates to \nkeep them interested in financing our debt, the pressure is on to raise \ninterest rates for the American economy. And as we do, the cost of \nowning a home, a car, making any major purchase, or financing a \nbusiness goes up, as well.\n  It is not a coincidence--in fact, it is closely parallel--that many \nof these countries that are our major creditors and mortgageholders are \nalso causing great damage to America's economy. We know what China is \ndoing to America today. Our balance of trade with China says it all. We \nfind ourselves importing more and more Chinese goods into the United \nStates. We find American factories and manufacturing jobs disappearing, \nparticularly over the last 4 years where we have seen this exodus of \ngood-paying manufacturing jobs from the United States to many other \ncountries, but largely to China. We find ourselves more and more \ndependent on China for cheap imports to sustain our way of life.\n  What company in America is the largest importer of Chinese goods in \nour country? Wal-Mart. So if you go to Wal-Mart and you think, boy, \nthey are trimming those prices down, take a look where the products are \nmade. They are made in China instead of the United States. Fewer people \nin the United States have good-paying jobs. We are getting the cheap \ngoods in from China, but we are paying for it in terms of the strength \nof our economy.\n  So not only are these countries--Japan and China in particular, and \nSouth Korea and Taiwan and others--in the Asian rim finding themselves \nas our mortgageholders, but they are also finding themselves taking \naway jobs from America, taking away jobs we desperately need.\n  So this administration, the Bush administration, with the cooperation \nand enthusiastic support of the Republican side of the aisle, believes \nthat more and more debt in America should not be feared, that we should \ngo more deeply in debt than ever in our history, we should pile on that \ndebt with tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America, we should \ndrive this debt to meteoric levels by privatizing Social Security, and \nnot paying for it, and we should do a little sleight of hand in \naccounting where we do not even include the full cost of the Iraq war \nafter 2006 in our budget.\n  How can this be coming from an administration that prides itself on \nbeing fiscally conservative? This is fiscally irresponsible. We are \nmortgaging America's future and the future of our children to these \ncountries that hold our national debt. We are giving them more power \nover our future and our economy than we should. And we are paying \ndearly for it.\n  Our huge debt makes us dependent on these countries. We should be \ncautious about a budget that relies on borrowing more and more and more \nfrom foreign countries and assumes they are always going to be willing \nto continue to buy large amounts of our debts.\n  In 2001, as I mentioned earlier, before President Bush came to \noffice, we had budget surpluses. We were on track to pay off almost all \nof the national debt by 2008. Now it is forecast that we will have a \n$5.9 trillion debt by 2008. Pay-go, as I mentioned earlier, is a rule \nthat requires new tax cuts be paid for. There will be an amendment on \nthe budget resolution offered. I don't think it is out of the question \nto say that if you want to increase mandatory spending programs, or if \nyou want to cut taxes, find a source to pay for them, either another \ntax or spending cuts. That used to be a basic conservative credo on \nCapitol Hill. Now it has been ignored. The question is whether, given \nthat chance by Senator Feingold and his amendment, Democrats and \nRepublicans will vote for fiscal sanity and fiscal responsibility.\n  Let me talk about the priorities in this budget that are simply \nwrong. This budget cuts many programs to the bone even as it is giving \nthese massive tax cuts to wealthy Americans. The budget cuts Medicaid \nby about $14 or $15 billion.\n  Now, the budget is interesting because I looked to see--I used to sit \non the House and Senate Budget Committees--how they did it. Well, they \ndid it with an interesting approach. They called for the cuts in \nMedicaid at the same time as they added these caveats, these warnings, \nthat any cuts in Medicaid should not ``undermine the role\n\n[[Page S2635]]\n\nthe Medicaid program plays as a critical component of the health care \nsystem of the United States; cap Federal Medicaid spending, or \notherwise shift Medicaid cost burdens to State or local governments . . \n. ; or undermine the Federal guarantee of health insurance coverage \nMedicaid provides. . . .''\n  How can you do both? How can you dramatically cut Medicaid spending \nand still do these things? I think this is a figleaf. I think members \nof the Senate Budget Committee know better.\n  Let me tell you a word or two about Medicaid. It is the largest \ninsurer in my home State of Illinois, covering more than 2 million \npeople out of the 12.5 million whom I represent. The program covers 40 \npercent of all children born in Illinois and provides health insurance \nto 30 percent of the kids as they are growing up in my State. It pays \nfor 65 percent of nursing home residents in Illinois. Nationally I \nthink the average is 70 percent.\n  As more and more people lost their health insurance and struggled \nwith our economy over the last few years, losing good-paying jobs, \nlosing health insurance coverage on the job, we saw the number of \npeople covered by Medicaid increase. Illinois expanded Medicaid \ncoverage in the last 2 years to 130,000 children and 135,000 parents. \nThat expanded coverage is at risk due to the cuts in this budget.\n  Senator Bingaman and Senator Smith will offer a bipartisan amendment \nto remove these cuts from the budget, and I hope we will support that \namendment. How can we be in a position where we are absolutely derelict \nin our duty and responsibility to do something about the cost and \naccessibility and affordability of health care in America and then turn \naround and say we are going to absolutely gut the safety net? Medicaid \nis the safety net. Medicaid says if you are working a job and not \nreceiving health insurance, and you reach a point in desperation where \nyou need health care, if your income is low enough, Medicaid will pay \nfor your medical bills.\n  It is not going to be luxurious care. There is not much of that left \nin this country under Medicaid, even though some of the critics say \nthere might be. I have not seen evidence of that. Most of the Medicaid \nproviders I talk to, the doctors and hospitals, argue we do not pay \nthem enough. So if we are not going to create a real safety net of \nhealth care for America, how can we chop up the existing safety net of \nMedicaid, as this budget proposes to do?\n  And let me make one aside here, my own personal point of view. This \nPresident is out doing 60 cities in 60 days to talk about the threat of \nSocial Security being out of balance in 40 or 50 years. He looks down \nthe track and sees, 50 years from now, that tiny light of a train \ncoming and says: We better do something today to deal with the \nchallenge of Social Security 50 years from now.\n  I am not opposed to that. But the President is now barnstorming the \nUnited States talking about that problem 40 or 50 years away, and while \nhe is talking about that problem down the tracks, a locomotive is \ncoming right behind us called the cost of health care in America. It \nhas on that locomotive Medicaid, Medicare, and the cost of health \ninsurance, and the President is not saying a word. The Republican \nleadership in Congress is not saying a word, save for this budget \nresolution which says we are going to reduce the protection and \ncoverage of Medicaid, protection and coverage essential to people in \nthe last years of their lives in a nursing home, people in the first \nmoments of their lives who are covered as children and infants.\n  Let me talk about education. What a time in the history of America to \ncut education. That is what the Senate Republican Budget Committee \ndoes, cutting it by $34 billion. Mr. President, 3.2 million children in \nIllinois are in primary education and depend on Federal funding. And \n5,200 children would be unable to attend Head Start. Have you ever been \nto a Head Start program? Have you seen what they do there? Children \ncome in from some of the poorest families in the neighborhood, kids \nwhose parents probably did not have a good experience in school, and \nthey bring these kids in to learn how to get along well with other kids \nand to give them a running start at being successful when they enter \nkindergarten.\n  Is there a better concept than that, preschool education for kids so \nthey have a chance to succeed? Well, this budget obviously decides we \ncannot spend as much as we should on Head Start.\n  Illinois will lose $500 million for elementary and secondary \neducation under this bill. Mr. President, 5,200 children in my State \nwould be unable to attend Head Start programs due to the cuts.\n  The State would also lose $335 million for special education and $160 \nmillion for school improvement programs. This budget also cuts funding \nfor vocational and technical education. Illinois receives $50 million a \nyear for that. It serves 350,000 students who are not college bound, \nbut students who want to be trained with vocational training and \nsimilar technical education training so they can make a living and \ncontribute to this country. This budget cuts it.\n\n  Three out of every five high school students in Illinois are enrolled \nin these programs. Senator Bingaman has offered an amendment to restore \n$4.8 million. It is my understanding it was already voted on and \nfailed, which is a sad commentary that we have decided we cannot afford \nto put money into vocational and technical education. There are \nbillions of dollars for tax cuts for people making over $1 million a \nyear, but we cannot find $4.8 billion in Senator Bingaman's amendment \nfor education. What a priority, that the wealthiest among us will \nreceive about $3,000 more in tax cuts every month while we tell the \nkids in vocational schools and getting technical education we cannot \nafford their teachers and their classrooms.\n  Law enforcement also faces terrible cuts, cuts of $2 billion, \nincluding a $500 million cut in the COPS Program. I know President Bush \nand the Republicans in Congress loathe President Clinton's COPS \nProgram. They hate it that a Democratic President would come up with a \nprogram to make America's communities safer that was so wildly popular. \nThey have been determined since they arrived in town to kill this \nprogram. Well, my congratulations to the Senate Republican Budget \nCommittee. You almost have the job done with this budget. Cutting this \nmoney for the COPS Program is sadly going to jeopardize the men and \nwomen in uniform who put the badges on every morning and risk their \nlives so our communities are safer. They are out there fighting crime, \nviolence, drugs, gangs, and this budget says we don't need them; we \ndon't need to continue this program.\n\n  I think they are wrong. Since 1994, Illinois has received more than \n$400 million for the COPS Program. We have added 6,000 new police \nofficers in our State, in 680 different local law enforcement agencies. \nIllinois is safer and America is safer because of the COPS Program. But \nbecause it has Bill Clinton's name associated with it, the Republican \nBudget Committee has to do away with it. So tax cuts for the wealthiest \nin America, averaging $3,000 a month for those making over $1 million a \nyear, but we cannot afford the cops on the street to make it safe for \nour kids to walk home from school or our parents to go out for a stroll \nin the park in the evening. Is that an upside down priority?\n  Let me talk for a moment about transportation and Amtrak. The budget \ncuts transportation by $16 billion, and it eliminates funding for \nAmtrak. I cannot think of a worse idea at this time. To eliminate \nnational passenger rail service means the following: more cars on the \nroad and highways, causing congestion; more pollution for our air, \nmaking it even worse for those suffering from pulmonary disease and \nasthma and other problems; and with more gas being burned in these \ncars, more dependence upon foreign oil. This is absolute lunacy that we \nare walking away from national passenger rail service when we know it \nmeans more traffic congestion, more pollution, and more dependence on \nforeign oil.\n  That is a priority the Bush administration echoed in the Republican \nbudget. There will be an amendment offered to restore the cuts in \nAmtrak. I hope it succeeds. We can do better than this budget. It \ndoesn't reflect the real state of our deficit and it doesn't reflect \nthe real values of America. It has the wrong priorities. It cuts things \nthat are essential, such as health care and education and \ntransportation. For what? To give more new tax cuts to the wealthiest \npeople in this country.\n\n[[Page S2636]]\n\n  I am not sure President Bush thinks that was his Ohio mandate to go \nforward with these tax cuts. But I wish he could have been at Walter \nReed Hospital today. I went to see soldiers who were injured overseas \nand going through recuperation. I went to one of their physical therapy \nrooms to watch them be fitted for their new legs and new arms, trying \nto make their lives again a reality. They are proud of this country and \nI am, too.\n  I would be prouder if we were more honest in our budget. But we are \nnot. We don't even include the full cost of the war they fought in this \nbudget. We act as though it doesn't exist after 2006. Well, it does \nexist. The soldiers who served our country exist. We need to make \ncertain that when it comes to veterans health care, to the basics they \nneed to start their families and get good jobs and restore their lives, \nwe will stand behind them. This budget walks away from them. I hope the \nSenate will think twice about passing this document. I think we need a \nnew set of priorities, reflecting the real values of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I remember sitting in that chair presiding \nlate in the evening when I was first elected. You get lots of \nopportunities to sit in that chair and preside. When it draws toward \nthe hour of 8 o'clock and 9 o'clock and 10 o'clock, I know the days can \nget very long, especially when you are sitting in that chair. I think \nthe Chair understands the process here. We have time, and the time is \ngoing to be wasted unless it is used. So we intend to use the time. I \nhope it is more interesting to the Chair to at least have somebody \ntalking than to sit by his lonesome.\n  The Comptroller General warned us earlier this year that the fiscal \noutlook is worse than claimed. He said in a speech to the National \nPress Club:\n\n       The simple truth is that our Nation's financial condition \n     is much worse than advertised.\n\n  The Comptroller General has it exactly right. The Comptroller General \nof the United States is head of the Government Accountability Office. \nHe is responsible to Congress to tell us about the fiscal condition of \nthe country.\n  He is warning us that our current budget course is unsustainable. \nThat is a word he uses over and over, ``unsustainable.'' Chairman \nGreenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, has used that same \nword, ``unsustainable.'' It is a word I have used many times to my \ncolleagues that the current budget course is unsustainable. We are \nrunning record deficits now. The President says cut revenues some more, \nadd more to spending, and on top of it, we have the baby boomers about \nto retire. None of this adds up, and the President's budget does not \nadd up. The President has left things out in an attempt to make the \nnumbers look better. One of the things he has left out is any war cost \npast September 30 of this year. We have $82 billion that the President \nasked for in a special addition to the budget, called a supplemental, \nfor this year. But past September 30 of this year, he has asked for no \nadditional money, although the Congressional Budget Office tells us \nthat over $380 billion is going to be necessary.\n  It is not just with respect to the war the President has not given us \nthe full story in his budget. He also has not shown us the full cost of \nhis tax cut proposal. This dotted line shows the end of the 5-year \nbudget window. Look what happens to the President's tax proposal right \nafter the 5 years of the budget window. The cost absolutely explodes. \nNone of that is revealed by the President's budget.\n  In addition to the war costs and his tax cuts, he has also not shared \nwith the American people the cost of fixing the alternative minimum \ntax, the old millionaire's tax that is rapidly becoming a middle-class \ntax trap. Why do I say that? Because now 3 million people are being \ncaught in the alternative minimum tax. In 10 years, they tell us 40 \nmillion people will be caught up in the alternative minimum tax. It is \ngoing to be a big surprise to a lot of people. They thought they were \ngetting tax cuts from this administration, but they are going to get \ntax increases from this administration. Many of them will not get it \nthis year, but more of them will, and more next year, and more the year \nthereafter. Millions more will be caught up in the alternative minimum \ntax. It costs $774 billion to fix. The President's budget has nothing, \nzero, in the budget to cover that cost.\n  Over and over, what the President has done is just leave things out \nof his budget to claim he is making progress on reducing the deficit.\n  Earlier Senator Bennett was on the floor talking about how well the \neconomy is doing. In some measures, it is doing well, but in many \nothers, the economy of our country is being pumped up by writing hot \nchecks. I remember Senator Bumpers so well during the Reagan era when \nwe had a similar pattern of borrow and spend. He said: Anybody can pump \nup the economy by writing billions of dollars of hot checks. That is \nwhat this administration has done, hundreds of billions of dollars of \nhot checks, and not just over a 5-year period but every year, every \nyear hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit financing.\n\n  When the President came into office, he inherited a surplus. He \ninherited a substantial surplus, $236 billion. He told us if we adopted \nhis plan, there would not be deficits. He was wrong because the \ndeficits have absolutely exploded. And so has the debt. It is not just \nthe deficits. Our friends on the other side of the aisle just want to \ntalk about deficits, but the debt of the country is the real concern.\n  You will remember the President told us in 2001 that he had a plan \nthat would give us maximum paydown of the debt. He was going to \neliminate as much of the debt as could be eliminated. Now we see the \nreality of the President's plan. Instead of debt being paid down, the \ndebt has skyrocketed. It was $3.3 trillion in 2001. We now project it \nwill be $9.4 trillion in 2015. This debt is going straight up. That is \nthe publicly held debt. The gross debt is even worse. The gross debt \nwas $5.8 trillion in 2001. We now project that it will hit $15.8 \ntrillion in 2015 if the President's policies are adopted.\n  This truly is a policy of deficits and debt, and it is also a policy \nof, in some ways, decline because while we are running these massive \ndeficits and dramatic increases in debt, the value of our currency is \nin sharp decline.\n  One of the key reasons for that is the massive trade deficits. At the \nsame time we are running huge budget deficits under the President's \npolicies, we are also running massive trade deficits, the biggest trade \ndeficits ever in our history.\n  The trade deficit last year was $618 billion. Why does it matter? It \nmatters because we have to fill in the gap somewhere. The way the \nPresident is filling in the gap is to borrow the money. He is borrowing \nit from all over the world.\n  In the last 3 years--and we only have numbers to 2004--this is what \nis happening to the foreign holding of our U.S. Treasury debt. Foreign \nholdings of our Treasury debt have gone up 92 percent in just the last \n3 years. Some might say: So what. Everything seems to be going well. \nThat just shows countries have confidence in us.\n  Does anyone really believe America is strengthened by borrowing more \nand more money from Japan and China and South Korea? Does anybody think \nthat somehow strengthens America?\n  The harsh reality is that all this borrowing has led to this result: \nThe dollar is in decline. Against the Euro, it has already gone down 33 \npercent since 2002. As we borrow more, people are having less faith and \nconfidence in the value of the U.S. dollar, and the dollar has declined \nquite dramatically. It is not just the Euro, it is against other \ncurrencies as well.\n  Senator Bennett, I am sure, talked about how jobs are now being \ncreated. That is true, and that is good news, and all of us are happy \nfor that for the country. But the hard reality is there is an enormous \ngap between what is happening in this recovery and what has happened in \nprevious recoveries.\n\n[[Page S2637]]\n\nThis dotted red line shows job recovery in the nine recessions since \nWorld War II before this one. One can see at this stage of the \nrecovery--and this is the number of months after the business cycle \npeak--when we get out to this stage of the recovery, generally job \nrecovery is improving very markedly and very dramatically. But look at \nthe gap between this recovery and the average of the job recovery in \nthe nine previous recessions since World War II. There is an enormous \ngap. In fact, the gap in jobs is 6.2 million private sector jobs short \nof the typical recovery. Something is wrong here. Something very \ndifferent is occurring between this recovery and other recoveries.\n  One of the questions we ought to be asking is why? Why is this \nrecovery so weak compared to all the other recoveries since World War \nII? One of the things we see in addition to that is real weekly \nearnings during the tenure of President Bush are up only $5.32--and \nthat is a week. Real weekly earnings in January of 2001 averaged $523 a \nweek in this country. You see, this goes back to 1996, and we saw a \nvery healthy run up from $485 to $523 from 1996 to 2001.\n\n  So that was an increase of $38 a week. In this 4-year period, 2001 to \n2005, weekly earnings are only up $5--again an indication that this \nrecovery is weak in comparison to other recoveries. Here is more \nevidence that something is amiss in this recovery. Here is the share of \npopulation at work, and what we see is that it is near a 10-year low, \nwith 62.3 percent of the population employed. We had been up at just \nabout 64 percent, but in this period, with the recession, not \nsurprisingly, the share of population at work was reduced, and still we \nare not seeing a strong recovery.\n  I am certain also that Senator Bennett talked about what has happened \nwith tax cuts and that tax cuts help fuel the recovery. There is no \ndoubt that tax cuts help a weak economy. I myself proposed to our \ncolleagues very substantial tax cuts in 2001, not as big a tax cut over \nan extended period as the President but actually bigger tax cuts in the \nshort term than the President first proposed in order to give lift to \nthe economy.\n  I think now our colleagues are basically rewriting history and saying \nthat tax cuts increased revenue. That is not what the record shows. The \nrecord shows that tax cuts reduced revenue. Here is what has happened. \nThis chart shows Federal revenues in trillions of dollars, and we can \nsee at the time of the Reagan tax cuts we had a reduction in revenue. \nAt the time of the Bush tax cuts, revenues declined 18 percent over a \n3-year period. They did not go up; they went down. This is not a matter \nof ideology. It is not a matter of partisanship. It is a matter of \nfact. The fact is, revenue went down.\n  Looking at it in another way, this is the history of revenue going \nback to 1955 as a percentage of gross domestic product, and we can see \nthat revenue had reached a peak of almost 21 percent in 2000. This led \nPresident Bush to say we need to cut taxes. He was right. Taxes were \nvery high historically at that point, but look at what has happened \nsubsequently. Taxes last year were down to 16.3 percent of \ngross domestic product. That is the lowest since 1959.\n\n  So, again, when our friends say we get more revenue with tax cuts, \nno, no. We did not get more revenue. Revenue went down sharply. It did \nnot go up. That is just a factual matter.\n  I remember very well, in 2001, the Congressional Budget Office came \nto us with--I call this the fan chart. The fan chart was designed to \nshow us the range of possible outcomes of budget deficits going \nforward. The Congressional Budget Office gave this wide range of \npossible outcomes depending on various economic scenarios, and they \nchose this midrange of possible outcomes for the forecast. The \nadministration adopted that same outlook, and they said on the basis of \nthis analysis that we were going to have nearly $6 trillion in \nsurpluses over the next 10 years. Of course, this was back in 2001.\n  My Republican colleagues came to me when we were having these budget \ndebates, and I said, please, do not bet on a 10-year forecast. Let us \nnot be betting the farm on a 10-year forecast because it may not work \nout. Yes, let us have tax cuts, let us have money set aside to \nstrengthen Social Security, but let us not bet the whole farm on these \nforecasts coming true.\n  Some of my best friends on the Republican side said: Kent, you are \nway too conservative. Do you not understand with these tax cuts, we \nwill get a lot more revenue? Do you not understand the way it works? If \nwe have these tax cuts, that will fuel the economy, and we will get \nmuch more revenue. We will be way above the midpoint of this range.\n  Well, let us go back and check what really happened. Here is what \nreally happened. It is this red line. We were not at the midpoint. We \nwere not at the bottom of the range of possible outcomes on the \ndeficits; we were way below the bottom. So this theory that tax cuts \nare going to lead to more revenue did not work out. In the real world, \nit did not work out.\n  Here is what the Federal Reserve Chairman says. He rejects claims \nthat tax cuts will pay for themselves. He said:\n\n       It is very rare and very few economists believe that you \n     can cut taxes and you will get the same amount of revenues.\n\n  He has made other comments on the subject as well. He said last year, \non September 8, in testimony before the House Budget Committee:\n\n       If you're going to lower taxes, you shouldn't be borrowing \n     essentially the tax cut. And that over the long run is not a \n     stable fiscal situation.\n\n  That is exactly what the budget before us asks us to do. It asks us \nto borrow more money to finance more tax cuts when the revenue is \nalready the lowest it has been since 1959.\n  I have to say to my friends, at some point the stuff that is being \nproposed has to add up. If my colleagues do not want to finance the \nspending they are voting for, then vote to cut the spending to match \nthe revenue they will support. If they do not intend to make those cuts \nin spending, then raise the revenue to meet the spending they insist on \npassing.\n  Over and over today, we heard our friends on the other side of the \naisle say this budget is one that is fiscally responsible. I will soon \nhave the chart that shows the year-by-year increases in the debt under \nthis budget.\n  Over and over I heard today that this budget is going to cut the \ndeficit in half. Well, that is a worthy goal--going to cut the deficit \nin half over the next 5 years. The problem with it is they have just \nleft out all kinds of things we know we are going to spend money on. \nThey left out the war costs past September 30. That is $300 billion, \naccording to CBO. They left out $700 billion to fix the alternative \nminimum tax. They left out $700 billion to fund the President's Social \nSecurity plan.\n  It does not stop there because, very interesting, if we go to their \nown budget document on page 5, here is what we find. This is their \nanalysis of how much the debt is going to increase over the 5 years of \ntheir budget. Look at what it shows. These are not my numbers. This was \nnot developed by our side of the aisle. This is our Republican \ncolleagues' own budget document, and here is what they say: If we pass \nthis budget, the debt is going to increase in 2005 by $669 billion. Of \ncourse, that budget is already in play. Next year they say the debt \nwill increase by $636 billion; the next year they say the debt will \nincrease by $624 billion; the next year by $622 billion; the next year \nby $611 billion. How is the debt increase being cut in half? The \ndeficit should be the amount by which the debt increases every year, \nright? Well, this is what they say the debt is going to increase by, \nand yet at the same time they are saying they are cutting the deficit \nin half.\n  How do these two things add up? The only way they add up is by just \nleaving things out. When you put them back in, what you see is the debt \nincreasing each and every year by over $600 billion, and all before the \nbaby boomers retire.\n  What is going to happen then? Massive debt before the baby boomers \nretire, and then a doubling of people eligible for Medicare and Social \nSecurity. Then we have a train wreck.\n  The hard reality is, this budget does virtually nothing about the \ndeficit situation facing the country. In fact, it only makes it worse. \nUnder this budget before us, the deficit is increased by $130 billion \nover and above what would happen if we did nothing. If we put the \nGovernment on autopilot and walked out of here today, the Congressional \nBudget Office says the deficit would be $130 billion less than if we \npass this\n\n[[Page S2638]]\n\nbudget. Yet we heard all day how this is a fiscally disciplined budget.\n  I wish it were so, but it is not. We now face a circumstance in which \nthe country is living beyond its means. We are running a trade deficit \nover $600 billion, a deficit on an operating basis over $600 billion, \nand we are borrowing the money and the President's answer is borrow \nsome more money. Change Social Security, create private accounts, \ndivert money out of Social Security, fill in the difference by \nborrowing trillions of dollars more.\n  Tomorrow we are going to have a debate and a lengthy discussion on \nthe question of Social Security and what the proper course is. I, for \none, believe we do need to fix Social Security. We not only need to fix \nSocial Security, we need to fix Medicare because the shortfall there is \neight times the shortfall in Social Security. The President has no plan \nto address that shortfall.\n  In addition to that, we are running these record budget deficits and \nthe President says make the tax cuts permanent, cut the revenue base \nsome more, and spend more money.\n  This budget spends $100 billion more than last year's budget. I said \nto my colleagues earlier today, this is almost surreal, talking about \nthis budget, how disconnected it is from reality, how far afield it has \nbecome. To hear descriptions of this budget that suggest it is fiscally \nresponsible kind of leaves me shaking my head.\n  Enormous risks are being run. The risks that are being run are that \nthe folks who are loaning us the money decide they are not going to \ncontinue to do it. If that were to happen, the dollar would plummet \nfurther. I have already indicated it is off 33 percent against the Euro \nin just the last several years. But if those who are loaning us money--\nthe Japanese, they have loaned us over $700 billion; the Chinese, they \nhave loaned us over $200 billion; the South Koreans, they have loaned \nus almost $70 billion--if they decided no longer to continue loaning us \nthese amounts of money, what would we do? What would the options be \nthat would be open to us? How would we pay our bills?\n  That is a question we ought to be thinking about very carefully. If \nthose who are loaning us these vast amounts of money decided that they \nwere running too great a risk, if they decided they were tired of \nlosing the value of their investments because the value of the dollar \nis constantly eroding, what would be the choices left to us? Very \nclearly we would have to dramatically raise interest rates. That would \nhave a very serious impact on our economy, very serious, because not \nonly do we have government debt--Federal Government, State government, \nlocal government--corporations have debt and individuals have debt--\nthey have mortgage debt, they have car loan debt, they have student \nloan debt. What would happen to all of that debt if all of a sudden \ninterest rates had to rise quickly and dramatically in order to get \nforeign capital back into the country to float this boat because of \nthese massive budget deficits and trade deficits? What then? That is \nthe risk that is being run. That is the risk that is being run with \nthis reckless fiscal policy.\n  Our friends on the other side have described themselves as \nconservative. There is nothing conservative about the budget policy of \nthis Government. This is a wildly reckless fiscal policy of record \ndeficits, of record increases in debt with no end in sight, and this \nbudget is more of the same. By its own terms, it says it is going to \nincrease the debt every year of this budget by over $600 billion a \nyear. Debt on top of debt.\n  It is not too late. The time is still available to us to change \ncourse, to go to the American people and say: You know, we have to trim \nour sails. We are living beyond our means. We have to take steps to \nreduce this growth of deficits and debt. Yes, we need more revenue. \nRevenue is at the lowest it has been since 1959. That doesn't mean the \nfirst thing we do is raise taxes because could you get more revenue \nwithout a tax increase. You could get more revenue by collecting the \ntaxes that are due now. The Internal Revenue Service tells us that the \ntax gap, the difference between what is owed and what is being paid, is \nover $300 billion a year. That is money that is owed that is not being \npaid. Why should we increase taxes on anybody before we collect taxes \nfrom people that already owe it?\n  The vast majority of the American people pay what they owe. But we \nhave a growing number of people and a growing number of companies that \nare not paying what they owe. The result is the burden gets shifted \nonto all the rest of us who do pay what we owe.\n  Part of the result is these massive budget deficits. Yes, we have to \nbe tough on the spending side of the ledger as well, without question. \nWe are going to have to be tough on the spending side. But our \nRepublican friends never want to talk about the revenue side. They say \ndeficits are simply a result of spending.\n  No, deficits are a result of the relationship between spending and \nrevenue. What has happened is very clear. The facts demonstrate it \nconclusively. The revenue side of the equation has collapsed. Last year \nshows the lowest revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product \nsince 1959, and spending has gone up.\n  I would be the first to say the administration has increased spending \nwith complete bipartisan support. The increase in spending has been \nprimarily in three areas: Defense, homeland security, rebuilding New \nYork. Those are the areas where the spending has gone up. In fact, \nvirtually all of the spending increases are in just those three areas. \nBut that is the reality. Spending has gone up, revenue has gone down. \nWe couldn't pay our bills before, and we sure can't pay them now. The \nproposal is spend even more, have even less revenue.\n  The deficits get worse and they get worse at the worst possible time, \nright before the baby boomers retire. That puts enormous strain on the \nbudget of our country.\n  What difference does it make? The difference it makes is somehow you \nhave to pay these bills. If we are not going to cut the spending to \nmatch the revenue or raise the revenue to match the spending, then the \nonly alternative is to continue to borrow, borrow, borrow. And \nincreasingly, we are borrowing from countries all over the world. That \nmakes us more vulnerable.\n  I have never heard of a country borrowing its way to power. I have \nnever heard of a country strengthening itself by becoming more indebted \nto others. I have never heard of a country that built its power on \nbeing the biggest debtor nation in the world, which we have now become. \nWe have gone in the last 30 years from being the biggest creditor \nnation in the world to being the biggest debtor nation.\n  You can do that for a while, just as a family can live beyond its \nmeans for a while. But at some point the bills come due. At some point \nyou have to pay up.\n  The challenge for us is to get on a different course and a different \ntrendline as quickly as we can. We have seen this country take on \nchallenges such as this many times before and succeed. The strength of \nAmerica is our resilience and our ability to change course to meet \nchallenges. We did it in World War I, in World War II, and we did it in \nthe Great Depression. We did it in the 1990s when we were faced with \nmassive deficits as well and we were able to get back on a course that \nturned deficits into surplus. Now that course is reversed once again. \nUnfortunately, unlike the 1980s when we had more time to get well, this \ntime there is very little time to get our financial house in order \nbefore the baby boomers start to retire.\n  Hopefully, tomorrow we will begin to agree to some amendments to this \nbudget that will reduce the buildup of deficits and debt and begin to \nset us on a course toward fiscal responsibility. I hope that will \nhappen. We will certainly have a vigorous debate and discussion and \namendments tomorrow, and I look forward to it.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the executive branch agencies have many \nprograms to recognize performance and talent. In the legislative \nbranch, we too often take personal effort and hard work for granted. \nUnfortunately, the Senate does not possess many ways to recognize \nexcellence, and too often we recognize outstanding people only at their \nfarewell parties when they leave to assume a high-level position \ndowntown.\n  Today, I would like to take a little time off the debate clock to \nmention something that is not debatable. I\n\n[[Page S2639]]\n\nthink this is simply stating something that all members, on both sides \nof the aisle, know only too well. I want to recognize three members of \nour Senate Budget committee staff who exemplify the highest standards \nof public service--Jim Hearn, Cheri Reidy, and Dave Pappone.\n  During the recent transition, I was very fortunate to have three of \nthe very best in the Senate, and the U.S. Government, elect to stay \nwith the committee. Jim, Cheri, and Dave Pappone are among the best I \nhave seen. They serve as the institutional knowledge and conscience of \nthe committee. I have benefited greatly from the advice and counsel of \nthese professionals who have served the committee under former Chairmen \nPete Domenici and Don Nickles. I am proud to say now they are part of \nmy team. When I announced in November that I intended to assume the \nchairmanship of the Budget Committee, I began to sit through ``budget \nschool'' tutorials with these three to go over the intricacies of the \nbudget process and the Budget Act. Since then, they provide outstanding \nstaff work and recommendations. The resolution before the Senate is \nhere on time and out of committee in not small measure based on their \nhard work.\n  Jim Hearn joined the budget committee in 1995. He holds a Master of \nPublic Policy degree with a concentration in Economics and Forecasting \nfrom the University of California at Berkeley. Jim served with the \nCongressional Budget Office, or CBO, from 1984 until 1995. He serves as \nour director for Federal Programs and Budget Process. He also is author \nof our committee's Budget Bulletin, which distills and explains the \nlatest budget developments on the Hill, and seeks to explain complex \nbudgetary concepts. Jim is one of those people in Washington who fully \nunderstands the Budget Act and the budgetary process. The technical \naccuracy of the budget, and the drive to bring ``good government \nsolutions'' to the budget process are Jim's constant passion. He is \nrespected by CBO, OMB, and budget experts everywhere--inside and \noutside Government. Countless Senate committees know they can count on \nJim to give them an honest evaluation of budgetary proposals and \nscoring.\n  Cheri Reidy joined the Budget Committee in 1982. She holds a Master \nof Public Policy Analysis from the University of Rochester with an \nemphasis in statistical and economic analysis and program evaluation. \nHer undergraduate degree is in Psychology which, no doubt, serves her \nwell in understanding the budget process. Cheri serves as our director \nfor Revenues and Budget Review. Cheri understands all sides of the \nPAYGO ledger as well as anyone--she especially knows revenues and tax \npolicy. I sometimes think she is the anchor, the core of our \nprofessional staff. She is tireless and remains cool under pressure. \nShe spends time with our new committee staff teaching them the ins and \nouts of budget review and the type of products required to be able to \ndraft a chairman's mark within several days of getting the CBO \nreestimate of the President's Budget. Cheri is brilliant, a team \nplayer, and a pleasure to work with.\n  David Pappone joined the Budget Committee 3 years ago, when he \nstarted as the functional analyst for education and space/science. \nDavid holds a Master of Public Administration with a concentration in \nBudget and Public Finance from George Washington University. There was \na television ad years ago for Digital Computers that said, ``If you can \nmake the numbers work--it's the big time.'' Well, Dave Pappone is a \ngenius with spreadsheets and managing information from OMB, CBO, and a \nnumber of functional analysts on our staff. David makes the numbers \nwork and produces a number of complex, funding tables and charts in a \nfashion that seems seamless and almost effortless. He is a one man CBO \nfor our committee and gives us 110 percent day in and day out.\n  Mr. President, the Budget Committee has an extraordinary staff. On a \ndaily basis I am impressed with their tireless energy, professionalism, \nand teamwork. At the core are Jim, Cheri, and Dave, and I just wanted \nto recognize them and say thanks.\n  Mr. President, today I want to also recognize the achievements of Don \nDempsy of my staff, as he moves from the staff of the Budget Committee \nto serve as the legislative director for the Senator from North \nCarolina, Mr. Burr.\n  Don is one of those rare persons who combines unusual academic and \nintellectual achievements with a keen, practical, and effective role in \npublic policy. Well educated as an economist, he has applied this \nexpertise to health care policy and other public policy areas for over \n10 years.\n  He began his work on the Hill in 1996 and his talents were quickly \nrecognized by a number of Senators. He was promoted over the next few \nyears to positions of increasing responsibility in the offices of the \nincomparable Senator Gramm and upon his retirement, in the office of \nSenator Kyl.\n  His accomplishments and expertise with those Finance Committee \nmembers are well known. Early last year he joined the Budget Committee \nunder the chairmanship of my predecessor Senator Nickles. We were \nfortunate enough to benefit from his understanding of the budget and \ntwo crucial entitlement programs, Medicaid and Medicare, as well as his \nintensive knowledge of the full range of health programs.\n  Don, characteristically, has put his work and his loyalty to the \nSenate first, and left our office Friday and begins work today with \nSenator Burr without a break. The Senate and the country thank him for \nhis service.\n  I yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have come to the floor of the Senate \ntonight to sort of finish up the day, mainly because I am a westerner. \nI know that many people listen to the coverage of the Senate, but in \nthe West it often happens that the speeches pertaining to the interests \nof the West come off in the middle of the day. And it is now 8:40 p.m. \nhere. That means it is 5:40 on the west coast and 4:40 in Alaska, my \nhome.\n  I feel the west coast has been misrepresented as far as the issues \nthat pertain to the development of the Arctic Slope in my State. Gone \nare the days of the great supporters such as Warren Magnuson and \nSenator Jackson and Senator Hatfield from Oregon and Senator Hayakawa \nand others from California. We have almost unanimous opposition to the \ndevelopment of the Arctic Slope now from the west coast. Yet it was the \nwest coast that got most of the oil that came from the development of \nPrudhoe Bay.\n  I have lived through this whole period and I want to talk a little \nbit about the history of it. But I hope people living on the west coast \nwho listen to this and view this program will think a little bit about \nit and call their Senators and ask them, Why are they opposing the \ndevelopment of domestic oil? Why are they insisting on relying upon \nforeign sources of oil?\n  In recent months many have voiced concern about the emerging economic \nrecovery, job creation, our national security, and increasing gasoline \nprices. In my view, we can only have a full debate on this budget \nresolution if we discuss what I believe is the source of many of these \nproblems.\n  It has been 12 years since the United States adopted comprehensive \nenergy legislation, adopted a bill to send to the President a new \nenergy program. For more than a decade, our outdated policy has been a \nbarrier to our economic growth and opportunity. It is like a cancer \nspreading to all corners of our country and all industries in our \neconomy.\n  Without sound, balanced energy policy that reflects our current \ncircumstances, Americans will continue to see the symptoms of this \ncancer in their daily lives: higher prices at the pump, the fear of \nwhole cities held hostage by blackouts, and the whims of unstable \ngovernments and unfriendly regimes we rely upon for basic energy needs.\n  I hope later to address the sweeping impact of our Nation's \ninsufficient energy policy on all segments of our economy. But I want \nto begin tonight by putting these issues in historical\n\n[[Page S2640]]\n\ncontext and reviewing the history of what is called ANWR and the energy \ncrisis of the 1970s.\n  In 1960, Secretary of the Interior Fred Seaton established the 8.9 \nmillion acre Arctic National Wildlife Range and stipulated the range \nwas open for mineral leasing. As the only current Member who worked in \nthe Eisenhower administration, and one who drafted portions of the \norder creating the Arctic National Wildlife Range, attempts to convince \nthe Congress that the range was ever closed to oil and gas exploration \nis a mischaracterization of the intent of its creators, the history of \nthe range, and the purpose of the coastal plain of ANWR itself.\n  Contrary to misinformation, neither the Arctic Wildlife Range nor the \ncoastal plain of ANWR were ``set aside specifically for preserving \nwildlife for future generations.'' That is a quote many people use. In \nfact, both the order creating the range and the Alaska National \nInterest Lands Conservation Act, which we call ANILCA, which created \nthis area called ANWR, contain specific provisions permitting oil and \ngas exploration and development of our coastal plain.\n  The process which culminated in the creation of the range was \ndesigned to balance a myriad of interests. As the then-solicitor for \nthe Interior Secretary Seaton, my office was responsible for processing \nthe order which established the range. I personally, as an Alaskan, \nworked with conservationists, Alaska sportsmen, and industry to find \nthe appropriate balance between conservation and development. In fact, \nSecretary Seaton himself stated that ``Subsurface development will be \nundertaken in accordance with regulations that will protect and \npreserve the wildlife and the primitive character of the land.''\n  The then-Under Secretary at the time, Elmer Bennett, assured our \nState:\n\n       This Department has every intention to foster legitimate \n     oil and gas activity within this area if any potential is \n     discovered.\n\n  Many have forgotten the lessons learned in the 1970s. Before the \nenergy crisis, there were warning signs. In Congress, we held extensive \nhearings in 1972 on all aspects of energy supply, and we were warned \nover and over that unless we reevaluated our Nation's policy on energy \nconsumption and development, the country would essentially be unable to \nmeet its energy needs.\n  By increasing our dependence on foreign oil year after year and \nfailing to increase domestic production, we left ourselves vulnerable \nto OPEC's decision on October 18, 1973, to impose the Arab oil embargo. \nOPEC's decision was a retaliatory act. It was retribution for our \nforeign policy during the October Middle East war.\n  The embargo lasted until March 1974, and as a Member of the Senate in \n1973, I can tell you those were difficult times. The cost of foreign \noil rose nearly 400 percent, and the impact on our constituents was \nbrutal. Our people waited in long lines at gas stations throughout our \nNation, and the cost of gasoline prevented them from traveling by \nautomobile as they had in the past.\n  The embargo decreased industrial productivity, increased \nunemployment, and accelerated inflation. Secretary of State Henry \nKissinger estimated that the embargo of the 1970s cost us 500,000 jobs \nand more than $10 billion in national production.\n  America's consumers paid the price for that crisis. The price of oil \nrose, but so did the price of coal, natural gas, electricity, and even \nfirewood. My colleague at the time, Senator Henry Jackson from \nWashington, estimated every American paid almost $500 more in 1974 for \nenergy. Adjusted for inflation, that would be over $1,000 apiece today.\n  I remember well President Nixon's words, when the oil embargo began, \nin a televised speech on November 7, 1973. He called on Congress to \nenact a major energy bill, something he had asked us to do repeatedly \nfor 2 years. He told the country:\n\n       Our failure to act now on our long-term energy problems \n     could seriously endanger the capacity of our farms and \n     factories to employ Americans at recordbreaking rates . . . \n     It could reduce the capacity of our farmers to provide the \n     food we need. It could jeopardize the entire transportation \n     system. It could seriously weaken the ability of America to \n     continue to give the leadership which only we can provide to \n     keep the peace that we have won at such great cost . . .\n\n  What strikes me as I read President Nixon's speech today is that \nPresident Bush could give the same speech now. We again need \ncomprehensive energy legislation, and the stakes are still high.\n  In the wake of the 1970s energy crisis, Congress debated the Trans-\nAlaska Pipeline Authorization Act. During that debate, opposition came \nto the Senate floor and made dire predictions. They argued that \nconstruction of the pipeline would devastate Alaska's landscape and \nwildlife in the area.\n  For instance, Senator Kennedy predicted:\n\n       Earthquakes [would] create oil spills which would wreak \n     havoc with the Alaskan environment . . . The heat generated \n     by the oil flow . . . would have a detrimental effect on \n     Alaskan tundra and upset the whole ecology of the region . . \n     . and the pipeline [would] become a barrier which would \n     seriously interrupt the migratory patterns and normal \n     movements of various species of wildlife.\n\n  And the friends of the Earth testified at a congressional hearing in \n1969:\n\n       There is no technology that could restore the wilderness \n     that the pipeline would destroy.\n\n  These dire predictions did not come to pass. The Alaskan pipeline \nwithstood an earthquake of 7.9 magnitude on the Richter scale and not a \ndrop of oil was spilled--not one drop during that earthquake. \nSimilarly, our tundra has not been impacted by the flow of oil, nor has \nthe migration of wildlife been affected. In fact, the caribou \npopulation in the vicinity of the pipeline increased from 3,000 in the \n1970s to 32,000 today.\n  Even former Congressman Mo Udall, who had argued on the floor of the \nHouse that the pipeline would damage Alaska's ecosystem acknowledged \nthat he was wrong. He stated;\n\n       We've had 15 years or so with Prudhoe and we came out \n     pretty good. . . . the people who talked about ecological \n     disaster have been proven very wrong.\n\n  Environmental organizations agreed during debate on the pipeline that \ndevelopment of Alaska's resources is important. Stephen R. Seater of \nthe Defenders of Wildlife testified:\n\n       Defenders of Wildlife does not oppose development of \n     Alaskan North Slope oil and gas. The United States is \n     suffering from a lack of fuel, and it has been said by many \n     experts that by mid-summer we will be in a full-blown fuel \n     crisis.\n\n  And Thomas B. Stoel of the Natural Resources Defense Council \ntestified:\n\n       [T]he national security importance of Alaskan North Slope \n     oil is that it will relieve the United States of the \n     necessity to import an equal amount of foreign oil.\n\n  Despite differences over the possible routes for the transportation \nof Alaska's oil resources to the Lower 48, almost all Members of the \nSenate and House agreed that development of Alaskan oil was vitally \nimportant to both America's national security and the continued \neconomic well being of the U.S.\n  I emphasize this: that is why the vote on passage of the Pipeline Act \nwas allowed to proceed without the threat of filibuster. Not one \nSenator suggested filibustering the Alaskan Oil Pipeline Act.\n  The passage of the Pipeline Act was adopted by one vote when Vice \nPresident Agnew came to Congress and broke the tied vote. Congress \ndirected the Secretary of the Interior to move immediately to authorize \nconstruction of the 798-mile pipeline connecting the North Slope with \nthe port of Valdez to deliver oil to the Lower 48.\n  Four years later, the first tanker carrying North Slope crude oil \nleft Valdez, Alaska. Over 14 billion barrels of oil have been \ntransported through the pipeline since then. Today it provides nearly \n20 percent of our domestic oil production, although the throughput of \nthe pipeline has been reduced from a peak of 2.1 million barrels per \nday to about 750,000 barrels per day. That is why we must get into ANWR \nand that is why we must discover additional reserves.\n  At the time, construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline was the \nlargest privately financed construction project ever attempted. It \nstands as a testament to American ingenuity and our ability to balance \nprotection of the environment with production of our natural resources.\n\n  Alaska's vast resource potential was again raised in 1978 during \ndebate on the Alaska National Interest Lands\n\n[[Page S2641]]\n\nConservation Act. This act resulted in the creation of over 100 million \nacres of parks, wildlife refuges and national forests and tripled the \namount of land designated as wilderness.\n  During this debate, the Alaska delegation asked for a stipulation to \nallow the coastal plain of ANWR to remain open for oil and gas \nexploration and development, as it was when the Arctic Range was \ncreated.\n  As in the pipeline debate, many Members raised concerns about the \nenvironmental impact such development would have on the region. \nHowever, even those Members acknowledged that oil and gas exploration \nand development would occur if necessary for our national security.\n  Even Congressman Udall stated:\n\n       [N]othing stops some future Congress from allowing the \n     exploration for these uses if they are of sufficient national \n     importance.\n\n  He went on to say that a:\n\n     sizable find in the Arctic Range [would be] economically \n     feasible by the year 2000.\n\n  Thus, even a staunch environmentalist acknowledged that the coastal \nplain of ANWR would be developed in the future.\n  To ensure that the oil and gas rich coastal plain remained open for \nexploration and development, I worked closely with Senator Henry \n``Scoop'' Jackson and Senator Paul Tsongas. They promised that oil and \ngas activity would take place in ANWR subject to an environmental \nimpact statement.\n  In the spirit of compromise, Senators Jackson and Tsongas created \nSection 1002 of ANILCA, which set aside 1.5 million acres along the \ncoastal plain of ANWR for oil and gas exploration and development.\n  But in the years that followed, the promise made by Senators Jackson \nand Tsongas has not been upheld. I have now fought for 24 years to see \nthat promise fulfilled and to bring to the United States the energy \nresources it so desperately needs. I have been thwarted because this \nbody no longer respects the promises made by its predecessors.\n  There is a new climate in Congress. With the retirement and passing \nof the old bull World War II types like myself, a Member's word doesn't \ncarry the meaning it used to. Even President Jimmy Carter, who signed \nthe 1980 act, has failed to honor the legislation he helped create. I \nrecently received a letter from President Carter which said that \n``Congress may try to subvert parts of ANILCA'' by utilizing the budget \nprocess.\n  Congress has not gone back on its commitments, nor is it taking a \n``back door approach'' to legislating this important issue. Section \n1002 specifically authorizes exploratory oil and gas activities on the \ncoastal plain and mandates an environmental study. That environmental \nimpact study was completed and submitted to Congress in 1987!\n  Section 1003 of the 1980 act states that no development in ANWR can \ntake placement without Congressional authorization. We have tried for \nyears to open ANWR pursuant to that section, and have been thwarted by \nthe threat of a filibuster.\n  President Carter also stated that we are trying to ``circumvent \nnormal legislative procedures'' by inserting ANWR into the budget \nprocess. I ask my colleagues, since when have filibusters become \n``normal legislative procedure?'' Isn't the will of the people served \nby a simple majority vote? That is all we are asking for when we put \nthis in the Budget Resolution, a simple majority vote, and not \nsubjecting ANWR to a filibuster, which was unheard of in the 1970's in \nmatters concerning national security, and the availability of this oil \nfrom our Arctic is surely a matter of national security.\n  This year is my 37th year in the Senate; I can remember a time when \nthe filibuster was used sparingly, and I don't recall it ever being \nused when an issue of national security importance was before the \nSenate.\n  ANWR is a national security issue. When the Nation depends on 60 \npercent of our energy needs from unstable or unfriendly regimes, that \ninvolves a national security issue. When U.S. companies move their \noperations offshore because of high energy prices, this is a national \nsecurity issue. When Americans can no longer afford to heat their \nhomes, this is a national security issue. And when our military, which \nis the largest consumer of energy resources, is forced to rely on oil \nfrom the Middle East, this is a national security issue.\n  This Congress has failed to balance conservation with development and \nnow we are--literally--paying the price.\n  We have not seized opportunities to increase domestic production of \noil and natural gas. And, higher gasoline prices, dependence on foreign \noil, and a fragile economy--issues that many Members have expressed \nconcern about--are the signs that another energy crisis looms over us.\n  It is my hope that my colleagues will heed the lessons of history and \nact now. We cannot wait for another national crisis. The provisions in \nthe budget resolution starting the process of approval of ANWR by \nmajority vote must be supported.\n  Further, Congress must make good on its promise and open ANWR to \nexploration and development and begin the projects our country needs to \nmeet our energy demands now.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez).

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation.

Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  A 45-year-old transgender woman was found beaten to death by San \nFrancisco authorities last August.

The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/14/senate-section/article/S2641-3", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2641-S2642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE COOPERATION ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join with Senator \nGregg in championing this important legislation to give fire fighters, \npolice officers, emergency medical personnel, and other first \nresponders the basic right at long last to fair representation in the \nworkplace.\n  Every year, tens of thousands of police officers and fire fighters \nare injured on the job. Even apart from the extraordinary tragedy of \nthe loss of over 400 fire fighters and police officers on a single day \non 9/11, hundreds of fire fighters and police officers lose their lives \nin the line of duty each year. This bill is a needed bipartisan effort \nto protect our Nation's public safety officers and the communities they \nserve. Providing such protections is the least we can do for them in \nlight of the sacrifices they make every day for our country.\n  For more than 60 years, the Federal Government has recognized the \nright of employees to bargain collectively with their employers. It \nencourages labor and management to work together to improve wages and \nworking conditions and increase productivity. Collective bargaining has \nled the way on many important changes in today's workplace, such as \nhealth and pension benefits, paid holidays and sick leave, and \nworkplace safety. Our legislation will\n\n[[Page S2642]]\n\nensure that first responders will also have this fundamental right.\n  Granting this right to first responders also benefits the public in \nessential ways. It creates safer working conditions for public safety \nemployees and increases public safety. It saves money for states and \nlocal communities by providing more cost-efficient public safety \nservices. And it gives a voice on the job to the courageous public \nservants who put their lives on the line each day to protect and serve \nus.\n  First responders are well aware what it takes to create safe working \nconditions, and they know what it takes to enhance public safety. This \nlegislation gives first responders the opportunity to discuss on-the-\njob safety issues with management, and a meaningful role in \nestablishing policies and practices to protect the public.\n  In addition to improving public safety, this bill will save money. \nExperience has shown that when first responders are able to discuss \nworkplace conditions with management their departments can provide more \ncost-effective services. Extending collective bargaining rights to all \npublic safety employees will encourage innovation, efficiency and \npartnership in public safety departments, and produce lower costs for \nthe States and local communities they serve.\n  Our legislation accomplishes its goals in reasonable and moderate \nways. Most states would not be affected, because their laws already \npermit collective bargaining between public safety employees and \nemployers.\n  Under this bill, states that do not do so may choose to establish \ntheir own collective bargaining system, or they may ask the assistance \nof the Federal Labor Relations Authority in establishing bargaining \nprocedures and regulations. This approach respects existing state laws \nand gives each state the authority to decide how it will comply with \nthis legislation.\n  The benefits of this bill are clear and compelling. Public safety \nworkers are one of the largest sectors of the workplace that do not yet \nhave the basic right to form a union and bargain with their employers \nover wages, hours, and working conditions. It is a matter of basic \nfairness to give these courageous men and women the same rights that \nhave long benefited so many other Americans. They deserve a voice in \nthe life and death discussions about their work. They have earned that \nright, and I urge Congress to act quickly to guarantee it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/14/senate-section/article/S2642-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2642-S2643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CELEBRATING NATIONAL SAFE PLACE WEEK\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am please to recognize the week of March \n13 through 19, 2005, as National Safe Place Week. As my colleagues \nknow, the Senate adopted a resolution last week providing for this \ndesignation. I thank my colleague, Senator Feinstein, for her work on \nthis issue, and I also thank the other cosponsors of this resolution: \nSenator Boxer, Senator Cochran, Senator Crapo, Senator DeWine, Senator \nDodd, Senator Durbin, Senator Feingold, Senator Hatch, Senator Inhofe, \nSenator Inouye, Senator Isakson, Senator Johnson, Senator Kohl, Senator \nLandrieu, Senator Lieberman, Senator Lincoln, Senator Lugar, Senator \nMikulski, and Senator Murkowski. The Senate's action recognizes the \nimportance of Project Safe Place and sends a message that we will keep \nworking to protect our children. In countless ours of selfless work, \nvolunteers truly do make a difference every day, and in passing this \nresolution, the Senate applauds the tireless efforts of the thousands \nof dedicated volunteers across the nation for their many contributions \nto the youth of our Nation through Project Safe Place.\n  Events of the day may turn our attention overseas, but it is \nessential to remember those who are fighting an ongoing battle right \nhere at home to protect this Nation's must valuable resource: our \nchildren. Young people are the future of this Nation; they need to be \nboth valued and protected. Sadly, however, as my colleagues know, this \nprecious resource is threatened daily.\n  There is a tremendous initiative between the public and private \nsector that has been reaching out to youth for over 20 years. Project \nSafe Place is a program that was developed to assist our Nation's youth \nand families in crisis. This partnership creates a network of private \nbusinesses trained to refer youth in need to the local service \nproviders who can help them. Those businesses display a Safe Place sign \nso that young people can easily recognize a ``safe place'' for them to \ngo to receive help.\n  The goal of National Safe Place Week is to recognize the thousands of \nindividuals who work to make Project Safe Place a reality. From trained \nvolunteers to seasoned professionals, these dedicated individuals are \nworking together with the resources in their local communities and \nthrough their ties across the Nation to serve young people. Because of \nProject Safe Place, this all happens under a well-known symbol of \nsafety for in-crisis youth.\n  Project Safe Place is a simple program to implement in any local \ncommunity, and it works. Young people are more likely to seek help in \nlocations that are familiar and nonthreatening to them. By creating a \nnetwork of Safe Places across the Nation, all youth will have access to \nneeded help, counseling, or a safe place to stay. However, though the \nprogram has already been established in 42 States, there are still too \nmany communities that do not know about this valuable youth resource.\n  If your State does not already have a Safe Place organization, please \nconsider facilitating this worthwhile resource so that young people who \nare abused, neglected, or whose futures are jeopardized by physical or \nemotional trauma will have access to immediate help and safety in your \ncommunity. To create more Project Safe Place sites in Idaho, the staff \nin several of my State offices have completed the training to make them \nSafe Place sites, and now have the skills and ability to assist \ntroubled youth. In the coming years, Project Safe Place hopes that \nevery child in America will have the opportunity to connect with \nsomeone who can provide immediate help by easily recognizing the Safe \nPlace sign.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I also rise today to recognize \nNational Safe Place Week, which begins on March 13, 2005.\n  I am proud to join Senator Craig as an original cosponsor of S. Res. \n71, which designates the week of March 13-19, 2005 as National Safe \nPlace Week. This resolution recognizes the participating businesses, \ncommunity organizations, youth service agencies and volunteers that are \npart of the YMCA National Safe Place program and work for the safety \nand well-being of at-risk youth.\n  Youth today face an ever-growing amount of pressure in their daily \nlives at school, at home, and in the community. For some youth, \nproblems include abuse or neglect at home, drug or alcohol addictions \nof family members and friends, trouble at school or dangerous \nsituations on a date. Young people who face these situations should not \nfeel left alone, but should have a place in their community to which to \nturn.\n  Over the past 22 years, the National Safe Place program has connected \nover 79,000 youth in crisis to immediate help at Safe Place locations \nand has provided over 78,000 youth with counseling by phone. Present in \n41 States and serving 714 communities, the National Safe Place program \nbrings together the private and public sector to reach out and help at-\nrisk youth who are lost, scared, threatened or in unsafe situations. In \nmy home State of California, there are nine designated Safe Place \nprograms with over 1,667 Safe Place sites located in 65 communities.\n  National Safe Place sites include fast food restaurants, convenience \nstores, fire stations, libraries and other public buildings and are \nmarked by large, yellow Safe Place signs displayed prominently in front \nwindows. Any youth can walk into a Safe Place site and receive \nimmediate help from a trained volunteer, and further help from a Safe \nPlace staff person who can provide counseling, residential assistance \nor professional referrals, as needed.\n  The National Safe Place Week recognizes the time, resources and \nenergy of thousands of businesses, community organizations and \nvolunteers who make this effective, growing network of support for \nyouth possible. In addition, it seeks to increase awareness of the \ncrises that youth face today.\n  I am encouraged by the National Safe Place Program's positive impact \non communities throughout the Nation, and I hope that more communities \nwill\n\n[[Page S2643]]\n\nchoose to participate in this innovative program. I believe that the \nNational Safe Place program brings us closer to making our country safe \nfor youth, and for that I offer my full support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/14/senate-section/article/S2643-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JOHN GILLILAND\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to commend John Gilliland, \nwho worked for me on the trade staff of the Finance Committee for the \nlast 2 years. He left to go work for the law firm of Miller and \nChevalier, where I know he will be a great success.\n  We were lucky to have John with us on the Committee for 2 years. But \nhe has been working hard on public policy issues for much longer than \nthat.\n  John began his Senate career in the office of my good friend and \ncolleague, Senator Blanche Lincoln. John worked for 2 years as her \nlegislative counsel on trade and agriculture issues. Senator Lincoln, \nof course, was instrumental in helping us pass the 2002 farm bill and \nthe Trade Act of 2002, and John was her key staffer on both pieces of \nlegislation.\n  My staff worked closely with John on these issues, and everyone was \nso impressed by him that I hired him to help us on the Finance \nCommittee.\n  I am glad we did. John has been a tremendous asset. He knows \nagriculture and trade inside and out. I am always amazed that I can ask \nhim almost anything, and he not only knows that answer, but can give me \nall of the history, politics, and nuance.\n  His knowledge of agriculture was particularly important for Montana, \nwhere farming and ranching are the engine of our export income. John is \nsomebody who I trusted to represent me in Montana, and someone who I \ntrusted to represent Montana here in Washington. That alone is saying a \nlot.\n  John worked on some difficult and important issues while on the \nFinance Committee. He played a key role in the Australia free-trade \nagreement and was responsible for oversight of WTO negotiations. He was \nalso a strong advocate for our work to end the embargo against Cuba, \nand he helped negotiate the first ever Montana-Cuba agriculture trade \ndeal. In fact, John traveled with me on several of my trade missions, \nincluding to Cuba, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand.\n  John is also someone who is very dedicated to his family. He is lucky \nto have a wonderful wife, Rebecca, and three great kids-Will, Hudson, \nand Rebecca Jane. And they are fortunate to have a hard-working and \ntalented husband and father.\n  Now, all of this is not to say that John doesn't have his faults. \nMost of his colleagues give John a hard time for not being able to \nmatch his clothes. Their criticism is warranted. In fact, on a trip to \nThailand last year, we finally forced him to buy a new suit and some \ndress shirts. I am confident that we have now set him on the right \npath.\n  Having visited John at his desk, I can also say that I am happy that \nOSHA never paid him a visit. I heard someone describe John and his \noffice best when they said that he combines southern charm with \nnorthern efficiency and third-world desk organization.\n  All of that said these are about the worst things you can say about \nJohn. In fact, you would be hard pressed to find a person who does not \nlike John. He is truly one of the nicest and most genuine people you \nwill ever meet. There are a lot of people in this town with substantive \nknowledge, but there are few who can put together the substance, \npersonality, and strategy and be truly exceptional. John is one of \nthose people.\n  I always say that public service is one of the most noble things a \nperson can do. John Gilliland embodies the best in public service. He \nis aces. And I wish him the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/14/senate-section/article/S2643-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       CONGRATULATING BODE MILLER\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \ncongratulate a great Granite Stater, Bode Miller. On Saturday Bode \nbecame the first American in 22 years to ski his way to the overall \nWorld Cup title. An Easton, NH native, Bode perfected his talents on \nthe slopes of Cannon Mountain and now serves as the Director of Skiing \nat Bretton Woods. His style may not be conventional. It has been said \nthat, like a good many New Hampshire natives, he has a mind of his own \nand enjoys doing things his own way. That independent spirit helped him \ndo something else his own way this past Saturday--win the overall World \nCup trophy.\n  The American World Cup drought has been in place since 1983 and, as \nBode said on Saturday, had grown into ``curse'' proportions. In New \nEngland, we don't take kindly to sports ``curses.'' Since the turn of \nthe century, New Hampshire's sporting faith has been rewarded with \nthree Super Bowl trophies from the New England Patriots and, of course, \nthe much talked about World Series title in October by the Boston Red \nSox. Bode's extraordinary feats on the ski slopes of Europe have gained \nhim worldwide recognition and has an extra special importance for those \nfrom New Hampshire who enjoy some of best skiing in the world in the \nWhite Mountains. We are proud that the slopes we enjoy skiing each \nwinter, albeit at speeds much slower than Bode, have been the training \nground for the world's best skier.\n  Bode donned his first pair of skis at the age of 3 and spent much of \nhis early skiing life on the slopes of Cannon Mountain. He entered his \nfirst race when he was 11 and attended the Carrabassett Valley Academy \nin Maine and went on to the Junior Olympics in 1996, where he first \nmade a name for himself. Bode competed in the 1998 and 2002 Winter \nOlympics, and he has collected eighteen World Cup wins over his career.\n  At 27 years of age, Bode Miller has accomplished the most sought-\nafter spot of every skier, and has done so with his own style, \ndetermination, physical stamina and personality. Today we congratulate \nBode Miller on this tremendous accomplishment, and we look forward to \ncontinuing to follow the eventful progress of the world's greatest \nskier.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      HAPPY BIRTHDAY GEORGE WIDMAN\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \ncome to the floor today to wish a legendary North Dakota businessman, \nGeorge Widman, a happy belated birthday. On Saturday, March 12, George \nturned 85. He celebrated this momentous birthday yesterday with friends \nand family. I never forget George's birthday because we share March 12 \nas our birthdays.\n  George and I have known each other many years, and his resiliency is \nsomething I have long admired. Following the disastrous floods and fire \nthat struck downtown Grand Forks in 1997, George was wondering whether \nor not his world famous Widman's Candy Store would see another day. He \ntold his wife, Betty, they could build the new candy store anywhere in \nthe world, but they both agreed it was best to stay in Grand Forks and \nrebuild their business they had spent so many years crafting into a \ndowntown Grand Forks landmark.\n  After Grand Forks had started to rebuild following this disastrous \nflood, George was kind enough to send every U.S. Senator a Widman's \nchocolate bar with the words ``thank you'' imprinted on it. This \ndescribes George's approach to life: give of yourself for the benefit \nof others.\n  George epitomizes everything North Dakota represents. Growing up \nduring the Great Depression, he learned at an early age that in order \nto succeed hard work is required. He is very proud of his military \nservice in World War II. He is a Navy veteran and served on the USS \nBunker Hill from 1942 until his ship was hit in battle in 1945, He is \ndevoted to his family, his community, and his Nation--all reasons we \nshould pay tribute to George on his birthday and every day.\n  Today, three of George's six children are also in the candy business. \nEven though he has long passed the normal retirement age in our Nation, \nhe stills comes to work every day to make candy and interact with the \npublic he loves dearly. As George puts it, it's not about the money, \nbut the people he serves.\n  Again, it is my pleasure to honor George on his 85th birthday and \nwish him continued health and happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/14/senate-section/article/S2643-3", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2643-S2644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S2644]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/14/senate-section/article/S2643-3", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2643-S2644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S2644]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/14/senate-section/article/S2644-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/14/senate-section/article/S2644-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-1264.

A bill to establish a Federal Interagency Committee on \nEmergency Medical Services and a Federal Interagency Committee on \nemergency Medical Services Advisory Council, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Emergency \nMedical Services Act of 2005. This legislation will help to improve \nFederal efforts to support community-based emergency medical services \nacross America. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Feingold in this \neffort.\n  Today, New York University's Center for Catastrophe Preparedness and \nResponse is releasing an important report, titled ``Findings from a \nNational Roundtable to Improve Emergency Medical Service's Homeland \nSecurity Preparedness.'' This report details concerns and \nrecommendations from more than 50 representatives of national EMS \norganizations and Federal agencies. Their top recommendation was to \nimprove EMS homeland security preparedness through enactment of the \nvery measure we are introducing today. I would note that a former \nmember of my staff, Tim Raducha-Grace drafted this report. Tim \ncontinues to be a champion of first responders nationwide, and I \ncongratulate him on this latest achievement.\n  A comprehensive, coordinated emergency medical services system is \nessential to assure prompt, quality care to help individuals suffering \nfrom automobile crashes to traumatic medical emergencies, to terrorist \nevents. The emergency medical services system serves as one of the most \nimportant parts of our health care safety net.\n  Unfortunately, for the past 20 years, Federal support for EMS has \nbeen both scarce and uncoordinated. At least seven Federal agencies are \ninvolved in various aspects of emergency medical services (EMS), though \nmost agencies focus on only one segment of the EMS system and don't \neffectively coordinate with other agencies.\n  In 2001, at the request of Senator Feingold and myself, the General \nAccounting Office cited in its report Emergency Medical Services: \nReported needs are Wide-Ranging with a Growing Focus on Lack of Data \nthe need to increase coordination among Federal agencies as they \naddress the needs of regional, State, or local emergency medical \nservices systems.\n  This legislation would seeks to improve one of the few existing \nefforts to coordinate Federal support for EMS providers. This \nlegislation would formally establish a Federal Interagency Council on \nEmergency Medical Services (FICEMS), and would require the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration, in coordination with the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, to provide organizational and staff \nsupport.\n  This legislation would enhance coordination among the Federal \nagencies involved with the State, local, tribal and regional emergency \nmedical services and 9-1-1 systems. It would also help to assure \nFederal agencies coordinate their EMS-related activities and maximize \nthe best utilization of established funding.\n\n  Local, State and Federal level emergency medical services systems are \nextremely diverse and involve numerous different agencies and \norganizations. To assure a viable, responsive emergency medical \nservices system, Federal agencies need the input and advice of their \nnon-Federal partners and from persons regulating or providing emergency \nmedical services systems at the State and local level.\n  According to Tom Judge, the Executive Director of Lifeflight of \nMaine, and Jay Bradshaw, the State of Maine's EMS Director, improved \ncoordination can help strengthen support for a wide range of emergency \nmedical services, from rural EMS providers, to communications between \nEMS systems, to improving coordination between local EMS providers and \ntheir Federal partners.\n  Another GAO report made it clear that the Center for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services needs to better coordinate its reimbursement with the \nDepartment of Transportation's matching grants for equipment and \nvehicles. Many of Maine's communities are at risk of seeing their first \nambulance service closures in rural areas, such as in Rumford, ME, due \nto low reimbursement rates. If DOT targeted assistance to the low \nreimbursement areas that were at risk of shutting down, we might be \nable to maintain service in those areas.\n  Improved coordination could also strengthen the integration between \nlocal providers and Federal agencies. Substantial numbers of our \nReserve and National Guard units are being called up for duty, which \nhas hurt search and air rescue capability across Maine. While \nLifeFlight of Maine is called upon to provide an eye in the sky there \nis little to no current capability for lifting someone out of the woods \nwhen there is no space to land. If the Navy pulls the last part time \naircraft out of Brunswick Naval Air station, there wouldn't be any \ncapability at all within a reasonable response timeframe.\n  I am pleased to have the support of Maine's EMS Director, Jay \nBradshaw, Lifeflight of Maine, the American Ambulance Association, the \nNational Association of Maine EMS Directors, and others.\n  We must ensure that Federal agencies coordinate their efforts to \nsupport the dedicated men and women who provide EMS services across our \nNation. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting their efforts by \ncosponsoring this legislation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nMaine, Senator Collins, today to introduce legislation that will help \nimprove and streamline Federal support for community-based emergency \nmedical services. Our proposal will also provide an avenue for local \nofficials and EMS providers to help Federal agencies improve existing \nprograms and future initiatives.\n  When someone has been seriously hurt or has an emergency medical \nproblem in this country, the first thing they do is call for an \nambulance. And the EMS providers of this country do a great job in \nresponding to these emergencies. All of us have a friend or loved one \nwho has relied on these first responders. These folks rush to assist \npeople in trouble no matter the cause. Their only interest is making \nsure the patient is medically stable and being taken care of.\n  Congress has long recognized the important role played by EMS \nproviders. However, Federal support for EMS has been unfocused and \nuncoordinated, with responsibility scattered among a number of \ndifferent agencies. In 2001, the General Accounting Office cited the \nneed to increase coordination between the Federal agencies involved \nwith EMS issues but not much progress has been made since that report \nwas issued. The Federal Government doesn't even have a good handle on \nhow much it is spending on EMS or what the needs are for EMS.\n  A report to be released today by the New York University Center for \nCatastrophe Preparedness and Response highlights some of the \ndeficiencies in our support for EMS. According to that report, less \nthan 4 percent of the Office of Domestic Preparedness first responder \ngrant funding and 5 percent of\n\n[[Page S2647]]\n\nHHS bioterrorism grant funding goes to EMS. More than half of ambulance \nproviders received no direct Federal funding for homeland security \npreparedness. EMS providers receive very little homeland security \npreparedness education, training, and equipment and tend not to be well \nintegrated into overall response planning.\n  The bill we introduce today is a good first step towards addressing \nmany of the deficiencies in our current EMS policies and takes many of \nthe steps recommended by the NYU report. It would establishes a Federal \ninteragency committee whose purpose will be to coordinate Federal EMS \nactivities, identify EMS needs, assure proper integration of EMS in \nhomeland security planning, and make recommendations on improving and \nstreamlining EMS support. A1though Federal law, P.L. 107-188, called \nfor the establishment of a working group on EMS, this legislation goes \nfurther in detailing the role and function of the interagency \ncommittee. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee will certainly iron out any overlap that may exist.\n  This legislation also establishes an advisory council for the \ninteragency committee that includes representatives from throughout the \nEMS community. The advisory committee, made up of non-Federal \nrepresentatives from all EMS sectors and from both urban and rural \nareas, will provide guidance and input to the interagency committee on \na variety of issues including the development of standards and national \nplans, expanding or creating grant programs, and improving and \nstreamlining Federal EMS efforts. The advisory council is a critical \ncomponent of this legislation because it is the channel through which \nlocal EMS practitioners can directly impact and help reform national \nEMS policy.\n  I want to thank the long list of supporting organizations, including \nAdvocates for EMS, the American Ambulance Association, the American \nCollege of Surgeons, the American Medical Association, the American \nHeart Association, Association of Air Medical Services, ComCARE, the \nEmergency Nurses Association, Gold Cross/Mayo Medical Transport, the \nNational Association of EMS Educators, the National Association of EMS \nTechnicians, the National Association of EMS Physicians, the National \nEMS Pilot Association, the National Association of State EMS Directors, \nand the National Registry of EMTs. I also want to thank all of those \nWisconsinites who provided so much helpful input in coming up with this \nlegislation. In particular, I would like to thank Dr. Marvin Birnbaum \nof the University of Wisconsin, Fire Chief Dave Bloom of the Town of \nMadison, and Dan Williams, chair of Wisconsin's EMS advisory board, for \ntheir advice and guidance.\n  EMS providers are a critical component of our Nation's first \nresponder network. We must act now to streamline and coordinate Federal \nEMS support and work to better understand the needs of the EMS \ncommunity. I therefore ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 612. A bill to require the Secretary of the Army to award the \nCombat Medical Badge or another combat badge for Army helicopter \nmedical evacuation ambulance (Medevac) pilots and crews; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to explain \nbriefly the provisions of legislation I have introduced today that \nwould direct the Secretary of the Army to award the Combat Medical \nBadge (CMB), or a similar badge to be designed by the Secretary of the \nArmy, to pilots and crew of the Army's helicopter medical ambulance \nunits--commonly referred to by their call sign ``DUST OFF''--who have \nflown combat missions to rescue and aid wounded soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and Marines.\n  The legacy of the DUST OFF mission was brought to my attention by a \ngroup of Pennsylvania constituents who have been sharing the DUST OFF \nstory in an attempt to persuade the Army to recognize the service and \nsacrifice DUST OFF crews made, especially during the Vietnam War, in \nsaving the lives of thousands of fallen comrades by extracting the \nwounded from forward positions to bases where they would receive life-\nsaving medical care.\n  The Army began using helicopters to evacuate wounded soldiers during \nthe Korean War. However, because of their smaller size, Korean War \nhelicopters were used solely as a means of transporting the wounded \nfrom the combat zones. It was not until the early 1960's that a group \nof Army aviators envisioned using the newer, larger, UH-1A ``Huey'' \nhelicopters to serve as mobile air ambulances where a medic and crew \ncould provide life-saving treatment en route to the medical aide \nstation.\n  The road to establish air ambulance units within the Army was rocky \nand uncertain. Combat commanders often considered the use of \nhelicopters for this purpose a diversion of valuable resources. \nHowever, through determination, skill, and the American fighting \nspirit, air ambulance crews proved they were a valuable and reliable \nresource in providing support to the combat mission. Indeed, between \n1962 and 1973, DUST OFF crews evacuated more than 900,000 allied \nmilitary personnel and Vietnamese civilian casualties to medical \nassistance sites.\n  Captain John Temperelli, Jr. was the first commander of the 57th \nMedical Detachment, Helicopter Ambulance, who would lead the first DUST \nOFF unit in Vietnam. Army Captain Temperelli is considered the \n``pioneer'' of DUST OFF; however, it was Army Major Charles L. Kelly, \nthe unit's third commander, who would establish the traditions and the \nmotto that DUST OFF crews hold sacred today.\n  Major Kelly, like his predecessors, believed in the mission of \nrescuing fallen comrades so much so that he gave his life to the \nmission. On July 1, 1964, Major Kelly and his crew received a call to \nevacuate a wounded soldier. When they arrived, Major Kelly was \ninstructed by an American advisor on the ground to leave the area; the \nlanding zone was too ``hot.'' Major Kelly responded with the phrase \nthat would become the DUST OFF motto: ``When I have your wounded.'' As \nMajor Kelly hovered over the battlefield, an enemy bullet struck him in \nthe heart; he was killed. It was with news of Major Kelly's death and \nthe story of DUST OFF's dedication to the wounded that DUST OFF earned \nits permanency in the Army.\n  I received a book written by a Pennsylvania native, Army Chief \nWarrant Officer 5 Mike Novosel, titled DUSTOFF: The Memoir of an Army \nAviator. Mr. Novosel--a Medal of Honor recipient who served two tours \nin Vietnam and was a veteran of two other wars--knows first hand the \nsacrifice, courage and dedication to duty that DUST OFF crews displayed \nin Vietnam and continue to display today. In his two tours as a DUST \nOFF pilot in Vietnam, Mr. Novosel flew 2,543 missions and extracted \n5,589 wounded. In his book, Mr. Novosel shares many amazing stories of \nlanding in ``hot'' landing zones to allow his medic and crew chief, who \nwere also exposed to enemy fire, to rescue and care for the wounded. \nBut as Mr. Novosel has said, his experience as a DUST OFF pilot was not \nuncommon. Thousands of brave soldiers risked their lives every day by \nflying into combat zones to evacuate the wounded.\n  I am honored that Mr. Novosel and others have brought the story of \nDUST OFF to my attention. It is my sincere hope that the Army will \nrecognize DUST OFF pilots and crew with an appropriate badge which \nacknowledges the combat service of these brave individuals. When the \nWar Department created the Combat Medical Badge (CMB) in WWII, as a \ncompanion to the Combat Infantryman Badge (CIB) it did so to recognize \nthat ``medical aidmen . . . shared the same hazards and hardships of \nground combat on a daily basis with the infantry soldier.'' DUST OFF \npilots and crew equally shared the hazards and hardships of ground \ncombat with the infantry soldier. The fact that they were not directly \nassigned or attached to a particular infantry unit a fact that, under \ncurrent Army policy, makes them eligible to receive a CIB or CMB should \nnot bar special recognition of their service, service that one author \nhas characterized as ``the brightest achievement of the U.S. Army in \nVietnam.''\n  On July 29, 2003, I chaired a hearing of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans Affairs to hear testimony from DUST OFF participants about \ntheir experiences under fire. I gave the Army an opportunity to explain \nits position and,\n\n[[Page S2648]]\n\nperhaps, rethink its opposition to the awarding of an appropriate \ndesignation to DUST OFF crew members. Based on testimony offered by \nthree Vietnam veterans--Chief Warrant Officer, Ret., Michael J. \nNovosel, M.O.H., Chief Warrant Officer, Ret., John M. Travers, and Mr. \nWilliam Fredrick ``Fred'' Castleberry--I am now more convinced than \never of the worthiness of this legislation. Following the July 29, \n2003, hearing, I introduced this legislation--S. 1487 in the 108th \nCongress. The bill was referred to the Committee on Armed Services, \nwhich has jurisdiction over this matter. Unfortunately, the bill never \nmade its way out of committee which is why I am re-introducing this \nimportant legislation today.\n  Army officials recently decided to create a ``Close Combat Badge'' \n(CCB) for non-infantry soldiers that recognizes their direct \nparticipation in ground combat. However, this badge will not be awarded \nto DUST OFF Medical Helicopter Evacuation Crew Members who have yet to \nbe properly recognized.\n  On the Vietnam Veterans Memorial are etched the names of over 400 \nmedics, pilots, and crew that gave their lives so others might live. \nThe forward thinking, enthusiasm, and dedication of DUST OFF crews in \nVietnam are attributes seen in today's DUST OFF crews. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation which would recognize the nature \nof the service these individuals have performed, and continue to \nperform, while serving on DUST OFF crews.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 613. A bill to establish the Steel Industry National Historic Site \nin the State of Pennsylvania; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation that will honor the importance of the steel industry in the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Nation by creating the ``Steel \nIndustry National Historic Site'' to be operated by the National Park \nService in southwestern Pennsylvania.\n  The importance of steel to the industrial development of the United \nStates cannot be overstated. A national historic site devoted to the \nhistory of the steel industry will afford all Americans the opportunity \nto celebrate this rich heritage, which is symbolic of the work ethic \nendemic to this great Nation. The National Park Service recently \nreported that Congress should make remnants of the U.S. Steel Homestead \nWorks an affiliate of the national park system, rather than a full \nnational park, an option which had been considered in prior years, and \nwhich I proposed in legislation during the 107th Congress. Due to the \nbacklog of maintenance projects at national parks, the legislation \noffered today instead creates a national historic site that would be \naffiliated with the National Park Service. There is no better place for \nsuch a site than in southwestern Pennsylvania, which played a \nsignificant role in early industrial America and continues to today.\n  I have long supported efforts to preserve and enhance this historical \nsteel-related heritage through the Rivers of Steel Heritage Area, which \nincludes the City of Pittsburgh, and seven southwestern Pennsylvania \ncounties: Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Fayette, Greene, Washington and \nWestmoreland. I have sought and been very pleased with congressional \nsupport for the important work within the Rivers of Steel Heritage Area \nexpressed through appropriations levels of roughly $1 million annually \nsince fiscal year 1998. I am hopeful that this support will continue. \nHowever, more than just resources are necessary to ensure the \nhistorical recognition needed for this important heritage. That is why \nI am introducing this legislation today.\n  It is important to note why southwestern Pennsylvania should be the \nhome to the national site that my legislation authorizes. The \ncombination of a strong workforce, valuable natural resources, and \nPennsylvania's strategic location in the heavily populated northeastern \nUnited States allowed the steel industry to thrive. Today, the \nremaining buildings and sites devoted to steel production are \nthreatened with further deterioration. Many of these sites are \nnationally significant and perfectly suited for the study and \ninterpretation of this crucial period in our Nation's development. Some \nof these sites include the Carrie Furnace complex, the Hot Metal \nBridge, and the Unites States Steel Homestead Works, which would all \nbecome a part of the Steel Industry National Historic Site under my \nlegislation.\n  Highlights of such a national historic site would commemorate a wide \nrange of accomplishments and topics for historical preservation and \ninterpretation from industrial process advancements to labor-management \nrelations. It is important to note that the site I seek to become a \nnational site under this bill includes the location of the Battle of \nHomestead, waged in 1892 between steelworkers and Pinkerton guards. The \nBattle of Homestead marked a crucial period in our Nation's workers' \nrights movement. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, individuals, and \npublic and private entities have attempted to protect and preserve \nresources such as the Homestead battleground and the Hot Metal Bridge. \nFor the benefit and inspiration of present and future generations, it \nis time for the federal government to join this effort to recognize \ntheir importance with the additional protection I provide in this bill.\n  I would like to commend my colleague, Representative Mike Doyle, who \nhas been a longstanding leader in this preservation effort and who has \nconsistently sponsored identical legislation in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. I look forward to working with southwestern \nPennsylvania officials and Mr. August Carlino, President and Chief \nExecutive Officer of the Steel Industry Heritage Corporation, in order \nto bring this national historic site to fruition. We came very close to \npassing this bill in the 108th Congress with its passage in various \nforms in the House and Senate. However, Congress adjourned prior to \nfinal passage of the same bill in both chambers. Therefore, today I \nreintroduce this legislation and urge its swift passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 614. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to permit \nmedicare-eligible veterans to receive an out-patient medication \nbenefit, to provide that certain veterans who receive such benefit are \nnot otherwise eligible for medical care and services from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to reintroduce \nthe ``Veterans Prescription Drugs Assistance Act of 2005,'' a bill \nwhich seeks to assist Medicare-eligible veterans struggling with the \ncosts of prescription medications.\n  In the 108th Congress, I worked with my colleagues to provide a \nprescription drug benefit for all Medicare-eligible seniors. Today, I \noffer legislation to allow Medicare-eligible veterans to obtain \nprescription drugs from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) at the \nsignificantly discounted costs that VA, as a high-volume purchaser of \nprescriptions medications, is able to secure in the marketplace.\n  On May 23, 2003, I introduced similar legislation--S. 1153 in the \n108th Congress. In my capacity as Chairman of the Veterans Affairs \nCommittee in the 108th Congress, I held a hearing on June 22, 2004, and \nheard testimony from Senate colleagues, Veterans Administration \nofficials, and various veterans service organizations on this important \nlegislation. On July 20, 2004, the Committee on Veterans Affairs \nreported out S. 1153 by a vote of 10 yeas and 5 nays. Unfortunately, \nthe full Senate did not consider this measure.\n  In 2003, former Veterans Affairs Secretary Anthony J. Principi was \nforced to limit access to VA care--which continues to this day--by \nsuspending new enrollments of non-service-disabled middle and higher \nincome veterans who were not enrolled for care as of January 17, 2003. \nThe Secretary was forced to so act because the number of patients \nprovided care by VA had more than doubled in just five years and, as a \nresult, VA's medical care system had been overwhelmed. As a \nconsequence, VA was unable to provide timely access to healthcare for \nall veterans who had sought it and appointment waiting times had grown \nto alarming levels. But in almost every news story that followed the \nSecretary's difficult decision, it was noted that many of the new\n\n[[Page S2649]]\n\nenrollees who had overwhelmed VA's capacity to provide care were \nMedicare-eligible veterans who were able to get Medicare-financed care \nelsewhere but who were seeking access to the relatively generous \nprescription drug program provided to veterans under VA care.\n  Currently, VA provides enrolled patients with prescription \nmedications for $7 for each 30-day supply. But to get such \nprescriptions, the veteran must obtain the full range of medical care \nfrom VA. This fact, coupled with former VA Secretary Principi's \ndecision to close enrollment, means that veterans who are now, or who \nwill be, eligible for Medicare who had not enrolled for VA care prior \nto January 17, 2003, will be unable to access VA's generous \nprescription drug benefits. This legislation would provide some relief \nfor those veterans. In addition, I anticipate that it may induce some \nVA-enrolled Medicare-eligible veterans--those who were happy with their \nMedicare-financed care but who enrolled for VA care to gain access to \nVA-supplied drugs--to return to non-VA care with knowledge that they \nwill be able to get their non-VA prescriptions filled through VA. \nEnactment of this provision, then, would reduce--not exacerbate--VA \npatient backlog numbers.\n  The premise of this legislation is straightforward. VA fills and \ndistributes more than 100 million prescriptions each year for its 4.7 \nmillion veteran-patients. As a result, it has significant purchasing \npower--power which, coupled with VA's formulary program, allows it to \nnegotiate very favorable prices for prescription drugs. According to \nthe National Association of Chain Drug Stores, the average ``cash \ncost'' of a prescription in 2003 was $59.28. The average VA per-\nprescription cost in 2003 was just under $25--more than 50 percent \nless. This bill would allow veterans to access these significant \ndiscounts simply by providing a written prescription from any duly \nlicensed physician, presumably one he or she has seen under the \nMedicare program.\n  By reintroducing this legislation today, I seek to afford Medicare-\neligible veterans access to such discounts. I do not propose that VA be \ndirected to supply drugs to all Medicare-eligible veterans at VA \nexpense, or even with a partial VA subsidy. VA has stated that such a \nmandate would divert VA funding which, clearly, is already stretched to \nthe limit--away from VA priority patients: the service-connected, the \npoor, and those with special needs. I accept VA's statement of concern. \nI accept and I insist that scarce funding be directed, first, to meet \nthe needs of priority patients. This legislation, therefore, requires \nthat VA recover the costs of drugs it supplies under this program from \nveterans who bring their prescriptions from outside doctors to VA.\n  I do not propose to tell VA in this bill how to recover these costs. \nVA is better positioned than I to make such judgments. Thus, my \nlegislation provides flexibility to VA to design and test payment \nmechanisms to best accomplish cost recovery while still easing \nveterans' access to the drugs they need. It might be that enrollment \nfees, a co-payment structure, or a simple ``cost-plus'' for \nadministrative expenses pricing format, or some combination of those \nmechanisms works best. It might be that different approaches work best \nin different regions of the country. I intend for the VA to experiment \nwith different pricing structures to determine what works best. \nHowever, I also intend that veterans get a break on prescription drug \npricing.\n  Those who would first benefit from this program are World War II and \nKorean War veterans who answered their country's call over 50 years \nago. As they age, many desperately need relief from high drug prices. \nMy purpose is not to minimize the work of the drug companies. Their \ndiscoveries have truly been marvels, but that is precious little \ncomfort to a Medicare participant who, whatever the drug's overall \nutility might be, cannot afford both the drug and food or shelter or \nheat.\n  The premise of this legislation is simple: veteran access to VA \nmarket-driven discounts. Yet, the assistance it could provide might be \nprofound. I urge my colleagues to support this bill so that the problem \nmight be solved, or at least reduced, for seniors who served. They \ndeserve it, and we should do it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 616. A bill to inform the American public and to protect children \nfrom increasing depictions of indecent and gratuitous and excessive \nviolent material on television, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, to better protect our children and \nfamilies from the increasingly indecent and violent images pervading \nour homes, I am introducing with Senator Hutchison the Indecent and \nGratuitous and Excessively Violent Programming Control Act of 2005. I \nbelieve this to be a crucial issue with far-reaching implications for \nour young people and for our country, and I strongly encourage my \ncolleagues to join me in seeing that this bill is enacted and sent to \nthe President for his signature.\n  Each day, and for hours and hours every day, broadcast, cable, and \nsatellite television outlets indiscriminately barrage our children and \nfamilies with indecent and violent images. Our children don't \ndifferentiate between sources of their programs, and neither should the \nlaw. Not only does the pervasive nature of indecent programming coarsen \nour society, but also its effects are being felt in our homes, in our \nschools, and on our streets. I cannot tell you how many parents and \neducators have told me that the behavior of the children in their care \nis bad and getting worse, and that they blame what these kids are \nseeing on television for much of the problem.\n  The Indecent and Gratuitous and Excessively Violent Programming \nControl Act is not intended to limit artistic expression, nor is it my \npurpose to impose the will of Congress on decisions that properly \nbelong to parents. What I hope to do with this legislation is to give \nparents and broadcasters, especially local affiliates, a set of tools \nthey can use to control the violence and lewdness being beamed into \ntheir homes and communities. To help parents determine what is \nappropriate programming for their children to watch, this legislation \nmandates meaningful labeling of violent and indecent programming to \ninclude a full-screen, 30-second warning every 30 minutes on broadcast, \ncable, and satellite programming. To help local broadcasters determine \nwhat appropriate programming for their communities is, the bill would \nallow local broadcasters to refuse to air programming that they believe \nviolates their own community standards, and protects local broadcasters \nfrom fines levied for broadcast decisions imposed on them by national \nnetworks. I believe local broadcasters in West Virginia and across the \ncountry know what the standards of decency are in their own \ncommunities, but currently are at the mercy of the national networks. \nWe need to give them the tools to follow community standards, and \nprotect them when a national network forces them to air harmful \nprogramming.\n  The Indecent and Gratuitous and Excessively Violent Programming \nControl Act will require the Federal Communication Commission to begin \ncomprehensive review of existing technologies to protect our children \nfrom gratuitous and excessively violent programming on broadcast \ntelevision. My bill would require the FCC to assess the effectiveness \nof both the current voluntary ratings system and the ``V-Chip'' and \nother content-blocking technologies. I supported both voluntary \nannouncements and requiring television manufacturers to install the V-\nChip. I believe that both can be beneficial to parents who seek to \nlimit what their kids are seeing. But I acknowledge--as every parent in \na house with a television must that kids will seek out inappropriate \ncontent, and will attempt to find a way around whatever warnings or \ntechnological fixes we put in place to control their access to that \ncontent.\n  This legislation calls upon the FCC to recommend improved techniques \nor additional technologies that will help parents protect their \nchildren from material that could harm them or incite them to harm \nothers. Specifically, if the FCC cannot affirm that these technologies \nare practically effective in protecting children then 1. create a \n``safe harbor'' or other mechanism to protect children from gratuitous \nand excessively violent programming on\n\n[[Page S2650]]\n\nbroadcast television and 2. Require the least restrictive means to \nprotect children from indecency and gratuitous and excessive violence \nfor cable and satellite programming.\n  This should not be an ad hoc judgment made out of fear of the FCC on \nthe part of broadcasters, but instead a bright line test that artists, \ntelevision networks, advertisers, and cable and satellite providers \nand, most importantly, parents can rely on. Because programming that is \nexcessively violent or promotes violence is every bit as damaging to \nour youth as is content depicting sexuality in gratuitous or prurient \nmanner, we must address both issues.\n  The Indecent and Violent Programming Control Act would increase fines \nthe FCC could impose on broadcasters from $27,500 to $500,000 and gives \nthe FCC the appropriate authority to double fines bases on certain \ncircumstances. While I believe indecent programming transmitted against \nnational and community standards, or against the wishes of adult \nconsumers, must be punished, I also believe that most broadcasters are \nresponsible and are interested in providing wholesome entertainment. As \na means of self-policing, I have included a Sense of Congress that \nbroadcast television outlets, as well as cable and satellite providers, \nabide by the ``Television Code of National Association of \nBroadcasters.''\n  Finally, and this may be the most important part of the bill, my \nlegislation mandates that all broadcasters, be they network, cable, or \nsatellite, to double the amount of children's programming they are \nrequired to show each week. Whatever one believes about other parts of \nthe legislation I am introducing here today, I would hope that my \ncolleagues would be pleased and proud to see this provision enacted. \nWhat might surprise my colleagues, and indeed most Americans, is that \nbroadcasters are currently only required to show three hours of \nchildren's content a week. When you consider that what passes for \nchildren's content often amounts to little more than advertisements for \nproducts aimed at children, this is a travesty.\n  I welcome a vigorous and healthy debate on the issue of indecent \nprogramming aimed at children. We owe it to our children, and to the \nnation, to take up these challenging questions, and resolve to find \nways to protect kids, encourage creativity, and pay allegiance to the \nConstitution. I believe the Indecent and Gratuitous and Excessively \nViolent Programming Control Act is a vital step toward that goal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 616\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Indecent and Gratuitous and \n     Excessively Violent Programming Control Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Increasingly, parents, educators, and families are \n     concerned about the material that is broadcast on television \n     and radio, and the effect such material has on America's \n     children.\n       (2) Television influences children's perception of the \n     values and behavior that are common and acceptable in \n     society.\n       (3) Broadcast television, cable television, and video \n     programming are--\n       (A) uniquely pervasive presences in the lives of all \n     American children; and\n       (B) readily accessible to all American children.\n       (4) 85.1 percent of all American homes subscribe to multi-\n     channel video programming.\n       (5) Complaints about indecent programming have grown \n     exponentially in the last five years.\n       (6) In 2004, Americans filed over 1,000,000 complaints with \n     the Federal Communications Commission about indecent \n     programming.\n       (7) According to reports from the Parents Television \n     Council, indecent and violent video programming on cable \n     television is pervasive.\n       (8) Studies also show that parents are increasingly \n     concerned. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, more \n     than 4 out of 5 parents are concerned that their children are \n     being exposed to too much sex on television.\n       (9) Violent video programming influences children, as does, \n     indecent programming.\n       (10) The American Association of Pediatrics, the American \n     Psychological Association, the American Medical Association, \n     and the U.S. Surgeon General have all documented the harm \n     from watching excessive television violence on children.\n       (11) There is empirical evidence that children exposed to \n     violent video programming at a young age have a higher \n     tendency to engage in violent and aggressive behavior later \n     in life than those children not so exposed.\n       (12) There is empirical evidence that children exposed to \n     violent video programming have a greater tendency to assume \n     that acts of violence are acceptable behavior and therefore \n     to imitate such behavior.\n       (13) There is empirical evidence that children exposed to \n     violent video programming have an increased fear of becoming \n     a victim of violence, resulting in increased self-protective \n     behaviors and increased mistrust of others.\n       (14) There is a compelling governmental interest in \n     limiting the negative influences of violent video programming \n     on children.\n       (15) A significant amount of violent video programming that \n     is readily accessible to minors remains unrated specifically \n     for violence and therefore cannot be blocked solely on the \n     basis of its violent content.\n       (16) Age-based ratings that do not include content rating \n     for violence do not allow parents to block programming based \n     solely on violent content thereby rendering ineffective any \n     technology-based blocking mechanism designed to limit violent \n     video programming.\n       (17) Technology-based solutions, such as the V-chip, may be \n     helpful in protecting some children, but cannot achieve the \n     compelling governmental interest in protecting all children \n     from violent video programming when parents are only able to \n     block programming that has, in fact, been rated for violence.\n       (18) Restricting the hours when violent video programming \n     can be shown to protect the interests of children whose \n     parents are unavailable, unable to supervise their children's \n     viewing behavior, do not have the benefit of technology-based \n     solutions, are unable to afford the costs of technology-based \n     solutions, or are unable to determine the content of those \n     shows that are only subject to age-based ratings.\n       (19) After further study, pursuant to a rulemaking, the \n     Federal Communications Commission may conclude that content-\n     based ratings and blocking technology do not effectively \n     protect children from the harm of violent video programming.\n       (20) If the Federal Communications Commission reaches the \n     conclusion described in paragraph (19), the channeling of \n     violent video programming will be the least restrictive means \n     of limiting the exposure of children to the harmful \n     influences of violent video programming.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act:\n       (1) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the Federal \n     Communications Commission.\n       (2) Multichannel video programming distributor.--The term \n     ``multichannel video programming distributor'' has the same \n     meaning given such term in section 602 of the Communications \n     Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 522).\n       (3) Other programming service.--The term ``other \n     programming service'' has the same meaning given such term in \n     section 602 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     522).\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Army to carry out the \ndredging project, Menominee Harbor, Menominee River, Michigan and \nWisconsin; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce a \nbill to reauthorize the dredging of the Menominee River and Channel to \n24 and 26 feet, respectively, from their present NOAA-certified depth \nof 20 feet. Congress originally authorized this dredging in 1960 \nthrough Public Law 86-645, which was subsequently deauthorized by the \nArmy in an administrative action due to a lack of funding as required \nby the Water Resources Development Act of 1986, Public Law 99-662.\n  The Menominee harbor channel depth of 20 feet dates back to 1931. \nWhile harbor depths of 20 feet may have been adequate for ships of that \ntime, a detailed study by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1959 reported \nthe size of cargo ships using Menominee, MI and Marinette, WI ports \nincreased significantly in the mid-1950's. Unfortunately, many of \ntoday's modern and more efficient cargo ships cannot safely navigate in \nharbors with 20-foot clearances. Dredging the river and\n\n[[Page S2653]]\n\nchannel to 24 and 26 feet would make these ports accessible to the \nlarger ships and would be important to the economic growth in \nMenominee, Marinette, and the other regions of the country with which \nthey trade. Manufacturing, shipbuilding, and transportation industries \naccount for over a third of the region's employment and rely heavily on \naccess to competitive port facilities.\n  Dredging of the Menominee River and Channel has been the subject of \nno less than a dozen studies submitted to Congress over the past \ncentury. The 1959 Army Corps of Engineers study recommended dredging to \nthe depths I am proposing today and included support from the then-\nGovernors of Michigan and Wisconsin, and findings of no adverse impact \nby the Departments Interior and Health, Education, and Welfare, and the \nFederal Power Commission. Assessments by the environmental agencies of \nMichigan and Wisconsin referenced in the Corps' report indicated the \nproposed dredging would not harm local fish and wildlife. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Specter, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Dayton, and Mr. Nelson of \n        Florida):\n  S. 619. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to repeal \nthe Government pension offset and windfall elimination provisions; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nMaine, Senator Collins, to introduce legislation that will repeal two \nprovisions of current law that reduce earned Social Security benefits \nfor teachers and other government pensioners--the Government Pension \nOffset provision and the Windfall Elimination Provision.\n  Under current law, public employees, whose salaries are often lower \nthan those in the private sector, find that they are penalized and held \nto a different standard when it comes to retirement benefits. The \nunfair reduction in their benefits makes it more difficult to recruit \nteachers, police officers, and fire fighters; and it does so at a time \nwhen we should to be doing everything we can to recruit the best and \nbrightest to these careers.\n  The current Government Pension Offset provision reduces Social \nSecurity spousal benefits by an amount equal to two-thirds of the \nspouse's public employment civil service pension. This can have the \neffect of taking away, entirely, a spouse's benefits from Social \nSecurity. And, as one might guess, this provision disproportionately \naffects women.\n  The Social Security Windfall Elimination Provision reduces Social \nSecurity benefits for retirees who paid into Social Security and also \nreceive a government pension, such as from a teacher retirement fund.\n  Private sector retirees receive monthly Social Security checks equal \nto 90 percent of their first $627 in average monthly career earnings, \nplus 32 percent of monthly earnings up to $3,152 and 15 percent of \nearnings above $3,152. Government pensioners, however, are only allowed \nto receive 40 percent of the first $627 in career monthly earnings, a \npenalty of over $300 per month.\n  To my mind it is simply unfair. My legislation will allow government \npensioners the chance to earn the same 90 percent to which non-\ngovernment pension recipients are entitled.\n  I do not understand why we would want to discourage people from \npursuing careers in public service by essentially saying that if you do \nenter public service; your family will suffer by not being able to \nreceive the full retirement benefits they would otherwise be entitled \nto.\n  Record enrollments in public schools and the projected retirements of \nthousands of veteran teachers are driving an urgent need for teacher \nrecruitment. Critical efforts to reduce class sizes also necessitate \nhiring additional teachers. It is estimated that schools will need to \nhire between 2.2 million and 2.7 million new teachers nationwide by \n2009.\n\n  California currently has more than 300,000 teachers, but will need to \nhire an additional 300,000 teachers by 2010 to keep up with \nCalifornia's rate of student enrollment, which is three times the \nnational average. All in all, California has to hire tens of thousands \nof new teachers every year.\n  To combat the growing teacher shortage crisis, forty-five States and \nthe District of Columbia now offer ``alternate routes'' for \ncertification to teach in the Nation's public schools.\n  It is a sad irony that policymakers are encouraging experienced \npeople to change careers and enter the teaching profession at the same \ntime that we clearly tell them that we will reduce your Social Security \nbenefits for making such a change--benefits they worked so hard to \nearn.\n  Nearly one million government retirees nationwide are affected by the \nGovernment Pension Offset and Windfall Elimination provisions, but \ntheir impact is greatest in the 12 States that chose to keep their own \npublic employee retirement systems, including California.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Government Pension \nOffset reduces benefits for some 200,000 individuals by more than \n$3,600 a year. And, as I mentioned earlier, the Windfall Elimination \nProvision causes already low-paid public employees outside the Social \nSecurity system, like teachers, firefighters and police officers, to \nlose up to sixty percent of the Social Security benefits to which they \nare entitled. Sadly, the loss of Social Security benefits may make \nthese individuals eligible for more costly assistance, such as food \nstamps.\n  I am also very aware that we are facing extraordinary deficits and \nthat fixing the problem that we are talking about here today will be \nexpensive. I am open to considering all options that move us toward our \ngoal of allowing individuals to keep the Social Security benefits they \nare entitled to. The important thing for us to do is to take action \nthat moves us in the right direction.\n  The reforms that led to the Government Pension Offset provision and \nthe Windfall Elimination Provision are almost 20 years old. At the time \nthey were enacted, I'm sure they seemed like a good idea. Now that we \nare witnessing the practical effects of those reforms, I hope that \nCongress will pass legislation to address the unfair reduction of \nbenefits that make it even more difficult to recruit and retain public \nemployees.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nfrom California, Senator Feinstein, in introducing the Social Security \nFairness Act. This bill repeals two provisions of current law--the \nwindfall elimination provision (WEP) and the government pension offset \n(GPO) that unfairly reduce earned Social Security benefits for many \npublic employees when they retire.\n  Individuals affected by both the GPO and the WEP are those who are \neligible for Federal, State or local pensions from work that was not \ncovered by Social Security, but who also qualify for Social Security \nbenefits based on their own work in covered employment or that of their \nspouses. While the two provisions were intended to equalize Social \nSecurity's treatment of workers, we are concerned that they unfairly \npenalize individuals for holding jobs in public service when the time \ncomes for them to retire.\n  These two provisions have enormous financial implications not just \nfor Federal employees, but for our teachers, police officers, \nfirefighters and other public employees as well. Despite their \nchallenging, difficult and sometimes dangerous jobs, these invaluable \npublic servants often receive far lower salaries than private sector \nemployees. It is therefore doubly unfair to penalize them when it comes \nto their Social Security benefits. These public servants--or their \nspouses--have all paid taxes into the Social Security system. So have \ntheir employers. Yet, because of these two provisions, they are unable \nto collect all of the Social Security benefits to which they otherwise \nwould be entitled.\n  While the GPO and WEP affect public employees and retirees in \nvirtually every State, their impact is most acute in 15 States, \nincluding Maine. Nationwide, more than one-third of teachers and \neducation employees, and more than one-fifth of other public employees, \nare affected by the GPO and/or the WEP.\n  Almost one million retired government workers across the country have\n\n[[Page S2654]]\n\nalready been adversely affected by these provisions. Millions more \nstand to be affected by them in the future. Moreover, at a time when we \nshould be doing all that we can to attract qualified people to public \nservice, this reduction in Social Security benefits makes it even more \ndifficult for our Federal, State and local governments to recruit and \nretain the teachers, police officers, firefighters and other public \nservants who are so critical to the safety and well-being of our \nfamilies.\n  The Social Security windfall elimination provision reduces Social \nSecurity benefits for retirees who paid into Social Security and who \nreceive a government pension from work not covered under Social \nSecurity, such pensions from the Maine State Retirement Fund. While \nprivate sector retirees receive Social Security checks based on 90 \npercent of their first $612 average monthly career earnings, government \npensioners checks are based on 40 percent a harsh penalty of more than \n$300 per month.\n  The government pension offset reduces an individual's survivor \nbenefit under Social Security by two-thirds of the amount of his or her \npublic pension. It is estimated that nine out of ten public employees \naffected by the GPO lose their entire spousal benefit, even though \ntheir deceased spouses paid Social Security taxes for many years.\n  What is most troubling is that this offset is most harsh for those \nwho can least afford the loss--lower-income women. In fact, of those \naffected by the GPO, 73 percent are women. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, the GPO reduces benefits for more than \n200,000 of these individuals by more than $3,600 a year--an amount that \ncan make the difference between a comfortable retirement and poverty.\n\n  Our teachers and other public employees face difficult enough \nchallenges in their day-to-day work. Individuals who have devoted their \nlives to public service should not have the added burden of worrying \nabout their retirement. Many Maine teachers, in particular, have talked \nwith me about this issue. They love their jobs and the children they \nteach, but they worry about the future and about their financial \nsecurity in retirement.\n  I hear a lot about this issue in my constituent mail, as well. \nPatricia Dupont, for example, of Orland, ME, wrote that, because she \ntaught for 15 years under Social Security in New Hampshire, she is \nliving on a retirement income of less than $13,000 after 45 years in \neducation. Since she also lost survivors' benefits from her husband's \nSocial Security, she calculates that a repeal of the WEP and the GPO \nwould double her current retirement income.\n  These provisions also penalize private sector employees who leave \ntheir jobs to become public school teachers. Ruth Wilson, a teacher \nfrom Otisfield, Maine, wrote:\n  ``I entered the teaching profession two years ago, partly in response \nto the nationwide pleas for educators. As the current pool of educators \nnear retirement in the next few years, our schools face a crisis. Low \nwages and long hard hours are not great selling points to young \nstudents when selecting a career.\n  ``I love teaching and only regretted my decision when I found out \nabout the penalties I will unfairly suffer. In my former life as a \nwell-paid systems manager at State Street Bank in Boston, I contributed \nthe maximum to Social Security each year. When I decided to become an \neducator, I figured that because of my many years of maximum Social \nSecurity contributions, I would still have a livable retirement `wage.' \nI was unaware that I would be penalized as an educator in your State.''\n  In September of 2003, I chaired a Governmental Affairs Committee \nhearing to examine the effect that the GPO and the WEP have had on \npublic employees and retirees. We heard compelling testimony from 73-\nyear old Julia Worcester of Columbia, ME, who told us about her work in \nboth Social Security-covered employment and as a Maine teacher, and \nabout the effect that the GPO and WEP have had on her income in \nretirement. Mrs. Worcester worked for more than 20 years as a waitress \nand in factory jobs before deciding, at the age of 49, to go back to \nschool to pursue her life-long dream of becoming a teacher. She began \nteaching at the age of 52 and taught full-time for 15 years before \nretiring at the age of 68. Since she was only in the Maine State \nRetirement System for 15 years, Mrs. Worcester does not receive a full \nState pension. Yet she is still subject to the full penalties under the \nGPO and WEP. As a consequence, she receives just $107 a month in Social \nSecurity benefits, even though she worked hard and paid into the Social \nSecurity system for more than 20 years. After paying for her health \ninsurance, she receives less than $500 a month in pension income.\n  After a lifetime of hard work, Mrs. Worcester, is still substitute \nteaching at 75, just to make ends meet. This simply is not fair. I am \ntherefore pleased to join Senator Feinstein in introducing this \nlegislation to repeal these two unfair provisions, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join us a cosponsors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n        DeWine, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Levin, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 620. A bill to reinstate the Public Safety and Recreational \nFirearms Use Protection Act; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to offer, along with Senators \nWarner of Virginia and DeWine of Ohio, the Assault Weapons Ban \nReauthorization Act of 2005. We are joined by Senators Schumer, \nMikulski, Durbin, Clinton, Boxer, Levin, Dodd and Reed, who are \noriginal cosponsors of this critical legislation.\n  This is the same basic legislation that passed by the Senate last \nyear as an amendment to a bill designed to provide blanket immunity for \ngun manufacturers. However, once that amendment passed, the underlying \nbill was defeated, in part by its own sponsors, after the National \nRifle Association applied intense pressure to Members of this body.\n  Thus we saw the ideological and extreme view of the National Rifle \nAssociation, when they sacrificed their most desired legislative \npriority--gun immunity legislation--because the Senate had approved the \nassault weapons ban and two other amendments that would save people's \nlives: closing the gun show loophole, and requiring trigger locks.\n  Although President Bush had said he supported the assault weapons \nban, he refused to personally engage to help this legislation get \nsigned into law, and the ban expired on September 13, 2004. As a \nresult, these weapons are now once again proliferating through our \nneighborhoods and communities throughout the United States.\n  That is why, today, I am introducing the Assault Weapons Ban \nReauthorization Act of 2005. This legislation mirrors the legislation I \nauthored in the Senate and then-Congressman Schumer authored in the \nHouse in 1994.\n  As was done then, the legislation I am introducing would: ban the \nmanufacturing of 19 specific types of military-style assault weapons, \nas well as a number of other guns based on a simple test to determine \nwhether the guns were hunting guns or weapons of war; prohibit the \nmanufacture of large capacity ammunition magazines--clips, drums and \nstrips of more than ten rounds--because it is those large capacity \nammunition feeding devices that can make a semiautomatic assault \nweapons so very deadly; and continue to exempt 670 hunting guns \nentirely, and it is also important to note that the ban would continue \nto ``grandfather'' in every gun that was made before 1994. So no \ninnocent gun owner would lose a weapon. There will again be no \nconfiscation component to the bill.\n  This legislation is not perfect. There are comparisons that were made \nto get it passed last time around, and since its previous enactment \nthere have been many concerns raised about the need to tighten or alter \nthe definition in order to make the prohibition more effective. I am \nopen to working with my colleagues to ensure we enact the best \nlegislation possible, but we need a first step--at a minimum Congress \nneeds to reinstate the original assault weapons ban.\n  Unfortunately, we are already seeing the impact of the lapse of this \nlaw and we should not let another year pass without reinstating its \nprotections. We know the ban worked. Supply went down. Prices went up. \nThe use of these weapons of war in gun crimes had fallen consistently \nsince the ban passed.\n\n[[Page S2655]]\n\nAccording to Department of Justice data, the proportion of these \nassault weapons used in crime fell more than 65 percent since the ban \ntook effect. And these statistics are backed up by report from the \nBrady Campaign.\n  The analysis in the Brady study was performed by Gerald Nunziato, who \nfor eight years served as the Special Agent in Charge of ATF's National \nTracing Center--a man who know first hand what these numbers means.\n  The study found two key things:\n  First: ``Assault weapons banned by name in the Federal Assault \nWeapons Act have declined significantly as a percentage of guns ATF has \ntraced to crime, and in absolute number of traces, since the Act was \npassed. Had this decline not occurred, thousands more of these banned \nassault weapons would likely have been traced to crime over the last 10 \nyears.''\n  In other words, the assault weapons legislation signed into law ten \nyears ago successfully dried up the use of banned assault weapons in \ncrime. Second, arguments have arisen that despite this evidence, the \nban has not really worked because gun manufacturers would simply \nproduce copycat guns that have the same killing power as assault \nweapons, and use these guns in crime across the country. I agree that \ngun manufacturers have tried everything they could to circumvent the \nban and this concern is something that may need to be addressed. But \nlet's look at what the Brady study said about this issue.\n  Second: ``The gun industry's efforts to evade the Federal Assault \nWeapons Act through the sale of `copycat' guns has not substantially \nundercut the positive effect of the statute in reducing the incidence \nof assault weapons among crime guns.''\n  In other words, even though determined gun manufacturers tried to \nevade the ban, they were not successful and copycat guns did not \nreplace banned guns in equal numbers, at least when traced to crimes.\n  In many cases, and when dealing with many issues, I continue to find \nthat what is most compelling is not just the statistics, but rather the \nreal people affected by the policies we debate. It's those men, women \nand children that are the reason most of us come to work everyday. I'm \nhere today to talk about this issues because of the devastating effect \nthese guns can have on families in our neighborhoods, office buildings, \nstreet corners or schoolhouses across the country. I have said before \nthat this issue really came home to me on July 1, 1993, just over 11 \nyears ago, when Gian Luigi Ferri walked into 101 California Street in \nSan Francisco carrying two high-capacity TEC-DC9 assault pistols \ncapable of holding 30- or 50-bullet magazines. Within minutes, Ferri \nhad murdered eight people and six others were wounded. His victims were \nnot soldiers or even enforcement officers. These people doing everyday \njobs in an everyday place. A place forever tainted by the bloodshed \ncaused by one man and his assault weapons.\n  And 101 California was just one of many shootings by grievance \nkillers, discontented employees or even schoolchildren--shooting that \nshows us that nobody is safe when these guns are in the hands of the \nwrong people. Yet five months ago, the federal ban on assault weapons \nexpired, and once again new guns like the TEC-DC9 are allowed on our \nstreets. The ban expired despite overwhelming public support to renew \nit--71 percent of all Americans support renewing the assault weapons \nban, as do 64 percent of people in homes with a gun. And it expired \ndespite overwhelming support from law enforcement and civic \norganizations--nearly every major law enforcement and civic \norganization has supported a renewal, including the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, the Chiefs of Police, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the \nNational Association of Counties, and the list goes on and on.\n  Sadly, the ban expired despite the stated public support of President \nGeorge W. Bush and former Attorney General John Ashcroft and despite \nthe support of a majority of United States Senators--52 of us voted to \nrenew this ban just this past March. Despite all of this support, this \npast September the American people were lift unprotected and made less \nsafe. And make no mistake--when the ban expired the guns began to flow. \nAnd when the guns began to flow the safety of our communities was put \nin jeopardy.\n  One advertisement that ran in gun magazines is from ArmaLite, a \ncompany that makes post-ban rifles. ArmaLite offered a coupon for a \nfree flash suppressor for anyone who bought one of their guns before \nthe ban expired so that, once the ban expired, the gun could be \nmodified to its pre-ban configuration.\n  The ad even states that, ``It is not legal to install this on a post \nban rifle until the assault weapons ban sunsets.''\n  This is the kind of thing we can continue to expect--companies once \nagain producing deadly assault weapons, high capacity clips, and \ndangerous accessories we worked so hard to stop almost ten years ago.\n  The original assault weapons ban was passed before September 11, \n2001, with focus on the use of these military weapons by street \ncriminals and gangs. But in the intervening years we have come to \nappreciate the significance of the threat posed by foreign terrorists. \nWe know that al Qa'ida and other shadowy terrorist groups may plan to \nattack us here, at home, using these very weapons. A training manual \nfound in Afghanistan made clear that al Oa'ida has seen the threat \nposed by these weapons. In fact, some of these guns are the very ones \nbeing used against our men and women in uniform in Afghanistan and in \nIraq.\n  Simply put--these weapons are not just a law enforcement problem. \nThey are a homeland security and counterterrorism problem. We need to \ntake action to ensure that AK-47s and other such assault weapons cannot \nsimply be purchased by a terrorist operative in preparation for an \nattack in the United States.\n  I am deeply disappointed that despite support of the American people, \nsupport of the Congress, and stated support of the President, the \nassault weapons ban was allowed to expire this past fall.\n  It is past time to stand up to the NRA and instead listen to law \nenforcement all across the nation who know that this ban makes sense \nand saves lives. It is past time to listen to the studies that show \nthat crime with assault weapons of all kinds has decreased by as much \nas 65 percent since the ban took effect almost ten years ago.\n  The bottom line is that across this nation everybody knows this ban \nshould be law. Law enforcement, mayors, cities, counties, three former \nPresidents, and even George W. Bush himself have said the ban should be \nrenewed.\n  This time I hope, for the safety of all Americans, President Bush, \nMajority Leader Frist and Speaker Hastert will help re-enact this \nimportant legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/14/senate-section/article/S2655-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 141.
