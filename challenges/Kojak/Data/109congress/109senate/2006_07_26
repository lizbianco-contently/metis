This morning we will have approximately 1 hour of debate \nprior to the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the Gulf of \nMexico energy security bill.

I remind my colleagues to remain in the Chamber \nfollowing that vote so that we may proceed at 10:40 this morning to the \nHall of the House of Representatives to hear the address by the Prime \nMinister of Iraq. I thank all Senators for their attention.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand there are 15 minutes \nequally divided. I am not sure what equally divided means this morning, \nbut we will do our best. I think Senator Bingaman may be here and might \nwant the opposition's time. We will try to use our time in favor of it \nas judicially as we can. I start by yielding myself 6 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized for 6 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today is a very important day. Let me \nexplain why that is to all the Senators and those who are interested.\n  First, I am going to try to convince our colleagues today that this \nsmall lease sale that we are talking about is one of the most important \nissues spoken of in this Chamber this year. This morning, as the Sun \nrises over the majestic dome of the Capitol and families wake up across \nthe land, whether it be in Albuquerque, NM, or in New Orleans, LA, or \nMiami, FL, as they wake up, millions of Americans around the great land \nfind their homes cooled and after breakfast they start their cars, \ndrive their children through their neighborhoods, in carpools or \notherwise, to get some needed relief from\n\n[[Page S8212]]\n\nthe heat. But for these families there is no relief from the high cost \nof energy.\n  For too long we have remained unable to provide a remedy for that. In \nthe words of the man in charge of our Nation's monetary policy, ``one \nlikely source of the deceleration [of economic growth] is higher energy \nprices, which has adversely affected the purchasing power of households \nand weighed on our consumer attitudes.''\n  In plain speak, that means if we don't take action, we are in \ntrouble. I assure my colleagues, there is a growing chorus in America \nand this chorus demands energy relief. It demands our attention to the \nsimple piece of property in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  We are here to talk about whether to proceed on an item that is \ncritical to American jobs and to our Nation's economy. In the Gulf of \nMexico we have a piece of real estate owned by the Government that is \nthe subject matter of what we choose to call the Gulf of Mexico Energy \nSecurity Act. We direct the Secretary of Interior to lease the area \ncommonly known as 181 within 1 year after the date of the enactment of \nthis bill. We further remove the moratorium or restriction on the area \nto the south of 181 and we direct the Secretary to lease that area \nalso.\n  Taken together, these are 8.3 million acres. I will explain them on \nthe map here in a second, briefly, so I can have my fellow Senators, \ntwo of them who want to speak, have an opportunity to do so. They have \nbeen vital in getting this done.\n  But let me summarize. This 8.3 million acres contains 1.26 billion \nbarrels of oil, American oil, and 5.8--or rounded out--6 trillion cubic \nfeet of natural gas. These resources under the sea are American assets \non American lands and the power to unleash these resources lies in the \nhands of the Senate. Or we can walk away and adopt an alternative and \nthat is to continue to increase our dependence on foreign sources of \nenergy from hostile regions of the world.\n  As American jobs hang in the balance, I remind my colleagues that \nbetween 1999 and 2005, a period of time equal to one term in the \nSenate, the price of natural gas in the United States increased 289 \npercent. At the same time we lost over 3 million jobs in the \nmanufacturing sector.\n  In the words of the Federal Reserve Chairman:\n\n       High prices of natural gas reflect strong demand and \n     diminished supplies.\n\n  This vote today is a step toward correcting that imbalance.\n  Also, in this gulf coast bill we provide protections to the Florida \ncoastline. Thanks to the skills and heart and concern of the \ndistinguished Senator Mel Martinez from the State of Florida, we have \nprotected the Florida coastline in this legislation.\n  I say to those opposed to this legislation, these provisions are a \ncompromise between those who seek additional access to new areas of \ndevelopment and those who do not want to develop off their shores. We \nstruck a balance. Here in the Senate that balance has the overwhelming \nsupport of those who seek additional Outer Continental Shelf deep sea \naccess, and the overwhelming support of those whose priority is coastal \nprotection. I am proud of this balance and I defend it against those \nwho challenge it and seek to undermine it.\n  Finally, the bill is both fiscally responsible and meets the needs of \nthe coastal States that make the sacrifice of hosting our energy \ninfrastructure. It takes care of them in a fair way.\n  I do not take my fiscal responsibility lightly and I do not make the \nfact of fiscal responsibility a light issue. I come at this issue with \na vast experience in budget matters in the Senate and I can tell you \nthis: The cost associated with sharing the OCS receipts must be weighed \nagainst the cost of inaction. I can tell you for certain, inaction \nwould be devastating. When the destruction of the Hurricanes Rita and \nKatrina ravaged our Nation's gulf, it was a national tragedy, not \nsimply a regional occurrence. Our response should continue to be \nnational in scope and wide in its vision.\n  We have all heard the anecdotes of how this region hosts about half \nof our Nation's refining capacity and infrastructure. We heard \nstatistics from the Mineral Management Service that showed that the \nOuter Continental Shelf plays a major role in supplying our energy \nresources.\n\n  Let me summarize. The Gulf of Mexico is the most prolific producing \noffshore region and we cannot leave one giant piece of it--one piece of \nreal estate owned by the people that is probably more energy laden than \nany other piece of real estate in the lower 48--we can't leave it sit \nthere. We have struck a fair balance in this bill and I can say for \ncertain it deserves the sincere consideration of every Senator.\n  When we start voting, I believe every Senator should say, in \nfairness, let us proceed. A few days from now an overwhelming number of \nSenators should say proceed to permit this property, owned by the \npeople, with supplies of gas for the people--let it be used by the \npeople so we don't have to spend more money overseas, sending our \ndollars and our hard-earned currency to buy what we own, that we can \nproduce in the next decade.\n  The production will be astronomical if we put our heads to \nunderstanding that it is America's property, it is America's resources. \nThere is no risk. We ought to get on with changing 25 years of what \nstarted in California, of a fear that was irrational, and get on with \nreasonable, rational, safe, deepwater drilling.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The Senator from Louisana is here and when she is finished, I would \nyield the remaining time to Senator Martinez.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I appreciate the introduction to this \nimportant measure by the chairman of the Energy Committee, Senator \nDomenici. No one has worked harder, in my view, in this entire Chamber, \nand perhaps in the entire Congress, to help us reach a reasonable, \nbalanced energy policy. The Chairman knows, and I agree with him, we \ncan't drill our way out of this situation. But neither can we conserve \nour way. We have to stay on parallel tracks to drill more where we can \nof oil and gas, and conserve more where we can.\n  The last Energy bill reached a pretty good balance of that. This is \nanother step forward in that reasonable, rational, progressive road the \nchairman is trying to provide. He is providing excellent leadership and \nI am proud to support his efforts.\n  This bill, as the Senator from New Mexico said, will open up \nsignificant tracts of land off of the gulf coast for drilling of oil \nand gas that we need as a nation. I have spoken about this bill many \ntimes in terms of its benefits to Louisiana and the gulf coast, and I \nwill again this morning. But before I do that, I would like to speak to \nthe national issue.\n  Senator Domenici is correct when he said this country needs these \nreserves--and we need them now. This area of the gulf, 8.3 million \nacres that we have been able to negotiate based on the good work of \nSenator Martinez and others in the Gulf Coast States, will provide more \nthan six times the amount of natural gas that this country imports in \nthe form of LNG each year. Let me repeat that--six times the amount of \nnatural gas--liquefied natural gas--that this country imports every \nyear. It has more oil than the proven reserves of Wyoming and Oklahoma \ncombined. There is more oil here for our Nation that desperately needs \nit.\n  Our manufacturing sector is doing the best it can do to hold onto \njobs in the United States. This is an issue that Senators on both sides \nof the aisle feel strongly about: keeping jobs in America. If we want \nto keep jobs in America, we need to follow the Chairman's lead and open \nup lease sale 181 and 181 South.\n  Only a year ago, the price of natural gas was $15 per million Btu. \nToday we are fortunate. It has gone down to $6, but 3 or 4 years ago it \nwas $2. It is volatile and it is too high. We need to take it down and \nstabilize it for manufacturing and agricultural interests from which \nevery single Senator in this body benefits.\n  We are competing internationally. Overseas they can produce natural \ngas for a fraction of what it costs us here. Our industries are \nstruggling to hang on because the price is too high. This will help to \nget our price down, to stabilize it, and bring down the futures that \nare driving up our prices.\n\n[[Page S8213]]\n\n  The same for oil: only a few years ago a barrel of oil was $35 a \nbarrel. Today it is selling for about $75 a barrel.\n  We need to open up more domestic reserves--first, for the country \nbecause it is a smart and balanced energy policy. It is sound economic \npolicy--to keep jobs right in the United States.\n  Second, we must open up these domestic reserves because it is sound \nenvironmental policy. Let me speak about the gulf coast for just a few \nmoments.\n  I have come to this floor many times in the 10 years that I have been \nhere to talk about the gulf coast where I was born and raised, part of \nthe country that I think is the most beautiful and the most special. Of \ncourse, we all think the place we are born is that way. But I have also \nsaid this coast is America's only energy coast.\n  This is a satellite picture taken just recently. It shows the coast \nof Florida, the coast of Alabama, Mobile Bay, the great boot of \nLouisiana, the shore of Mississippi, and the great expanse of the shore \nof Texas. This area, since the 1940s, has been the only area in the \nUnited States that has allowed offshore oil and gas drilling. We have \nexperimented there for 40 years. We made a lot of mistakes. But we have \ndone a lot of things right. Now we have an industry that actually \nresembles the space program more than it does the old-time roughneck \nindustry with oil greasy derricks of the old days, as seen in those \nblack and white pictures. Today, the industry deploys technology that \nlooks like a spaceship out in the Gulf of Mexico. We are proud of the \ngulf. Every widget, every gadget, every seismic device, every flange, \nevery wellhead in large measure has been crafted, designed, and built \nby people along the gulf coast--and it is a trade that we are proud of. \nWe do it without major spills. We do it simultaneously as we enhance \nour fisheries, and we do it proudly. We want to continue to do it.\n  We have laid thousands of miles of pipeline that send oil and gas not \njust to Louisiana but all over this country for people who live in New \nYork, New Jersey, Maryland, places like Illinois, places in the \nMidwest. I want you to see where these pipelines start. They start in \nthe Gulf of Mexico.\n  We drill for oil and gas proudly--and we don't use it just for \nourselves, but we use it for everyone in America, to keep these lights \non in this Chamber, to help cool people's homes. As we have seen many \ntimes after heat waves strike, people can die in large numbers when the \nutilities go off.\n  This is not a laughing matter. This is a very serious matter. We are \nproud to do it, but we cannot do it any longer without sharing in a \nportion--a very reasonable portion--of the revenues that are generated. \nWe need those revenues to ensure the safety of the massive amounts of \ninfrastructure that rest atop our rapidly eroding coast.\n  We generated this year from this section of the gulf about $6 \nbillion. The projections are that it could go up to $12 billion. If we \npass this bill, it will open up some other areas which will generate \nfor the Treasury of the United States of America upwards of $15 billion \na year.\n  The question to my colleagues is, do you think the people who help \ngenerate this revenue, the 10 million people who live along this coast, \ncould share in a partnership with these great resources so we can \nprovide some revenue stream to help protect ourselves and the nation's \nenergy infrastructure from hurricanes that come our way; restore the \nvital wetlands that support this entire Nation; protect and support the \nmouth of the greatest river system in North America, the Mississippi, \nhelp drain two-thirds of the United States, the river that takes 70 \npercent of the grain from the Midwest?\n\n  Is it possible that we could set up a partnership that works for \neveryone? Or is that impossible these days in Washington?\n  My people at home can't even understand it. They say: Senator, who \nwould be against revenue sharing?\n  We are not asking for all of it. We would like 50 percent, but we \nnegotiated a good deal, at 37.5 percent the same percentage that \nonshore states used to receive from production on the federal lands in \ntheir states before it was raised to 50 percent. We are not trying to \nbe hogs, but we are drowning down here.\n  If you think I am joking about drowning, I would like to show you a \npicture of one road. Senator Domenici has seen this. It made him \nshudder. This is the highway to Port Fourchon, which is the highway \nthat links the United States of America to about 70 percent of U.S. \noffshore oil and gas production. This looks like a Third World nation.\n  I have come here and begged for money to help with this highway. We \ncannot, as a State of only 4.5 million people, support the entire \ninfrastructure of the United States of America. We can't do it. We are \nnot that rich. We are a Southern State that has serious challenges. I \nam not saying we are a charity case, but we can't build highways for \neverybody with only our money, particularly highways that basically \ncarry the natural resources of the Nation. This is what it looks like.\n  This is the scientists' projected land loss of the Delta plains. This \nis from the USGS at the Department of the Interior. This map shows the \nprojected land loss. From 1932 to 2050, this is the land lost and the \nprojected land loss by 2050.\n  People wonder why New Orleans is flooding. This picture shows us why. \nThe great marshland that protected us--up the great river system and \nthe major ports which helped western expansion for the Nation--put it \naway from the water and protected it so it could help the Nation grow. \nSince then, we have not done our job using the revenues wisely and \nreinvesting in this great wetlands to protect it.\n  This is an opportunity to pass a bill that is balanced, that is \nsmart, that is necessary, that is needed, and that will be put to great \nuse by the coast of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Texas to \nprotect the barrier islands that protect the great energy resources of \nthe Nation and the wonderful people who live there.\n  In conclusion, I will say this: I have taken Senators on planes, \nflying over these coastal wetlands. I look down at these ports and \nthese bays. In the middle of hurricanes, people whose homes, schools, \nand churches were destroyed were sleeping on concrete in tents to keep \nthese pipelines open for the Nation when they did not have homes for \nthemselves.\n  I am not going to go home until a solution is found for the wetlands.\n  I see the Senator from Florida. I will yield my time. I thank him for \nhis extraordinary leadership in finding the solution for the gulf \ncoast. This is a gulf coast bill. It is not a Louisiana bill, nor a \nFlorida bill--it is a gulf coast bill. We are Gulf Coast States. I am \nvery proud to have Senator Martinez's support.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I join my colleague, the Senator from \nLouisiana, and thank the chairman of the Energy Committee for his help \nin moving this bill today. I know it is a very important day for the \nUnited States but also for the people of Florida.\n  S. 3711, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, is a bill \nthat will not only provide very needed resources for our Nation, but it \nalso provides something that is very important to those of us who love \nand are from the State of Florida, which is protections for our State \nfrom encroachment by those who would wish to drill and explore for oil \nand gas in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  For many years, Members of the House and Senate from Florida have \nbeen joined in a struggle to ensure that Florida's economic and \nenvironmental interests be protected as exploration for oil and gas in \nthe Gulf of Mexico took place.\n  I am pleased to say that as we have worked through this issue, one of \nthe things that was paramount in our minds was providing some zone of \npermanent protection for the State of Florida. In this particular \narrangement, which we have been able to reach thanks to the good work \nand understanding of the needs of Florida by Chairman Domenici and \nothers, we have been able to find a zone of protection for the State of \nFlorida--a zone of protection that begins in Pensacola and moves south \n125 miles in Florida waters but provides an extraordinary zone of \nprotection for the State of Florida, as we obtained not only 125 miles \nbut frankly 237 miles from the coast of Tampa and almost 325 miles from \nthe coast of Naples. The entire west coast of Florida is going to enjoy \nprotection of well over 200 to 300 miles.\n\n[[Page S8214]]\n\n  We are, in fact, going to be protecting the State of Florida's \nmilitary mission line. The military in Florida have had a long and \nclose working relationship. We value what they bring to our State and \nwhat they provide for our national defense.\n\n  The military mission line, in this area, is going to be observed and \nprotected. That is what provides this extraordinary zone of protection \nbeyond the 125 miles we see here. Why is this important? Because while \nwe could not do this permanently--and there is no such thing as \npermanence--we have been able to provide this zone of protection, all \nof this in yellow, to the State of Florida until the year 2022, a long \ntime from now.\n  In addition, a further protection of that, which is incredibly \nimportant for our State, there are any number of leases that were at a \ndifferent time under different leadership and, perhaps, with not as \nmuch thought of the impact it could have on our State, our economy, our \nbeaches, our environment. Many leases were given to oil companies, not \nmuch more than 3 miles off the coast of Florida, some 8, 10, 15, or 17 \nmiles off the coast. The State of Florida has, in fact, purchased some \nof the leases in the past. I commend Governor Bush for leading the \neffort to do so.\n  Under this bill, under this arrangement, the leases that are interior \nin the area of Florida can then be swapped out for leases in the areas \nthat will be explored. It is a great and wonderful opportunity for \nthose who are holding leases close to the coast of Florida to swap them \nout for areas far beyond where they currently are, thus eliminating, \nbeyond the year 2022, any threat on the gulf coast from drilling.\n  This is an important and good day for Florida. It is something we \nhave battled for long and hard. Senator Bill Nelson and I--my colleague \nfrom Florida--filed a bill early this year which provides a 150-mile \nzone of protection. This is not 150 miles relating to the panhandle, \nbut it is 125 miles and is, as others have said, the best deal on the \ntable.\n  Is this the answer to our problems? Certainly not long term, \ncertainly not forever. Certainly we have to understand that the future \nof America, as the President said in his State of the Union Message, is \nmoving away from our dependence, our addiction to fossil fuels. We have \nto understand that this is at best a bridge into the future. This is at \nbest a way to provide for now so that Florida industries that have been \nso dependent on gas, such as the phosphate industry, such as \nfertilizers, and the generation of electricity to cool and warm Florida \nhomes, will not be imperiled.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds to \nconclude.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I know Florida can play a significant role in the \ndevelopment of ethanol and other alternative fuels. I know this is an \nopportunity for us to bridge into the future. I am delighted that today \nwe are going to provide Florida the kind of protection it needs.\n  I welcome the opportunity to move S. 3711. It is the last measure, it \nis the last line. There cannot be any other way but this way if we will \nhave the support of Florida Senators.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who seeks time? The Senator from \nthe great State of New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. How much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Twenty-eight minutes on your side.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Is there time remaining for the proponents?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is no time remaining for the \nproponents.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, shortly I will be voting for cloture on \nthe motion to proceed to S. 3711. I will be urging other colleagues to \ndo as well. I am not casting my vote for cloture because I support the \nbill in its current form. On the contrary, I think the bill that has \nbeen brought before the Senate is seriously flawed on several grounds. \nI am voting for cloture on the motion to proceed because I want to have \na chance to propose amendments to the bill, propose improvements to the \nbill. I want this bill to represent good, long-term energy policy and \ngood, long-term fiscal policy for the country.\n  I am aware of statements made by some that once the Senate is on the \nbill, there will be an attempt to frustrate the ability of Senators to \noffer legitimate energy amendments. I will certainly oppose any attempt \nto prematurely invoke cloture on the bill. Our energy problems in the \ncountry are serious business. They cry out for thoughtful responses. \nThey also deserve a process in the Senate that is serious and is \nthoughtful.\n  In this Congress, we made great progress on energy because we adopted \nan open, inclusive, and bipartisan approach on the issues. In my view, \nthat record is at risk if we adopt a process on this bill that is a \nclosed process.\n  I hope the Senate consideration of this bill will be in the vein of \nthe consideration we gave to the last Energy bill. Americans want \npositive, forward-looking solutions to our energy problems. They want \nus to use America's technological know-how to come up with innovative \nsolutions and approaches to our problems. We are only going to be able \nto find those forward-looking solutions if everyone is given a \nlegitimate opportunity to help the Senate work its will on this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this past weekend I was in Tennessee--in \nNashville, my hometown. The visit was an opportunity for me to catch up \nwith constituents. Again and again, whether I was in Nashville or over \nin Carter County at a wonderful pig roast or over in Jackson, TN, west \nTennessee or Memphis, the concern of the high cost of gasoline, the \nhigh cost of cooling homes, and the impact on local businesses came up \nagain and again and again.\n  As I was driving through the streets of Tennessee, the average price \nof gasoline in Nashville, I remember specifically, was $2.87 a gallon--\nkind of a bargain if you compare it to here in DC, where many metro \narea prices averaged over $3.08 a gallon this weekend. But people back \nhome in Tennessee feel that it is anything but a bargain. They feel the \npinch in their wallets, and it affects how they live every day--whether \nit is driving their kids to school or taking their vacation at this \ntime of year or filling that tractor with fuel.\n  Across the Nation, Americans are compensating for these high gas \nprices and high energy prices by cutting back, feeling the squeeze and \nhaving to cut back in other areas. We think twice about going out for \ndinner or lunch at a restaurant. We select our vacation destinations \nbased today on how far one has to drive from home rather than the \nappeal of that destination. And we wait a few weeks longer than \ncomfortable before turning on that air-conditioner or heating our \nhomes. That is the direct cost these high energy prices have on our \neveryday family life.\n  Many Americans fail to realize the indirect but the very real \npassthrough costs of high energy prices, the extra energy costs that \nare hidden in the\n\n[[Page S8215]]\n\nprices of the consumer goods and services we use every day. It is not \njust gasoline prices that are putting that squeeze on American \nconsumers. Right now, American consumers and industries are paying the \nhighest natural gas prices in the world. That translates into, yes, \nhigher heating and cooling bills but also higher prices for farmers \ntrying to buy fertilizer for their fields, higher prices for products \nmade with chemicals, higher prices for paper products, higher prices \nfor manufacturing jobs, which means those jobs ultimately are lost here \nin America.\n  Six years ago, America's natural gas bill was $50 billion. Last year, \nit was four times that, $200 billion. In countries competing for \nAmerican jobs, the price of natural gas is often one-sixth--one-sixth--\nas much as it is here in the United States. Thus, when U.S. companies \nare having to pay more for the energy they need, it makes it harder and \nharder for them to compete in this global marketplace. When they can't \ncompete, they have to make very tough economic decisions that many \ntimes result in American jobs having to move overseas--where energy \nsupplies are much more plentiful and the costs are much lower.\n  The National Association of Manufacturers estimates that more than \n3.1 million high-wage manufacturing jobs have been lost in this country \nover the last 6 years--largely as a result of those high energy prices. \nOf more than 120 world-scale chemical plants under construction around \nthe world, only 1 is here in the United States. The high cost of \nnatural gas hurts farmers because natural gas is used to make \nfertilizer. It is hurting the forest industry. It is hurting the paper \nproducts industry. Mr. President, 267 mills have closed, and 189,000 \njobs have been lost since this runup in natural gas prices over the \nlast 6 years.\n  We are all familiar with the energy challenges facing America. We are \ndangerously dependent on foreign sources of oil. We are dangerously \ndependent on foreign sources of oil--much of it coming from countries \nwith unstable governments or with interests that are cleary contrary to \nthose of our country.\n  This disparity will only increase if we do not take action. We have \nto act to increase the amount of American energy. And that, of course, \nwe could use right here in America today.\n  The bill before us--the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act--is going \nto do just that. It is action. It will reduce our dependence on foreign \noil and natural gas by opening up more than 8 million acres in the gulf \nto domestic exploration. The area opened under this bill is estimated \nto contain 1.26 billion barrels of oil and over 5.8 trillion cubic feet \nof natural gas. It will have an impact on the prices consumers pay at \nthe pump and on their power bills, as we look to the future. It makes \nsense: increased supply, when we know that price point is ultimately a \nproduct of supply and demand.\n  I want to make it clear that while this is a first step toward \naddressing the energy challenges we face, it is an important step. \nThere is a lot more we can and should do in the future to break what \nthe President called our ``addiction'' to oil, to diversify our energy \nresources, to increase the use of renewables and alternative sources \nsuch as ethanol and biodiesel, clean coal technology, and nuclear \npower, and to decrease, to minimize, to lessen consumption by \nconsumers.\n  One year ago this week, the Senate passed a comprehensive national \nenergy policy which, over the course of the last 12 months, has \nachieved impressive results. As a result of the Energy bill, 27 new \nethanol plants have broken ground, 150 more are in the works. The \namount of ethanol and biodiesel we use in our gasoline will more than \ndouble over the next 6 years, saving 80,000 barrels of oil a day, and \n401 new E-85 pumps have been installed. As a result of that \ncomprehensive Energy bill passed last year, the nuclear industry is \nplanning to build 25 new reactors in the United States, enough to power \n15 million households with clean, emission-free electricity. Because of \nthe Energy bill passed last year, 120 clean coal facilities are in the \nplanning stages, enough to replace 2 million barrels of oil a day by \nthe year 2025. And because of the comprehensive Energy bill of last \nyear, wind power, solar power, and hydrogen fuel cells all got a major \nboost. The Energy bill was part of the solution.\n  The bill on the floor today is that next critical step. Once we pass \nthis bill and begin producing more of America's energy, we will still \nhave a lot more work to do. We need to do more to encourage development \nof innovative 21st century technologies that will break our addiction \nto foreign oil. Whether ethanol or hydrogen or coal-to-liquids or new \napproaches that we can't even imagine today, we must do all we can to \nsupport those new technologies, those advanced technologies that will \nmove us beyond the debate over oil and over gas.\n  For the foreseeable future, we are going to be talking about oil and \ngas. That is why the bill before us today is so critical. The Gulf of \nMexico Energy Security Act will substantially reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil and natural gas. It will increase moving toward energy \nindependence. It will strengthen our national policy. It will reduce \nthe cost of living for American consumers.\n  In a post-9/11 world, energy security is a matter of national \nsecurity. Now more than ever America needs America's energy. That is \nwhat this bill does. It brings more American energy to American \nconsumers. It is a bipartisan bill.\n  I especially thank Senators Domenici and Landrieu, Vitter, and \nMartinez, and so many others for helping us get to this point. I hope \nthe Senate will now vote to allow us to begin debate on this \nlegislation so that we can continue to deliver meaningful solutions to \nthe American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 5865, which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5865) to amend the Social Security Act to \n     increase the limit on payments for temporary assistance to \n     U.S. citizens returned from foreign countries.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, recent events in the Middle East have \nled to the evacuation of thousands of U.S. citizens from Lebanon. This \nevacuation is being conducted by the U.S. State Department.\n  However, the Department of Health and Human Services, or more \nspecifically, the Administration for Children and Families, ACF, is \nresponsible for assisting U.S. citizens upon their return to the United \nStates.\n  Over the past several days, ACF has established repatriation \nfacilities at the Baltimore/Washington airport, the Philadelphia \nairport, and McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey. More than 5,000 \nAmericans have been offered assistance at these facilities in recent \ndays. Thousands more are expected within the week.\n  These repatriation facilities are staffed by Federal and State \nemployees who provide assistance with travel, lodging, and access to \nmedical facilities, as necessary. These employees are doing a \ntremendous job assisting all of the evacuees.\n  Unfortunately, under current law, this critical assistance is subject \nto a statutory cap of $1 million dollars. Given the expected number of \nevacuees, the statutory cap could be reached at any moment. Unless \nCongress acts quickly to raise the cap, the ongoing repatriation \nefforts will be suspended. We must not allow that to happen.\n  The legislation I have offered today, along with my colleague from \nMontana, Senator Baucus, will raise the cap to $6 million through the \nend of this fiscal year. This increase is expected to fully cover the \nanticipated costs of the evacuation this year, as well as provide for \nthe continued operation of the repatriation program next year.\n  In addition to temporarily raising the cap, this legislation would \nprovide the States with the option to use the National Directory of New \nHires to verify eligibility under the Food Stamp Program. This language \nis similar to the provisions in current law now being used to verify \neligibility for the SSI Program and to collect delinquent child support \npayments.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the utilization of this \noption in the Food Stamp Program would save roughly $1 million a year, \nthus offsetting the cost of raising the cap.\n  In contrast to the legislation passed by the House yesterday, this \nlegislation does not sunset the repatriation program. The repatriation \nprogram has been in operation, in one form or another, since the 1930s. \nThere is no reason to believe this program should be abolished. Thus, \nthe sunset provision contained in the House bill is merely a gimmick to \ncreate the appearance that the bill is paid for when in fact it is not.\n  On another matter, the House language includes a requirement for an \nIG report on the repatriation program. However, it does not appear such \na report is necessary.\n  According to ACF, under the emergency repatriation program each State \nhas an approved plan which they implement when needed. They are allowed \nto assume costs for all of the activities contained in their approved \nplan. The States then submit a detailed explanation of how the funds \nwere spent, along with supporting documentation.\n  Finally, it should be noted that the language in the House bill was \nintended to lift the million-dollar cap for the current fiscal year. \nBut it is not entirely clear it accomplishes that goal. Under current \nlaw, the cap is effective for fiscal years beginning after September \n30, 2003. Under the House-passed language, the cap is effective for \nfiscal years beginning after September 30, 2006. Since the current \nfiscal year occurs after 2003 but before 2006, that begs the question--\nwhat is the cap for this year? The answer to this question should not \nbe ambiguous. The Senate language clearly states the cap for the \ncurrent fiscal year is $6 million.\n  Given all of these concerns, I urge my colleagues to reject the House \nlanguage and support the Senate alternative. The Senate alternative \nwill maintain the critical assistance now being provided to evacuees, \nwhile at the same time offsetting the cost of this assistance in a \nreasonable and responsible manner.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to adopt the Grassley-\nBaucus amendment to the bill H.R. 5864--The Returned Americans \nProtection Act of 2006. This bill provides needed resources to the \nUnited States Repatriation Program, which is currently assisting U.S. \ncitizens who are returning to United States from Lebanon.\n  The United States Repatriation Program was established by title XI, \nsection 1113 of the Social Security Act to provide temporary assistance \nto U.S. citizens and their dependents who have been identified by the \nDepartment of State as having returned, or been brought from a foreign \ncountry to the U.S. because of destitution, illness, war, threat of \nwar, or a similar crisis. The program is currently being used to \nprovide assistance to citizens returning from Lebanon, but estimates \nindicate that the program could reach its statutory spending cap at any \nmoment. The cap is currently $1 million per fiscal year. We have been \nasked by HHS to increase the cap for fiscal year 2006 to $6 million.\n  The Grassley-Baucus amendment lifts the cap for fiscal year 2006 from \n$1 million to $6 million. The amendment also includes an offset from \nthe President's fiscal year 2006 budget to use the National Directory \nof New Hires, NDNH, to improve the administration of the Food Stamp \nProgram. Access to the NDNH will help USDA verify wage and employment \ninformation on food stamp applications. That proposal was scored by CBO \nhas providing $11 million in savings over 10 years.\n  We have worked with the Department of Health and Human Services and \nother Government agencies in creating this legislation. We believe we \nhave a reasonable and fiscally responsible solution to this relatively \nminor problem. We urge the Senate to adopt our amendment, pass the \nbill, and send the bill to the House for their immediate consideration.\n  This bill involves a small and, thankfully, seldom-used Federal \nprogram. But as recent news events have made clear, this is a program \nthat can provide much-needed assistance to our constituents during \ndifficult circumstances. We should not allow these\n\n[[Page S8217]]\n\nimportant resources to be needlessly delayed.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nGrassley-Baucus substitute amendment at the desk be agreed to, the \nbill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4695) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Address of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, before speaking on the Burmese \nFreedom and Democracy Act, I want to make a few comments about the \nspeech of the Prime Minister of Iraq which we just had an opportunity a \nfew moments ago to hear in the joint session over in the House Chamber.\n  Today we mark a step forward in the war on terror. A mere 3\\1/2\\ \nyears ago, the dictator, Saddam Hussein, would have addressed his \nregime's legislature of lackeys. Today, the democratically elected \nPrime Minister of Iraq addressed a joint meeting of the U.S. Congress.\n  A mere 3\\1/2\\ years ago, the dictator, Saddam Hussein, ruled Iraq. He \nterrorized his own countrymen with murder, torture, and weapons of mass \ndeath. He posed a security threat to the entire region and to the \nUnited States. The international community decided he had to face \nserious consequences.\n  In March of 2003, America, as we all well know, led a multinational \ncoalition of forces to depose the dictator and to liberate Iraq. Since \nthen, the country has made remarkable progress as it throws off the \nshackles of tyranny and embraces democracy.\n  Iraqis have held three successful national elections, ratified a \nconstitution, elected a permanent unity government, and formed a \ncabinet with a strong prime minister at its head: Prime Minister Nouri \nal-Maliki, whom we had the pleasure of hearing from just an hour or so \nago.\n  It took our country 13 years to go from independence to the \nimplementation of our Constitution. Iraqis have done it in 3--and under \nthe glare of the 24-hour news cycle coverage and the threat of \nterrorist attacks.\n  When Prime Minister Maliki ascended to the podium today, it was hard \nto deny the importance of the moment. His presence in this Capitol \nrepresents a victory for democracy. And his country is, and will \ncontinue to be, an important ally in the war on terror. Of course, \nthere will be many tough days ahead in Iraq. There is no denying that \nthe security situation represents a real challenge. But America does \nnot avoid challenges, and we do not abandon our allies when the going \ngets tough.\n  We are moving forward in Iraq. The country recently realized its \nhighest oil production and export levels since before its liberation, \nand during the past 3 years, per capita income in Iraq has doubled.\n  I would also like to call to my colleagues' attention an article \ntitled ``Iraq as a Sovereign Nation'' written by the Prime Minister \nthat appeared in Monday's Wall Street Journal. It points to very \ntangible proof that Iraq is moving forward.\n  The Iraqi province of al-Muthanna, located at the southernmost border \nof that country, has become the first province in which local Iraqi \nforces have taken full responsibility for law enforcement and security, \ntaking over for our coalition forces. President Bush has frequently \nsaid: As Iraqis stand up,\n\n[[Page S8218]]\n\nwe will stand down. That is exactly what has happened in al-Muthanna, \nhome to over a half million Iraqis.\n  Local Iraqi police and military have stood up and taken the place of \n1,400 coalition troops. The Governor of al-Muthanna has command of the \nprovincial police. Iraqi national police and Iraqi Army troops will \noperate in the province under the control of the Prime Minister and the \nNational Government.\n  The transfer of power in al-Muthanna is only the first step. The \nPrime Minister writes that ``current estimates envision half of Iraqi's \nprovinces transferring security responsibility before the end of \n2006''--this year. He and I agree that this process should not be \ndriven by an arbitrary timeline but by the situation on the ground; \nnevertheless, this is an encouraging sign.\n  He goes on to write that the decisions for future transfers of power \nwill be made based on the threat assessment in the province, the \nreadiness of the local Iraqi forces, the readiness of the local \ngovernmental authorities, and overall coalition force posture.\n  The historic achievement of local control in al-Muthanna represents \nan important step forward in our mission in Iraq. As Iraqis stand up, \nwe will stand down, and we will leave behind a proud and free Iraq.\n  The Prime Minister ends his article by saying:\n\n       With God's help, and continued assistance from \n     the coalition, our regional neighbors and the larger \n     international community, our people will unite and \n     prosper. Together, we can and will succeed.\n\n  I think we should all commend the Prime Minister for his vision and \nleadership. America will and must continue to stand by Iraq. None of \nwhat has been achieved in the last 3 years there has been at all easy, \nbut we have succeeded and we will continue to succeed because freedom \nand democracy are stronger than the terrorists' tools of mayhem and \nfear.\n  Great credit must go to President Bush for his strong leadership in \nthe war on terror which has enabled us to reach this transfer of power \nin al-Muthanna, and soon, in other provinces as well. I also commend \nthe Iraqi Government, Iraqi police, and Iraqi security forces for their \nhard work in promoting stability in the country.\n  Of course, Madam President, I know our colleagues join me in thanking \nthe men and women of America's Armed Forces for their courage, \ndedication, and sacrifice.\n  Stability in Iraq means stability in the region and greater security \nat home. As the Prime Minister said in his speech just delivered, \naccording to translation:\n\n       Do not imagine that this problem [of terrorism] is solely \n     an Iraqi problem, because the terrorist front represents a \n     threat to all free countries and free peoples of the world. . \n     . .The responsibility of facing this challenge lies on the \n     shoulders of every country and every people that respects and \n     cherishes freedom.\n\n  The Prime Minister is exactly right. For that reason, America must \nstand firm in the war on terror, and we must stand side by side with \nour Iraqi allies in their war on the terrorists.\n  Before I finish, let me say a few words about the current situation \nin the Middle East regarding Israel and Hezbollah. Israel is America's \nlongstanding friend and an ally in the war on terror. In fact, the \nhorrors of September 11 awoke many in this country to what Israelis \nface daily and have faced daily for literally years. That country has \nbeen and continues to be on the front lines of the war on terror. I, \nfor one, support Israel's efforts during this intense time to do \nwhatever it takes to defend her people and her borders.\n  Maybe some have forgotten, but the terrorist group, Hezbollah, killed \n241 American service men and women in Beirut in 1983. Hezbollah's love \nof death and destruction is on a par with al-Qaida. They are enemies to \nevery peace-loving, democratic country. They are a threat, and Israel \nhas a right to pursue them wherever they exist.\n  Now, Madam President, if I may, I would like to turn to speak in \nsupport of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act, which is the bill \nbefore us this afternoon.\n  This May, along with a number of cosponsors, including my good \nfriends, Senator Feinstein and Senator McCain, I introduced this bill \nfor Senate consideration. Passage of this bill would mean continued \nsanctions against the illegitimate, dictatorial regime that currently \nholds Burma literally in its grip--the Orwellian-named State Peace and \nDevelopment Council, or SPDC. This Senate will be acting on behalf of \nthose in Burma who are being repressed. The Burmese people want these \nsanctions because they want democracy, justice, and freedom, and we \nstand with them.\n  I see my friend, Senator McCain, here to speak on this issue as well. \nHe has actually had the privilege of meeting with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, \nthe hero of Burmese independence, an opportunity that has been denied \nto most because she has been essentially under house arrest for 10 of \nthe last 17 years.\n  The broad, bipartisan coalition in this Chamber for this legislation \nindicates America's firm resolve to oppose the tyrannical SPDC regime, \nand America's recognition that Burma, under the SPDC, poses an \nimmediate threat to its region. To put it simply, the allies of the \nBurmese people have a moral obligation to continue to stand up against \nthe SPDC. I take great pride that we are continuing to do so.\n  As many of my colleagues are well aware, last year, the extension of \nsanctions was signed into law by President Bush on July 27, 2005. It \nenjoyed strong, bipartisan support and passed this body by a vote of 97 \nto 1. Unfortunately, recent events have reminded us of the need to keep \nup the pressure on the villainous SPDC regime.\n  Ibrahim Gambari, the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for \nPolitical Affairs, visited Burma in May as a representative of \nSecretary-General Kofi Annan. He met with the ringleaders with the SPDC \nas well as Nobel Peace Prize winner, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who, as I \nindicated earlier, is a political prisoner and has been the leader of \nthat country's democracy movement for quite some time. Suu Kyi, as I \nindicated earlier, has spent 10 of the last 17 years in detention or \nunder house arrest for her efforts to bring freedom and democracy to \nher people. Many other members of her party, the National League for \nDemocracy--the NLD--have been detained as well.\n  After returning, U.N. Diplomat Gambari wrote a column for the \nInternational Herald-Tribune titled ``A Crack in the Burmese Door.'' \nAfter acknowledging the SPDC's years of repression and misrule, Gambari \nwrote:\n\n       Last month, something seemed to change. Burma's locked door \n     popped open a small crack.\n\n  Gambari wrote this based on his discussions with the SPDC. But I \nthink we should judge actions rather than words, and those actions tell \nan entirely different story. In fact, nothing fundamentally has changed \nin Burma. Suu Kyi remains under house arrest and the regime continues \nto engage in outrageous behavior.\n  I do not share Mr. Gambari's optimistic view that the SPDC is ready \nto, as he puts it, ``turn a new page.'' In my view, the junta is only \ninterested in deflecting growing pressure from the international \ncommunity to change its repressive ways--and in avoiding the U.N. \nSecurity Council's consideration of a nonpunitive resolution that \naddresses the threat the SPDC poses to its own people and the entire \nregion.\n  Shortly after Mr. Gambari's visit, Suu Kyi's house arrest was \nextended for another year--double the length of the extensions she \ntypically receives, under the regime's perverted concept of a legal \nprocess.\n  Even worse, Suu Kyi's life. was threatened in a state-run newspaper. \nThe New Light of Myanmar, a mouthpiece for the SPDC junta, printed the \nfollowing in a story on July 6:\n\n       The days of Daw Suu Kyi and NLD are numbered. They are \n     heading for the tragic end . . . Daw Suu Kyi and the National \n     League for Democracy (NLD) pose the most dangerous threat to \n     the nation.\n\n  That is an ominous threat. And the people who make it have the power \nto see it carried out.\n  They have made an attempt on her life before, and are apparently \nthreatening to do so again.\n  In addition to the immediate danger its misrule poses to the Burmese \npeople, we cannot forget for a single moment that the military regime \nin Rangoon poses a significant and non-traditional threat to the entire \nregion. Their litany of abuses is well known.\n  Refugees spill into Thailand, fleeing the SPDC's brutal war against \nethnic minorities.\n\n[[Page S8219]]\n\n  Illegal drugs pour across Burma's borders into China, India, and \nThailand, and destroy the lives of the region's youth.\n  And an unchecked HIV/AIDS virus closely follows drug trafficking \nroutes, leaving disease and human tragedy in its wake.\n  It is worth noting that the SPDC spent $70,000 in 2004 to combat HIV/\nAIDS. This is in stark contrast to the millions of dollars spent on \nweapons from China and Russia--and, according to recent news reports, \nNorth Korea.\n  This is no time for the international community and multilateral \norganizations, including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, \nASEAN, to soften its stance on Burma.\n  I want to emphasize for my colleagues one very important point. This \nSenate has already done much on behalf of the Burmese people. Now it is \ntime for the U.N. to do its part.\n  We need less talk and more action at the U.N. in support of \ndemocracy, freedom, and justice in Burma. We must keep in mind that the \nsituation is so dire in Burma that the U.N. has already adopted 28 \nnonbinding resolutions regarding that country. It is now time for the \nU.N. Security Council to act.\n  The criteria and justification for bringing a country before the \nSecurity Council was outlined in a report commissioned by former Czech \nPresident Vaclav Havel and South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu. There \nis no one in this Chamber who does not applaud their sustained efforts \nto bring about a peaceful solution to the Burma problem.\n  In fact, the Senate passed in May a measure that I sponsored calling \non the U.N. Security Council to discuss a binding, nonpunitive \nresolution on Burma that calls for the immediate and unconditional \nrelease of Suu Kyi and all other political prisoners in that country; \nan end to abuses against minorities, including the use of rape as a \nweapon of war; and the beginning of a meaningful national \nreconciliation process that includes the unfettered participation of \nthe NLD and ethnic minorities with the SPDC.\n  It is time for the U.N. Security Council to take such action. It is \ntime for free nations to stand for freedom.\n  I specifically call on the respective governments of Ghana and the \nRepublic of Congo, current nonpermanent members of the Security \nCouncil, to support this resolution.\n  Ghana, in particular, is a country that values freedom and the rule \nof law, and support for the resolution would unequivocally demonstrate \nthat they stand on the side of justice in Burma.\n  I urge our Representative to the United Nations to continue efforts \nto move toward Security Council consideration of a nonpunitive \nresolution on Burma. To do any less would be to take a step backward.\n  Mr. President, the Congress has stood with the people of Burma in \ntheir quest for freedom and democracy. It is time for the U.N. Security \nCouncil to do the same.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank Senator McConnell and Senator \nFeinstein for their leadership once again in renewing the sanctions \ncontained in the 2003 Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act. I am proud to \ncosponsor and support this resolution.\n  I again thank the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from \nCalifornia for their leadership and their advocacy. I thank Senator \nMcConnell for his very strong and inspirational remarks that he \ncompleted.\n  As we renew these sanctions, the situation inside Burma continues to \nworsen still. The military junta in that country controls the \npopulation through a campaign of violence and terror, and the lack of \nfreedom and justice there is simply appalling. The Burmese regime has \nmurdered political opponents, used child soldiers and forced labor, and \nemployed rape as a weapon of war. Political activists remain \nimprisoned, including elected members of parliament. And that \ncourageous woman, Aung San Suu Kyi, has spent yet another year in \ncaptivity.\n  Aung San Suu Kyi's resolve in the face of tyranny inspires me and, I \nbelieve, every individual who holds democracy dear. Because she stands \nfor freedom, this heroic woman has endured attacks, arrest, captivity, \nand untold suffering at the hands of the regime. Burma's rulers fear \nAung San Suu Kyi because of what she represents--peace, freedom and \njustice for all Burmese people. The thugs who run the country have \ntried to stifle her voice, but they will never extinguish her moral \ncourage. Her leadership and example shine brightly for the millions of \nBurmese who hunger for freedom and for those of us outside Burma who \nseek justice for its people. The work of Aung San Suu Kyi and the \nmembers of the National League for Democracy must be the world's work. \nWe must continue to press the junta until it is willing to negotiate an \nirreversible transition to democratic rule. The Burmese people deserve \nno less.\n  And, while we see encouraging signs that the world is no longer \ncontent to sit on the sidelines, not everyone has gotten the message. \nNine years after Burma joined ASEAN, the Southeast Asian nations remain \ntoo passive in the face of Burma's outrages. The European Union has \nrecently announced that it will waive a travel ban on Burma's top \nleaders so that the Burmese foreign minister can attend the Asia-Europe \nmeeting in Finland this September. It is hard to see what new actions \nthe Burmese junta must commit in order to induce the world to treat the \njunta like the pariah it wishes to be.\n  At least there should be no mistaking where the United States stands \nwhen it comes to repression in Burma. The U.S. Congress has been in the \nforefront of efforts to isolate that country, and we stepped up these \nmeasures significantly in 2003 with the Burmese Freedom and Democracy \nAct. In doing so, we took active steps to pressure the military junta, \nand we sent a signal to the Burmese people that they are not \nforgotten--that the American people care about their freedom and will \nstand up for justice in their country. Today's renewal of the import \nrestrictions--sanctions that are supplied by supported by the National \nLeague for Democracy--is just one of those steps. I believe that these \nrestrictions must remain in place until Burma embarks on a true path of \nreconciliation--a process that must include the NLD and Burmese ethnic \nminorities.\n  But the import ban must not be the only step. The U.S. has pushed for \na resolution at the United Nations Security Council, and this step \nshould garner wide support. The Europeans and ASEAN too should take up \nthe Burma issue and put it on their front burners. Every responsible \nmember of the international community must realize that the desire of \npeople to be free is universal, and it does not stop at the gates of \nRangoon. The people of Burma desire freedom and democracy, they have \nexpressed this desire, and they shall one day have it. The question is \nnot ``if'' but ``when.'' We shall help them get there, and we shall \nnever forget their brave struggle.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from \nCalifornia for their leadership on this very important issue.\n  There are many issues that are before America's attention today and \nthat dominate our television and our newspapers. But this struggle for \nfreedom on the part of the Burmese people has been there before and, \nunfortunately, will be after. We must be steadfast in our advocacy \nuntil they attain the freedom that they deserve under the leadership of \nthis magnificent, Nobel Prize-winning hero for men and women throughout \nthe world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If I can say to my friend from Arizona before he \nleaves the floor, it is hard to imagine that the world simply doesn't \npay any attention to this outrageous regime. I ask my friend, if they \nhad a weapon of mass destruction, probably we would be paying a little \nmore attention to this pariah regime--does my friend from Arizona not \nagree?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I agree with my friend from Kentucky. Let me respond by \nreferencing, again, this struggle carried out by this magnificent \nwoman. She has endured 17 years of house arrest. When her husband was \nin England, he was dying of cancer. She has two sons, by the way. He \nwas dying of cancer, and she wanted, of course, to go to be with her \nhusband in his last hours. The\n\n[[Page S8220]]\n\njunta said: Yes, you can go, but you can never come back.\n  Among the incredible sacrifices she has made, she was not even \nallowed to be with her husband as he died.\n  One time she was surrounded by these thugs who killed some of her \nsupporters. She was in a car for a week--inside of her car for a week, \nsurrounded by these unspeakable, brutal thugs who were the goons of \nthis regime.\n  The things she has undergone. Yet, incredibly, whenever she is with \nthese thugs from this junta, she treats them with the utmost courtesy. \nShe serves them tea. She treats them as only a woman of her caliber can \ntreat her mortal enemies.\n  Her story needs to be told and retold throughout the world, thousands \nand thousands of times. As a person who is a hero worshiper, an \nadmirer, I believe that heroes have an important place in our Nation \nand the world. When I see her, she ranks in the first ranks of heroes \nin the world. It seems to me, with all due respect to the other nations \nof the world--our European friends, our ASEAN friends, and others--that \nwe should be far more energetic in her advocacy and advocacy of freedom \nfor her people.\n  I thank the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator as well. He makes a very important \npoint.\n  The United Nations has not responded to efforts to prod them into \nmoving this item up on the agenda. It could well be because of the lack \nof enthusiasm, shall I say, of the Chinese and the Russians--two \npermanent members of the Security Council. Nevertheless, the efforts \npersist. This U.S. sanctions bill is important, but it is not going to \nget the job done. We know that. It would require multilateral sanctions \nof a dramatic basis, such as were imposed against South Africa, to get \nthe job done. At least at this point, the ASEAN countries seem to be \nmore interested in doing business there than they are squeezing the \nregime.\n  There was, however, one encouraging sign. Burma was scheduled to host \nthe ASEAN meeting this year. That did, I think, embarrass the members \nto the extent that they were unwilling to do that. So ASEAN obviously \nis not meeting in Burma in 2006.\n  The struggle continues. I thank our colleagues. This is going to pass \non a voice vote shortly. I thank our colleagues for their awareness of \nthis issue. I think it is one that will be before us for some time to \ncome.\n  I don't know if there are other speakers. I see the Democratic \nleader. Does he wish to speak on this bill?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, 3 years ago, Burma's military junta \narrested democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi and returned her to the \nhouse arrest that she has endured with only intermittent periods of \nrelease since 1989.\n  Three years ago, Congress enacted the Burmese Freedom and Democracy \nAct of 2003, and we have renewed the sanctions called for under that \nlegislation every year since then.\n  That legislation is set to expire this summer, and we are now \nconsidering whether to extend its provisions for another 3 years.\n  Tragically, Burma's human rights record has worsened, rather than \nimproved, in the 3 years since Congress enacted the Burmese Freedom and \nDemocracy Act.\n  Earlier this year, the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi was extended for \nanother year. More than 1,100 political prisoners languish in jail in \nBurma, prevented from expressing their aspirations for a democratic \ngovernment.\n  The military junta ruling Burma still refuses to enter into a dialog \nwith the opposition National League for Democracy. Its brutal treatment \nof ethnic minorities and advocates of democracy remains unabated. \nForced labor is a widespread problem, and labor activists are regularly \nimprisoned for trying to combat it.\n  The failure of Burma's dictators to address the HIV/AIDS and avian \ninfluenza situation in the country contributes to the horrific \nsituation of the Burmese people.\n  And the regime's effects are not confined to Burma's borders. \nThousands of refugees have fled to Thailand, Malaysia, India, and \nBangladesh. Burma is the world's second largest opium producer, \nsupplying 90 percent of the heroin from Southeast Asia. It is also the \nsingle largest producer of methamphetamine in the region.\n  One year ago, nearly to the day, I stood on the Senate floor and \nquestioned whether these economic sanctions were the most appropriate \ntool for bringing about the kind of change we need to see in Burma.\n  The arguments against economic sanctions continue to be quite \ncompelling. First of all, they have a very poor record of success. The \nkinds of governments that merit this sort of treatment are not \nsensitive to international opprobrium, nor are they swayed by it to \nmake changes. Second, economic sanctions tend to hurt the people that \nthey are intended to help. Ordinary people lose their jobs, while the \nmilitary and its leaders are left untouched. Third, severing economic \nties shuts off an important avenue of dialog that can promote change.\n  Those who support the sanctions point out, rightly, that Burma's \nrulers are not willing to engage in dialog, either at home or with its \nneighbors. It is plain that Burma's military dictators are not \ninterested in being members of the international community. They have \nrebuffed the United Nations. And they have refused to allow U.N. \nSpecial Rapporteur on Human Rights Paulo Sergio Pinheiro to visit Burma \nsince November 2003.\n  They are equally uninterested in improving the lives of their people, \nor participating in the global economy. While more and more nations \nhave turned to freer markets to bolster their growth, Burma has \nactually worked to dismantle fundamental economic institutions like \nproperty rights, contract enforcement, sustainable fiscal policies, and \na reliable currency.\n  It is difficult to imagine an environment less conducive to growth \nand less attractive to foreign investment. Revenues from oil and gas \nexports flow to the regime. Businesses and farmers are routinely shaken \ndown. And productive assets are concentrated in the hands of the \nregime's cronies.\n  In December of last year, America led the effort that produced the \nU.N. Security Council's first-ever discussion of the human rights \nabuses in Burma. I welcome the administration's efforts to increase \ninternational pressure on the military dictatorship.\n  But if we are serious about trying to isolate the junta through \nsanctions, we cannot act alone. The European Union has also imposed \nsanctions on Burma, but neighboring countries continue to trade with \nBurma and to direct investment there.\n  The administration needs to work with other countries, especially the \ncountries in the region Thailand, China, India--that are still \neconomically engaged with the dictatorship to intensify the pressure on \nthe regime.\n  The countries in the region have the most to lose from the worsening \nof the situation in Burma. As the oppression and abuse continue, more \nrefugees will flee across the borders. As the junta focuses on \nenriching itself and ignoring the needs of its people, more drugs will \nflow across the border, and the risk of diseases like HIV/AIDS, \nmalaria, antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis, and avian influenzas will \nincrease in the region.\n  Despite my reservations about the effectiveness of sanctions to \neffect change, I will support this resolution, extending the Burmese \nFreedom and Democracy Act for a further 3 years.\n  This extension adds our voice to the voice of the Burmese people, \nmuffled by the oppressive regime, in calling out for democracy and \nhuman rights. It is my hope that our action today will increase the \nawareness of the worsening human rights situation and bolster \ninternational support for democracy in Burma.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 86, \nwhich will renew the import ban we first imposed on Burma in 2003.\n  The Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act was our response to the \nreprehensible attack on the National League for Democracy which \noccurred on May 30, 2003, and the arrest of many NLD officials, \nincluding their leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.\n  I worked with my colleagues, Senator McConnell and Senator Baucus, to \ndevelop and pass that legislation. We authorized a ban on imports from \nBurma for 3 years, subject to annual renewal by Congress.\n  Well, the 3 years are about to end, and unfortunately the situation \nin\n\n[[Page S8221]]\n\nBurma has not improved. The latest report from the State Department \nnotes the continuation of killings and rape, use of forced labor, \nforced conscription, arrests and disappearances of political activists, \nand other abuses by the ruling military junta. And on May 23, 2006, the \nruling junta extended for another year the unjustified house arrest of \nDaw Aung San Suu Kyi. To renew trade with Burma now would send exactly \nthe wrong signal. We need to renew the import ban as a visible \ndemonstration to the ruling junta that their actions are unacceptable \nand that they must change their ways.\n  We also need to encourage other nations to take strong action. The \nEuropean Union has imposed some sanctions. Canada, Australia, Japan, \nand Norway also have some restrictions in place. I think they should \neach join us in doing more. Other nations should be acting as well, in \nparticular, China. I urge the administration to continue engaging our \ntrading partners to join us in strengthening sanctions against the \nruling military junta. We need to work together in order to spur \nmeaningful democratic reform in Burma.\n  For these reasons, I support authorizing the import ban for another 3 \nyears, and I support the outright renewal of the import ban for another \nyear. I, therefore, urge my colleagues to join me in supporting passage \nof H.J. Res. 86 and getting it to the President's desk for his \nsignature as soon as possible.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today in support of \nlegislation to renew the ban on all imports from Burma for another \nyear.\n  The House unanimously passed this bill earlier this month and I urge \nthe Senate to follow suit today.\n  This bill amends the original Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of \n2003 to allow the sanctions to be renewed, 1 year at a time, for up to \n6 years.\n  Simply put, the ruling military junta, the State Peace and \nDevelopment Council has done nothing over the past 3 years to warrant a \nlifting of the sanctions.\n  It has failed miserably to make ``substantial and measurable \nprogress'' towards recognition of the 1990 elections--decisively won by \nAung San Suu Ky's National League for Democracy--and a full restoration \nof representative government.\n  If we vote to lift the sanctions prematurely, we will only reward \nRangoon for its rejection of democracy, human rights, and the rule of \nlaw.\n  Let us review the facts.\n  Aung San Suu Kyi, Nobel Peace Prize recipient and leader of the \nNational League for Democracy, is confined to her home by orders of the \nmilitary junta. She recently celebrated her 61st birthday under house \narrest and on June 9, 2006, her detention was renewed for another year.\n  She has spent the better part of the past 16 years imprisoned or \nunder house arrest.\n  The human rights situation in Burma is deplorable and demands a \nclear, unified response from the international community: 1,300 \npolitical prisoners are still in jail; according to a report by the \nAsian human rights group, Assistance Association for Political \nPrisoners, 127 democracy activists have been tortured to death since \n1988; 70,000 child soldiers have been forcibly recruited; the practice \nof rape as a form of repression has been sanctioned by the Burmese \nmilitary; use of forced labor is widespread; human trafficking is \nrampant; and the government engages in the production and distribution \nof opium and methamphetamine.\n  Given this substantial list of abuses, it is no surprise that a \nrecent report by former Czech President Vaclav Havel and retired \narchbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa--``Threat to Peace: A Call for \nthe UN Security Council to Act on Burma''--confirms the need for United \nNations intervention.\n  It details how the situation in Burma fulfills each of the criteria \nused for past intervention by the Security Council: overthrow of an \nelected government; armed conflicts with ethnic minorities; widespread \nhuman right violations; outflow of refugees--over 700,000--and drug \nproduction and trafficking and the spread of HIV/AIDS.\n  The report should be required reading for all members of the United \nNations who doubt whether or not the Security Council should take up \nBurma immediately.\n  Some may argue that because the sanctions have not achieved their \ndesired goals--the release of Suu Kyi, the restoration of a free and \ndemocratic Burma--they should be terminated.\n  I could not disagree more. First, Aung San Suu Kyi and the democratic \nopposition continue to support a ban on all imports from Burma.\n  Second, the international community is coming together to put \npressure on Burma: In July 2005, ASEAN forced Burma to forgo its \nscheduled rotation as chairman of the organization; on December 16, \n2005, the U.N. Security Council debated the situation in Burma for the \nfirst time.\n  Last month, the United Nations Under Secretary for Political Affairs \nbriefed members of the Security Council on his meeting with Suu Kyi, \nher first meeting with a foreigner since 2004; a group of legislators \nfrom member countries strongly urged ASEAN last week to take concrete \nmeasures to resolve the political situation in Burma; Malaysian Foreign \nMinister Syed Hamid Albar, whose country currently chairs ASEAN, \nblasted Burma in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal this week for \nundermining the credibility of ASEAN by not moving closer to democracy.\n  And, finally, I believe we are making progress on having a majority \nof the United Nations Security Council support adding Burma to the \nagenda of the Security Council for debate and possible passage of a \nbinding, nonpunitive resolution on Burma.\n  By taking a leadership role on this issue, the United States has \ninspired other countries in the United Nations to put pressure on Burma \nto respect the wishes of its people and the international community to \nrelease Suu Kyi and restore a democratic, representative government.\n  They have begun to recognize that--as the Havel-Tutu report \ndocuments--Burma's actions not only represent a threat to the rights \nand freedoms of the Burmese people, but to the region and international \ncommunity as a whole.\n  I strongly urge those members of the Security Council who have not \ndone so to add their names to the growing list of countries who support \nadding Burma to the council's agenda. Passage of this legislation today \nwill serve as another beacon of hope for the Burmese people and another \nexample of leadership that will bring other countries to their side.\n  I remind my colleagues that under the provisions of this legislation, \nwe will have the opportunity to debate sanctions on Burma every year. \nThat is how it should be.\n  Sanctions are not a panacea for every foreign policy dispute. But, \nwhen they are backed by a robust international response, they can be \neffective and they can compel change.\n  Archbishop Desmond Tutu has rightly said, ``As long as [Suu Kyi] \nremains under house arrest, not one of us is truly free''.\n  Today, I urge the SPDC to release Aung San Suu Kyi, recognize the \n1990 elections, and engage in a true dialogue with the National League \nfor Democracy.\n  I urge the United Nations Security Council to debate and pass a \nbinding, nonpunitive resolution on Burma that recognizes the threat the \nregime poses to the region and calls for Suu Kyi and all prisoners of \nconscience to be released.\n  And, finally, I urge the Senate to renew the sanctions on Burma for \nanother year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the Senator from Kentucky has been working \non this matter for years. I appreciate his vigilance and diligence. I \nalso say to my friend from Arizona, for the Senator from Arizona to \nstand and talk about brutality and suppression means a lot. He \nunderstands it. We all know he understands it, having been a victim of \nthat for years when he was a prisoner of war. I appreciate the \nleadership of these two fine Senators moving this matter forward.\n  I am going to speak on another issue at this time, Madam President. \nAre there others from either side who are going to speak on this \nmatter?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Nevada, I am not aware of any \nother speakers on either side.\n  Mr. REID. Then we should pass it, and I will get the floor and move \non.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. How much time remains?\n\n[[Page S8222]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 14 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the remainder of the time on this side.\n  Mr. REID. I yield all of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nthird reading and passage of the joint resolution.\n  The joint resolution (H.J. Res. 86) was ordered to a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/26/senate-section/article/S8222-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8222-S8255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    GULF OF MEXICO ENERGY SECURITY ACT OF 2006--MOTION TO PROCEED--\n                               Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, today the Senate is considering a bill \nthat represents a positive step for our Nation's energy security. The \nGulf of Mexico Energy Security Act can play a role in building a better \nenergy future for our country and especially a better future for the \npeople of the gulf coast.\n  I want the record to reflect my deep appreciation to Senator \nBingaman, who is the ranking member of this Energy Committee, for \nworking with us on this issue. Senator Bingaman has--at least to my \nunderstanding--no problems with where this bill will allow drilling. He \nhas concerns as to how the money is going to be allocated following the \ndrilling. I understand his concern and appreciate it. Senator Bingaman \nis the epitome of a gentleman. Even though he has concerns about how we \nare moving this bill forward, he has not been an impediment, and we are \nmoving forward as quickly as we can so, again, I want the record to \nreflect my deep appreciation for Senator Bingaman, what a good friend \nhe is and a good Member of the Senate.\n  I am going to say more about the specifics of this legislation. Prior \nto doing that, I ask unanimous consent that during the consideration of \nS. 3711, there be a limitation of five first-degree amendments, energy-\nrelated amendments, in order on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I say \nto my good friend, the Democratic leader, as he knows the development \nof this bill was done on a bipartisan basis. It is narrowly targeted \nbut represents a delicate compromise between the gulf coast Senators, \nSenators from Florida, and it is the feeling of all those involved in \ndeveloping this legislation, as I say, again, on a truly bipartisan \nbasis, that if we open this bill up to amendments--we have lots of good \nideas on this side of the aisle, and I expect there are lots of good \nideas on that side of the aisle. I recall when we were doing the major \nEnergy bill last year about this time, we spent several weeks on it as \nwe considered virtually everybody's good idea about what to do, either \non the conservation side or the production side.\n  So I say to my good friend, the only way to achieve success, it \nstrikes the sponsors of the bill, is to keep it very narrowly crafted \nand to pass it as is out of the Senate.\n  I know that is not what we customarily do, but this is an unusual \nsituation. We are trying to respond to high energy prices in America. \nEven though natural gas prices have subsided somewhat in recent months, \nwe anticipate them going up again next fall. There is a good chance \nthat the futures market in natural gas will actually respond favorably \nto this measure, if we can get it out of the Senate. Natural gas \nprices, we all know, are set in America. It is not a global price \nsetting. It could provide immediate relief to natural gas customers all \nover America.\n  For all of those reasons, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am disappointed that the majority has \nobjected. I think the proposal I made would permit the Senate to make \nimprovements to the bill. We limited the number of amendments and we \ncertainly would be willing to limit the time on them. But I understand \nthe objection of the majority.\n  This legislation opens approximately the same area President Clinton \nproposed when he was President. This would be opening an area of oil \nand gas exploration in the Gulf of Mexico. But when President Bush came \ninto office, he narrowed the consideration at the request of his \nbrother, the Governor of Florida. This bill moves us back closer to \nPresident Clinton's proposal with some additional deepwater acreage \nopened south of the 181 area. It satisfies the concerns of the State of \nFlorida. It is also a positive step for those who want to see the \nrestoration of the gulf coast wetlands. I can remember the first time \nSenator Breaux spoke to me about the State of Louisiana and what was \nhappening to his State.\n  During the time I am going to be here on the floor, which will be a \nfew minutes--I came here 15 minutes ago and listened to the remarks of \nthe two Senators from Kentucky and Arizona, and I hope to leave in 10 \nor 15 minutes--there will be an area the size of three football fields \nwashed into the gulf, gone forever. Huge tracts of land are being \nwashed into the ocean every day. We must have coastal restoration. We \ncan do this, but it is not easy.\n  We learned with Katrina that had Katrina hit several decades ago--50 \nyears ago--the damage would have been much less than it was because it \nwould have had a barrier and the storm would not have hit the City of \nNew Orleans as it did, and other coastal areas. I have been there. I \nsaw what happened in New Orleans. I have been there a number of times. \nI saw what happened in Pass Christian, MS. I will always remember that \nin my mind's eye--the devastation from the wind.\n  But this legislation gives New Orleans, LA, hope because it provides \na source of money to restore the wetlands that are being devastated. \nThat is the basis for my strong support of this piece of legislation. \nThis bill will help them get the resources which are needed to rebuild \nin a sustainable manner.\n  Everyone in Louisiana should know that they have a tireless champion \nin Senator Mary Landrieu. I wish I could express to her father, Moon \nLandrieu, former mayor of New Orleans, a Cabinet Secretary here in \nWashington, as I have done in the past. I wish I could express my \nsupport and admiration of his daughter Mary Landrieu, a wonderful \nfamily of 10 children. She has done so much work in this regard. If it \nweren't for her efforts, without any question the Senate would not be \nconsidering and passing this bill, which we will do in a few days. I am \nnot going to be able to say this to Moon Landrieu today, but I am sure \nI will in the near future, and tell him about the good work his \ndaughter has done here. Her whole family should be proud of her, and \nthe whole State of Louisiana should be happy and satisfied with the \nwork she has done in this regard.\n  For the first time in the history of this country, the delta area of \nthe Mississippi River, because of the work we have done on it through \nthe Corps of Engineers, and all the other governmental entities, which \nis one of the reasons the gulf is washing away, that we will be able to \nfor the first time have a long-term project to restore the coastland. \nIt is expensive and hard, but it is so important for our country.\n  Having said all the good things about this bill and about Senator \nLandrieu, I want it to be very clear in my remarks here today that this \nbill is not going to fix America's energy needs. It is not going to \nsolve America's energy crisis. We have a failed energy policy in this \ncountry. The Bush-Cheney failed energy policies--simply more for big \noil--won't work.\n  British Petroleum announced yesterday that their profits have gone \nup. In Reno, NV, the price of gasoline is $3.12 a gallon today. The \nprice of gasoline in Nevada on an average has gone up more than 50 \ncents a gallon in the last year. The Bush-Cheney energy policies do \nnothing to alleviate the problems we are having in Nevada and around \nthe country.\n  This bill will do nothing to bring down the price of gasoline or \ndiesel. It won't come down as long as demand keeps growing and big oil \ncompanies are not investing their billions and billions of dollars in \nprofits in new American energy jobs and manufacturing and in developing \nalternatives to oil.\n  As my friend from Oregon said better than I, we are marinating \nourselves in oil. The country is being marinated with fossil fuel. We \nneed to bring much\n\n[[Page S8223]]\n\nmore fuel-efficient cars and trucks quickly to market and to promote as \na country energy efficiency and conservation.\n  That is the one real difference between Democrats and Republicans--\nspeed. We have been ready for months and months and months, going into \nyears, to fund and uphold a project like energy. If we can get to the \nMoon, we can solve our energy crisis. But we can't do it by continuing \nto do something we have done for 50 years. The Sun is there producing \nenergy every day. The wind is there blowing every day and producing \nenergy. We need to capture that energy. We need to capture geothermal \nenergy. We are not doing it.\n\n  It appears to me the majority is not interested. The Republicans have \nproposed emergency spending on energy and underfunded even the mediocre \nEnergy bill from last year. The administration still has not gotten \naround to issuing loan guarantees to build new biofuels plants.\n  Democrats want to transform the Nation's energy policy, and we want \nto do it now. But the Bush administration and the Republican Congress \nis content to let the market and Big Oil crush consumers, squeezing \nevery last coin out of their pockets.\n  I had a press event across the hall in the LBJ Room this morning. I \nhad with me a family from Colorado. They have a little 5-year-old boy. \nHe is little, but he is a husky little kid, Johnathan. They have to \nfill their two vehicles. One drives a lot to his job, and the other \ndoesn't drive as much. But they fill their cars on average of twice a \nweek. It costs them $45 every time they fill their gas tank. It is $180 \na month which they cannot afford. They have no health insurance. It is \ntrue all over America.\n  This morning the majority leader said there was a lot more we can do \nrelating to energy, and we should do it in the future. I make this \npoint to the majority leader through the Republicans and to the \nPresident, the future is now. Americans are suffering from an energy \ncrisis, and have been since well before last year's energy bill.\n  In Reno, NV, it's $3.12 a gallon for regular unleaded. The future is \nnow. What are we waiting for? Is this the best we can do? I hope we can \ndo better before we finish this congressional term. We are not going to \ndo it before August. That is what we have demanded, but we have \ntomorrow and a few days next week, and that is it.\n  We have good ideas. In May, the Democrats introduced the Clean EDGE \nbill. That stands for Energy Development for a Growing Economy. That \ndescribes the problems we have in America today. We need to do energy \ndevelopment. We have to do it if we want to keep our economy growing. \nIt is a bill to accelerate development in commercialization of energy \nefficiency technologies, renewable energy production and alternative \nfueled vehicle market penetration.\n  Isn't it a shame that the Federal fleet, the biggest we have in \nAmerica, is not one which we are using with alternative energy? And we \nare not. The Clean EDGE bill adds important provisions to make the \nFederal Government a real leader in energy instead of just the largest \nconsumer.\n  The Clean EDGE bill contains important provisions to set a national \noil savings goal, increases penalties to punish price gouging, and \nreigns in energy market speculators who are driving up the price of \nnatural gas.\n  Let me say this. On public radio this morning--I enjoy listening to \npublic radio every morning; I love that medium--I can't remember the \nname of the man who was there in ANWR, but he was there 50 years ago \nwith the people who first pushed to set that aside as pristine \nwilderness. What he said today was remarkable. He said, I was there \nmore than 50 years ago. He said it is the same today as it was then. He \nis 73 years old now. He was a young man 53 years ago when he was there.\n  I know how strongly the Presiding Officer feels about that. America \nfeels just as strongly that we did the right thing in protecting ANWR. \nIn listening to that radio program, I felt in my heart we had done the \nright thing.\n  We need to move forward with innovative, good legislation. The Clean \nEDGE bill does that. A few days ago, 41 Democratic Senators sent a \nletter to the majority leader stating our desire to move legislation \nsuch as the Clean EDGE bill before we recess to bring down prices and \ngive consumers affordable alternatives. Unfortunately, it seems we will \nhave to continue looking for other legislative opportunities since we \nneed to pass S. 3711 as soon as possible, and send it to the House \nwhere they can send it to the President.\n  But let us not kid ourselves; this bill is good for the gulf coast \nand will contribute to the Nation's energy security and, more \nimportantly, for coastal restoration. It will not affect gas prices and \njust extends our addiction to oil.\n  I again compliment the very good work of Mary Landrieu in moving this \nbill forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, before he leaves the floor, I want to \ncommend the distinguished leader from Nevada. He has for a long time \nchampioned the needs of consumers. In the West, we understand the \ndevastation gasoline prices have had on our consumers. And his case for \na new energy policy, a red, white, and blue energy policy that makes us \nfree of our dependence on foreign oil, is a case he has eloquently \nmade, and made frequently. I want him to know how much I appreciate his \nleadership before he leaves the floor.\n  I want to start the discussion about the legislation which is before \nus now by acknowledging the enormous pain and hurt so many citizens of \nour Gulf States have endured since Katrina struck their \ncommunities. Pictures of this tragedy are seared into our minds at this \npoint. In the Senate, I sit next to the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana, Senator Landrieu. She has brought passion, energy, and \neloquence to the cause of securing help for those she represents so \nwell as folks in the Gulf States try and get on their feet.\n\n  My view is that the challenge for the Senate is to reconcile the need \nto help those folks hurting in the Gulf States with the urgent need for \nCongress to legislate fresh, bolder energy policies for our entire \ncountry. My understanding is the distinguished majority leader from \nTennessee, Senator Frist, will not allow amendments to this \nlegislation. If that is the case, my view is this legislation does not \nbalance the need to help folks in the Gulf States with the urgent need \nto get that fresh red, white, and blue energy policy for our country's \nfuture.\n  Does the Senate truly believe more shouldn't be done to promote \nrenewable energy? Does the Senate truly believe more shouldn't be done \nto promote automobile efficiency? Does the Senate truly believe more \nshouldn't be done to protect consumers from exploitive practices? Does \nthe Senate truly believe taxpayer dollars should be used to subsidize \noil companies even though the President, to his credit, has said \nsubsidies aren't needed when the price of oil is over $55 a barrel?\n  If no amendments are allowed under this legislation, which is my \nunderstanding from the statement made by the distinguished majority \nleader, essentially what the Senate will be saying to the country is if \nwe go off and drill in the gulf a bit, then the country can call it a \nday as far as getting a new energy policy. I don't think that is good \nenough.\n  I support responsible drilling in the gulf. We obviously need more \nenergy production. By any realistic calculus, we know oil will be part \nof our future and we are going to need to encourage production in a \nresponsible way. In the Senate Committee on Finance, again, working on \na bipartisan basis, the Senator from Wyoming, the distinguished Senator \nwho sits on the Committee on Finance, Senator Thomas, has some \nexcellent ideas in terms of encouraging production, particularly \ngetting more oil from existing wells. We do need more oil production. \nBut drilling alone is not the new energy policy this country needs. It \nis more business as usual.\n  We have been down this road before. In the 1990s, for example, the \nCongress passed a royalty program that was supposed to stimulate energy \nproduction and be good for the Gulf States and for our country as a \nwhole. What it has done is something very different than what was \nenvisioned. In fact, the sponsor of that legislation, our respected \ncolleague from the State of Louisiana, former Senator Johnston, has \nsaid the program, as it has developed, is nothing along the lines of \nwhat he envisioned.\n\n[[Page S8224]]\n\n  The Government Accountability Office has said with the royalty \nprogram created in the 1990s when oil was about $19 a barrel--it is \nover $70 a barrel now--that program that was created in the 1990s is \ngoing to cost taxpayers a minimum of $20 billion and possibly as much \nas $80 billion.\n  That is the royalty program we have on the books now. As we start \nthis discussion about setting up a new program, I want to make sure the \nSenate is up on how much money is being frittered away under the \nmismanaged program that is on the books today. One would think it is \ncommon sense to fix the old program before we start a new program. One \nwould think it is common sense to take the savings generated by fixing \nthe old program and applying those savings to paying for the new \nprogram before the Senate this afternoon. However, neither of those \ncommonsense steps is being taken. A new program is being considered by \nthe Senate today when Congress has not corrected the old program which \neven the oil companies acknowledge is not needed today, and even the \nsponsor, our former colleague, Senator Johnston, has indicated is not \nworking.\n  I have talked with Chairman Domenici about this. Chairman Domenici \nhas indicated he wants to fix this old program, this old, mismanaged \nprogram that has wasted so much of the taxpayers' scarce resources. We \nall know Chairman Domenici is a straight shooter and forthright and I \nhave appreciated his discussions with me.\n  However, I don't think the oil companies are going to easily give up \nthis multibillion dollar boondoggle, this sweetheart deal they have \nobtained. Time is not on the side of those who want to put a stop to \nthe billions of dollars being needlessly dispensed under the 1990s \nprogram.\n  The legislation before the Senate now is one of the last \nopportunities the Senate will have to permanently fix the broken \nroyalty program that began in the 1990s. Senator Kyl and I have been \nworking in a bipartisan way to change this. There has been action in \nboth the other body, the House, and in the Senate, in the Senate \nCommittee on Appropriations where the distinguished senior Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein, has done an excellent job of trying to \nadvance the cause of stopping these subsidies, but my guess is the \nlegislation the Senate has been able to at least start in the \nappropriations process may not even hit the floor of this body, and \neven if it does, the oil companies are very well positioned to run out \nthe clock on the effort in this session of Congress to stop the \nneedless subsidies that were granted in the 1990s.\n  For example, there is mediation now going on between the companies \nand the Government, but it is nonbinding, so the oil companies hold all \nthe cards. The appropriations process, of course, only lasts for a year \nso the companies can run out the clock on that, as well.\n  Senator Kyl and I spent a lot of time in the Senate making the case \nfor why this was a needless expense, particularly at a time when we \nhave so many other needs in our country. That day, despite the fact I \nstood in this spot for almost 5 hours, we could not even get a vote on \na measure to stop these subsidies that the General Accounting Office \nhas calculated is at least $20 billion and possibly $80 billion.\n\n  Put me down as pretty skeptical that the oil companies are going to \nvoluntarily give up these huge sums of money. As of now, in this \nsession, one measure after another has failed in terms of potential \nsteps that could protect the consumer. Let's review: The Federal Trade \nCommission, the agency that is supposed to protect the consumer and to \ndeal with concentration and mergers in the oil industry, a big goose \negg from the Federal Trade Commission. In fact, the chair, Deborah \nMajoras, has all but said that high prices are essentially good for the \nconsumer because by her theory that will promote more energy \nproduction. That is a pretty astounding theory of consumer protection, \nbut Senators can look it up. That is what she said before the Energy \nCommittee.\n  The agency that regulates commodities? Zip, with respect to dealing \nwith speculative practices, practices that contribute very \nsignificantly to the cost of oil. In fact, when oil company executives \ncame before our committee--the distinguished Senator from Alaska will \nrecall--one oil company executive said speculative practices are a big \nfactor in driving up the cost of oil for our consumers. We have not \nseen anything to reign in those speculative practices.\n  How about stopping needless tax breaks? When the oil company \nexecutives came before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I \nwent down the row and asked each one of the executives whether they \nneeded all these tax breaks. They now have record profits, consumers \nhave record prices, so I made the point, why in the world would you \nneed record tax breaks? The executives, when they had to answer in \nbroad daylight, said they did not need them. Ever since then, I have \nbeen trying to roll back some of those tax breaks. The President, to \nhis credit, said tax breaks are not needed when the price of oil is \nover $55 a barrel, but we have taken only the most modest step. A tiny \nbit of the tax relief that the oil companies are getting has been \nrolled back under a proposal I made involving a drilling writeoff that \nthe companies get.\n  So, Federal Trade Commission, zip; anti-speculative efforts, zip; tax \nbreaks that are needless expenditures that the oil companies say they \ndon't need, virtually nothing. So put me down as pretty skeptical given \nthe fact that in each of those areas the Government has ducked taking \non the oil companies. Put me down as pretty skeptical that somehow \nthese oil companies are going to come to the table and walk away and \nleave behind $20 to $60 billion worth of breaks in royalty relief from \nthe 1990s. I don't think it is going to happen. I hope it does.\n  Chairman Domenici is very sincere in his views, but given the track \nrecord in this Congress of the oil companies being able to escape any \nkind of effort at those various agencies I have outlined, I don't think \nthe oil companies are going to voluntarily clean up a program in the \n1990s that has been so mismanaged. My sense is it is going to be \nnecessary to pass legislation in this Congress to force the companies \nto give up these needless subsidies.\n  There is a compromise with respect to how it could be done in a \nbipartisan way. It is a compromise that I and the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona, Senator Kyl, have been talking about. We actually \nproposed it to the distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator \nDomenici. I suggested what we might do is allow the negotiations \nbetween the companies and the Government under the 1990s royalty \nprogram to proceed for a bit longer. Possibly that will work. I am \nskeptical, but possibly it will.\n  But if those negotiations did not produce the savings for taxpayers \nand the cleansing of this old program that is so important, then we \nhave to be tougher. After a period for negotiations, I would propose as \npart of a bipartisan compromise that the Senate then insist the \ncompanies get no new leases until the old program has been cleaned up. \nThat would bring together some of the ideas advanced by the \ndistinguished chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nSenator Domenici, and some of the ideas Senator Kyl and I and others \nhave offered on a bipartisan basis.\n  We suggested that be done in this bill. We said: Here is an \nopportunity in this legislation to permanently fix the old program \nbefore you start a new one. We thought it was a chance to take two \napproaches Senators have been talking about and bringing them together \nand permanently fixing the program. I believe if the Senate does not do \nthat, the clock is going to run down on the program, and I think, in \nall likelihood, the Senate, in the beginning of 2007, will be in much \nthe same place it is today. I do not want to see that happen.\n  I think it is time for a fresh approach with respect to how our \ncountry makes energy policy. I think we need to be much bolder and much \nmore creative. I have advanced ideas in this area; a number of Senators \nhave. But we have seen precious little of that kind of bold thinking. \nWhat we have seen is essentially business as usual.\n  I hope colleagues will take a look at the analysis that has been done \nby the Senate Budget Committee of the impact of the legislation before \nus today. This is, of course, S. 3711. I asked the Democratic staff of \nthe Senate Budget Committee to do an analysis of the impact of the bill \nbefore us today. The\n\n[[Page S8225]]\n\nlegislation before us now authorizes at least a 50-year commitment. The \noil companies, in my view, under this legislation have been able to \nparlay the suffering of our citizens in the Gulf States into something \nthat I believe could become an unaffordable gravy train.\n  What the Budget Committee staff found is that between 2017 and 2055, \nthe U.S. Treasury and Federal taxpayers would be out almost $20 billion \nbeyond what is already going out the door under the broken royalty \nrelief program from the 1990s that I have described once again on the \nfloor of the Senate. But beyond that, all bets are off. Lost revenues \nafter that could be as much as $12 billion to $15 billion each year.\n  So I would ask the Senate: At a time when clearly folks in those Gulf \nStates are hurting, and the Senate ought to step in and be of \nassistance to them, does it make sense to authorize a 50-year program \nthat, particularly after the initial period, will involve additional \nsums, additional untold billions of dollars of revenues that could be \nlost?\n  The challenge for the Senate now, it seems to me, is, first and \nforemost, to get some amendments to this legislation. I hope the \nmajority leader, the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Frist, \nwill change his mind. I hope the distinguished majority leader will \nallow amendments on automobile efficiency, on renewable energy, on \nprotecting consumers from exploitive practices, and protecting \ntaxpayers from needless subsidies. We would not be talking about \nhundreds of amendments. I think amendments in those four areas would \nprovide an opportunity to strike a balance in this legislation to make \nsure that urgently needed help is directed to these Gulf States, that \nefforts are being made to get a new energy policy for our country.\n  It does not make any sense, to me, for the Senate to say: Let's go \ndrill a bit in the Gulf--and pretty much call it a day. But that is \nwhat the legislation in its present form essentially says. It says: At \na time when the country desperately needs a new energy policy, when \npeople are clamoring for it at townhall meetings and in chambers of \ncommerce and in virtually every other place a Senator goes, what we are \ngoing to say is nothing doing. We are going to say a bit of drilling in \nthe Gulf will cover it, and a bit of drilling in the Gulf can take \nplace, even though billions of dollars are being wasted under a \nprogram--a previous program--that was directed to the Gulf States from \nthe 1990s.\n  I think the Senate can do better. I think the Senate can do better on \na bipartisan basis. Senator Kyl and I are ready to propose what we \nbelieve could be a bipartisan initiative that would involve \nrecommendations made by the chairman of the Energy Committee, Senator \nDomenici, ourselves, Senator Feinstein, and others. We think we could \nsave a big chunk of money--billions and billions of dollars--that could \nbe applied to the new program that is being considered by the Senate \ntoday.\n  That is the kind of bipartisan work the Senate should focus on. I \nlook forward to the discussion and particularly hope the distinguished \nmajority leader, Senator Frist, will change his mind. This subject is \ntoo important to bar Senators from offering meaningful amendments and \nallowing the Senate to get a more balanced energy policy and securing \nthe needs of our citizens.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Without objection, the quorum calls will be equally divided.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nS. 3711, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006.\n  This is an important and timely piece of legislation that deals with \nan issue that is very near and dear to Floridians, which is protecting \nour gulf coast from drilling.\n  Protecting Florida's coastline is an issue of monumental concern to \nme and to my constituents, and I commend Chairman Domenici and his \nstaff, as well as Leader Frist and Senator Mitch McConnell, for their \nhard work in forging a strong bipartisan compromise that allows us to \ndo just that. I also thank the distinguished Senator from Louisiana for \nher work in bringing about this bill.\n  As Floridians know, and many of my colleagues have learned over the \npast several months, our beaches are extremely important to our way of \nlife. We value their unique and fragile ecosystem. Our State's special \nscenery and fragile environment bring millions from across the Nation \nand the globe to enjoy its sugar-sand beaches and world class angling \nand boating.\n  I have spent a great amount of time and energy since arriving in the \nSenate fighting to protect Florida's treasures from the threat of \noffshore drilling, together with my colleague, Senator Nelson, as well \nas with the Members of the Florida delegation in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Several different pieces of legislation have been introduced over the \npast year in the House and the Senate that the Florida delegation has \nfound extremely worrisome, and we have been successful up to this point \nin keeping drilling at bay. But the drilling battle has gotten fiercer \nand the stakes have gotten much higher as our Nation struggles to meet \nour energy demands in an increasingly uncertain world.\n  Pressure continues to mount in Congress to develop Federal deepwater \nresources in the Outer Continental Shelf. And because high oil and \nnatural gas prices are not a Republican or a Democrat problem but they \nare our Nation's problem, there is a bipartisan majority that grows \nstronger each day behind the effort to open the Eastern Planning Zone \nof the Gulf of Mexico to more drilling.\n  So our options are whether to be part of a solution--a real solution \nthat provides concrete protections for our State--or watch our \nprotections be eaten away year after year by those who do not share \nFlorida's values. I chose to be part of a solution for Florida.\n  I want to assure Floridians that Florida is protected under this \nbill. This legislation, which I was proud to help negotiate, will \nprovide unprecedented protections for the gulf coast of Florida. This \nbill establishes in law a 235-mile buffer from Tampa and a minimum of \n125 miles of protection from the Panhandle of Florida south through the \nyear 2022. It provides over 300 miles of protection from Naples west. \nAnd it protects our very important military mission line. The military \nmission line is important to Florida because we are also blessed in \nFlorida to host a great number of military facilities and the very \nimportant facilities in the Florida Panhandle. Eglin Air Force Base, \nHurlburt Field, and the Pensacola Naval Air Station are facilities that \nrely on the Gulf of Mexico for training and for firing ranges, all of \nwhich would be incompatible with drilling.\n  Any lease within 125 miles of the coast, inside the no-drill zone, \ncan be exchanged for new leases in deepwater in the Gulf of Mexico. In \naddition, the critical ``Stovepipe'' area located in extreme proximity \nto Pensacola will be protected from oil and gas exploration through the \nyear 2022. These are historic protections that Floridians can count on \nfor years to come.\n  I would like to make clear that this is not an opening for \nnegotiation. I am firmly committed to this deal. Anything else that \nsubtracts from the protections for our State as laid out in this \nlegislation is not enough for our State. This is it.\n  To me, this compromise is a bridge to the future. It is my hope that \nby 2022, and maybe long before then, we will have developed a long-term \nenergy strategy to lessen our dependence on oil. It is that simple and \nsomething I feel very strongly about for our future.\n  Just last year, the Senate passed a large, bipartisan Energy Policy \nAct that doubled the amount of ethanol in our fuel mix to 7.5 billion \ngallons. The bill also included provisions that I supported that \nincreased funding for sugarcane and cellulosic ethanol development, as \nwell as $50 million in loan guarantees to build alternative energy \nplants. We must buckle down and advance the use of renewables and \nalternative sources of energy. We are only\n\n[[Page S8226]]\n\nscratching the surface of our future potential, and we should not limit \nthe capacity or ingenuity of America's scientists to tackle this energy \nproblem. However, we need a bridge to get to that future. S. 3711 is a \nway to keep our industries and utilities running while we find new ways \nto power our cars, heat and cool our homes, and create our energy--\nAmerica's energy.\n  As important a priority as it is to Floridians that we protect our \ncoasts and our environment, we must be realistic about our own energy \ndemands. It is a difficult thing--and it has been a difficult thing as \nI have tried to fight for Florida's environment--to stand here and say \nwe want no new drilling, we want no drilling anywhere in the gulf, when \nFlorida's size alone makes it one of the Nation's largest \nconsumers. And these consumers are Florida's families who are \nstruggling to fill their cars and heat and cool their homes. These are \nstruggling families who sit around the kitchen table while they balance \ntheir family budget and find the budget busted by ever-increasing \nenergy costs. The rising cost of fuel and the strains that this is \nplacing on their pocketbook are dominating talk of America's families.\n\n  In addition, we have to keep in mind how critical energy is to many \nof our industries that help drive the economies of our State. As a \nmember of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I have heard \ncountless testimony from our Nation's chemical, fertilizer, and \nmanufacturing industries that are vitally dependent on increasing \nnatural gas supplies within our Nation. Unlike petroleum, which is \ntraded globally, much of the natural gas market is traded on a regional \nbasis, and U.S. natural gas prices are among the highest in the world. \nFor example, Florida provides 75 percent of the phosphate fertilizers \nused by American farmers and gardeners every day. The Florida phosphate \nindustry is one of the State's oldest and largest economic engines, \naccounting for more than 6,000 direct jobs. The Tampa Port Authority \nestimates that that industry has created more than 41,000 indirect jobs \nand $5.9 billion of economic impact in the Tampa Bay region alone.\n  Prior to the significant increases in natural gas prices, the U.S. \nnitrogen industry typically supplied approximately 85 percent of U.S. \nfarmers' nitrogen fertilizer needs. As a result of the continuing \nnatural gas crisis, farmers have been forced to import more than 50 \npercent of the nitrogen fertilizers they use. In total, at least 21 \nnitrogen fertilizer production facilities have closed since July of \n1998. Sixteen of those plants have closed permanently. That represents \na 25-percent drop in total U.S. production capacity, while five plants \nremain idle even today. S. 3711 will provide over 5.8 trillion cubic \nfeet of natural gas for our impaired industries, utilities, and also my \nconstituents who are dealing with soaring heating and cooling bills.\n  I would like to focus now on a series of concerns that have been \nraised regarding this bill, how it is different and, in my opinion, \nbetter than OCS legislation recently passed in the House of \nRepresentatives. Let me say, first, that my colleagues in the Florida \ndelegation worked tirelessly to find and obtain the best protection \npossible for our State under very difficult circumstances. Some have \nquestioned the protections afforded to the buffer zone around Florida. \nThe buffer zone provided by S. 3711, in my opinion, is clearly \npreferable to any other one that has been offered as an alternative. \nThis legislation ensures that the Federal Government will continue to \nhave jurisdiction over the Federal waters off each State's coast. We do \nnot cede the responsibility of energy development, environmental \nprotection or military preparedness to the desires of State \nlegislatures. The buffer zone in the Gulf of Mexico is good through the \nyear 2022 and also prohibits drilling in our military critical training \nareas.\n  Some have asked why Florida's Atlantic coast is not included in this \nbill. I would say, quite simply, that Florida's Atlantic coast has been \nunder relentless attack for the last year and a half by those who want \nto drill. The Atlantic coast of Florida is still under a Presidential \nwithdrawal until 2012, as well as the entire eastern and western coasts \nof the United States. This means that until the year 2012, the eastern \ncoast of Florida is safe. Our compromise legislation in no way weakens \nthe existing coastal protections. The House-passed OCS bill removes the \nentire Presidential withdrawals off of every coast and forces State \nlegislatures to pass legislation every 5 years to keep or extend those \nprotections.\n  Other coastal Senators have raised their objection to S. 3711 because \nthey want to increase coastal buffer zones in their own States. This is \na focused piece of legislation that deals only with the Gulf of Mexico. \nAdding additional protections to areas that frankly are not promising \nto the energy industry should not be an impediment to moving forward \nwith this compromise bill. To quote the old bank robber, when asked why \nhe robbed banks, he replied: Because that is where the money is. The \narea being opened for exploration is the most promising area of \ndiscovery for the industry and can be leased right away.\n  During negotiations, I chose to focus on protecting the area of \nFlorida under greatest pressure, and I thank my colleagues, Senator \nDomenici, Leader Frist, and Senator McConnell, for honoring me and \nFlorida's environmental concerns.\n  The last major concern that has been raised is objection to revenue \nsharing with western Gulf States and targeted revenues to the stateside \nLand and Water Conservation Fund. It is perfectly fitting and \nappropriate that we share revenues with the States that produce our \nNation's energy and deal with its corresponding onshore repercussions. \nWe in Florida do not want to participate in the development of this \nextensive oil and gas infrastructure but recognize that others in the \nwestern gulf pay the price to bring reliable energy to the country. We \nshare 50 percent of revenues on public land within a State's boundary, \nand it is fitting that we provide energy-producing States with at least \nsimilar treatment. Sharing 37.5 percent of the new OCS revenues will \nnot bankrupt the Nation, nor increase the Nation's national debt. \nCurrently, these areas off the coast are not being leased and are \nproviding no revenue to the General Treasury. Keeping 100 percent of \nzero revenues is just that--nothing.\n\n  Finally, for those concerned with funding the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, S. 3711 will provide a real boost for the program. \nThe mandatory funding stream established under this bill does not \nreplace appropriated funding and does nothing to disadvantage the \nprogram in the appropriations process. The President's budget request \nhas been zeroed out the last 2 years for this program and under our \ncompromise bill, the Land and Water Conservation Fund will provide up \nto $450 million or 12.5 percent of the revenues generated from the new \nleasing each year.\n  This compromise was delicate and difficult to forge. Some argue more \ncould have been done for Florida. Others protest that Florida is \nafforded far too many protections, given that our State consumes nearly \n20 million gallons of petroleum per day. High oil and natural gas \nprices are not a Republican or Democratic problem, but they are our \nNation's problem. It is imperative that we pass the Gulf of Mexico \nEnergy Security Act to provide Florida with the critical environmental \nprotections it needs, as well as bringing 1.25 billion barrels of oil \nand 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to keep our industries and \nNation afloat as we develop future sources of alternative energy. \nFailure to act is not an option. I urge my colleagues to support this \nwell-crafted, bipartisan measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am proud to follow Senator Martinez from \nFlorida, who has truly gone the extra mile in realizing his \nresponsibility to his home State of Florida but also recognizing his \nresponsibility to the Nation and trying to balance the two in a very \nintricate way. There isn't a Senator on this floor who doesn't \nappreciate the value and beauty of Florida's vast coastlines and \nrecognize that they are not only a Florida treasure, they are a \nnational treasure. We know we have the technology today, as has been \nclearly demonstrated over the last two decades, to drill not very far \noffshore anywhere and make sure that it is done in an environmentally \nsound way to\n\n[[Page S8227]]\n\nprotect the beauty of those beaches and the vistas of those marvelous \ncoastlines that make up the great State of Florida.\n  For Florida or any State to suggest that the oil that lies off its \nshore is not a national asset and, therefore, should be treated only as \na State asset is simply wrong. It would be as though my suggesting, as \na Senator from Idaho with millions of acres of Federal forest lands, \nthat not one tree should be cut for the sake of building homes anywhere \nin our Nation. Why? Because of the environmental consequences, when we \nknow today we, in fact, can cut trees in a clear, clean, and precise \nway, preserve the environment, and provide the fiber to the national \nfiber market, be it paper or 2 by 4s to build homes. It is also true of \nthe minerals that lie under the subsurface of my property--but not my \nproperty, the Nation's property--on the Federal lands of the State of \nIdaho.\n  There is an intricate and important balance between what is a State's \nresponsibility and a State's right and what is a Federal property and, \ntherefore, the responsibility of the Congress in exercising the \nauthority over that Federal responsibility, that Federal resource that \nwe are today talking about in an important piece of legislation that is \nnow before the Senate.\n  Embodied in S. 3711 is an effort to very carefully go at part of the \nresource that lies in the Gulf of Mexico that is a Federal asset and a \nFederal resource and do so in a way that clearly benefits the State of \nFlorida but, more importantly, benefits every consumer in America \ntoday.\n  Here is the current situation that Americans face and that America \nsimply cannot understand. Every area of this red zone around our \ncountry is a designated area by a Federal action in which we are not \nallowing our companies to develop and explore for gas and oil. I call \nit the no zone--no, you can't go there; no, you can't touch it; no, you \ncan't drill; and, no, you can't develop. What does it mean to our \ncountry? Well, it means literally billions of barrels of oil and \ntrillions of cubic feet of gas all around this area--Alaska, ANWR, the \nwest coast from the State of Washington down to the border with Mexico \noff the coast of California, all around Florida, all the way up to the \nState of Maine. It is difficult to determine how many billions of \nbarrels of oil are there, but we know that it is significant and it is \nphenomenal.\n  Let me give an example. On this little piece of paper is a green \nstrip. It is a green strip that recognizes S. 3711. We are going to \nplace it in its proper location in this debate. I am going to put it \nright there. That is all this bill does. How big is this spot? This \nspot is 8.3 million acres out of the Gulf of Mexico. This little spot, \nby this perspective, represents 1.6 billion barrels of oil, we believe, \nbased on a U.S. Geological Survey, and 5.83 trillion cubic feet of gas \nright there, this little, tiny spot. Is it significant? In the mix of \nall of this, yes, it is. But more importantly, it says that a \ncomprehensive broad policy under sound environmental guidelines could \nmake this Nation tremendously less dependent on foreign oil and gas \ncoming out of Canada.\n  The industries that the Senator from Florida talked about that are \nlosing their base, agriculture and nitrogen fertilizer, the \npetrochemical industry and natural gas that is now going offshore, and \nwe are losing those jobs, all of that would stop if this Senate and \nthis Congress and this Government got their heads on right about \nnational energy policy. S. 3711 is a step in the right direction. Is it \na big step? No, it is not. It is a rather small step. But it is a \ntremendously important step, as we head down the road of beginning to \nrecognize that this Nation could, in fact, become very much self-\nsufficient in many ways in its energy needs through its own energy \nproduction.\n  You have heard some rather tired and old debate about needing a \ncomprehensive energy policy, and we shouldn't do S. 3711 without it \nbecause it simply isn't broad enough. How can any Senator stand on the \nfloor today who stood on the floor a year ago today and debate the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2005, the most significant, broad-ranging energy \ndevelopment, energy conservation, new technology for energy bill that \nthis Congress has ever passed? It is now law. It is now being \nimplemented. And whether you are in the Midwest or the upper Midwest or \nin Idaho, we have ethanol refineries going up all around us. Twenty \npercent of the corn crop this year will be used in the production of \nethanol and into the future. Why? Because of new technology and \nnational energy policy. You don't need to reinstate or restate what we \ndid last year. All you need to do is keep adding to it and \nstrengthening it in a way that allows us as a nation to become \nincreasingly self-sufficient.\n  S. 3711 does just that. Let me bring your eye back to the chart, back \nto this little, tiny spot on the map, this 3.8 million acres. That is a \nlot of land, isn't it? In this case, it is a lot of water. Under that \nwater and in that land rests an opportunity to bring down the energy \ncosts to the average American consumer by a significant amount and to \nmake us less dependent on foreign sources for our oil today in areas of \nthe world that are politically very unstable.\n  I could go on about a lot of facts, statistics, and figures. But let \nme take you to the real important part of this debate. It is called \nsecurity for the average American family. America is frustrated today, \nand the average consumer and average mom and dad are tremendously \nfrustrated because their cost of living is not keeping pace with their \npaycheck. Why? Because instead of driving to the gas pump and filling \nup for $10 or $15, they are paying $40 or $50 each time, or more. What \ndoes that do to a family budget? You may say that is one energy cost; \nthey can surely abide that. Did you check their thermostats and their \nother energy bills, the cost of electricity to turn the lights on and \nkeep their computer on for them and their kids? What about the \ntemperature in the home in the cold winter months? All of that has \ncosts significantly more in a very short period of time.\n  In 6 years--that is the life of one term of a Senator--natural gas \nprices that heat the homes of America have gone up 286 percent. While I \nknow we ought to be concerned about all of the politics and all of the \nsurrounding land and doing it environmentally sound, what we are \ntalking about today is beginning to understand the burden and the sense \nof insecurity that the American consumer is suffering from and doing \nsomething about it. It would be one thing to say there isn't any more \ngas, there isn't any more oil, and we are shifting to a bunch of \nalternatives, and in the meantime you are going to have to pay the \nprice.\n  The reason the American consumer is paying more at the pump today, \nmore for their electrical bill and heating is because of politics, \nbecause the American politician for the last two decades has denied the \nAmerican consumer the right to have access to the resources they are \nentitled to have. I hope we got the message.\n  S. 3711 begins to say to American consumers that we hear you. We may \nbe a little late, but we hear you. In hearing you, we are going to \nbring 5.83 trillion cubic feet of gas online in a relatively short \nperiod of time--18 months to 2 years at the very latest. And we have \nthe potential of bringing 1.6 billion barrels of oil into the gulf \ncoast refineries. That is billions of barrels that we will not buy from \nVenezuela, Saudi Arabia or any other place that is politically \nunstable. We are going to produce it in this country. That should help \nbring down or stabilize the cost of gas at the pump.\n  The American consumer ought to be able to rely on its Government not \nto stand in the way of the private industry sector of our country and \nits ability to produce for that American consumer. But for decades upon \ndecades, we have done just that, all in the name of environment--in \nmost instances, even when we knew that the environment wasn't going to \nbe damaged. And now we know for sure.\n  Remember Katrina? Remember what happened a year ago, as one of the \nmost powerful storms in the world surged up the Gulf of Mexico and \nacross the coast of Louisiana and Mississippi and Arkansas? It tipped \nover oil rigs out in the gulf, shut down thousands of wells that are in \nthis green area. And no oil was spilled. Why? Because of the safety \nmechanisms, the environmental ability that our industries have today to \ndo it right.\n  Few of you remember what happened off of the coast of California in \nthe late 1950s and early 1960s; it was an oil spill\n\n[[Page S8228]]\n\nknown as Santa Barbara. From that day forward, the environmentalists' \ncall was: Remember Santa Barbara. The reason we had so much difficulty \nwith this little sale was the ghost of Santa Barbara. Let me tell you, \nSanta Barbara is dead, buried, and gone. From that day forward, the \nAmerican oil-producing industry learned lessons, developed \ntechnologies, wellhead shutoffs, did all of the right things not only \nin a voluntary way but also because of mandates of public policy from \nour Federal Government. We began to get it better, and it is the best \nit is today. Americans ought not fear drilling off their coasts because \nit is done right. Remember Katrina and not one drop spilled.\n  Let me talk about something else that simply demonstrates the reality \nof where we are. Let's dial up your scope and not look at the whole of \nthe United States; let's go right to the gulf on this chart. Here we \nare. Here is 181. This is what S. 3711 talks about, this 8.3 million \nacres. We provide excellent buffer for the State of Florida all around. \nYet we are going to allow production to come off in that area so that \nthe American consumer can feel a little more secure, hoping that the \nprice at the pump will not go up anymore and might go down a little, \nand their energy bills this winter may go down a little bit. But \nthe reason I bring this to the floor is because of the speech I gave \nsome months ago on the Senate floor about what is going on right here, \nthe Northern Basin off Cuba, 50 miles from the Florida coastline. We \nhave five foreign countries drilling there today. That is 50 miles off \nof our coastline; it is property that belongs to the Cuban nation. \nChina is there drilling, as are Spain and Canada. It is not 120 miles \naway, not the big buffer zone we created to protect the Florida \ncoastline from our own effort, our own expertise, from the world's best \ndeep-sea drillers, the U.S. petroleum companies. In some instances \nthere, it is nations that know little about the technology and are \nborrowing it from others and don't have our quick shutoff systems and \nour wellhead protection systems. They are not 120 miles off of our \ncoast, they are 50 miles off of our coast, and we cannot do a thing \nabout it.\n\n  Let me rephrase that. There is something we could do. Right now, we \nhave prohibition that no U.S. company can go there. It is Federal \npolicy, U.S. foreign policy. Why? Because it is Cuban. Yet the Cubans \nwould love to have us there. Why? Because of our expertise and talent. \nThey want their beaches protected. This particular area of Cuba has \nbeautiful, sandy white beaches being developed by foreign interests \ntoday for resorts, so foreign tourists can come there from all over the \nworld. They don't want those beaches at risk, but they also want oil \ndeveloped. They would love to have us do it, but we have a prohibition \nagainst that. We will debate that on the floor.\n  I have a bill that 20-plus Senators are cosponsors of. It would \nchange the policy and allow U.S. companies to play in that area, to \nbid, and to become the producer--not for a Chinese market but for a \nU.S. market. Isn't it phenomenal? Here we go, again. Here is the ``no \nzone.'' We say: No, you can't. No U.S. company can touch any of this. \nBut right down here, we say: China can come and drill. We say that by \nthe absence of good foreign policy; we don't say it in reality. But by \ndenying ourselves the opportunity, we invite the world to come.\n  The reason it is important that I say this in the context of S. 3711 \nis for the American people to understand that, as we struggle to get it \nright, with lease sale 181 embodied in the Senate bill, it is but a \nsmall step in the right direction--albeit the right direction--with \npotentially a very significant impact to the consumer's pocketbook. At \nthe same time, we have a long way to go as a country, as our economy \nstruggles under dramatically increased energy costs, as the average \nfamily struggles to balance their budget, their household budget.\n  There is no way that mom's or dad's salary is going to go up 280 \npercent in a few months' time. It will not happen. Yet everything that \nis tied to energy, everything that is tied to the petrochemical \nindustry, their costs have gone up dramatically, and all of those are \nput off on the American consumer. Did you hear the Senator from \nFlorida? Twenty-five to thirty percent of our nitrogen production has \ngone offshore. Now, we are so silly that we are stepping on our food \nbills. Nitrogen goes on the ground, nitrogen produces crops, crops \nproduce food, and food gets to the consumer shelf. By our public \npolicy, we are suggesting that food costs will even go up, or at least \nthe producer's costs will go up. If the producer's costs will go up, \nthey will attempt to pass that through to the market shelf, to the \ngrocery store. So not only by the absence of good policy are we going \nto cause mom to pay more to get to the grocery store, we are going to \nask that she pay more when she gets there, all because of an incoherent \nlack of policy that doesn't fit the absolute needs of the American \nconsumer.\n  I could go on a lot longer about national security and our dependence \non foreign oil and, when that dependence is at risk, then we have to \nsuffer or we put our military in harm's way, in part, to protect our \nforeign interests and keep rural stability. We will argue that it is in \nthe name of human freedom, but in the process it holds down energy \ncosts by creating a stable world.\n  Senator Domenici chairs the Energy Committee, and he has worked now \nfor a year to produce the legislation that is before us. He recognizes, \nas do many of us who serve on the Energy Committee, the reality of \nwhere we are today and where we have to go. The American consumer will, \nI believe, feel the positive result of this legislation when it becomes \nlaw, when the drilling starts, when the marketplace recognizes that the \npotential of bringing 5.83 trillion cubic feet of gas to the market and \n1.6 billion barrels of oil is very significant, and it is done in a \nsafe way and environmentally sound way and it is out of harm's way from \nthe rest of the world that is growing increasingly unstable, which \nhappens to be one of the primary producers of crude oil for the world \nmarket. No, finally the Senate gets it.\n  Senator Domenici and I and members of the Energy Committee and this \nSenate struggled for 5 years to craft the Energy Policy Act of last \nyear, a very significant bill.\n  A lot of work is underway. Billions are being invested in all forms \nof new technology and energy and energy development. But in the \ninterim, in the next decade or two, as we transition this great economy \nof ours to different forms of energy, you don't turn off the energy you \nhave, you don't tell the consumer not to drive the car for 5 years \nuntil we can get them a hydrogen fuel cell car that doesn't do any \nemission, or maybe is supplied by energy that is going to cost less. \nOur country doesn't work that way and it never has.\n  S. 3711 begins to put us in sync with reality. I say to the American \nconsumer that we hear you. We hear you loudly and clearly and we grasp \nyour sense of frustration and insecurity at this moment. Passage of \nthis bill will help stabilize energy costs and, in some instances, \nespecially in natural gas, it may well bring down those prices for the \nwinter months and the heating months of 2006 and 2007. If we can \naccomplish that--and I think we can--then this Senate ought to vote \nunanimously for S. 3711. We ought not get caught up in the minutiae of \nthe politics of the past because the minutiae of the politics of the \npast have produced $3 gas, have produced $10 and $12-per-million-cubic-\nfeet gas, and have caused the American consumer to develop a sense of \ninsecurity about themselves, their families, and their futures like \nnone we have ever had.\n\n  The chairman of the Energy Committee gets it. That is why he has \nworked as hard as he has. I believe I understand those issues, and I am \nproud to be a cosponsor of this legislation.\n  Let us say to the American people: Let's take a step further. Let's \nerase this red area from surrounding the American coastline. Let's look \nat new offshore policy that says to the American consumer: Here is an \nopportunity, and we ought to deal with it in an environmentally sound \nway, instead of just saying no. You can't just say no and be able to \ndeal with that at the gas pump the next day because when you do, that \nmeans the American consumer pays more.\n  I see that as the essence of this bill. And in supporting S. 3711, \nalbeit a strong step, it is clearly a step in the right direction. \nLet's remember the responsibility we have to the consumer\n\n[[Page S8229]]\n\nas we effectively deal with and develop these resources because that \nconsumer is also an environmentalist who wants it done in a safe and \nsound and environmentally clean way. That is what we are about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, before the distinguished Senator \nleaves the floor--I see he is still here and I am glad he is--I thank \nhim very much not just for me or for that speech, for that statement, \nfor that set of thoughts, but I thank him for the American people for \nhis thoughtfulness.\n  If anyone wants to read the text of something that summarizes from \nbeginning to end the problems we are having and why in the areas of \nhigh costs of natural gas and crude oil and insecurity and lack of \nconsistency and fluctuation in prices that are frightening and scaring \neverybody, read the speech that was just delivered by the distinguished \nSenator from Idaho. It is a tremendous introduction to the problem and \nthen a total summation and wrap-up of what we can do for ourselves and \nwhy we should do it and why with the problem of energy supply in the \nfields of natural gas and crude oil, wherever America can, we must use \nour resources, especially these days when insecurity in the world \ncauses such a problem. Even if they are supplied, the price is totally \nout of focus, and everybody should know that if we have our own \nsupplies, that is what we ought to use--it is sitting right off our \ncoast--with no damage, as the Senator from Idaho indicated.\n  We saw the little piece of property out of acres and acres and \nmiles--this little piece of property, 8.3 million acres. He showed it \nto us on a map. It is loaded with natural gas. How do they know? They \nhave already proven it. Part of it was ready to be leased; isn't that \nright, I say to the Senator? Part of it was ready to be leased in the \nregime of the Governor of the State of Florida, a former Senator, \nLawton Chiles. As a Floridian, he, years ago, acknowledged this must \nhappen, that part of this property was prepared. We know it. When we \nput it to bid, it will be ready to go.\n  Not only that, as the distinguished Senator indicated, to have an \nimpact on the cost, we don't have to wait until they drill--right?--\nbecause it is such a big supply that the marketplace will take \ncognizance, will be aware of, will respond to the fact that we are \nready to do it.\n  Once this bill leaves here, even that might have an impact. But I am \nnot sure, until it is signed, as I think of it, that will have an \nimpact because there is always a chance for a slip between the cup and \nthe lip.\n  We have to get it done, and we have to get it voted on. It is ours. \nIt is ready to go.\n  I once again thank my good friend and valued member of the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources--and many others around here--for his \nterrific speech summarizing the problem we have and the way this \nAmerican solution to an American problem should be addressed and why.\n  I thank the Senator. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to join in the conversation \nand the discussion about energy and in support of S. 3711, the Gulf of \nMexico Energy bill.\n  We are coming up on the anniversary of the Energy Policy Act which we \npassed sometime back. It is comprehensive energy legislation that \nrecognizes the difficulties we have in this country, recognizes the \ndirections we need to go, recognizes in general terms where we have to \nbe, whether it is increased production, whether it is efficiency and \nconservation, whether it is alternative methods, whatever. All those \nissues are excellent, and I am glad we did that.\n  Of course, now we are in the position of implementing those policies \nand implementing the policies, of course, is what will have an impact \non people in this country, what will have an impact on the costs.\n  Despite the Energy bill, prices, of course, have risen. They have \nincreased because we haven't been able to implement the bill to bolster \nproduction. There are a number of things going on, and I think we have \nto continue to remember that there are at least two aspects of the \nfuture in terms of energy.\n  One is, out 20 years, we will be looking at all new kinds of sources, \nall new kinds of supplies, whether they be wind energy, sun energy, but \nthose are down the road. We are not there yet. On the other hand, we \nneed to be talking about how we are going to supply our cars and how we \nare going to take care of the costs for American families this year, \nnext year, and 5 years from now. So there are two aspects that are very \nmuch involved.\n  One of the reasons, of course, is we haven't been able to move. There \nhas been some resistance to including production in measures. The \nrecent jump in prices has been linked directly to that resistance. It \nis time to do something about U.S. production.\n  I echo the comments the senior Senator from Louisiana made earlier \ntoday that we cannot drill our way to energy independence and we cannot \nconserve our way to energy independence. We have to do both. We have to \nhave production, we have to have efficiency, we have to have \nconservation. Oil and gas is the easiest way we know to do this.\n  I come from Wyoming, one of the large production States of oil, gas, \nand coal, the largest producer of fossil fuels. We know how to do these \nthings, but we have to find new sources, new ways of moving toward the \nenergy that is there.\n  For the sake of security, we must do more. We must reduce our \nincreased reliance on foreign sources of energy. Obviously, as the \nworld changes--and we see every day on the TV how difficult it is to \ncontinue to do that--the Outer Continental Shelf holds great promise \nfor accomplishing that goal.\n  The higher prices we have seen recently are the result of many \nfactors, and we need to address those factors. We all agree increased \nsupply lowers prices. We need to produce more energy in the United \nStates, and, of course, this is a politically charged issue.\n  Many people have proposals they believe will help. I have my own bill \nto reduce prices that Americans pay for energy, increase efficiency, \nnew refineries, and better infrastructure and all the things we must \ndo.\n  We cannot deny the basic economic principle that increased supply \nreduces cost. It is simple. The bill we are debating today will \nincrease domestic supplies of gas and oil. It will do so in ways that \nare sensitive to the environment, that will make us more secure and \nbolster economic opportunities. And it represents an agreement between \nthe States that are most directly impacted by gulf coast production.\n  Too often people complain about the high energy prices and attempt to \nblame others. We have an opportunity to do something about that cost of \nenergy today. In 6 months' time it will be winter. I am certain that \nMembers will complain about the cost of energy then, too. I am also \nsure there will be a call for more money to spend on LIHEAP and other \nprograms. I ask that we deal with those problems now and not later.\n  The American people are paying close attention to this bill and want \nus to continue with this debate and make some improvement in domestic \nproduction.\n  If we do not increase supply now, the American people will know who \nto blame. There are, of course, other things that Congress needs to be \ndoing on energy. Coal conversion technologies need our full support. We \nhave over 200 years' worth of coal in the United States that can be \ncheaply produced. Wyoming supplies a third of our Nation's current coal \nneeds.\n  We put this coal on railcars and send it across the Nation. That is \nincreasingly becoming expensive. We want to put the coal in pipelines \nand convert it to diesel and electric power for cleaner power.\n  Our electric transmission grid needs to be modernized. Several \nhundred thousand people lost power this last week in California, \nMissouri, Illinois, and New York. The grid is stressed, and we need to \nencourage investments to strengthen it.\n  I would like all of our coasts opened to responsible production. This \nbill makes 1.3 billion barrels of oil and 5.8 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas available. That is a good thing. Let's not forget there is \nan additional 19.3 billion barrels and 83 trillion cubic feet of oil\n\n[[Page S8230]]\n\nand gas off our coasts that are currently off limits. This bill does \nnot make those areas available.\n  Yes, I prefer that revenues from these activities be used to reduce \nour Nation's debt. There is continued resistance to all of these \nbroader approaches, however.\n  I hope that lease sale 181 can serve as an example to other coastal \nStates that offshore production works. What we need now is a bill on \nwhich we can agree, and we have it before us. We need something that \ncan make a difference in the short term. This bill is a pragmatic \napproach that achieves these goals. This is something we know can \nhappen. We know how to produce it. It is available. It recognizes the \nvalue of increased production and strikes the necessary balance to make \nthose activities a reality.\n  We are faced with a broad challenge in energy, of course, a long-term \nchallenge. We have all kinds of approaches to it. But here is one \nbefore us that we know how to handle, that we can handle, it has an \nimpact, and it is prepared for us to do today. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will be glad to defer to the distinguished \nranking member of the committee. I won't be long. I will go ahead and \naddress this very important issue.\n  I begin my remarks by thanking the distinguished senior Senator from \nNew Mexico, Mr. Domenici, for his leadership in this area. He is one of \nour more knowledgeable Members. After years of watching him at play, I \nnow refer to him as our No. 1 utility player. Whatever the problem was, \nhe can be helpful. He is knowledgeable on budget issues, energy issues, \nand also has a practical side: Let's find a way to get it done. Once \nagain, he has done that with this bill.\n  I know he wants to work with his committee. I know he wants to work \nwith Members on both sides of the aisle. But I know more than anything \nelse he wants to do the right thing for our country. So I thank Senator \nDomenici for his leadership. He has agreed to do some things in ways he \nwould not do it if he could do it in a vacuum. But that is what \nleadership is all about. In the legislative process, you don't get it \n100 percent the way you want it. You have to give a little and get a \nlittle to do the right thing, to produce a product for the American \npeople. So that is the main reason I am here. I want to thank you for \nthat.\n\n  I also acknowledge the leadership and encouragement of Senator \nMartinez, the Senator from Florida, and others from Florida who have \nbeen helpful in this effort. I have a great admiration for Florida. It \nis more or less a neighboring State--a little bit of Alabama intervenes \nbetween my State, where I actually live, and the Panhandle of Florida--\nand I haven't been able to understand why they have been so opposed to \noil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico. I understand the concern \nabout coastal areas--the beaches. But there has to be a reasonable and \npractical way to protect the American people and their needs for this \nproduction, and shield our beaches and our tourist industry from harm.\n  It is easy to say: No, no, I am not going to have it at all. It takes \ncourage and leadership to say: Well, let's work this out in a way that \nwould be the right thing for our military bases in the Panhandle of \nFlorida, and for our tourist industries in Florida, Alabama, \nMississippi, Louisiana, and Texas--we all have that--and take advantage \nof the tremendous resource that will help the American people, that \nwill reduce our dependence on foreign oil. This is what this is all \nabout.\n  It is not just the prices at the pump today; it is about the long-\nterm plan. We have a problem here. It is a growing problem. Are we \ngoing to do something about it? This is a step in the right direction. \nThat is the message here. Will this bill solve the problem tomorrow? \nNo. It will have an impact almost immediately, because people will see \nwe have taken some action and they will act. And it probably will have \nsome impact on natural gas pretty quickly. But it is a clear statement \nto everyone that we realize there is a problem here and we are going to \ndo something about it.\n  So I thank Senator Martinez for stepping up. Senator Nelson has been \ninvolved, and I hope we are going to have a unified group of Senators \nfrom the entire Gulf of Mexico area to endorse this concept. We have \nworked at that. Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, \nhave met and talked on a bipartisan basis about doing the right thing. \nI have been proud to be a part of that.\n  Senator Landrieu of Louisiana has been relentless--relentless--has \nshe not, I ask the Senator?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You bet.\n  Mr. LOTT. She has worked this issue hard. Senator Vitter has made \nsure we have done it in the right way. He has looked at the language \nvery carefully. I commend them in particular. Their State has probably \nbeen more active involving this issue than any other Gulf States. Their \nState has also taken some of the negative impact--on the coastal \nareas--in recent years. Therefore, it is only right that they get a \nhigher percentage of the coastal impact fees and that they be \nrecognized for their effort. Senator Hutchison and Senator Cornyn, \nSenator Cochran, Senator Shelby and Senator Sessions also deserve to be \nrecognized. We have all been involved.\n  The next point I want to make is I don't quite understand why we are \nfinding it harder and harder to produce a result. It is has become so \nhard to be bipartisan. I admit it is almost impossible to get a \nbipartisan agreement that is bicameral. Maybe it is just a sign of the \ntimes; maybe it is the political season we are in which may be a little \nmore testy than normal. But here we have a perfect example of a \nbipartisan bill. A wide margin of you vote earlier on the motion to \nproceed to this bill, and we are now in the debate time on that. I \npredict when we get to the final vote, it once again will be \nbipartisan, probably higher than anybody would have thought. But this \nis the way it can happen. This is the way it should happen. So I am \nglad we are working in a bipartisan way.\n  I want to say: Look, we made some progress last year with our Energy \nPolicy Act of 2005. It didn't entirely address our energy needs, \nobviously, but it was a step in the right direction. Now, here is the \nnext step. For years, I have been stressing that our energy policy in \nthis country has to be balanced. I would prefer to produce our way out \nof our energy situation. I believe we can have more: more oil, more \ngas, more hydrogen, more nuclear, probably more wind and solar energy \ntoo. We can do it all. But I finally came to the conclusion we are not \ngoing to be able to just do one part of this equation; we are going to \nhave to produce more, we are going to have to conserve more, we are \ngoing to have to look for alternative fuels, and we are going to have \nto be innovative. I have made that concession. After all, it makes \nsense. Why don't we do the whole package?\n  That is what last year's Energy Policy Act began to do, it made some \nimprovements in nuclear and in hydrogen and alternative fuels. However, \nwe can't do all of those things instantly. Very few places are ready to \nbuild a new nuclear plant. My State of Mississippi may have been one of \nthe first to build a new nuclear reactor. That is great. We need to \nmove towards alternatives such as liquefied natural gas, and once \nagain, we have to build the facilities. And that won't happen tomorrow.\n  In the meantime, while we need to make stronger conservation efforts \nand come up with more alternatives and innovative ideas, and we need \nmore oil and gas. It is that simple. Now, we can get it some way or the \nother from Iraq, Venezuela, Nigeria, Iran or we can get our own safely. \nWhen I go to my State of Mississippi, people scratch their head and \nsay, why is it that people from a certain part of the United States are \ndetermined we are not going to get oil out of ANWR? What is it to them, \nand what does it mean to the country?\n  For whatever reason, without impugning anybody's motives, we haven't \ndone it. But we can do it in the gulf. We can do it in the Gulf of \nMexico because we know it can be done. We think it will be in the best \ninterests of our States and our people and we think it is in the best \ninterests of America. It is there, it can be obtained safely, miles off \nthe coast.\n\n  I want to emphasize right up front: This is not about putting oil \nrigs or\n\n[[Page S8231]]\n\nnatural gas wells within the sight of the beach, although there have \nbeen natural gas wells in plain view from my front porch in Pascagoula, \nMS. It is not about that. We do not want our beaches to be threatened. \nThis is going to be at least 100 miles away--in the case of Florida 125 \nmiles away from this 181 and the other areas we are going to open. I \nthink it can be done and it will produce very early results.\n  Look at what we are talking about here, freeing up 1\\1/4\\ billion \nbarrels of oil that we won't have to get from some unstable government \noverseas, and almost 6 trillion cubic feet of gas, that is huge. Others \nin this country ought to be willing to do the same thing in other \ncoastal areas. But I want to emphasize that this is not about any other \ncoastal area; this is just about our area. We are prepared to step out, \ndo the right thing for our country, take the risks. But we also want to \nget a little of the benefits, a little help in trying to deal with some \nof the problems we have in the coastal region.\n  By the way, one little aside: This bill will reduce the Federal \ndeficit by almost $1 billion over 10 years--$1 billion--probably more. \nI think all of the numbers are understated. I think we are going to get \nmore oil, more gas, more benefits, more money coming into the Federal \nTreasury and our States. We will do it without raising taxes or fees on \nanybody. So we get the benefit of additional supply, we get the benefit \nof impacting our Federal budget, drilling will produce hundreds of \njobs, good-paying jobs. I know the people who work on those rigs out \nthere in the Gulf of Mexico, and I know the kind of money they make. \nYes, they work hard and they take risks and they are away from their \nfamilies, but these will be good, new jobs for good, hard-working \npeople--people who need a little help right now, these are the people \nwho have been hammered by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  For decades, almost every dime generated from leasing of Gulf of \nMexico areas for oil and gas all came to Washington--all of it came to \nWashington. Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Alabama, the States \nwhich permit energy exploration off their coasts, reaped very little \nbenefit, but they incurred a lot of the risks, some of the damage and \nsome of the threats. We provide the infrastructure. These boats don't \njust take off from nowhere; they have to be built somewhere. All of \nthis goes on--it is not all perfect, let me be honest about that. There \nare certain challenges. So we feel there should be an equitable \ndistribution of the royalties from the Outer Continental Shelf to those \nof us who are on the front line.\n  For years States that allow energy production on Federal land receive \n50 percent of the Federal revenues from these activities. Those of us \nin the gulf: zip--other than what we get indirectly through the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund and through Federal largess, which, in our \narea, is not much.\n  So we think this is important. We are trying to stand up and do what \nwe think is right for our country, but we want to also do the right \nthing for our States. There is a coastal impact. We all know that. This \nis an acknowledgment of that. The Gulf States which will be producing \nthis would get under this agreement 37\\1/2\\ percent of the Federal \nrevenues from the new leases entered into after the date of enactment. \nTwelve and one-half percent, though, of the revenues would go to the \nFederal Land and Water Conservation Fund, for all of the States to use. \nWe are not greedy, but we want our fair share for a change. There was a \ntime when we wouldn't stand up, speak up, and fight for what is right \nfor our people. This time, we are going to. It is a win-win. It is \nright for our country and it is right for us. I think this is a good \narrangement.\n  The money that goes to the States--Senator Landrieu and I have felt \nit shouldn't all go to the States. Our State capitals and our State \nGovernors are quite often not from the marshes of Louisiana or the \nbeaches of Mississippi. We have to make them understand where we are \nand who we are. Once again, part of the problem over the years has been \nour own fault because the attitude in the south of Louisiana and the \nsouth of Mississippi is: Oh, well, we will do it ourselves. Well, we \nare trying to get a better rate. We are trying to make more sense. So \n20 percent will go to the coastal counties that are impacted.\n  I know the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, is here, and he \ncares about those areas. I want to tell him what these monies will be \ndedicated to. They will not be frivolously squandered on some project \nthat is not along the coastline. The funds are going to go to coastal \nconservation, coastal protection, and restoration. Hurricane \nprotection--hello--do we need to do that? By the way, if we don't do \nit, we know who is going to pay our bill because when we are flat on \nour back the Federal Government will have to come in again with \nhundreds of billions of dollars. Let's be proactive. Let's try to do a \nbetter job in protecting our coastal areas and our marshes. If we do \nnot take action, the impact on fisheries could be absolutely \ndetrimental. If you don't have these areas of brackish water, you are \nnot going to have the shrimp and the fish we have been trying to \ndevelop there. This money will provide for mitigation of natural \nresource damage.\n  I firmly believe this will have a great impact in our area. It is the \nright thing to do. These areas will be better, and in some instances \nthey will be restored. Louisiana is losing land every hour, and \nalthough we may not have that big a problem in Mississippi yet, this \nproblem is only going to get worse. We can take action to protect the \nfuture.\n  We have a chance to do some innovative work. In my State of \nMississippi, we are not trying to put things back as they were before \nHurricane Katrina; we want them to be better. We are coming up with \ninnovative ideas. We are thinking about how can we be better prepared \nto withstand a hurricane. These funds will make a huge difference in \nthe long run.\n  I want to make this clear: I think this is a great effort that we \nwill all be able to point to in the future and say that we did \nsomething great. This is something that will make a difference. We will \nbe saying to the American people: We understand your pain, we feel it, \nand we are taking steps to do something about it.\n\n  This will not be the last effort. We are going to have to do more. \nBut now is the time to do this. Now is when the people are suffering \ndue to higher prices for oil and for natural gas. It has made it very \ndifficult for people. This legislation will reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil, it will help us with our budget needs, it will provide \nmore money to protect natural resources, and it will bring much needed \nfunds and jobs to the gulf area which was hammered by Katrina and Rita. \nThis is truly a plan which Congress should pass and be proud of and the \nPresident should adopt.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues as we go forward in the \nnext couple of days to complete action on this important legislation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Obviously, people who have the time to look at this believe \nit has been a very unfair situation, one that for some reason or \nanother we have tolerated for years. When they realize the way it is \nhandled in other parts of the country, they feel very strongly it is \ntime we step up and get some benefit.\n  It is also further exaggerated and exacerbated by the fact that if we \nbelieve that we are on the line, dealing with all the costs and all the \npotential problems that could go along with this, we ought to get some \nof the benefits so we can prepare for that.\n  I want to say that the people in the Senate and the American people \nhave been very concerned, sympathetic, and helpful to us after the \nhurricane. But they know we have coastal impact problems. We need to \naddress some of those problems now, not later, because they have become \nvery serious. There are areas we are losing that are basically going \ninto the Gulf of Mexico, and we can also take steps to preserve what we \nhave and to better prepare for hurricanes, use for protection and \nmitigation for the future.\n  The people feel very strongly about it. It is not just our Governors \nwho see this obviously as one way to help us deal with the future needs \nwe have, but also just the rank-and-file people. We understand we need \nto get it done.\n  This proposal, which would give our Gulf States some share for our \ncoastal impact, will give us the benefit of getting some help. Also, \nthe people understand this is something we need to do for our country \nand are willing to do it\n\n[[Page S8232]]\n\nin the gulf. I wish the rest of the country would follow our lead. \nHowever, we are not going to fuss about that, we are just going to step \nup and do the job.\n  Our people do feel very strongly about it. They believe we have not \nbeen treated fairly and it is time to do something about it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on the two sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico controls 2 hours \n23 minutes, and the majority controls 1 hour 50 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me speak for a few minutes to give my view of the \nlegislation.\n  First, let me just say energy issues are very much on the minds of \nthe American people. Rightly so. We have oil trading at above $75 a \nbarrel. We have the price of gas at the pump above $3 in most parts of \nthis country today. Clearly there are a lot of explanations for that, \nbut that is part of the reason we should be focusing on this set of \nissues.\n  We have high and growing demand for energy in the world. We have high \nprices because not only do we have high demand, we have constrained \nsupply, and we have great uncertainty in the world. All of that affects \nthe price of oil and the price of natural gas as well. Whether the \nuncertainty is in the Middle East, whether it is in the Nigerian Delta, \nwhether it is threats of curtailed imports from Venezuela--there are \nall kinds of reasons the price of oil is high.\n  We need to focus on how do we begin to pursue a strategy that helps \nsolve these problems. The truth is, our country is on the wrong track \nwhen it comes to oil and gas. According to the Energy Information \nAdministration Annual Energy Outlook, our projected future demand for \noil and natural gas is going to far outstrip our domestic production \ncapabilities, and that circumstance is getting worse, not better. All \nof the projections are that after the passage of this bill, it will \ncontinue to get worse, not better.\n  We have the opportunity, the Members of the Senate and Members of \nCongress, to try to make some decisions to get the supply/demand \nequation better into balance. How can we use oil and gas more \nefficiently and thereby need less than the projections would indicate \nwe might wind up needing? How do we substitute the alternative fuels in \nour energy mix on a faster basis, on an accelerated basis? How do we \nproduce more and how do we find ways to be more efficient?\n\n  A year ago this coming Saturday, we had final passage of the \ncomprehensive Energy bill we passed last year, the Energy Policy Act of \n2005. On balance, I believe--I still believe and believed at that \ntime--that was a good piece of legislation. Mr. President, 74 Senators \nvoted for it. We had a majority of Republicans voting for it. We had a \nmajority of Democrats voting for it. The bill was put together on a \nbipartisan basis in the Senate Energy Committee under the leadership of \nits chairman, Senator Domenici, from my home State of New Mexico.\n  When the bill came to the floor, of course, Senators on all sides of \nthe many issues in that bill were given an opportunity to bring their \namendments to the floor, to debate those amendments, to have them voted \non, and despite the broad sweep of that legislation, we completed that \nprocess in 2 weeks.\n  After passage of the bill, we went ahead and had a very fair and open \nand inclusive conference with the House of Representatives that \nresulted in a conference report that enjoyed broad, bipartisan support.\n  The Energy Policy Act addressed energy production. It addressed \nenergy conservation. It addressed energy technology and renewable \nenergy, and it addressed oil and gas and coastal impact assistance, \nincluding assistance to the States which are most interested in this \nlegislation. It made significant strides in the right direction on a \nhost of issues.\n  I had hoped, frankly, that we could continue to move forward in the \nenergy policy area this year by acting on a series of measures to \naddress the remaining issues. There are clearly remaining issues that \nneed attention. One of those is the lack of effective steps to increase \nefficiency in the use of oil and natural gas.\n  We did not do what we should have done in last year's Energy bill to \ndeal with that issue. The Senate version of the bill had some good \nideas in it. Unfortunately, they were dropped in the conference. We \nwere not able to persuade the House to agree to those. For that reason, \nthis past May, I joined with a bipartisan group here in the Senate to \nintroduce S. 2747, the Enhanced Energy Security Act. That bill \naddresses oil savings and alternative fuel infrastructure and provides \nfor a renewable portfolio standard and various other efficiency and \nconservation measures.\n  Another energy measure I hoped we could act on this year is S. 2253. \nThat is the bill which would have required the Secretary of the \nInterior to offer for lease lands within this original lease sale 181 \narea we have been discussing as part of this legislation. Early this \nyear, I joined with Senator Domenici to develop and introduce the bill \non a bipartisan basis. The bill would have opened portions of the \noriginal lease sale 181 area that had been proposed for leasing in 1997 \nby the Clinton administration. That proposal by the Clinton \nadministration was made after negotiations with then-Governor Lawton \nChiles, our former colleague here in the Senate, Governor Lawton Chiles \nfrom Florida.\n  Those areas had been taken off limits by a decision by the Bush \nadministration. I think some may not realize that we would not even be \nhere today talking about opening lease sale 181 for possible drilling \nif the Bush administration had followed through on the Clinton \nadministration's schedule for leasing. They proposed to do that, and it \nwas on their schedule when this administration came into office.\n  The bill Senator Domenici and I introduced did nothing to affect \nareas under congressional moratoria or areas that had been withdrawn by \nPresidential decree or order. No part of the area to be leased was \ncloser than 100 miles from any point in Florida.\n  We have a map here that will give people an idea of what was involved \nwith lease sale 181. This is the bill which was reported out of the \nEnergy Committee with bipartisan support. You can see the line there, \nwhich is the 100-mile line, showing we are not getting within 100 miles \nof Florida and showing the additional area that would be open for \nleasing.\n  I should point out that between the time Senator Domenici and I \nintroduced S. 2253 and the date our committee had a hearing on that \nbill, the administration published its own draft proposed program for \noil and gas leasing for the period 2007 through 2012. That 5-year plan \ncalled for a lease sale in the 181 area in the fall of 2007. The area \nthe administration proposed for leasing contained about 3.07 trillion \ncubic feet of natural gas and 620 million barrels of oil.\n  The current state of play under current law is that even if this \nlegislation does not become law, the administration plans to open that \narea for leasing beginning in the fall of 2007. It was good news when \nwe learned the administration intended to proceed to lease this new \narea. It meant that a substantial new development of oil and gas would \ntake place even if we didn't succeed with the bill Senator Domenici and \nI introduced.\n  At the hearing we had on S. 2253, I asked the Director of the \nMinerals Management Service, which is the agency with responsibility \nfor this leasing, Ms. Johnnie Burton, whether the administration's \nplans would wind up coinciding with what the bill envisioned if passage \nof the bill was delayed. She replied that that certainly would be the \ncase.\n  After the Energy Committee reported the bill in early March, we \nreceived additional evidence that the plans for leasing new areas in \nthis draft 5-year plan were on fairly solid ground, and the new \nevidence was that the Congressional Budget Office booked the expected \nrevenues from royalties and bonus bids in the budget baseline for this \n10-year period, 2006 through 2016.\n  Even though a good portion of the oil and gas contemplated in the \noriginal bill reported by the Energy Committee was incorporated into \nthe developing plans of the Minerals Management Service, I thought it \nmade sense that with the balance of the initial area\n\n[[Page S8233]]\n\nopened by S. 2253, we go ahead with the bill and try to enact it. \nUnfortunately, at least from my perspective, events since the committee \nreported the bill to the full Senate have changed the bill in very \nsubstantial ways. In my view, this is not the bill that we worked on in \ncommittee. Several of our colleagues in the Senate took the position \nthat S. 2253 should not move forward without certain modifications.\n  My colleagues from Florida expressed a desire for a long-term \nmoratorium off the coasts of their State. My colleagues from other Gulf \nCoast States indicated that they would object to S. 2253 being \nconsidered without those States receiving a fixed percentage of the \nrevenues from the oil and gas produced in the Federal Outer Continental \nShelf off their coasts.\n  Both of these demands, which were satisfied in this bill, which has \nnow come to the Senate floor, S. 3711, in my view, have undermined the \ngoals of the original bill. Because S. 3711, which is the bill now \npending in the Senate, locks up vast areas of the Outer Continental \nShelf off Florida, and because the bill provides for the ceding to 4 of \nour 50 States billions of dollars of Federal revenues, I find myself in \nthe position of having to oppose the bill.\n  The chairman of the Energy Committee will point out that S. 3711 \nopens two new areas in the Gulf of Mexico. That is true. Beyond the \narea proposed for opening by the new 5-year plan that I talked about, \nMinerals Management Service, S. 3711 opens a triangular sliver in the \narea known as ``the bulge.'' You can see that sort of orange area on \nhere. That is new under this legislation. The legislation also opens \nthe so-called 181 south area, which is currently under a congressional \nmoratorium that expires this September 30.\n  There is also a Presidential withdrawal for that area which is 181 \nsouth. That is the lighter orange area down below the area that we have \nbeen talking about.\n  In order to get these additional resources that are provided for in \nthis bill, which amounts to 2.76 trillion cubic feet of gas, S. 2711 \nputs 21.83 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in the eastern Gulf of \nMexico off limits until 2022.\n  I don't think it is a very good trade for the people of America for \nus to give up access to 21 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in order \nto gain access to 2.76 trillion cubic feet. Some of that 21 trillion \ncubic feet of natural gas that is being put under a 16-year moratorium \nin this bill is in areas that have never been controversial in \nCongress. These areas were part of the original lease sale 181 area \nthat every annual congressional moratorium had exempted.\n  We are talking about this entire yellow area. I think this chart is \nvery similar to the chart that the Senator from Florida, Mr. Martinez, \nhas been using. It shows a very much larger area that is being \nsubjected to this 16-year moratorium than we have ever put under \nmoratorium before.\n  These yellow moratorium areas that are within the blue of the \noriginal lease sale 181 area shown on the chart, these three resource-\nrich areas are not now under moratorium. If Congress does not enact S. \n3711, these areas could be leased under the next 5-year plan, if the \nadministration decided to include them, instead of being locked up \nuntil 2022.\n  Let me, also, for a moment show a chart that our colleague, Senator \nCraig, was using earlier this afternoon. He has a chart showing what is \nhappening south of the area that we are locking up for the next 16 \nyears. This is the thatched area down near Cuba. I think looking at his \nchart sort of brings home the unfortunate handicap we are putting \nourselves under with this legislation. In fact, Senator Craig's bill, \nof which I am a cosponsor, would allow U.S. oil companies to \nparticipate in the development of this thatched area, the oil and gas \nresources in this thatched area down near Cuba, some of which is as \nclose as 50 miles from the State of Florida. But at the same time in \nthis legislation, we are saying we are going to prohibit drilling for \nthe next 16 years in areas as far as 230 miles from the State of \nFlorida. To my mind, that doesn't make good sense.\n  It would be ironic if Cuba proceeded with drilling in its waters to \nextract at least 4 billion barrels of oil under its territory, while at \nsame time we were passing legislation saying there would be no drilling \nin the waters we control through 2022. That is exactly what this \nlegislation says.\n  Referring again to Senator Craig's statement, he talked about the \n``no zone''--the large ``no zone'' all around the country, where nobody \nwants to allow drilling. I will say we are adding to the ``no zone'' \nvery substantially with this legislation by putting in this yellow area \nareas that had not been subject to moratorium and certainly have not \nbeen subject to anything such as a 16-year moratorium, as we are about \nto enact here.\n\n  In addition to being bad energy supply policy for the long term, S. \n3711 is also, in my view, bad fiscal and budgetary policy for the long \nterm.\n  The bill directs, as I think many have mentioned, 37.5 percent of \nrevenues from new leases to the four States, Texas, Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Alabama. Starting in 2017, a second royalty diversion \nusing the same percentage would be applied to new leases in existing \nareas of the Gulf of Mexico open to production.\n  We have a chart which makes the case as to what we are talking about. \nWe are saying, in the western Gulf of Mexico and the middle Gulf of \nMexico, that we are, in fact, going to cede 37.5 percent of the \nroyalties from production on new wells in those areas to these four \nStates as well; that those are funds which otherwise would go into the \nFederal Treasury.\n  In order to avoid a point of order under the Budget Act, S. 3711 \npurports to cap the revenue sharing, from 2016 to 2035, at $500 million \nper year. And then it has a very interesting provision. It says ``net \nof receipts.'' Rather than actually capping the revenue sharing, the \nbill allows receipts from the 181 and the 181 south area to be added to \nthe $500 million cap. That makes the so-called cap, in my view, at \nleast much higher. However, even with the cap, the amount flowing to \nthe four Gulf States is estimated to be somewhere between $27.5 billion \nand $30.5 billion during this period. After 2056, the full entitlement \ncomes into play with estimated losses to the Federal Treasury of \nbetween $12.5 billion per year and $15 billion in 2056 alone.\n  This underscores the point which people need to understand--that this \nlegislation calls for this sharing of revenue or ceding of revenue to \nthese four States in perpetuity. This is not in any way sunset. There \nis no time limit. This is from now on. The legislation says these \nStates will be entitled to the money.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have strongly opposed diverting \nrevenues from the Outer Continental Shelf. It is clear to me, in \nreading the history of this country and the laws of this country, that \nthis is a Federal asset and that ceding of these revenues to State and \ncounty treasuries of coastal States is bad policy. The resources of the \nOuter Continental Shelf belong to the entire Nation. Over the years, \nthere have been several attempts by coastal States to assert some form \nof ownership rights over the Outer Continental Shelf. In the 1940s, \ncoastal States tried to issue leases to oil companies in these Federal \nwaters. That led to a landmark decision in our Supreme Court in 1947. \nThe Supreme Court ruled in 1947 that offshore lands were, and always \nhad been, owned by the United States as a feature of its national \nsovereignty.\n  Having been stopped by the courts, the States turned to Congress to \nrequest that it turn these so-called submerged lands over to the States \nthemselves. President Truman strongly objected to this. He vetoed the \nlegislation that was sent to him. Let me read the quotation from his \nveto statement. He said that he could not:\n\n     approve this joint resolution because it would turn over to \n     certain States as a free gift very valuable lands and mineral \n     resources of the United States as a whole; that is, all the \n     people of the country. I do not believe such an action would \n     be in the national interest. I do not see how any President \n     could fail to oppose it.\n\n  That was the basis for his very veto.\n  President Truman left office and Eisenhower took a different view. He \nsigned the Submerged Lands Act of 1954 that granted the coastal States \ntitle to submerged lands within 3 miles of their coasts.\n  Later that year, Congress also passed the Outer Continental Shelf \nLands Act, asserting Federal control over the subsoil and the seabed of \nthe Outer Continental Shelf. The legislative history of\n\n[[Page S8234]]\n\nthese acts is clear. They were intended as a final settlement of the \nissue of who owned what on the Federal Outer Continental Shelf.\n  In recent years, as the resources of State waters which were granted \nunder the 1953 act have been depleted, and as the great resource \npotential of the Federal waters has come into full review, a new \ndrumbeat has arisen. The claim is that coastal States should have a \npreferential share of the resources of the Outer Continental Shelf over \nand above other States that, under current law, are equally entitled to \nthese receipts, and under the Supreme Court's view are entitled to \nthese receipts.\n  We are not talking about trivial sums of money. Oil and gas receipts \nfrom the Outer Continental Shelf are the third largest source of income \nto the United States after taxes and Customs duties.\n  Over the next several decades, it is estimated that oil and gas \nroyalties from the Outer Continental Shelf will exceed $1.2 trillion. \nAs we look to the future, a future in which we will have large bills \ncoming due at the Federal level, with the retirement of the baby boomer \ngeneration, it is unwise, in my opinion, to consider permanently \ndiverting these revenues away from the Federal Treasury to these four \ncoastal States.\n  I have often heard the argument that we ought to give a percentage of \nFederal royalties to the Outer Continental Shelf, to the nearby States \nbecause Western States, such as my own, New Mexico, receive a portion \nof the royalties from the Federal lands within their borders.\n  Let me address what I believe is a false comparison head on. The \nfirst obvious point is that the Mineral Leasing Act which has been \nadopted made provisions for my State to receive 50 percent of the \nroyalties for production on Federal lands. This Mineral Leasing Act \ndoes not discriminate against Louisiana, Mississippi, or any other \ncoastal State. To the extent that the Federal Government reduces oil \nand gas and collects royalties on Federal land within their borders, \nthe Federal Government pays 50 percent of those revenues to the States \njust as they do in my State, just as they do in Wyoming, just as they \ndo in every other State in the Union.\n  Indeed, according to the Minerals Management Service, between 1982 \nand 2003 the Federal Government distributed $14.8 million to Louisiana \nfrom onshore Federal leases under the Mineral Leasing Act. The reason \nLouisiana did not get more was because there is very little Federal \nland in Louisiana that produces oil and gas. Most onshore oil and gas \ndevelopment in Louisiana takes place on State or private land and not \non Federal land.\n  Louisiana, like any other State, receives 50 percent of the royalties \ncollected by the Federal Government from Federal oil and gas leases. \nWestern States, such as New Mexico, and eastern States have very \ndifferent histories when it comes to patterns of life ownership. A long \ntime ago, in the 19th century, a large part of States such as Louisiana \nconsisted of public land. But the laws at that time allowed that \nFederal land to be patented and bought into private ownership or given \nto the State where it now forms the tax base for those States. That \nexplains why there is relatively little Federal land in a State such as \nLouisiana. The State enjoys the ability to levee taxes, including \nseverance taxes on all the oil and gas that is produced within the \nState, which is considerable.\n  The development of the western States took a very different turn in \n1920 when it became clear that there was a significant amount of \nFederal land that had oil and gas potential. Instead of allowing that \nland to be patented and brought into private ownership under the mining \nlaws, as had happened in earlier years in States further east, Congress \npassed a new law--and that is the Mineral Leasing Act I was just \nreferring to. This act forges a very different bargain.\n  In return for keeping the lands with rich oil and gas resources under \nFederal ownership, therefore, out of the State's tax base, the Federal \nGovernment agreed to give the States a share of the Federal royalties \nas compensation for the lost tax revenue involved. This compromise \nrepresented no injustice to any State that had previously had all of \nits Federal lands converted into private land through land patents. \nThese eastern States already had what the western States were giving \nup; that is, the ability to tax all of the economic activity within \ntheir borders.\n  If you read the legislative history of the Mineral Leasing Act of \n1920, it is clear that the split of revenues between the Federal \nGovernment and the State governments was in compensation for removing \nlands from the tax base of the States.\n  So when you recognize the reason for the 50-50 split of royalties on \nFederal lands within the boundaries of States under the Mineral Leasing \nAct, it is clear to me that transposing this system to the Outer \nContinental Shelf makes absolutely no sense. Federal ownership of the \nOuter Continental Shelf takes nothing away from the tax base of any \ncoastal State. To the contrary, Federal development of national assets \non the Outer Continental Shelf actually results in enhanced economic \nactivity, increased tax revenues in adjacent coastal States.\n  One report that illustrates this fact is published in 2002 by \nLouisiana Midcontinent Oil and Gas Association. It is entitled ``The \nEnergy Sector Still A Giant Economic Engine for the Louisiana \nEconomy.'' That title is a pretty good thumbnail description of the \ntrue impact Outer Continental Shelf activity has on the Gulf Coast \nStates. That activity is a giant engine for their economies.\n  Here are some of the facts in that report. The report says the energy \nsector has a $93 billion impact in Louisiana and employs 62,000 people. \nThe energy sector in Louisiana supports $12.5 billion in household \nearnings. It pays $1.14 billion in State taxes. Workers employed by the \noffshore oil and gas industry can expect to earn salaries between \n$75,000 and $100,000 a year. That was in 2002 when the report was \nissued. Oil exploration and production value-added income already \nexceeds $17 billion and refined value-added income is nearly $5 \nbillion.\n  The same facts can be told for each of the coastal States that border \nthe Gulf of Mexico. They derive substantial economic benefit from their \nstrategic location next to these oil and gas deposits that are still \nowned by the United States.\n  For these reasons, I cannot support the current proposal to set in \nmotion a permanent and a very large diversion of Federal royalties from \nthe Outer Continental Shelf to these four States. I am sympathetic to \nthe environmental damage that has been caused over the years to coastal \nwetlands. Much of that damage in the past was from causes other than \noil and gas activities. An important source of the future threat is \nfrom factors such as global warming.\n\n  Last year, in the Energy Policy Act, we enacted a Coastal Impact \nAssistance Program that directed $1 billion be paid as mandatory \nspending over 4 years to the Gulf Coast States. I strongly supported \nthat measure. I have strongly supported funding for reconstruction of \nthe gulf coast in the tragic aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita \nlast summer.\n  The policy rationale for the permanent revenue diversion proposed in \nthis bill, in my opinion, is highly flawed, just as the energy policy \nrationale for the bill is also flawed. If you want to have a strong and \nfiscally solvent Federal Government, you need to be very careful about \nnew spending entitlements and claims on Federal revenues being created \nby the Congress. The provisions of this bill do not reflect that kind \nof concern.\n  If we are to cope with the rising demand for energy, and particularly \nfor natural gas, we must also approach that matter. Strictly giving up, \nfor the long term, access to 21 trillion cubic feet of natural gas just \nto obtain just over 2 trillion cubic feet is shortsighted, in my view. \nUndertaking to solve our long-term problems with natural gas supply and \ndemand by focusing just on the supply side I also see as shortsighted.\n  Let me talk a little bit about the precedent of what we are doing. I \nsee that as another and somewhat separate reason for opposing this \nlegislation. S. 3711 sets bad precedent both in the energy policy area \nand in the fiscal policy area. There is no reason I can think of why \ncoastal States up and down our seaboards will not demand the same kinds \nof treatment being demanded by the States that are insistent upon the \nprovisions in this legislation.\n\n[[Page S8235]]\n\n  Let me put up the chart that shows what we are talking about. The \nOuter Continental Shelf is the blue area surrounding the country. Of \ncourse, this bill just deals with the gulf. We all understand that. But \nlet's just think about the precedent we are setting that will come back \nto haunt us when we have this issue revisited in the future.\n  My sincere concern is that if we take the steps that we are proposing \nto take in this legislation that lock up Florida until 2022, or the \nareas off the coast of Florida going out at least 125 miles until 2022, \nwe are well on our way to making these other resources unavailable also \nuntil 2022.\n  We are also setting a bad precedent in the fiscal arena, as well. \nWhere production is allowed, other States are likely to demand the \ntreatment that we are here affording to Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, \nand Alabama.\n  Take Alaska, for example. If you do a little reading on where our \nundeveloped natural gas and oil resources are, much of it is off the \ncoast of Alaska. The Federal Outer Continental Shelf off the coast of \nAlaska covers a vast area, some 600 million acres. The Outer \nContinental Shelf off Alaska's coast is more than twice the size of \nAlaska itself.\n  To give an idea of the immensity of this OCS area, the onshore lands \nof the State of Alaska comprise some 366 million acres. The Federal \nOuter Continental Shelf off Alaska contains vast resources, an \nestimated 26.6 billion barrels of oil, and 132 trillion cubic feet of \ngas.\n  If we start down this road, as this bill does, in my opinion, with \nrespect to the Gulf Coast States, we will certainly be asked to give \n37.5 percent of the revenues of producing these Federal resources off \nAlaska's coast to the State of Alaska. In fact, such a proposal has \nalready been developed. Other States are likely to follow. This is a \nprecedent that I think we will all come to regret.\n  I know there are strong feelings on the other side of this issue. I \nunderstand the sentiments that some have, but I am persuaded this is \nbad energy policy for the country, that this is bad fiscal policy for \nthe country, and I hope that we are able to make some changes in this \nlegislation before we finally dispose of it so we can correct these \nproblems.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will yield quickly, but I want to try \nto get the record straight with Senators so they will know where we are \ntimewise. We are in postcloture where every Senator has a certain \namount of time. By consent today, we are taking 6 hours, 3 hours to \nthose in favor and 3 hours to those against. I am in charge of the 3 \nhours in favor, and Senator Bingaman, so far, has been the only one who \nhas spoken. But he is in charge of the time on the opposition. He might \ngive us some of his 3 hours today if we run out, or we would ask the \nleader. I have a lot of speakers.\n  In any event, Senator Bond asked to be next. He is here. Senator \nSessions is speaking for our side. We will go back and forth. Senator \nSessions asked he be next on our side. And the senior Senator from \nAlabama who is here, also, would like to speak next.\n  How much time does Senator Bond want?\n  Mr. BOND. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Sessions?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Shelby?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Ten minutes. I will try to do it in less.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have 1 hour 50 minutes; is that right? And Senator \nBingaman has how much?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). One hour forty-five minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Landrieu wants to speak 10 or 15 minutes. We \nwill welcome that. If we add that up, we have plenty of time.\n  I want the Senators to know we have a schedule. It is not me; Members \nhave to follow each other.\n  I take a minute and say to Senator Bingaman, I am not going to answer \nnow the detailed allegations today. I think two or three are \nsignificant, but I am just going to say to the Senate I have the most \nrespect for my colleague. I think everyone knows we work together, \nshoulder to shoulder. It is good to work with him. I think he must feel \nthe same. We got something great done.\n  However, I believe there is one flaw in the argument that is \nimperative. That is, plain and simple, do you want to hang tight with \nan ideology of the past and get no bill and no new development or do \nyou want to adjust to change and get something significant?\n\n  Now, he might not agree, my friend might not agree that I am correct \nin saying what we are getting, but I truly believe the final product of \nthe path we were going to follow--which was to not share the revenue; \nand we had not made any arrangement with Florida--was doomed to yield \nnothing, and we would be back where we were.\n  Secondly, if we want to wait around for MMS to do their plans and \nassume that they end up with what they started with, then just look at \nhistory. They hardly ever come out anywhere close to what they started \nwith, and they probably would have done it again on this one. We are \nbetter off, in my opinion, adjusting a bit to the reality of getting \nsomething real than to stand rigid on the philosophy of the past.\n  Revenues: If you do not drill, you do not get any revenues. We have \nbeen in a no-drill posture for the American Treasury for almost 20 \nyears. I do not know how many more years we will be with no revenues \nand no drilling, so I am not worried about the fiscal policy because I \nam worried about the effect on the economy and on people of not using \nthe resource.\n  I can hardly measure that, I say to Senator Bond. It is too big for \nme to measure as a budgeteer. So I wanted to make that point just in \nkind of a summary manner, which is part of what my friend and great \ncolleague has been arguing in derogation of this bill on the Senate \nfloor.\n  Then I had one more observation. As to the big piece of land we are \nnot going to be able to drill in in the future that my friend has \nalluded to, if you just look at that map, the perpendicular line is a \nline established in a letter from the military which said they needed, \nfor future use, everything beyond that line. And everybody had been \nagreeing we would not, without the military's consent, ever drill \nthere. And that is essentially why most of that property is off limits. \nNow, there is more to the story than that, but that is the biggest \nportion of the story.\n  Having said that, I would certainly like to say to my colleague, \nSenator Bingaman, I trust that we are back together soon to get another \ngreat Energy bill; and we will. I would feel much better if you and I \nwere together on this, but I feel just as confident, or more so than I \ndid on the Energy bill, that the way to get Outer Continental Shelf \ndrilling is to start with this new precedent and get it going. And I \nthink the ball will roll. If you get this, you will get offshore \ndrilling in real quantities. You will get more than ever to the \nTreasury and more than ever to the bounty of production. That is what \nthe real ball game is about. And you either do something like that or \nyou sit around and wish. We have been wishing, and it never happens.\n  So with that, I yield to Senators. I will be off the floor. You can \ntake time in your sequence. I will come back in an hour and a half or \nso, and if there is time, I will wrap up this afternoon.\n  Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I just ask that my and Senator Shelby's \ntime slots be reversed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. He has another appointment, and I would be glad to \nyield to him and take the slot you originally had for Senator Shelby.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure. Senator Shelby would go right after Senator Bond \non the proponents list. And they would be followed by Senator Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, could I just indicate for my colleague, \nI appreciate his comments. We do have a couple of Senators who are in \nopposition who are coming to the floor and will wish to speak, too, at \nsome stage. I do not want to line up so many proponents that they are \nnot able to make their statements within a reasonable period of time. \nSo if we can fit them in at some stage in the proceedings, that would \nbe great, as soon as they arrive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me say to my colleague, that is \nfine. I\n\n[[Page S8236]]\n\nnoted your staff had apparently gone and checked, and there might be \nsomebody. I would like to ask that they let you know as soon as \npossible so you do not have people with the expectation of being next \nbecause they are right here, and all of a sudden somebody drops in and \nsays: I am next because I am in opposition. I think that would be a \nlittle unfair. I wish the Senator would work with us on that.\n  All right, having said that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to offer a compromise and support a \ncompromise. I have agreed to limit my remarks to 7 minutes in the hope, \nhowever faint it might be, that people might listen to me.\n  Secondly, I am here to support a compromise. I am here to support a \ncompromise led by our good friend, Chairman Domenici, involving the \noccupant of the Chair, the Senator from Louisiana, and a distinguished \nbipartisan group of Senators who are coming together to bring out a \ncompromise that is going to solve a major problem.\n  We hear--on the floor, and wherever politicians gather, and pundits \ngather, and at coffee shops--people complain about the high cost of \ngasoline, the high price of natural gas, and our unhealthy dependence \non foreign oil. Well, my gosh, they are all right. They are all \ncorrect. We are importing over 60 percent of our petroleum.\n  We hear lots of people pontificate about the skyrocketing costs of \nnatural gas, heating homes, and how that affects the need for low-\nincome heating assistance programs, and how it squeezes all of us who, \nlike me, depend upon natural gas to heat a house. Once again they are \nright. Over the last few years, natural gas prices in America have been \nsome of the most expensive in the world. Some people cry out for the \nneed to do something to reduce these high oil and gas prices.\n  Well, in the past, when it has come down to it, too many people have \nstood up and said: No, we are not going to do it. The reasons range \nfrom ``not in my backyard''--they do not want anything produced right \nnear them, whether it is oil or minerals or a manufacturing process--\nthat is called the NIMBY approach. Others are pushing environmental \nconcerns to the extreme, not realizing that modern-day exploration of \noil and gas is done with new techniques that are designed to be as \nfriendly to the environment as possible. Then of course, there are \nothers who think that high gas prices make a great campaign issue in an \nelection year, and that it is in their best interest to do nothing \nbefore November.\n  Well, there is a way to begin to reduce the price of oil and natural \ngas; and that is to increase domestic supplies. Let me point out to my \ncolleagues that for all the laws we pass, we have not been able to \nrepeal the law of supply and demand. If you have more demand than you \nhave supply, the cost goes up. And that is what we have.\n  Now, we are trying to reduce the demand by conservation, but people \ncontinue to make choices, and the economy grows. Not only our economy \ngrows, but the economies of India and China, which are putting real \npressure on demand, grow faster. But we are not keeping up with the \ndemand from production in the United States. Thus, our percentage of \ncontribution to supply continues to decline.\n  The area specified in S. 3711 will open up 8.3 million acres of the \nOuter Continental Shelf for oil and gas leasing as soon as practicable, \nbut no later than one year from the date of enactment. This area, which \nincludes Lease 181 and an area south of Lease 181, is estimated to \ncontain roughly 1.26 billion barrels of oil and 5.8 trillion cubic feet \nof natural gas. The natural gas supply alone made available under this \nbill is enough to heat and cool 6 million homes for 15 years. That is a \ngood start. We would like to have more, but with the demand for energy \nso high, and the supply limited, we need to take what steps we can.\n  With the price of gasoline over $3 a gallon, all of us are looking at \nthe need to conserve, and that is one way we can make a difference: \nstop driving so much, carpool, walk. People still get there. I used to \nwalk to school, ride a bicycle to school. That is not a bad idea for a \nlot of kids. It keeps you in better shape.\n  In addition to the growing demand for energy, disruptions in supply \ndue to geopolitical instability in the middle east and South America \nhave caused energy prices to spike upward. All of these factors have \ncaused the price of gasoline to increase by over 125 percent since \n2000. As fighting continues in the Middle East and political \ninstability remains in South America and North Africa, energy analysts \nwarn that $100 barrel oil could indeed be a reality in the future.\n  The situation with natural gas is no different. To say that we are in \na natural gas crisis is an understatement. Why is this the case? Again, \nthe answer is quite simple. Over the years demand for natural gas has \nskyrocketed while domestic supplies have dwindled. And when that \nhappens, simple economics tells us that prices soar as they have in \nrecent years for natural gas.\n  We have a lot of demand for natural gas because of the increasing \ndemand for this resource in the generation of electricity. More and \nmore electric utility generation plants have been forced to switch to \nnatural gas. Natural gas is also in short supply because of all the \nrestrictions on its production and delivery, including restrictions on \naccess to these gas supplies and strict environmental regulations, \nwhich have pushed a massive expansion of natural gas usage as opposed \nto the use other energy resources such as coal.\n  According to a Wall Street Journal editorial, there has been a 40-\npercent increase in the use of natural gas since 1986, and that \naccounts for nearly 25 percent of our energy. And it is set to increase \nby another 40 percent by 2025. We cannot afford to do that. Our \nproduction of natural gas has fallen from 19.2 trillion cubic feet to \n18.2 trillion cubic feet. That is a 7.2-percent decline. We cannot \nafford to do that.\n  We need to liquefy and gasify coal so coal gas can fit in, too. That \nis some ways down the line. But in the meantime, we have to go ahead \nwith lease 181 and the adjacent areas.\n  Price increases hurt our economy. They hurt people who drive cars. \nU.S. consumers spent $200 billion on natural gas in 2005, which is four \ntimes as much as we spent in 1999. This has caused both Federal Reserve \nChairmen Greenspan and Bernanke to repeatedly warn that ``natural gas \nbottlenecks endanger economic expansion'' and ``pose risks to both \neconomic activity and inflation.''\n  High natural gas prices cost us manufacturing jobs. The National \nAssociation of Manufacturers says that roughly 3 million manufacturing \njobs have been lost due in large part to natural gas price increases. \nChemical plants are moving overseas along with and fertilizer plants.\n  According to the U.S. Chemistry Council, it is estimated that from \n2000 to 2005, the chemical industry saw the loss of 100,000 jobs and \n$50 billion to overseas competition. Furthermore, the magazine Business \nWeek reported that of the 120 major chemical facilities in the planning \nand construction stages around the world, only one is in the United \nStates--50 plants are going up in China.\n\n  Job loss due to increased natural gas prices has also had a \ndevastating impact on the fertilizer industry because natural gas is a \nkey component in the production of nitrogen fertilizer. Late last year, \nFord B. West of the Fertilizer Institute informed the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Interior that sixteen U.S. production \nfacilities have closed permanently and an additional five have been \nidled due to rising natural gas prices--this represents a 35 percent \ndecline in U.S. fertilizer production\n  The agricultural sector is also taking it on the chops. The president \nof the Missouri Farm Bureau, Charlie Kruse, on March 17, 2005, \ntestified that in the last 4 years, the retail nitrogen fertilizer \nprices, because of the shortage of the supply of natural gas, have \nskyrocketed from $100 per ton to $350 per ton. These are real costs \nbeing put on our farmers.\n  Analysis from the Food and Agricultural Policy Institute, FAPRI, at \nthe University of Missouri-Columbia indicates that fertilizer prices \npaid by agricultural producers increased by almost 50 percent between \n2002 and 2006, with fuel prices increasing over 100 percent in the same \ntime frame. This leads to cost increases of over $80 per acre for rice, \n$50 per acre for corn and $10 to $25\n\n[[Page S8237]]\n\nper acre for soybeans, wheat and cotton.\n  Farmers are hurting. These increased costs are going to curtail the \navailability of our food supply and raise the cost of our food as well. \nTransportation costs will also rise.\n  Well, the concern has been raised by the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico that this legislation is not the best deal.\n  I might agree with him, but I will tell you something. Standing here \non the floor of the Senate, it is the best looking one of the whole \nugly bunch because I have been waiting for a long time to find a way to \nincrease the supply of oil and gas produced in the United States. This \nis a start. He has pointed out, we need to do a lot more things. Well, \nI will be there to support whatever we can do to make a reasonable \ncompromise to overcome the objections, so we can start producing gas in \ndeep sea offshore drilling.\n  I hope one of these days we can go back up to the barren reaches \nabove the Arctic Circle in ANWR. I have been up and watched them drill \nin Prudhoe Bay. There is no harm to the environment. I will tell you, \nthe caribou and the birds love it. The mosquitos are great. They are \njust as healthy as they are in southern Alaska.\n  Tapping the energy resources in the areas specified in this bill can \nhave an immediate impact on both the price of oil and natural gas \nbecause these areas are located in the Gulf of Mexico near existing oil \nand gas production infrastructure. With its proximity to major oil and \nnatural gas transport terminals and pipelines, these new energy \nresources could be quickly shipped to the market for use.\n  Well, in closing, I commend Senator Domenici for putting together a \nbipartisan group to support this bill. I laud his efforts. It is going \nto be done in an environmentally friendly manner. Last year's \ndevastating category 5 hurricane did not cause any significant oil or \ngas spillage. And this new technology can produce this oil and gas from \noffshore areas in an environmentally friendly manner and begin to break \nthe logjam where supply cannot keep up with demand.\n  I urge my colleagues to support S. 3711.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, at this point I rise to discuss the \nlegislation currently before the Senate, S. 3711, the Gulf of Mexico \nEnergy bill. I am an original cosponsor of this bill and strongly \nsupport its passage.\n  Over the last few years, we have seen drastic increases in the prices \nof crude oil and natural gas. While demand for these products in our \ncountry continues to grow, the domestic supply of these commodities \nremains stagnant at best. This lack of domestic productivity and the \nvolatility of the global energy market are causing the everyday lives \nof Alabamians and people all across this Nation to become increasingly \ndifficult.\n  I have no doubt that my colleagues have heard the same stories that I \nhave heard from my constituents in Alabama--that they are having \ntrouble making ends meet because of the prices at the pump. They tell \nme they cannot afford to commute to and from work, pay their monthly \nbills--particularly with record high temperatures--or run their small \nbusinesses.\n  These are not luxury costs. These are the basic costs of everyday \nlife. Alabamians have asked that the Congress do something to alleviate \nthe burden of rising energy prices, just as constituents have all over \nAmerica. While the Gulf of Mexico energy bill will not immediately \nlower gas prices, it will take a significant step forward in addressing \nmany of the problems that cause rising prices. Whether short or long-\nterm effect, one thing is abundantly clear: The status quo is \nunacceptable. More importantly is the fact that because we have \nneglected to tap domestic resources that are currently available to us, \nwe are forced to purchase energy sources from foreign nations that are \noften hostile to U.S. interests. Economic security is the underpinning \nof national security. Energy independence, as I have said many times, \nis vital to economic stability.\n  To achieve a higher level of energy independence, we must increase \ndomestic capacity and production. While no single solution will \nimmediately solve our current problem, there are immediate steps we can \nand must take toward that end. I believe the legislation before us, \ncrafted by Senator Domenici, myself and other Senators, represents a \ncritical step in that direction.\n  According to the Minerals Management Service, MMS, S. 3711 would open \nmore than 8.3 million acres on the Outer Continental Shelf in the Gulf \nof Mexico for oil and gas leasing. MMS estimates these 8.3 million \nacres contain at least 1.26 billion barrels of oil and 5.8 trillion \ncubic feet of natural gas, perhaps more. Tapping these resources would \nreduce the cost of energy nationwide and serve to move us further down \nthe path of energy independence as we continue to explore and develop \nnew sources of energy.\n  For Gulf States--and my State of Alabama is one--that choose to allow \ndrilling off their coast, the legislation also contains a long overdue \nrevenuesharing mechanism. Gulf States allowing oil and gas production \noff their shorelines will receive 37.5 percent of revenues from new \nleases. In addition, 12.5 percent of the revenues will go to the \nstateside Land and Water Conservation Fund for the acquisition of parks \nand recreation facilities across the Nation. The remaining 50 percent \nwill flow into the coffers of the Federal Treasury.\n  Some in this Chamber will surely object to the provisions of S. 3711. \nThey will say that the legislation diverts needed revenue from the \nFederal Treasury and bestows upon gulf producing States a financial \nwindfall. It is important to point out that CBO estimates this \nlegislation will produce nearly $1 billion in new and unexpected \nrevenue for the Federal Treasury over the next 10 years. In my view, \nassertions that the gulf producing States should not receive a share of \nthese revenues assumes that those States have done and sacrificed \nnothing to deserve a share of the revenues. For too long the gulf \nproducing States have borne the brunt of our Nation's domestic energy \nneeds while receiving virtually nothing in return.\n  I would also point out that 37.5 percent is less than the 50 percent \ncurrently provided to States with onshore production. And I would dare \nto guess that the impact to our coasts is as significant as any impact \nfrom onshore drilling. I would also reiterate that the bill provides \n12.5 percent of the stateside LWCF which will be made available to all \n50 States. The Gulf States portion will ensure that the States of \nAlabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas are compensated for the \ndecades of oil and gas exploration and production that has taken place \noff their coasts, the impact the production has had on our coastal \nareas and the billions of dollars this production has brought into the \nFederal Treasury.\n  The legislation clearly lays out a formula that compensates the \nStates according to their proximity to drilling as well as their \nhistoric production and does so while positively impacting the budget. \nThe legislation also ensures that the coastal counties and parishes \nthat are impacted the most have a dedicated funding source to address \nthe needs of their communities.\n  This agreement also represents a commitment by the gulf producing \nStates to continue energy exploration and production off their coasts. \nThis commitment contributes to the energy independence of the Nation. \nIt is time that the gulf producing States were rewarded for their \ncontributions and sacrifices. And while it is difficult to estimate \nwhat this will mean in the way of revenues over the next 60 years, \nthere is no doubt it will be a great resource to the Nation and provide \nsubstantial revenues to Federal and State treasuries.\n  I have no doubt this legislation will provide billions of dollars to \nAlabama and its producing partners in the Gulf of Mexico. These funds \nwill be available to our State and local coastal governments to address \nthe problems that come with drilling production and its required \ninfrastructure. It will ensure we can begin to reverse the coastal \nerosion and begin barrier island restoration that will protect our \nStates from the all-too-familiar hurricanes. These funds will allow \nAlabama, Mississippi, Texas, and Louisiana to enhance their\n\n[[Page S8238]]\n\nfisheries and coastal infrastructure and put hurricane mitigation \nprograms in place to help us better prepare for the storms of the \nfuture.\n\n  The sponsors of this legislation have also worked closely with the \nState of Florida to address the longstanding concerns of the State \nregarding offshore drilling on their coast. Specifically, the \nlegislation includes a 125-mile moratorium on drilling off the coast of \nFlorida until the year 2022. I strongly believe all revenues leading to \nU.S. energy independence should be aggressively pursued. We should \ncontinue to develop alternative sources of energy. We should promote \nenergy efficiency. We should encourage refinery capacity expansion, and \nwe certainly should continue to explore and develop resources that are \ncurrently available to us. We recognize that some of these options will \ntake time to affect our current crisis. Others, however, remain current \ncapabilities.\n  S. 3711 provides that leasing must commence in a substantial portion \nof the 8.3 million acres within at least 1 year of enactment. It says \nthat leasing must occur in the remainder of the 8.3 million acres as \nsoon as practicable. In the context of Federal energy policy, these are \ntangible measures that would have a considerable and direct effect in \nthe short term on consumers and businesses and on the Nation's economy \nas a whole.\n  In closing, this legislation is the product of careful coordination \namong affected States on behalf of the needs of the entire country. It \nmakes much needed contributions to the Nation's energy supply and \ncompensates participating States justly. At the same time it \naccommodates the concerns of those who do not want oil and gas \nproduction to occur off their shorelines, and it provides a mitigating \nmechanism for States that elect to participate. The American people \nrightly expect their elected representatives to act on their behalf to \nstem the escalation of our current energy crisis. While this measure \nalone is not sufficient to solve our energy crisis, it is absolutely a \nnecessary component of the overall solution.\n  I urge my colleagues' strong support for this crucial legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield myself 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the Senate today is considering the Gulf of \nMexico Energy Security Act. I believe this legislation is not \nappropriate energy legislation and also not responsible fiscal policy \nfor the United States, as we face a Federal deficit of $8.4 trillion \nand looming cuts to many vital programs that the Federal Government \nmust support. Next week we will begin to take up the Defense \nappropriations bill for this year. As we consider that bill, we will \ndiscover huge unmet needs to finance the current operations of our \nmilitary. If we diminish the Federal Treasury, our ability to respond \nto that issue and a host of other issues will be contemporaneously \ndiminished.\n  This legislation would mandate that almost 38 percent of revenue from \nFederal resources generated by new leases in new areas of production \nmade available by this bill will be given to four Gulf Coast States. \nRevenues that currently would be provided to the Treasury for the \nbenefit of the Nation as a whole will be diverted to four States. This \nbill, if passed, will cost the Federal Treasury billions of dollars \nover time. I am not alone in my opposition to this legislation. \nTaxpayer advocates and environmentalists share my concerns. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of several letters be printed in the \nRecord expressing these concerns.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Taxpayers for Common Sense,\n\n                                                    July 24, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: Taxpayers for Common Sense Action (TCS \n     Action), a non-partisan budget watchdog organization, urges \n     you to oppose S. 3711, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act \n     of 2006. TCS Action is alarmed by provisions in the bill \n     which alter existing federal-state revenue sharing provisions \n     for royalty payments. Royalty payments represent the second \n     largest source of federal revenues after federal taxes. These \n     provisions will siphon off billions of dollars that would \n     have gone to the Treasury, further straining the nation's \n     fiscal health.\n       TCS Action is not opposed to off-shore oil and gas \n     exploration and development. However, federal waters are \n     owned by all U.S. taxpayers and the public has a right to \n     receive a fair return for the resources they own. Oil and gas \n     resources located within federal waters should not be \n     converted into cash cows benefiting only four Gulf coast \n     states. Gulf coast states currently receive significant \n     royalty payments from waters within 6 miles of their \n     coastline. In fact, under current policy, Louisiana received \n     nearly a billion in revenue from oil and gas royalty payments \n     from 1986-2003.\n       This legislation would dramatically deplete federal revenue \n     generated by leases in lease sale 181 and 181 south and all \n     leases that are issued after enactment of the bill. Currently \n     royalties from these waters would return entirely to the \n     federal government. Moreover, lease sale 181 would likely be \n     opened in the next several years regardless of this \n     legislation. Despite attempts to disguise this legislation as \n     a revenue generator, opening these tracts of off-shore waters \n     under the proposed royalty-sharing provisions with the four \n     Gulf coast states would have detrimental long-term effects on \n     the federal budget. The Administration has also raised \n     similar concerns to changes in revenue-sharing on current \n     leases and their cost to federal taxpayers.\n       With the federal debt mounting and oil and gas prices \n     nearing record highs, reducing the federal earnings on our \n     natural resource royalties does not make fiscal sense. We \n     urge you to vote against the S. 3711 and return some fiscal \n     sanity to our nation's energy policy. If you have any \n     questions, please contact Autumn Hanna at (202) 546-8500.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Steve Ellis,\n     Vice President of Programs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                League of Conservation Voters,\n\n                                                    July 24, 2006.\n     Re oppose S. 3711, the so-called Gulf of Mexico Energy \n         Security Act of 2006.\n\n       Dear Senator: The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) is \n     the political voice of the national environmental community. \n     Each year, LCV publishes the National Environmental \n     Scorecard, which details the voting records of Members of \n     Congress on environmental legislation. The Scorecard is \n     distributed to LCV members, concerned voters nationwide, and \n     the press.\n       LCV urges you to oppose S. 3711, the so-called Gulf of \n     Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006. This backward-looking \n     legislation fails to address our energy problems, raids the \n     federal treasury, and threatens our coastal economies and \n     ecosystems with pollution and oil spills.\n       Opening more of our coastlines to drilling is clearly not \n     the answer to our energy problems, especially given that \n     eighty percent of offshore oil and gas resources are already \n     open to drilling, and oil companies currently hold more than \n     4,000 untapped leases in the Gulf of Mexico. Instead of \n     despoiling our shores and perpetuating our dependence on oil, \n     Congress should pursue faster, cheaper, and more \n     environmentally friendly solutions, including making cars and \n     trucks go further on a gallon of gasoline and increasing our \n     use of clean, renewable energy such as wind and solar power.\n       Unfortunately, rather than using American ingenuity to \n     advance a new energy future that benefits both the economy \n     and the environment, S. 3711 continues to promote failed \n     policies of the past. It opens eight million acres of \n     Florida's Gulf Coast waters to offshore drilling rigs, \n     including more than six million acres that are currently \n     protected by the bipartisan moratorium on offshore drilling \n     that has been in place for twenty-five years. S. 3711 would \n     also divert tens of billions of dollars in offshore drilling \n     revenues from the federal treasury and give the money to just \n     four states. If the Senate were to pass S. 3711, it would \n     pave the way for a conference with H.R. 4761, the even more \n     harmful House-passed bill that would lift the moratorium on \n     offshore drilling for all of our coastlines across the \n     country.\n       We urge you to protect our coasts, our environment, and our \n     economy by voting NO on S. 3711, and instead supporting real \n     solutions to our energy problems. LCV has scored votes \n     related to energy policy and coastal protection on numerous \n     occasions in the past few years, and the Political Advisory \n     Committee will strongly consider including votes on this bill \n     in compiling LCV's 2006 Scorecard. If you need more \n     information, please call Tiernan Sittenfeld or Nat Mund at my \n     office at (202) 785-8683.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Gene Karpinski,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  Sierra Club,\n\n                                                    July 25, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the nearly 800,000 Sierra Club \n     members, I urge you to defeat The Gulf of Mexico Energy \n     Security Act, sponsored by Senator Domenici, and instead \n     fight for energy solutions that will save American families \n     money and cure our addiction to oil.\n       The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, S. 3711, will open \n     an area the size ofthe State of Maryland to new oil and gas \n     drilling, approximately 8 million acres in the Gulf of \n     Mexico. This bill would also repeal parts of the offshore \n     drilling moratorium that has protected America's coast for \n     more than 25 years. It would also divert 37.5 percent of the \n     revenues from new oil and gas drilling in the\n\n[[Page S8239]]\n\n     Gulf to just four states, costing the Federal Treasury nearly \n     $20 billion over the next 20 years.\n       Not only does this bill lift the moratorium on drilling in \n     the eastern Gulf of Mexico, it jeopardizes every other \n     coastal state. The House has already passed an expansive \n     drilling bill that puts the entire Atlantic and Pacific \n     coasts on the chopping block. If the Domenici bill passes the \n     Senate it will certainly get much worse in a House-Senate \n     conference committee, putting our wetlands, marine \n     environments, beaches and coastal economies at risk.\n       The Sierra Club strongly supports permanent protection for \n     our beaches and coastal waters. Our coasts provide essential \n     habitat for fish and wildlife, a detination for thousands of \n     vacationing families each year, and the economic lifeblood \n     for thousands of tourism and fishing communities.\n       The Domenici drilling bill continues to lead America away \n     from smart energy solutions. It is estimated that drilling \n     off of Florida's coast would only bring 47 days of oil and 4 \n     months of natural gas, and we wouldn't see any of it for at \n     least 7 years. There are faster, cheaper, cleaner and \n     longerterm energy solutions like energy efficiency and clean, \n     renewable energy that will start saving families and \n     businesses money today.. We do not need to sacrifice our \n     beaches and coastal waters to meet America's energy needs.\n       Thank you for consideration of our recommendations. If you \n     have questions, please feel free to contact Athan Manuel at \n     202-548-4580.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Carl Pope,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund,\n\n                                                    July 25, 2006.\n     Re oppose S. 3711, the budget-busting offshore drilling bill.\n\n       Dear Senator: The Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund is an \n     independent organization committed to giving conservation \n     issues a political voice on Capitol Hill and around the \n     nation. The Action Fund publishes an annual Conservation \n     Report Card which highlights the voting records of Members of \n     Congress on legislation vital to protecting our nation's \n     wildlife and wild landscapes for future generations.\n       Protection of marine life in the outer continental shelf is \n     one of Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund's highest \n     priorities. S. 3711, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, \n     would dismantle the 25 year bipartisan offshore drilling \n     moratorium by opening 6 million acres of currently protected \n     waters in Florida's Gulf coast to oil and gas development. \n     The Action Fund urges you in the strongest possible terms to \n     oppose S. 3711, which will most likely be included in the \n     next Conservation Report Card.\n       The eight million acres proposed for oil and gas \n     development in the Gulf of Mexico are home to more than 20 \n     species of whales and dolphins, five species of sea turtles, \n     dozens of fish species and hundreds of species of birds. All \n     would be put at risk of collision and exposure to the routine \n     pollution associated with oil and gas drilling if S. 3711 \n     were to pass. An oil spill would further devastate our marine \n     wildlife.\n       While the bill would threaten our marine wildlife and \n     coastal economies, it would do nothing to lower oil or \n     natural gas prices; it will simply feed our country's \n     unsustainable addiction to oil. From enforcing strict \n     conservation measures to making our cars go farther on a \n     gallon of gas, Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund supports \n     faster, cleaner, cheaper solutions than oil and gas drilling \n     to meet our energy needs.\n       I further urge you to oppose S. 3711 so that a conference \n     report with HR 4761, the House-passed offshore drilling bill \n     authored by Rep. Richard Pombo (R-CA), never sees the light \n     of day. The House bill lifts the entire offshore drilling \n     moratorium nationwide, and Rep. Pombo has made clear that the \n     House intends on using the conference process to add as many \n     of the House bill's provisions to the Senate bill as \n     possible. We oppose S. 3711 in its own right; a conference \n     with the House bill would be disastrous.\n       Thank you for your consideration in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Rodger Schlickeisen,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. REED. In 1952, President Truman, speaking about proposals to give \ncoastal States Federal offshore oil and gas revenue said:\n\n       If we back down on our determination to hold these rights \n     for all the people, we will act to rob them of this great \n     national asset. That is just what the oil lobby wants. They \n     want us to turn the vast treasure over to a handful of States \n     where the powerful private oil interests hope to exploit it \n     to suit themselves.\n       Those sentiments are not far off from today. In 1953, \n     Congress enacted the Submerged Land Act. This law provided \n     that each coastal State would have a seaward boundary of at \n     least 3 miles and that the Federal Government would \n     relinquish to the States the interests of the United States \n     in lands beneath the navigable waters within the State \n     boundaries. Importantly, the law affirmed the Federal \n     Government's ownership in lands seaward of the State \n     boundary. Revenues from Outer Continental Shelf drilling \n     belong to the American people in all 50 States. The \n     legislation the Senate is considering today violates this \n     pact with the American people, and it denies the Federal \n     Treasury and the American people essential revenue to address \n     the needs of our Nation.\n\n  Again, to quote President Truman, since his comments still ring true \ntoday:\n\n       I can see how Members of Congress from [affected areas] \n     might like to have all the offshore oil for their States. But \n     I certainly can't understand how Members of Congress from the \n     other 45 States can vote to give away the interest the people \n     of their own States have in this tremendous asset. It is just \n     over my head and beyond me how any interior Senator or \n     Congressman could vote to give that asset away. I am still \n     puzzled about it. As far as I am concerned, I intend to stand \n     up and fight to protect the people's interest in this matter.\n\n  Proponents of this bill argue that their coastal States deserve to \nshare in the Federal revenues because they have tremendous costs and \nenvironmental challenges arising from energy development and production \nthat benefits the whole Nation. They argue, with some validity, that \nthey bear costs, although the benefits are shared by the entire Nation. \nI acknowledge that. I fully acknowledge that energy development is \nharming our coastal zones, leading to habitat loss and erosion. For \nthis reason, in 2001 Congress authorized a coastal impact assistance \nprogram that provided Federal funding to States and local communities \nfor mitigating the impacts of OCS oil and gas development and \nproduction. It is also the reason why I supported an amendment to the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2005 that mandated $1 billion over 4 years in \ndirect Federal spending to gulf coast States and other producing States \nfor the purposes of remediating environmental problems caused by the \nextraction and production of energy. That is the right approach, to \nappropriate Federal resources, directed to help States address a \nproblem that is caused in large part by production activity.\n  What I object to is a permanent entitlement that does not state \nspecific eligible uses to mitigate the environmental harm of OCS \nproduction. For example, the bill before us today would allow the \nStates to decide to fund a category described as ``mitigation of the \nimpacts of Outer Continental Shelf activities through the funding of \nonshore infrastructure projects.'' This could cover any appropriate \nbricks and mortar project in any State along the gulf coast, from \nschools to highways to community centers, all of which I think could \nand would be legitimately argued by a State official as somehow \nmitigating the impacts of outer Continental Shelf activities.\n  So in a sense what we have opened up here is a general revenue \nsharing, not a targeted approach to mitigating the specific harms \ncaused by the extraction and production of petroleum and natural gas \nproducts.\n  Nothing in this bill requires the States and communities to report \nback to taxpayers and the Federal Government how the funds are being \nused. I don't think there is any appropriate mechanism of routine \nreporting. I suppose that if you objected to a particular project, you \nmight sue in Federal Court saying they violated the act, but that is \nhardly an appropriate and routine and rational way to ensure that the \nspending is appropriate.\n  Again, reading the very general language in the bill, I would think \nthat you could make a case that a school, community center, and a range \nof other projects would be infrastructure that would mitigate in some \nway the broad effects of production of energy in these States. An \nargument may be made that a vote against the bill is a vote against the \ncommunities and people harmed by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. I don't \nthink that is true. This debate has to be about responsible national \nenergy and responsible fiscal policy.\n  We in this body have voted to provide $123 billion to help the gulf \ncoast recover. That money, because of our difficult financial \nsituation, is literally being borrowed. The interest on that debt and \nthe principal of that debt will be paid by all Americans. It is an \nexample of why we need Federal resources in difficult times, because \nthere will be other occasions where other Americans will see the same \nkind of suffering, the same kind of destruction that was visited upon \nthe gulf coast, and we as a Congress have to be able to stand up, not \njust with words but resources, to help these people. As\n\n[[Page S8240]]\n\nwe diminish the Federal resources by a very narrow revenue-sharing plan \nfor four States, we diminish our capacity to respond.\n  We have also directed and voted recently for a $2 billion \nauthorization for Louisiana's coastal restoration program as part of \nthe Water Resources Development Act. If more money is necessary to \nrestore the gulf coast, then more money should be provided, and that is \nnot the sentiment of just the people who live there, that is the \nsentiment of the American people because, frankly, if any part of our \ncountry was similarly devastated, we would all be here asking our \nfriends and colleagues to help us, and I think they would respond. What \nthey may not be able to do, if we pass this bill, is respond with the \nsame kind of financial clout because we will have already given Federal \nresources for the benefit of only four states.\n  There are other aspects of funding that inure to the benefit of these \ncoastal communities. Section 8(g) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands \nAct provides coastal States with a share of the revenues received by \nthe Federal Government from leases on Federal tracts that are adjacent \nto and within 3 miles of a State's seaward boundary. That is a \nspecialized source of revenue which goes to coastal States. Between \n1986 and 2003, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas received \nnearly $2 billion in revenues from the Federal Government under section \n8(g). This funding is precisely the type of funding that could be used \nto mitigate the impacts of OCS production.\n  Further, the Coastal Zone Management Act's ``Federal consistency'' \nprovision ensures that Federal actions, such as OCS leases for energy \nproduction, that are likely to affect any land or water use or natural \nresources of the coastal zone must be consistent with a coastal State's \napproved coastal zone management programs. That means that if Gulf \nCoast States put into place strong coastal zone management plans to \nprotect against erosion and the loss of wetlands and environmental \ncomplications, the law would require a Federal OCS lease to be \nconsistent with these plans and make these States less vulnerable to \nstorms. So not only is this an issue of funding, it is an issue of \nStates taking action to ensure that they have strong environmental \nprotections, and these plans, in turn, according to the law, will be \nimposed upon the OCS leases.\n  Now, we understand that energy production is a burden to the States, \nbut it is also, in many situations, an economic benefit to these very \nsame States.\n  The oil and gas industry is central to Louisiana's economy, with an \nestimated $93 billion impact in 2001. Over $1.3 billion worth of oil \nand gas is produced annually in Alabama. The State receives direct \nbenefits of approximately $285 million annually in the form of lease \nbonuses, royalties, trust fund investments, and severance taxes. In \n2005, Texas petroleum and coal were valued at $8.89 billion. All of \nthese revenues provide a strong and powerful force of economic progress \nfor all of these communities. I daresay that, as much as a burden is \nimposed, there would be great reluctance for any of these States to try \nto curtail this economic production because it benefits the community.\n  Now, what is also troubling about the legislation is not only the \nfiscal implications, but also it is proposing a permanent entitlement \nthat is unnecessary to generate new domestic natural gas and oil \nsupplies. There are over 40 million acres of Federal Outer Continental \nShelf under lease, but the oil and gas industry is sitting on over 33 \nmillion acres of undeveloped leases. They have less than 7 million \nacres in production, and there is 328 trillion cubic feet of \nrecoverable natural gas in the nonmoratoria areas.\n  The United States consumes 25 percent of the world's energy, and yet \nwe have less than 3 percent of the world's oil supplies. We cannot \ndrill our way to energy security; yet this bill essentially provides \nonly one way forward--to drill in the Gulf of Mexico. We deserve an \nenergy bill that will reduce our dependency on fossil fuels and \nstrengthen our economy.\n\n  On July 20, I joined 40 of my colleagues in sending a letter to the \nmajority leader asking that we consider energy legislation that sets \nnational goals to reduce our overall national dependence on petroleum \nby increasing fuel efficiency and alternative vehicle technologies, \nthat protects Americans from price-gouging and market manipulation, and \nthat levels the playing field for new renewable and energy efficiency \ntechnology and, more specifically to this debate we are having, ensures \nthat new energy proposals that affect spending or revenues must be \nfiscally responsible and take into account the true long-term impact of \nthese proposals. That is not the bill we are considering today.\n  I am left wondering why, as the Senate finally takes up energy \nlegislation, we are not debating and voting on a bill to increase fuel \nefficiency in cars and trucks. Why are we not voting on oil savings \nprovisions? Where are the provisions in our energy legislation to \nprotect consumers from price-gouging or restore lost royalties to the \nFederal Treasury from oil and natural gas companies making record \nprofits? Where is the mandated Federal funding dedicated to fully \nfunding energy efficiency and renewable energy?\n  I hope the Senate will get to vote on an increase in fuel efficiency \nstandards. Gasoline consumption in the transportation sector represents \nabout 44 percent of total oil consumption in the United States each \nyear. Including diesel fuel, the number jumps to 57 percent. To bring \nabout any serious reduction in our dependence on foreign oil, we must \nincrease the fuel efficiency of our cars and light trucks, as well as \npromote the use of hybrids and vehicles that use alternative fuels.\n  I also hope we will have a chance to amend this bill. I hope we have \na chance to have a debate on an energy bill that will include not only \nsupply-side considerations but also demand-side considerations. All of \nthis legislation is important to consider, but I fear we will be \nconstrained to this bill.\n  Finally, I am concerned that whatever we do in the Senate would open \nup a conference with the other body. Their legislation, H.R. 4761, the \nDeep Ocean Energy Resources Act, would lift the moratorium on offshore \ndrilling for all of our coastlines, not just the gulf coast. I believe \nthis would be a serious step, putting in jeopardy fisheries and marine \nsanctuaries, further depleting the Treasury, further eroding States' \ncurrent positions with respect to drilling, and undermining \nenvironmental mitigation for energy development and production. My \nRhode Island coastline, like the coastline of every State, is something \nwe want to preserve and protect, and there is a fear that if the House \nversion prevails, these coastlines will be jeopardized.\n  We are in a situation where we have a burgeoning energy crisis. We \njust have to go to the gasoline pump to figure that one out. This \nburgeoning energy crisis impacts our foreign relations. We have scores \nof troops across the globe today because of our dependency on oil. But \nthis should not be the occasion to entertain legislation that is unwise \nin terms of energy policy and potentially very damaging to the fiscal \nintegrity of the United States.\n  Before we open new lands to development, we need to ensure that the \noil and gas industries are putting undeveloped leases into production, \nand we need to take meaningful action to reduce our consumption and \nincrease renewable energy supplies. We need to be more independent with \nrespect to energy, reduce our consumption of fossil fuels overall. This \nis an energy policy which we should pursue, and as a fiscal policy, we \nhave to maintain Federal resources for Federal responsibilities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nof speakers be as follows: Sessions, Menendez, Cochran, Landrieu, and \nAlexander.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I believe I had asked for 15 minutes. I \nwill try to do it in 10. I ask that I be notified at the end of 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. President, I travel my State, and I know that Senator Shelby, who \nspoke earlier, travels Alabama, also. We meet with people and talk with \npeople. I see people back in my hometown in church and in other places, \nand I get asked about energy prices all the time. People are concerned \nabout it.\n\n[[Page S8241]]\n\n  I have studied some of the economic numbers in this country, and I am \na bit troubled. I think it is a valid concern for our Nation that, \nwhile the country is doing well economically and unemployment is down, \nmiddle and lower income workers' salaries have not increased as much as \nwe would like them to. In fact, the higher income salaried workers, \nwage and hour workers, are doing better percentage-wise than the lower \nincome workers. That means the cost of energy impacts them \nsignificantly. They ask me to do something about it. I talk about what \nI have been trying to do since I came to the Senate 10 years ago, which \nincludes voting and working to try to open up the ANWR region, where \nlarge reserves exist, and to support nuclear power and clean coal. I \nhave been a supporter of ethanol, and I am hopeful that we will see \nethanol, biodiesel and matters of that kind really advance as an option \nfor America.\n  I have to tell you that the most certain and direct thing we can do \nis to increase domestic production of oil and gas in this country. That \nis what we are about to act on now. This legislation is a concrete, \ndirect way that will make a difference in the price of oil and gas in \nour country.\n  One of my colleagues mentioned that some people like to use this \nphrase: Big oil companies. I want to make one thing clear: the reason \nwe should open up production in the Gulf of Mexico is not to help big \noil companies. We should open it up if, and only if, it is good for the \nAmerican consumer and the American economy.\n  In fact, I am confident that many of the big oil companies will have \nno interest in producing oil and gas from the Gulf of Mexico. They may \nbe sitting on large reserves of oil and gas right now, and they may be \nvery happy with $75 a barrel. Why should they want a competitor to go \nout and produce more in some other area if it might reduce the value of \nthe oil and gas reserves that they possess? It is a myth and a \nfalsehood that this has anything to do with oil and gas companies.\n  What it has to do with is increasing the supply of natural gas and \nincreasing the supply of oil for American consumers, keeping our wealth \nat home.\n  One thing is obvious to us: We very much depend on natural gas. \nEighteen percent of U.S. electricity comes from natural gas--18 \npercent--is generated from natural gas. Nuclear power provides 20 \npercent of our electricity. Nuclear power is the only source of clean, \nreliable, and affordable electricity. Nineteen applications for nuclear \npowerplants have been issued since we passed the Energy bill last year. \nNineteen applications for new nuclear powerplants have been issued \nsince we passed the Energy bill last year. It will make a big \ndifference, but I have to tell you, I don't expect 18 percent of \nelectricity that comes from natural gas to be reduced any time in the \nfuture.\n  Oil prices are at high levels. On July 14, 2006, the price of crude \noil closed around $77 a barrel. Many Wall Street analysts say it may \nhit $80 if this Mideast crisis continues. By comparison, the price of \ncrude oil 2 years ago was $35 a barrel. That has been an increase of \n100-plus percent.\n  High energy prices, for all practical purposes, result in a tax on \nthe American consumer. And to whom do we pay that tax? We pay it to \nforeign nations. Many of those nations are hostile to us diplomatically \nand politically. They are not our greatest friends. In fact, somebody \nhas written an article stating that the more oil wealth a country has, \nthe less friendly that country becomes.\n  Mr. Bernanke, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, in April of \nthis year said:\n\n       Rising energy prices pose risk to both economic activity \n     and inflation.\n\n  On June 15, he said:\n\n       The steep increases in energy prices over the past several \n     years have had significant consequences for households, \n     businesses, and economic policy.\n\n  One article I saw recently estimated that higher energy costs have \nknocked down our growth in GDP by 1 percent this year.\n  The average price of gasoline has now hit $3.02. It is up from $2.28 \na year ago. This hurts families. It hurts consumers. We know that. We \nhate to see that happen. We know there is a worldwide increase in \ndemand for oil and gas. We know that China and India are growing. I was \nin South America recently. Almost every country I visited had been \nhaving a 5-percent or more increase in growth. That means they will use \nmore oil and gas.\n  I will tell you it makes a big difference to a working Alabamian, a \nworking man or woman anywhere in this country, who now has to pay an \nadditional $50 a month for gasoline and maybe some more for heating as \na result of natural gas.\n  Natural gas prices have risen dramatically. On July 14 of this year, \nnatural gas in the United States was a little over $6.25 per million \nBtu's. Not too long ago it was $12. It has dropped about half, which is \ngreat news. But in Russia and Oman, for example, natural gas comes in \nat about $1.25 per million Btu. These higher costs do impact American \nbusinesses, particularly, as well as consumers.\n  The vice president of Nucor Steel in Tuscaloosa, AL, said recently:\n\n       The high price of natural gas significantly impacts our \n     ability to remain competitive and have a productive \n     manufacturing sector.\n\n  Some of the natural gas spike in prices is the result of speculation, \nit is the result of a fear of shortage, a fear that is out there. We \nhave seen that prices have gone up and down in natural gas.\n  I would say this: Natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico is at \na point where we need to expand our areas of drilling. Natural gas \nwells produce for a good long time, but they dry up faster than oil \nwells do. And if we don't constantly replace them, then we have a \nproblem.\n  We have had a controversy in Alabama recently about LNG, liquefied \nnatural gas. This is natural gas that may be produced in the Middle \nEast. It is liquefied, frozen or brought to a point of liquid by \nreducing its temperature. It is brought to the United States. A plant \nis set up, probably offshore, to heat it up and put it into the \nAmerican pipeline after we pay the foreign shipper, after we pay the \npeople to produce it in the foreign country, after we pay the foreign \ncountry for this natural gas. That is what Alan Greenspan told us we \nwill have to do more of, importing LNG. And we will be doing more of \nthat if we're not careful.\n  How silly it is to do that when right off our own shores we have huge \nreserves of natural gas. We could keep all that wealth at home in our \nNation. We could produce that oil and gas so it goes right into our \nAmerican pipelines without having to be liquefied. It would go right to \nthe consumers around the country.\n  Mr. President, 60 percent of our oil comes from foreign sources, \nincluding, 49 percent from OPEC nations in all, 14 percent from Saudi \nArabia, and 12 percent from Venezuela--boy, they have been taking \naction recently to see if they can discomfort the United States--10.5 \npercent from Nigeria, and 6.4 percent from Iraq.\n\n  We paid $200 billion last year for foreign oil and gas--$200 billion, \nwealth that Americans would rather see invested in our country, hiring \nAmericans to produce oil and gas. They would pay taxes and be able to \nraise their families, have high wages and good retirement plans and \ngood health care plans.\n  A lot of people have wondered why these companies try to buy up our \nports and are buying up American industries. Why are these foreign \ncountries able to do it? One reason is, a number of them are oil-\nproducing nations. These oil-producing nations have wealth they don't \nknow what to do with. They want to invest it wherever they can, and the \nUnited States is a good, safe place. I think that is a factor. The \ntransfer of our wealth to foreign nations, many of whom are not our \nfriends or allies, impacts American jobs and American companies.\n  With regard to where we get our natural gas, less than 20 percent of \nit is imported. Most of it is imported through pipelines from Canada or \nMexico, but only 2.8 percent represents liquefied natural gas. That \ncomes in from Algeria, Egypt, and Trinidad.\n  So we are, in many ways, a self-contained natural gas community. If \nwe have a real shortage, the price is going to go up. It means if you \nheat your home with natural gas--and many Americans do--or if your \nbusiness depends on natural gas for operations--and many American \nbusinesses do,\n\n[[Page S8242]]\n\ntheir costs are going to go up significantly.\n  If we produce natural gas off our coast and put it directly in our \npipelines, that will help in a dramatic way to contain the price of \nnatural gas in America.\n  Alan Greenspan recently said:\n\n       Notable cost productions for both liquefication and \n     transportation of LNG--Liquefied natural gas--and high gas \n     prices projected in the American distant futures market have \n     made us a potential very large importer. Access to world \n     natural gas supplies will require a major expansion of LNG \n     terminal import capacity.\n\n  He has been warning about that for some time. That is what we are \nwrestling with in Alabama today: Do we want an LNG plant? We already \nproduce a lot of oil and gas offshore that goes directly into our \npipelines. People are comfortable with that. We have had no significant \nspills in our State. We are comfortable with that. But \nenvironmentalists and others are uneasy about this LNG terminal and \nwhether we should go in that direction.\n  So for every argument, from the environmental argument to the \nAmerican economy, to reducing the cost, we would do better to use oil \nand gas offshore.\n  Conservation, alternative fuels, and domestic production are all \nimportant things we need to work on. The Government has had moratoriums \non producing from offshore areas. It is something I have been involved \nin since I have been in the Senate, almost 10 years. We have had debate \nafter debate, vote after vote, but for a whole host of reasons, we have \nnot been able to get around this moratorium. We have not been able to \nproduce more oil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico because of it.\n  The State of Alabama produces oil and gas in Mobile Bay. I live in \nMobile. It is almost close enough to throw a rock at from Fort Morgan \nPeninsula and hit it. It is right off the coast. We have them in the \ngulf right off the coast. They produce a lot of oil and gas for this \ncountry.\n  In fact, I will show this chart. It is sort of amusing to me. I used \nto complain about it back in 2002. We were building a pipeline then. I \nsee Senator Cochran from Mississippi is now on the floor. He has seen \nall this before. We have been producing oil and gas up in Mississippi \nand Alabama for quite a number of years.\n  In 2002, our good friends down in Florida, who want no drilling 125 \nmiles or more offshore, objected to new natural gas exploration. But \nthey were perfectly happy to build a pipeline to take our oil and gas \ndown to Tampa, FL, so they can sit out on the dock and have their mint \njuleps and watch the sunset over the gulf before they go back in their \nbig houses kept cool with air-conditioning run by natural gas. I \nunderstand their environmental concerns. But at some point, the \nproducing States have to feel we have been taken here a little as \nchumps in this deal, getting not 1 cent from the 4,000 wells that exist \nin the gulf--4,000 wells.\n  By the way, we have 4,000 wells in the gulf, and this most powerful \nstorm, Katrina, came through so did several other powerful hurricanes \nlast year. Mr. President, over 3,000 of those wells were in the direct \npaths of those hurricanes, and we never had any significant spill of \noil in the gulf. It goes to show how good the technology is, how hard \nthey have worked scientifically to make oil and gas production safer. I \nthink that is why Florida is beginning to reevaluate this and are being \nmore amenable to the idea. Senator Martinez has worked hard to try to \nprotect Florida's interest as much as he can but allow some additional \ndrilling there. I think we have gotten past that. So I would say to my \ncolleagues I have been in the Senate for 10 years and we have been \ntrying to open up additional reserves in the gulf, and we should do \nthat. But we haven't been successful. It hasn't worked. We have tried \nand tried and tried some more.\n\n  Now Chairman Domenici has worked his heart out, and Senator Landrieu, \nworking on the Democratic side, has met him halfway, and they have \nworked and planned, and so many other Members of this body have worked \non it.\n  So we have a proposal now which I think will clear this Senate, will \nopen up huge areas, 8 million acres of gulf for production that can \nproduce, and, as we heard from other speakers, large amounts of oil and \ngas. It will be done in a way that is bipartisan and in a way that we \nall can be happy about.\n  We can keep the oil and gas people busy for the period that the oil \nand gas moratorium on the other parts of the gulf remains in effect. So \nat that time we will see what happens. If there is a mess or if there \nis unhappiness--maybe nothing will change. Or, maybe at that point we \ncan decide to open up more land in the gulf for production.\n  Mr. President, I don't know what my time was.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Senator has used 19\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I have gone beyond the 10 minutes I was looking to \nspeak--far too far. I will wrap up and say I thank each of the Members \nof this body who has worked hard to reach an accord that will have \nbipartisan support that should pass. Because this is important to the \nAmerican consumer; it is important to the American economy; it is \nimportant to jobs in this country. It will reduce the transfer of \nAmerican wealth to foreign nations where we are now sending it to buy \nthe energy we must have.\n  This is not a little matter; it is a huge matter. Every now and then \nwe have an opportunity to truly do something about an issue that our \nconstituents have raised with us. They have asked us to do something \nabout rising energy prices. This plan will work. It will produce large \namounts of oil and gas for our Nation and it will keep us producing \nenergy for quite a number of years.\n  This is what we should do to fulfill that obligation to our \nconstituents.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I yield myself 20 minutes of Senator \nBingaman's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this bill \nwhich would do little, if anything, to improve the energy situation in \nthis country. It would end up costing the Federal Government tens of \nbillions of dollars in the long run, and it would create an opening for \nthose who want to eliminate coastal protections that tens of millions \nof Americans want and enjoy.\n  My primary concern with this bill is the fact that it does absolutely \nnothing to protect New Jersey. I don't think it does anything for 44 \nother States, either, but I am here to represent the people of New \nJersey, and they are ill-served by the legislation.\n  We do have a large chemical industry in the State, and I am sensitive \nto the problems they are facing with the high cost of natural gas, \nwhich is a critical feedstock for them. I have received letters from \nthe industry urging me to support this bill, saying we must pass this \nbill to lower gas prices and put ourselves on the path toward energy \nindependence. But this bill will do nothing of the sort, particularly \nin the short term. I believe the outside groups supporting this bill \nknow this, and they are hoping this is a ticket into a conference with \nthe bill the House of Representatives passed last month, a bill that is \nstunning in its disregard for environmental protections.\n  The bill passed by the House would immediately eliminate the long-\nstanding moratoria that protect our coastlines, not just in one part of \nthe country but everywhere along the Atlantic, along the Pacific, the \nArctic, and gulf coasts. Then it would be a free-for-all. States that \nwanted to could allow drilling a few miles off their shores. \nNeighboring States that could be heavily impacted by the drilling, \nparticularly in the event of a spill, would have almost no say in the \nprocess. States that didn't want to drill would be given 50 miles of \nprotection, way down from the 200 miles we have now. If a State wanted \nto get an extra 50 miles, it would have to apply to the Federal \nGovernment every 5 years for that privilege.\n  The House bill also has a provision that opens national parks and \nmarine sanctuaries to drilling. As long as your rig is parked outside \nof a protected area, you are free to directionally drill into that \nregion. No thought is given to the environmental damage that might be \noccurring, the drill cuttings and toxic metals that can litter the sea \nfloor. But then again, some thought must have been given, because the \nHouse bill also provides broad waivers for a number of environmental \nlaws.\n\n[[Page S8243]]\n\n  One of the fundamental flaws of the House bill is an idea that we can \nsplit up the ocean into administrative boxes with each State \ncontrolling its offshore territory. But the ocean has no boundaries, \nand an oil spill will not respect any artificial lines we draw. There \nis territory off the eastern seaboard less than 75 miles from the coast \nof New Jersey the administration has already proposed opening to \ndrilling. The House bill is yet another opportunity for that to happen. \nIt is another assault on the Jersey shore, one of the most ecologically \nsensitive and economically important parts of the State of New Jersey.\n  Our beaches are part of our $222 billion tourism industry, which is \nresponsible for over 10 percent of the jobs in the State. The New \nJersey coastal counties are home to over 1.5 million people.\n  New Jersey is also home to a huge fishing industry. According to the \nAmerican Sports Fishing Association, there are over 800,000 \nrecreational anglers in the State, contributing over $1.3 billion and \n12,000 jobs to the State economy. Our commercial fisheries are critical \nas well. The port of Cape May and Wildwood is the fifth largest \ncommercial port in the country, by value. According to the National \nMarine Fisheries Service, New Jersey landed over 185 million pounds of \nfish last year, worth over $139 million.\n\n  The waters off the coast of New Jersey are home to over 300 species \nof fish and 300 species of birds, and our beaches are crucial stopping \npoints for countless numbers of migratory birds, including some \nendangered and threatened ones such as the red knot.\n  The House bill is a direct threat to all of this, and if S. 3711 \npasses, the House will have an opportunity to move their bill forward \nanother step toward becoming law.\n  I know we have been told that the Senate will try to avoid a \nconference--and I certainly appreciate that--and that we may be able to \nget the House to accept this bill as is. I have not heard any sort of \ncommitment to that effect from the majority leader, and no one has \npresented a clear way to this body to avoid a conference with the \nHouse. The House, meanwhile, seems quite clear that it doesn't find \nthis bill satisfactory at all. Richard Pombo, the chairman of the House \nResources Committee who would lead the House delegation in a \nconference, has been fairly blunt about this. Here are two of his \nquotes:\n\n       Given the fact that the House bill passed with overwhelming \n     support, it is unlikely that the House would accept the \n     Senate bill without having the opportunity to debate at least \n     a couple of provisions, if not the opportunity to bring it up \n     to par with the House bill.\n\n  Referring to the Senate bill:\n\n       It is a third of the bill that the House passed \n     overwhelmingly in a bipartisan fashion just two weeks ago,\n\n  Pombo spokesman Brian Kennedy said yesterday:\n\n       The House passed a comprehensive national solution.\n\n  Here are two news reports from this week:\n\n       House Resources Committee Chairman Richard Pombo, the lead \n     advocate of the House plan, has scoffed at the idea of simply \n     accepting the Senate plan.\n       Richard Pombo said that if the Senate passes its bill this \n     week, he plans to work in conference to add as many of the \n     House provisions as possible.\n\n  Then yesterday, in an AP report:\n\n       Representative Richard Pombo, a key sponsor of the House \n     bill passed last month, said Tuesday he saw no way the House \n     would accept the limited Senate legislation as a substitute \n     for its bill--no way.\n\n  Any Member of this Chamber who believes we can get the House to \naccept this bill as is should listen to these statements and think \nagain.\n  But I also don't believe this is all that great a bill to begin with. \nFirst, the fact is it doesn't do that much. Let me show you this map of \nthe region we are talking about.\n  This region outlined in black, the contours of it are lease sale 181. \nThe purple lines are the existing pipelines in the gulf over here, and \nthe gray squares are the oil and gas platforms that already exist. This \norange rectangle right here has already been opened. So S. 3711 would \nopen this red area in the middle, and these two tan areas, but the red \narea is already likely to be open next year by the administration \nanyway. Congressional action isn't necessary here at all. It is not \nunder a moratorium, it is not under withdrawal, so there is no need for \nus to act to get that gas.\n  The only new areas the bill opens are these two tan areas here, a \nwedge-shaped area in 181, and a bigger area called 181 south. They may \nlook pretty big, particularly this one here in the south, but combined, \nthese two areas have less gas than this red region alone.\n  Look how far these new regions are from the existing infrastructure \nin the region. Even if they were opened today, it would take years for \ncompanies to start developing them. And once they do start developing \nthem some years down the road, there is not all that much gas there to \nbegin with.\n  Here is the claim the proponents of this bill make: 5.8 trillion \ncubic feet of gas opened in this whole bill, which would be enough to \nheat and cool 6 million homes for 15 years. It would take care of the \nNation's needs for 3 months. That is what they say. But how long will \nit take to get that gas?\n  Here are the estimates that the Mineral and Mines Management Service \nsay even going out 50 years--even going out 50 years--we only get about \n80 percent of that 5.8 trillion cubic feet, about 2\\1/2\\ months' worth.\n  Looking into the median term, in the next 15 years, this whole bill \nwould open half a trillion cubic feet of gas. That is about 9 days' \nworth. The new areas, the areas that wouldn't be opened, anyway, \nprovide less than half of that, enough to take care of the country for \na cozy Thanksgiving weekend.\n  But in the near term, in the next 10 years, we get almost nothing out \nof this bill, and there will be absolutely nothing until 2011.\n  Take a look at these numbers from the Minerals Management Service and \nask yourself, will this have a real effect on natural gas prices, with \nthis type of supply? Will this have any effect on natural gas supply?\n  Nothing in the short term. But, in exchange for that ``nothing,'' we \ngive away 37.5 percent of the royalties, money that could be used for \nhomeland security, defense, housing, education--or actually helping the \ncoastal States in this region to actually meet their challenges. I do \nbelieve we should help them meet their challenges, particularly \nLouisiana. Senator Landrieu has made a powerful argument on behalf of \nher State and those needs. But the question is, How do we best achieve \nthat? Money for these other priorities we cede to four States, and for \nthose four States it is a great deal, but for New Jersey and the other \n45 States, I don't see how it is.\n  There are some people who might support this bill because of the \nmoney that will go directly to the Land and Water Conservation Fund \nstateside program. But the amount of money in that fund that we will \nget in the first 10 years is a trifle. These are the funding levels for \nthe stateside grant program for the past 6 years--see where they are--\nand the amount in this year's Senate Appropriations Committee report. \nThe average over that time is about $82.3 million.\n  Under the bill we are debating, this new direct funding for the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund would provide a small fraction of what it \nhad been getting in the past and barely even meet the lower funding \nlevels of recent years. While this does not replace the appropriations \nprocess for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, it could make it \nharder in the future to get appropriators to provide additional funds \nto this program, beyond that which is allocated in this bill. This is \nno windfall for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and it certainly \ndoesn't make up for the giveaways from the Federal Treasury.\n  Finally, this bill provides statutory protections for Florida's \nwestern coast until 2022. That is unprecedented and treats Florida \ndifferently from all other coastal States. I do not begrudge Florida \ntheir attempts to get statutory protections to 2022. They deserve the \nright to try to protect their coastline. But New Jersey also deserves \nthe right to protect our own. While we must fight each year for a 1-\nyear extension to the drilling moratorium and are beholden to the whims \nof the executive branch which could remove the Presidential withdrawal \nat any time, Florida would be protected.\n  We simply seek the same protections Florida is being offered, a \ncontinuation\n\n[[Page S8244]]\n\nof the moratorium until 2022. So I will be filing an amendment, \ncosponsored by a broad, bipartisan coalition of Members from both \ncoasts, including Senators Snowe, Feinstein, Lautenberg, Boxer, \nCollins, and many others, that would put the Atlantic and Pacific \nOceans off limits to oil and gas drilling until 2022.\n  While we file those amendments, we are being told, unfortunately, \nthat we will not be given the opportunity to offer any amendments to \nthis bill. I believe that is wrong. We have record-high gas prices. We \nface even higher ones in the future due to instability in the Middle \nEast. We are putting a squeeze on families around the country while \nallowing oil and gas companies to report new record profits this week. \nWe also have an electric grid in California that is straining under a \nrecord heat wave, and global warming threatens to bring us even more \nheat waves like this in the future. Yet this is the only piece of \nenergy legislation which is likely to move this year, and we are not \nlikely to be given the opportunity to address any of the real energy \nproblems this country faces.\n  There are a number of excellent amendments that are being filed by \npeople on both sides of the aisle, amendments that would raise fuel \nefficiency or provide for a real plan to cut down on the amount of oil \nwe use or create new incentives for renewable energy. I will be filing \namendments to encourage the production of biofuels and the development \nof new vehicle technologies, increase the amount of renewable energy \nthe Federal Government is required to purchase, spur the growth of \ntransit-oriented development corridors to help reduce people's \ndependence on cars, and others.\n  But at the very least, we should be allowing other coastal States, \nsuch as New Jersey, the opportunity to protect their own beaches the \nsame way Florida has already been taken care of in this bill. The \ncomplete lack of protections for the New Jersey shore in this bill and \nthe lack of guarantees that something much worse will not come out of a \nconference with the House forces me to oppose this bill. That is our \nfundamental problem. I certainly hope, if the bill is to pass the \nSenate, it certainly does not come back in any way other than its \npresent version, or else we will clearly be forced to do anything and \neverything necessary to achieve its defeat.\n  I yield the remainder of my time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the \nGulf of Mexico Energy Security Act. The legislation will expedite oil \nand gas production in areas that are at least 100 miles from the \ncoastlines of Gulf Coast States and will enable our Nation to reduce \nour dependence on foreign sources of energy. This will improve our \nnational economy and help increase job opportunities for American \ncitizens across the country. It also authorizes the sharing of 37.5 \npercent of the revenue from new production of oil and gas in the Gulf \nof Mexico with the States of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and \nTexas.\n  Mr. President, 12.5 percent of the revenue from this production will \nbe shared with all States through the Land and Water Conservation Fund. \nThe sharing of revenue with States is consistent with the way other \nareas of the country have benefited from oil and gas production, such \nas the western Rocky Mountain region, where 50 percent of oil and gas \nrevenue goes to the producing States.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this legislation will \nreduce Federal spending by $900 million over the 2008 through 2016 \nperiod. It increases domestic energy production and saves the Federal \nGovernment money.\n  The legislation will open 8.3 million acres to production on the \nOuter Continental Shelf, and it will do it responsibly. The offshore \nprogram will be conducted under Federal environmental mandates, \nincluding the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act.\n  As unrest in the Middle East continues, the development of an \nuninterrupted supply of domestic energy becomes more and more important \nto our national interests. Our economic security depends on it. At the \npresent time, 37 percent of our petroleum comes from the Middle East or \nAfrica. This legislation will reduce our dependence on these foreign \nsources of oil and gas.\n  American families and businesses feel the impact of increasing energy \ncosts every day. As gasoline prices rise, the heating and cooling of \nhomes becomes more and more costly. The new supply of natural gas which \nwill be made available by the Gulf of Mexico Security Act is enough to \nheat and cool nearly 6 million homes for 15 years.\n  Small businesses are strained by unexpected increases in the cost of \nenergy. As the cost of raw materials and fuel rise due to supply not \nmeeting demand, the cost of production and transport of goods is passed \non to consumers. Disruptions in our supply mean higher prices, lower \nproductivity, and ultimately the loss of jobs--especially in small and \nmedium size businesses.\n  American manufacturers face intense competition from foreign \ncompanies who have an energy cost advantage. Increased domestic \nsupplies of natural gas would assist our Nation's industries whose \ncompetitiveness relies on natural gas as a raw material. The U.S. \nagricultural industry, for instance, has been facing a natural gas \ncrisis since 1999. Farmers across the country use natural gas for food \nprocessing, irrigation, and in the production of crop-protection \nchemicals and fertilizers. The U.S. fertilizer industry estimates that \nin the 1990s, 85 percent of its domestic needs were supplied through \nU.S.-based production. But today, this industry relies on imports for \nmore than 50 percent of natural gas supplies. This adversely affects \nbusinesses such as Terra Industries in Yazoo City, MS, which produces \nnitrogen fertilizer and relies heavily on natural gas as a feedstock.\n  We must act now to take advantage, in an environmentally acceptable \nway, of our national resources in the Gulf of Mexico. This legislation \nwill do just that. It is estimated that this legislation will provide \nus with 5.8 trillion cubic feet of gas and 1.26 billion barrels of oil. \nThe process to begin extracting those resources could begin almost \nimmediately upon the enactment of this legislation.\n  I compliment the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, \nthe chairman of the Energy Committee, for his leadership in bringing \nthis bill to the floor of the Senate. The Gulf of Mexico Energy \nSecurity Act is a step in the right direction and will benefit our \nentire Nation. I encourage its adoption by the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I intend to speak for about 15 minutes. \nI think that was part of our unanimous consent agreement earlier. I \nknow there are other Senators who want to speak for and against.\n  I wish to begin again by thanking Senator Domenici for his strong and \nable leadership. I want to associate myself with the remarks of the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, the senior Senator from \nMississippi, Mr. Cochran, who has been a real leader in our effort to \npull a coalition of Senators together who are concerned about the \nNation's energy supply and our growing dependence on areas of this \nworld that are not friendly to downright dangerous. This coalition of \nSenators understands how important a partnership is to maintain a long-\nrange, mutually beneficial relationship that helps the coastal States \nthat agree to drill and the Nation that so desperately needs new \nsupplies.\n  I am going to try to answer some of the charges that were made. As \nthe chairman, the Senator from New Mexico, said, some of them are not \nworth responding to because they are so weak on their face. But some do \nneed to be responded to.\n  One of them that I want to set right is President Truman's position. \nSomebody might say: Senator Landrieu, why is it so important to know \nwhat President Truman did? We need to look forward, not backward.\n  But you know, as a leader and as an elected official, I find it very \nhelpful sometimes to understand history--the things we did right and \nthe things we did wrong--because it helps us to make wiser decisions in \nthe future. When so many lives depend on it--300 million, in this case, \nin the United States, and\n\n[[Page S8245]]\n\nmore in the rest of the world--I think it is important for us, as fast \nas we move up here, to try to get it right. So I want to get something \nright for the record. If somebody wants to come down here and debate \nme, please do, because I have many books about the Tidelands oil \ncontroversy with which I am prepared to debate. I have excerpts of the \nveto letter Truman sent. I read the original law. Why would I do this? \nBecause this is very important to my State.\n  The truth of the matter is this: In the late 1940s, we didn't know \nthere was oil and gas in the waters off the coast. I think the first \nwell was found in Pennsylvania, maybe the second one in Texas, and the \nfirst offshore well was off of a pier in California. I say a pier \nbecause that is the way they first were because nobody knew how they \ncould swim out. They made a pier to walk out to put the rig in the \nwater. And lo and behold, they discovered oil and gas. It wasn't soon \nafter that first well, there was a second well offshore in Creole, LA. \nI know about it because it is in my State, a little town that was \nvirtually destroyed by Katrina and Rita, where a lot of brave souls, \npioneers--just like the West is proud of the cowboys and the pioneers \nand the wagon trains that went out West, those of us along the gulf \ncoast, the roughnecks who started this industry, those who own pirogues \nand skiffs and flat boats and walked in the marsh are proud of the \nindustry which we developed.\n  We don't hang our head in shame about it, despite the rambling up \nhere about big oil companies this and big oil companies that. People \nhave made a good living. It helped this country to be the strongest \neconomy in the world and in large measure because of the way we manage \nour resources. We need to do a better job of that.\n  President Truman offered the Gulf Coast States 37.5 percent. He said \nthe land belongs to the Federal Government. There is no question it is \nFederal Government land and it is Federal resources. But as your \nPresident, I will agree to share the bounty.\n  Why? Because he was a smart man. He was an able leader, and wise, and \nknew that sharing is always better than hoarding. It is the first \nlesson kids learn in kindergarten. Why we can't learn it in Congress I \ndon't know. But President Truman figured that partnership is better \nthan in lateral taking. So he offered us 37.5 percent and he put a bill \nin and sent it to the Congress. You can read what happened.\n  But because of States rights issues and all sorts of other politics \nof the time, the Congress, for whatever reason, decided the States \nshould get 100 percent. They amended his law that he sent to Congress \nto give 100 percent and the Federal Government to get nothing. That, of \ncourse, didn't make any sense. And President Truman was correct. He \nvetoed it. I would have, too, if I were the President, and so would \nThad Cochran, if he were the President back then. It didn't make any \nsense.\n  But for Members to come to the floor and read only a part of the \nhistory and use it for their argument is not being forthright. That is \nwhat history books will say. That is why those of us in Louisiana \nunderstood that it was Leander Perez, who was leading the charge for a \ngreater share, 100 percent. We were so angry because we basically ended \nup with nothing. We should have taken the 37.5 percent.\n  That is what brings us here 50 years later--not to rob the Federal \nTreasury, not to ask for something that is not ours but to cut a good \ndeal, a fair deal, a square deal for the people of the gulf coast, for \nthe coastal States, and to honor the wise offer made to us by President \nTruman.\n  Here is a picture of it. I would have no such objection to such a \nprovision, which is similar to existing provisions under which the \nStates receive 37.5 percent of revenues from the Federal Government, \noil-producing public lands within their borders. Because in the 1920s \nthe record will reflect, when oil was discovered on land, the Minerals \nLeasing Act gave 37.5 percent to States such as New Mexico, to States \nsuch as Wyoming, to States such as Colorado. No oil or gas had been \ndiscovered in water. So there was no reason for the coastal States to \nbe included.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is correct because western States came \ninto the Union under completely different rules than the eastern \nStates. There was a lot more western land. So the Minerals Leasing Act \nwas passed. It was set at 37.5 percent. When oil and gas began to be \ndiscovered in little places such as Creole and off the coast of \nCalifornia, there was interest in having the coastal States at 37. But \nbecause there was an overreach, we got nothing.\n  Yes, we have had jobs, we have had economic opportunity. I am not \ndenying that. But what I am saying is a partnership is always better \nthan going it alone. The strategy of going it alone has resulted in not \none new refinery being built in this country in the last 30 years and \nonly expansion very recently, no new nuclear powerplants being built \nuntil recently, and no new areas opened under leasing because of no \npartnership.\n  I wanted to get the Truman issue straight this afternoon.\n  I also want to say that this bill is good overall energy policy. I \nknow we cannot drill our way out of the situation we are in. But we had \nbetter change course. Since 1960, we have been on a course of further \ndependence on oil and gas. We are building and trying to permit more \nliquefied natural gas terminals, which is good, but we are building an \ninfrastructure of dependence. We need to build an infrastructure of \nindependence so that we can make wise choices and not be beholding to \nthe suppliers of a commodity and a resource which we need to keep the \nlights on and to keep this economy moving forward.\n\n  This bill comes to the floor not saying it is the solution to all of \nour energy problems but arguing forcefully that increasing supply is \nimportant and saying we have not done that in over 20 years. We need to \nopen areas of new drilling.\n  As a story, I had a group of French Parliament members from France in \nmy office not too long ago. I cochair the French caucus. We talked \nabout a lot of issues. They were particularly interested in the issue \nof energy. I put up a map of the United States. And first they asked me \nabout nuclear because, of course, the French are leaders of the world \nin that. They produce a different kind energy technology than we do, \nand 80 percent of their energy comes from nuclear sources. They were \nasking me about that. They also asked me about other aspects of the \nenergy legislation. I showed them a map of the United States. I said \nthis is where we allow drilling, and this is where we don't, but we \nthink we might have reserves in many other places. When they saw the \nmap of how restricted drilling is they were dumbfounded. They said: \nSenator, why? This is a great country. America has resources. I said: \nBecause we have a backward-looking approach. We have not recognized new \ntechnology. We have not recognized that you can drill in places and \nminimize the footprint and expand opportunities for the economy while \nmaking sure that you are protecting the environment.\n  This is a step in right direction. The gulf coast is our Nation's \nonly energy coast. Three-hundred million Americans depend on this coast \nto work--and work we do.\n  This is a picture of a graph that I like to show. I have shown it \nmany times. The red is a natural gas pipeline company, and all the \npipeline companies that exist in the Nation. You can see there is a \ngreat cluster right here along the Texas coast, Louisiana, Mississippi \nand Alabama. It comes right here at Mobile Bay. This one lonely little \npipeline brings gas right over here to Florida because we are not able \nto drill for several reasons. That is a subject for another day. But \nthis is the gulf cost compromise. By the nature of it, we all can't get \nwhat we want. It is a compromise. These five States--four that are \ndrilling States and one that is a nondrilling State--have come \ntogether, Senators Martinez and Nelson, all of us, to say: OK. Let's \nstop fighting and let us start working for the benefit of the country. \nLet us give Florida a reasonable buffer, new revenue sharing to these \nStates, open some additional drilling and help the country get the \ndomestic oil and gas it needs. Maybe it makes too much sense for people \nto vote for, but there is another reason that this money is so critical \nto Louisiana and Mississippi, Alabama and Texas and, in particular, \nLouisiana because our topography is\n\n[[Page S8246]]\n\ndifferent. I know people can't grasp it because you do not see pictures \nof it very much. We don't have beaches similar to California and \nFlorida. We have only two. They are 7 miles long each--Holly Beach on \nthe west and Grand Island on the east. All the rest of our coast is \nquite expansive. It is marshland and grassland. It is the home of the \nmouth of the greatest river--the Mississippi River--system in North \nAmerica. That river goes all the way through our country. So this land \nis very fragile. Because of global warming, and because of other \nthings, because of some of the canals that were dredged back in the \nearly days before we understood the degradation that can be caused, \nthis coastal land is eroding. The hurricanes that are coming are more \nfierce and strong. We lost in Rita and Katrina alone total land equal \nto 73,000 football fields. We lose the equivalent of one football field \nevery 38 minutes, 73,000 football fields in 48 hours. That is the size \nof the District of Columbia gone in 2 days because of the great surges \nfrom the water and wind from Katrina and Rita.\n  This money is critical. And unlike our opponents who say there is no \ndirect use of this money, the people of Louisiana are poised to pass a \nconstitutional amendment that all of that money will go to coastal \nrestoration and hurricane protection.\n  I might add we are happy to do that. It is obviously popular and \nquite necessary in the State of Louisiana to do that. That is what our \nState wants to do. I might add that the interior States of New Mexico, \nColorado, and Wyoming have no restrictions. The States that share 50 \npercent of their revenues have no restrictions on the way the money can \nbe spent. They can reduce taxes with it. They can build universities \nwith it. They can build highways with it. They could put it in a trust \nfund and give out a check to everybody who lives in the State. But we \nhave targeted uses for these funds in this bill. We want them to go for \ngeneral environmental purposes and to secure our coast--not just for \nthe benefit of the 10 million people who live along the coast but the \n300 million people who depend on this coast to be there decades from \nnow, hopefully, centuries from now--a very valuable working coast for \nthe Nation.\n  Energy comes from this coast, fisheries come from this coast, the \nMississippi River empties into the gulf here, and 70 percent of the \nrain from the Midwest comes down through this river system. It is \nimportant that we don't wash it away.\n  I know my time is up. I will come back again to speak. Maybe there \nare some other Senators who would like to speak. But I wanted to get \nPresident Truman's position straight for the Record. I wanted to say \nthat our uses are going to go for environmental purposes and I wanted \nto say that without this money the coast will wash away.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order of speakers \nbe as follows: Senators Kyl, Murkowski, Talent, and Alexander, with the \nunderstanding that Democrats will be accommodated if they come to the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I come to the Senate floor to talk \nbriefly about S. 3711, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, \nwhich will open new federally controlled areas in the gulf to oil and \ngas leasing. I support the purpose of this bill as a necessary step in \nsecuring American oil and natural gas for America's energy consumers. \nIt will start to address the root cause of high energy prices which is, \nof course, demand outpacing supply.\n  However, there is one aspect of our Federal oil and gas leasing \nprogram that needs fixing. That program is the Royalty Relief Program. \nI am hoping we will have the opportunity to offer some modest reforms \nto this part of the program.\n  Let me first explain how it works. Royalties are collected by the \nDepartment of Interior from leases as a fixed percentage of the net \nvalue of oil or gas produced from the leased area. The terms of the \nlease specify the royalty rate that applies to future production from \nthat area, on average, about 15 percent, as well as the conditions \nunder which the lessee may qualify for a royalty holiday, a waiver of \nroyalty payments commonly called royalty relief.\n  Mandatory royalty relief was provided pursuant to the Deep Water \nRoyalty Relief Act of 1995 as an incentive to companies to undertake \ninvestment in the deep waters. The incentive was intended to provide \ncompanies that undertook these investments specific volumes of royalty-\nfree production to help recover a portion of their capital costs before \nstarting to pay royalties. The act also gave the Secretary of the \nInterior the authority to limit royalty relief based on market price. \nThese limits are called price thresholds. Price thresholds act to set a \ngross revenue ceiling so that companies do not benefit from both high \nmarket prices and royalty-free volumes.\n  These incentives were offered at a time when oil and gas prices were \nlow and interest in deep water exploration and development was lacking. \nSince the passage of the 1995 act, natural gas production is up 407 \npercent and oil 386 percent based on figures provided by the American \nPetroleum Institute.\n  Despite the program's successes, recent news reports and the \nadministration's own statements suggest that the Government may be \nunable to collect billions in royalties from leases issued under this \nact. Many have probably heard the reports to the effect that in 1998 \nand 1999 the Clinton administration issued leases that did not include \nprice thresholds. Why is this a big deal? It is a big deal because \nenergy prices have skyrocketed and without price thresholds to trigger \npayment of royalties, we will not see a dime from these leases. GAO \nestimates that the mistake could cost up to $10 billion in lost \nrevenues.\n  I wish that were the only problem, but it isn't. A few producers who \nsigned leases in 1997, 1998, and 2000 that did include price thresholds \nhave refused to pay royalty on production even though the thresholds \nhave been exceeded. One of the companies has sued the Department of the \nInterior, arguing that Interior does not have the authority to \nestablish price thresholds for leases issued between 1995 and 2000. \nThis could have significant implications for royalties already \ncollected. GAO estimates the potential return revenue to be almost $60 \nbillion.\n  Despite these concerns, the Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act \nwhich, again, made royalty relief mandatory in deep water leases but \ndid not require that royalty relief be conditioned upon price \nthresholds.\n  This brings me back to the bill under consideration and the modest \nreforms to the royalty program that I seek to offer to improve the \nprogram going forward. First, Congress must require that the Secretary \nof Interior impose price thresholds in all new leases that include \nroyalty relief. Directing the Secretary to include price thresholds in \nall leases is an important near-term action that will ensure that the \nAmerican taxpayer gets a fair return for the oil and gas produced from \nFederal land. The 1998 and 1999 leases demonstrate that the Interior \nDepartment cannot be trusted to do this on its own, and we cannot \nafford another $10 billion mistake.\n  Second, Congress must reaffirm the Secretary's authority under the \n1995 act to put price thresholds in leases. Congress intended that \nroyalties be paid when prices were high. We must ensure this is the \ncase.\n  This bill is a natural place to make these fixes to the Royalty \nRelief Program. After all, any royalty payments made or not made will \ndirectly affect the revenues that can be shared under this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to work with me on these important reforms. I \nhope we can all agree that including these reforms in this bill will \nimprove and not hinder the bill.\n  I conclude by saying that I have spoken with Senator Domenici, the \nauthor of the bill, and that Senator Wyden and I have urged some form \nof this relief be included in the bill. I appreciate very much Senator \nDomenici's leadership on this issue overall and hope that we can reach \nsome kind of agreement.\n  In conclusion, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na\n\n[[Page S8247]]\n\nLegislative Notice produced by the Republican Policy Committee on S. \n3711.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Legislative Notice\n\n          S. 3711--Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006\n\n       Read the second time on July 21, 2006, and placed on the \n     Senate Legislative Calendar under General Orders; no written \n     report.\n\n\n                               noteworthy\n\n       On Monday, the Majority Leader filed a cloture petition on \n     the motion to proceed to S. 3711, the Gulf of Mexico Energy \n     Security Act of 2006. As per Senate rules, a vote on cloture \n     on the motion will occur on Wednesday. The Majority Leader \n     has announced his intention to hold the vote prior to the \n     11:00 a.m. Joint Meeting of Congress.\n       Americans are facing high energy costs due to supply \n     problems for both oil and natural gas, which are having an \n     adverse effect on the nation's economy. Opening up the Outer \n     Continental Shelf (OCS) to energy development would increase \n     U.S. energy supplies, which in turn would help reduce energy \n     prices.\n       In April 2006, the Senate Energy Committee reported S. \n     2253, a bipartisan bill cosponsored by Chairman Domenici and \n     Ranking Member Bingaman, by a vote of 16-5 (with 1 \n     ``present'' vote), requiring the Secretary of the Interior to \n     offer for oil and gas leasing 3.6-million acres of Original \n     Lease Sale 181.\n       Concerns over S. 2253 prompted additional negotiations, \n     culminating in a new bill, S. 3711, which was introduced by \n     Chairman Domenici on July 20 with 10 cosponsors, including \n     Senator Landrieu (D-LA), the Senator who had voted \n     ``present'' on reporting S. 2253.\n       S. 3711 represents a bipartisan agreement among Gulf State \n     Senators to enact legislation that would increase domestic \n     supplies of oil and natural gas.\n\n\n                               highlights\n\n       S. 3711 would:\n       Require the Secretary to offer a portion of the Gulf of \n     Mexico, including a portion of Lease Sale 181 and an area \n     south of Lease Sale 181, for oil and gas leasing.\n       Make available to U.S. consumers an additional 1.26 billion \n     barrels of domestically produced oil and 5.83 trillion cubic \n     feet of natural gas.\n       Put into place a 125-mile buffer until [statutory] 2022 for \n     energy development in waters off the coast of Florida in the \n     Gulf of Mexico.\n       Put some areas within Original Lease Sale 181, previously \n     available for energy development, under moratoria.\n       Extend existing moratoria on energy exploration and \n     development in the Gulf from 2012 to 2022.\n       Distribute 37.5 percent of lease sale revenues (by a \n     formula to be established by the Secretary of the Interior) \n     to Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. These revenues \n     must be dedicated to coastal protection, restoration, and \n     mitigation.\n       Distribute 12.5 percent of lease sale revenues to the \n     stateside Land and Water Conservation fund, which provides \n     matching grants to States and local governments for the \n     acquisition and development of public outdoor recreation \n     areas and facilities.\n       Retain 50 percent of lease sale revenues in the General \n     Treasury.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       The following background information is drawn from two RPC \n     policy papers issued last month and titled, ``Revisiting \n     Energy Development in the Gulf of Mexico,'' and ``Evaluating \n     the Risks of Opening an Area to Energy Development.''\n\n\n         evaluating the need for energy development in the ocs\n\n       Americans are facing high energy costs due to supply \n     problems for both oil and natural gas, which are having an \n     adverse effect on the nation's economy. Crude oil prices, for \n     example, have hovered around $70 per barrel since April and \n     recently reached $77 per barrel. As a result, American \n     consumers have been faced with high gasoline prices, \n     sometimes exceeding $3 per gallon on average.\n       As high as gasoline prices have been, the high price of \n     natural gas may be having a greater impact on the economy. \n     Throughout most of the 1980s and 1990s, the wholesale price \n     (commonly referred to as the ``city gate'' price) of natural \n     gas hovered around $3 per thousand cubic feet. By 2004, \n     wholesale prices exceeded $6, and by the end of 2005, they \n     exceeded $10. Since then, the price has moderated somewhat, \n     but it is still high at $6.19 per thousand cubic feet. In \n     2005, natural gas consumers spent $200 billion on natural \n     gas, which is four times as much as was spent in 1999, the \n     last time natural gas traded within its historic price band \n     (the yearly average wholesale price during the 1980s and \n     1990s was between $2.78 and $3.95).\n       High natural gas prices have led directly to job losses, \n     particularly in the manufacturing sector. The U.S. chemical \n     industry, whose products are found in 96 percent of all U.S. \n     manufactured goods, has been hit hard by high natural gas \n     prices. The industry uses natural gas as both an energy input \n     and as a key ingredient in its products (accounting for more \n     than 10 percent of total U.S. consumption). It has been \n     estimated that, from 2000 to 2005, the industry lost $50 \n     billion in business to overseas competition, and reduced U.S. \n     jobs by 100,000 In the same time frame, the National \n     Association of Manufacturers estimates that, overall, the \n     United States lost 2.9 million manufacturing jobs, due in \n     large part to high natural gas prices.\n       Opening up the OCS to energy development would increase \n     U.S. energy supplies, which in turn would help reduce energy \n     prices. To the extent that energy development would add to \n     the world supply of oil, it would reduce the world price for \n     oil. More importantly, developing domestic natural gas \n     resources would substantially reduce natural gas prices, \n     thereby lowering Americans' heating and electricity bills. It \n     would also help halt job losses in the nation's manufacturing \n     industry and contribute to robust economic growth within that \n     industry and the economy as a whole.\n\n\n                    history of moratoria on the ocs\n\n       The Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), as a whole, is estimated \n     to contain approximately 60 percent of the remaining \n     undiscovered oil in the U.S., or 75 billion barrels of \n     technically recoverable oil. It also contains as much as half \n     of the remaining undiscovered natural gas, or 362 trillion \n     cubic feet of natural gas. However, much of the OCS, \n     including the U.S. waters off the coasts of New England, \n     California, the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, the Mid-Atlantic, \n     South Atlantic, Alaska's North Aleutian Basin, and the \n     Pacific Northwest have been put off limits by Congressional \n     moratoria or Presidential withdrawal.\n       Although Congress had enacted moratoria on Interior \n     Department appropriations bills beginning in 1982, the areas \n     covered by the moratoria varied from year to year. The \n     initial action to remove most of the OCS from energy \n     development activities on a more permanent basis began in \n     1990 when President George H.W. Bush issued an Executive \n     Order prohibiting lease sales off the East and West coasts \n     for 10 years. In 1998, President Clinton, in a memorandum to \n     the Secretary of the Interior, withdrew from leasing through \n     June 30, 2012, those areas of the OCS put under Congressional \n     moratoria in the Department of the Interior and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Act of 1998. Those areas included \n     those previously put under moratoria by President Bush, as \n     well as the North Aleutian Basin, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, \n     and the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic. Not included in \n     either of these Bush or Clinton acts was the Lease Sale 181 \n     area.\n\n\n                       history of lease sale 181\n\n       In November 1996, President Clinton's Secretary of the \n     Interior, Bruce Babbitt, adopted a five-year leasing program \n     (1997-2002) to start the multi-step process to allow for \n     eventual energy exploration and development in the Original \n     Lease Sale 181 area. The Secretary's decision was made after \n     extensive consultations by the federal government with \n     coastal states, including the State of Florida (which, among \n     the Gulf Coast states, has traditionally offered the \n     strongest opposition to energy activities off its coasts).\n       In June 2001, after President George W. Bush came into \n     office, a Final Environmental Impact Statement was completed \n     for the full 181 area, giving the lease owners the green \n     light to begin development activities. However, within weeks, \n     the U.S. House of Representatives passed an amendment to the \n     FY2002 Interior Appropriations bill (H.R. 2217) to prevent \n     the use of funds to execute a final lease agreement. The \n     amendment passed by a vote of 247-164, but was eventually \n     stripped out in conference. However, the strong opposition \n     demonstrated by the House vote convinced the Administration \n     to offer a compromise proposal to adjust the lease sale area \n     from 5.9 million acres to just 1.5 million, such that every \n     point of the proposed area would be at least 100 miles from \n     the coast of Florida.\n       In April 2006, the Senate Energy Committee reported S. \n     2253, a bipartisan bill cosponsored by Chairman Domenici and \n     Ranking Member Bingaman, by a vote of 16-5 (with 1 \n     ``present'' vote). It required the Secretary of the Interior \n     to offer for oil and gas leasing, within a year of enactment, \n     3.6 million acres of Original Lease Sale 181 that were not \n     subject to any moratoria or Presidential withdrawal. Concerns \n     over S. 2253 prompted additional negotiations, culminating in \n     a new bill, S. 3711, which was introduced by Energy Committee \n     Chairman Domenici on July 20 with 10 cosponsors, including \n     Senator Landrieu (D-LA), the Senator who had voted \n     ``present'' on reporting S. 2253.\n       The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee estimated \n     that the area that would have been made available for energy \n     development under S. 2253 contains 930 billion barrels of \n     technically recoverable oil and 6.03 trillion cubic feet of \n     technically recoverable natural gas. This new bill would make \n     available an area for energy development containing 1.26 \n     billion barrels of technically recoverable oil and 5.83 \n     trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable natural gas, \n     according to the Committee.\n\n\n         Evaluating the Risks of Energy Development in the OCS\n\n       As with virtually any economic activity, energy development \n     in the OCS carries risk. A major oil spill, for example, \n     theoretically could occur and could reach the U.S. coast, \n     thereby imposing major costs on the affected state. Such a \n     spill could also inflict significant, even irreversible, harm \n     on certain marine species. Nobody denies these possibilities; \n     nor should the mere possibility of harm (no matter how small) \n     justify inaction. Policy makers attempt to weigh risks and \n     benefits--they evaluate the likelihood of harm\n\n[[Page S8248]]\n\n     and then weigh the potential costs of action against the \n     costs of inaction. When framed in this way, sensible \n     decisions can be made on the acceptable level of risk.\n       An actual analysis of the last 30 years of experience with \n     offshore exploration and production activities shows that any \n     harms are likely to be small in size and cost, and are \n     unlikely to pose a significant threat to the survival of any \n     species populations. Due to advances in exploration and \n     extraction technology, major oil spills associated with U.S. \n     offshore oil and gas production have been virtually \n     eliminated. Indeed, since 1980, there has not been a single, \n     significant oil spill from a U.S. exploration and production \n     platform. The last oil spill to reach U.S. shores occurred 37 \n     years ago, in 1969, in California's Santa Barbara Channel. \n     Further, there is no documented evidence of any oil spill \n     occurring in U.S. waters more than 12 miles from the shore \n     reaching the shore. Moreover, only 2 percent of total \n     petroleum inputs into the U.S. marine environment originates \n     from offshore oil and gas development activities. Rather, \n     fully 63 percent of total petroleum inputs into the U.S. \n     marine environment comes from natural seeps on the ocean \n     floor. This strongly suggests that the risk associated with \n     deepwater energy development is very low.\n\n\n                            Bill Provisions\n\n       [Note: This Notice includes a map that details the area \n     that would be made available for energy development in the \n     deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico under this bill.]\n       Section 1--Title: Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of \n     2006.\n       Section 2--Definitions.\n       Section 3--Offshore Oil and Gas Leasing in 181 Area and 181 \n     South Area of Gulf of Mexico.\n       This section requires the Secretary of the Interior to \n     offer the 181 Area (that is, the tan area within the blue \n     border on the map above) for oil and gas leasing not later \n     than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act. It also \n     directs the Secretary to offer the 181 South Area (tan area \n     outside blue border), previously under moratorium, for \n     leasing as soon as practicable.\n       Section 4--Moratorium on Oil and Gas Leasing in Certain \n     Areas of Gulf of Mexico.\n       This section expands the moratorium on oil and gas leasing \n     to include areas previously available for leasing in the Sale \n     181 Call Area (the full area within the blue border, \n     sometimes referred to as ``Original Lease Sale 181'') and \n     extends moratorium until June 30, 2022. The moratoria apply \n     to: any area east of the Military Mission Line in the Gulf of \n     Mexico; any area in the Eastern Planning Area (east of the \n     green line) that is within 125 miles of the coastline of the \n     State of Florida; or any area in the Central Planning Area \n     (west of the green line) that is within 100 miles of the \n     coastline of the State of Florida (the yellow area, both \n     inside and outside the 181 area, west of the green line).\n       This section provides for oil and gas development east of \n     the Military Mission Line after June 30, 2022, though the \n     Secretary of Defense retains authority to veto leasing in \n     these areas.\n       It also provides that owners of existing oil and gas leases \n     within the areas newly under moratorium may exchange those \n     leases for a bonus or royalty credit that may only be used in \n     the Gulf of Mexico; that the value of the lease to be \n     exchanged will be equal to the amount of the bonus bid and \n     any rent paid for the lease; and that within a year of \n     enactment, the Secretary shall promulgate regulations to \n     govern the lease exchange process.\n       Section 5--Disposition of Qualified Outer Continental Shelf \n     Revenues From 181 Area, 181 South Area, and 2002-2007 \n     Planning Areas of Gulf of Mexico.\n       This section provides that 50 percent of revenues derived \n     from lease sale revenues in the OCS be deposited into the \n     general fund of the Treasury and 50 percent shall be \n     deposited into a special account in the Treasury, 75 percent \n     of which (i.e., 37.5 percent of the total) will be disbursed \n     to Gulf producing States and 25 percent of which (i.e., 12.5 \n     percent of the total) will be disbursed to the stateside Land \n     and Water Conservation fund.\n       The 37.5 percent of total OCS revenues reserved for Gulf \n     producing States shall be distributed according to a formula \n     established by the Secretary of the Interior. The formula \n     will distribute the funds in amounts that are inversely \n     proportional to the distance between the point on the \n     coastline of each Gulf producing State that is closest to the \n     geographic center of the applicable leased tract and the \n     geographic center of the leased tract. In other words, the \n     further away a Gulf producing State is from the leased tract, \n     the less money it gets. Each Gulf producing State shall \n     receive a minimum allocation of 10 percent in each fiscal \n     year.\n       Beginning in 2017, the same allocation formula will apply \n     to the 181 Area and the 181 South Area. For leases entered \n     into for the 2002-2007 planning area, starting in 2017 \n     revenues shall be allocated to Gulf producing States in \n     amounts that are inversely proportional to the distance \n     between the points on the coastline of Gulf producing States \n     that are closest to the geographic center of each historical \n     lease site and the geographic center of the historical lease \n     site, as determined by the Secretary. Again, the minimum \n     allocation for Gulf producing States in each fiscal year is \n     10 percent. Historical lease sites include all leases entered \n     into by the Secretary in the 2002-2007 planning area from \n     October 1, 1982 to December 31, 2015. The ending date will be \n     extended every five years beginning on January 1, 2022. For \n     each of the fiscal years 2016 through 2055, the amount to be \n     distributed from Continental Shelf revenues shall not exceed \n     $500 million.\n       Twenty percent of the share disbursed to each Gulf \n     producing State shall be paid by the Secretary to the coastal \n     political subdivisions of the Gulf producing States to be \n     allocated according to an existing formula.\n       Gulf producing States shall use the amount received under \n     this section only for one or more of the following purposes: \n     coastal protection; mitigation and damage to fish, wildlife, \n     or natural resources; implementation of a federally approved \n     marine, coastal, or comprehensive conservation management \n     plan; mitigation of OCS activities through funding of onshore \n     infrastructure projects; and planning assistance and the \n     administrative costs of this section (no more than 3 \n     percent).\n\n\n                                  Cost\n\n       The Congressional Budget Office estimates that S. 3711 \n     would reduce direct spending by $926 billion through 2016.\n\n\n                        Administration Position\n\n       A Statement of Administration Policy (SAP) on the bill was \n     not available at press time.\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, let me ask that my time be taken from the \ntime allotted to Senator Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Indian Health Care\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will speak to an issue I spoke about \nnearly a month ago in the Senate. Because nothing has happened \nsubstantially since then, I wanted to raise the issue. We are coming to \nthe end of the legislative session. We will be here the rest of this \nweek and next week. The time for consideration is going to be devoted \nto legislation the majority leader has already described. Then we are \noff in August for an August break, back in September, off in October \nfor the election.\n  The issue I want to talk about is the Indian Health Care Improvement \nAct. The reason I want to do that is I want to describe something that \nis happening in this country that very few people think much about, \nperhaps some don't care much about, but I know that there are some in \nthis Senate who do, and I believe they would agree with me that we need \nto move forward and pass the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.\n  Let me describe why this is urgent. Some while ago I came to the \nSenate and told my colleagues about a young woman--I did that with the \nconsent of the young woman's relatives--a young woman named Avis \nLittlewind. Avis was, I believe, 14 years old. Avis took her own life. \nShe laid in a bed for 90 days. She was supposed to have been in school. \nInstead, she lay in a fetal position in bed. At the end of that time \nshe took her own life.\n  No warning signs went up to anyone, nobody from the school, nobody \nfrom the mental health area, the tribe, or the family. Somehow she just \nescaped attention. She, like her sister, 2 years before her who had \nalso taken her life, decided that life was hopeless, that she was \nhelpless, and she ended her life.\n  I went to that Indian reservation because there are clusters of \nteenage suicides on some of these reservations. We had a cluster on the \nStanding Rock Indian Reservation shortly after that period.\n  I talked to the folks on this reservation, the school officials, the \nfamily members, the classmates, the tribal council. I discovered that \nhad this young woman been referred to treatment, there was very little \ntreatment available, very little mental health capability available to \nthis young girl, and that is the case on most reservations.\n  Because I have known about the sad situation with respect to health \ncare for American Indians for some long while, I was not particularly \nsurprised at what is happening with respect to mental health treatment \non reservations.\n  We have a trust responsibility for American Indians. We have a trust \nresponsibility for their health care. We\n\n[[Page S8249]]\n\nfail miserably. We have tried--my colleague, Senator McCain, myself, \nand other members of the Committee on Indian Affairs--to put together a \npiece of legislation to extend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act \nand try to make some improvements in delivery of health care to \nAmerican Indians--yes, for children, but elderly folks and others who \nare suffering. Yet that piece of legislation languishes. Senator McCain \nand I just talked about it yesterday, and the committee wants to get \nthat legislation through, get it passed, complete it.\n  Let me describe the circumstances in terms of numbers. Then I will \ntalk about some of the Indian folks who have had some difficulty. We \nhave a responsibility under Medicare. Here is what we provide: The per-\nperson expenditure on Medicare is $5,900 a year. We also have a \nresponsibility, by the way, for health care for Federal prisoners, \nthose whom we arrest and convict and send to Federal prison, putting \nthem away from society. We provide a cell, a bed, and we are required \nto provide for their health care. With respect to their health care, we \nspend $3,800 a year for Federal prisoners' health care.\n  We have a responsibility, a trust responsibility, for the health care \nof American Indians, as well. That responsibility is met in this \nmanner: Indian Health Care Services medical care, $1,900. We spend \nexactly one-half of what we spend for Federal prisoners on health care \nfor American Indians. The per capita expenditures are exactly one-half.\n\n  I have asked the Indian Health System, the folks in charge, how much \nhealth care is delivered versus what is needed. The answer is about 60 \npercent. Forty percent is not available. So the question is: Who is \nsick, who is hurting, who is injured, who does not get treatment on \nthese Indian reservations?\n  I mentioned, when I spoke about this before, that one of the chairmen \nof the Indian tribes in my State said that you cannot get sick after \nJune. The answer is: Don't get sick after June. If you get sick after \nJune, our contract health money is gone, and you are not going to get \nany help because then the criteria is the only help you get is life or \nlimb. If you lose a limb or lose your life, you get help; otherwise, \nhobble around in pain. Whatever that chronic condition is, sorry, tough \nluck, out of luck, out of money. Don't get sick after June.\n  What an unbelievable message. This is not a Third World country. This \nis a big country, and we do a lot of things. But some things we don't \ndo nearly well enough; and that is, keep our promise and keep our trust \nresponsibilities with respect to health care for Native Americans.\n  A man from the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians in my State \nsaid: Well, the doctor told me that I needed an MRI urgently on my \nknee. But he said: The Indian Health System facility on Turtle Mountain \nhas no money, so you don't get an MRI. You have a bad knee, you have \ntrouble, you have pain, but we are sorry, there is no money to find out \nwhat the problem is. No MRI.\n  A member from the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Tribes had a daughter \nwho was born prematurely and suffered some complications as a result. \nThat child died when she was 2 years old because they did not have any \nfunds, the Indian Health Service had no funds to send that young child \nto a high-risk hospital, one that could probably begin to treat those \nconditions.\n  The chairman of one of the tribes told me one day about being out \nriding a horse with another tribal member when the other member was \ninjured. He was bleeding severely from his injury. That reservation \ndoes not have a 911 emergency service. There was no ambulance to take \nthe man to the hospital, not to mention that the health facility on the \nreservation is not open after hours anyway. And it is not open on \nweekends.\n  On that reservation, there are isolated communities, some 30 minutes, \nalmost an hour from an ambulance or a health care facility. So the \nchairman of this tribe then tried to play doctor and made a tourniquet \nand tried to find a way to get this person to a health care facility \nbefore the person bled to death.\n  It is pretty unbelievable what is happening with respect to Indian \nhealth care. We have a very serious diabetes issue. The prevalence of \ndiabetes on Indian reservations, in many cases, is not double or triple \nor quadruple; it is even much higher than that. The Indian diabetes \nmortality rate is quadruple the diabetes mortality rate among other \nAmericans.\n  On the Spirit Lake Indian Reservation, a couple of the elders ran out \nof insulin. It was not a very good beginning to that story. You need \ninsulin if you have diabetes. But it got much worse. They went to the \nIndian Health Service clinic that serves that reservation, and there \nwas no insulin available--none. They said: We will not get another \nshipment for 24 hours.\n  That sort of thing goes on because there is not sufficient resources \ndevoted to meet our responsibility to the Indian health needs.\n  In addition to the kinds of things I have described--these things are \nrampant--in addition to that, we have this methamphetamine scourge that \nhas a devastating impact all across this country but especially on \nIndian reservations. The statistics that describe the problems and the \nchronic difficulties that the Indian Health Service confronts dealing \nwith methamphetamine is just, as I said, devastating.\n  At a recent hearing we had in the Indian Affairs Committee, a young \nwoman who is a tribal judge from the Turtle Mountain Chippewa \nReservation testified that methamphetamine is related to 90 percent of \nthe cases of tribal individuals who enter treatment on the reservation. \nAnd there are very few places to get treatment, as a matter of fact.\n  The plain fact is, this is an area of responsibility for this \nCongress, and we are not meeting it. We passed a piece of legislation \nthrough the Indian Affairs Committee a long while ago, describing the \nneed and describing the requirement for reauthorizing the Indian Health \nCare Improvement Act, and that bill languishes. We have lots of things \nto bring to the floor of the Senate that should not be here and do not \nneed to be here. This Congress often treats the light far too seriously \nand the serious far too lightly.\n  This is a serious matter, and we ought to be dealing with it. We \nought to deal with it now. We have responsibilities. Go to Indian \nreservations and take a look at these children and ask yourself whether \nthe health care of these children ought to be a function of whether \nthis Congress decides to appropriate enough money. It ought not be. A \nsick child is a sick child anywhere in this country and ought to feel, \nand their parents ought to feel, they have access to decent health care \nwhen that child is sick.\n  So on behalf of myself and Senator McCain and other members of the \nIndian Affairs Committee, I say that I believe this is a priority. This \nis not a Third World country. I do not want anybody to say to me: In \nour area the refrain is ``Don't get sick after June 1 because there is \nno money.'' Let's not have that happen in this country anymore. Let's \nprovide the funding that we require for the Indian Health Service to do \nwhat they should do to provide the kind of health care we know is \nnecessary.\n  Once again, we have responsibility for prisoners whom we incarcerate \nin Federal prisons, and we have trust responsibility for the health \ncare of American Indians; and we are spending half as much for the \nhealth care for American Indians per capita as we spend on Federal \nprisoners. That, in my judgment, is a shame. I am not suggesting we \nspend too much on Federal prisoners. They are our charge. They are \nincarcerated. We are responsible for their health care, but so too are \nwe responsible, under a trust relationship, to help take care of the \nhealth care needs of that population.\n  Mr. President, I hope that with the cooperation of the majority \nleader and others in this Chamber, that Senator McCain and I and others \ncan move this piece of legislation through the Senate and through the \nHouse and get it to the President for signature--the sooner the better.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak to the legislation before us, the OCS \nlease\n\n[[Page S8250]]\n\nsale 181. I know there have been colleagues before me this afternoon \nwho have spoken to the need for additional oil and gas reserves and \nresources in this country. The fact is, this Nation badly needs to \naccelerate its efforts to obtain more natural gas and more oil and \ndoing it domestically.\n  We have heard the comments that we are addicted to oil, that we need \nto be looking to renewables, and I do not dispute or doubt that for one \nmoment. We absolutely do. We need to be conserving more. We need to be \nfocused more on renewables and alternatives. That is the next \ngeneration. But our reality is we are here and now with a reliance on \nfossilized fuels. We need to transition out of that to that next \ngeneration of fuels. But until we do so, we are in an extremely \nvulnerable spot, particularly with our oil and our nearly 60 percent \ndependency on foreign sources and with our natural gas and recognizing \nthe trends in terms of our supply and the demand picture for natural \ngas.\n  In the past 5 years, the price of natural gas in this country has \nmore than tripled, rising sevenfold after last summer's hurricanes. We \nall know the prices at the gasoline pump. There is not a day goes by \nwhere there is not some exchange about what somebody was paying \nsomewhere for a gallon of gas at one location or another. And I can \ntell you, prices in my State--when you get out into the rural \ncommunities and you look at paying $4.50 for a gallon of gasoline, I \ncan tell you, the hurt is real. The tripling of natural gas prices has \nhad, of course, a very severe impact. And it is not just on those who \nheat their homes with natural gas. Manufacturing jobs--we have heard \nthis today--manufacturing jobs have fallen by 3.1 million jobs, 18 \npercent in the past 6 years.\n  We talk to those in the petrochemical and chemical industry. Jobs in \nthat industry are being forced to move overseas. We have had over 20 \nfertilizer plants in this country close. And as has been mentioned \nalready on this floor, America's annual natural gas bill has risen to \nmore than $200 billion a year. This is up from $50 billion, and that \nwas just 6 years ago.\n  While natural gas prices today, following a warm winter, are \ntemporarily below $6 per 1,000 cubic feet, we know the hurricane season \nis coming upon us in the gulf, we have global political disruptions, \nand we could have continued hot summer weather, and that we can \nanticipate a cold winter, and that any one of these--and certainly a \ncombination of them--could promptly send our natural gas prices \nskyrocketing again.\n  I cannot speak to the issue of natural gas without mentioning the \nopportunity we have in Alaska for incredible quantities of natural gas \ncoming down from Alaska's North Slope. And while we await the \nconstruction of a pipeline that can deliver this needed commodity from \nthe North Slope into the lower 48, we have to recognize one of the best \nways we can bring down prices that will increase the domestic supplies \nof gas is to produce more gas from the gulf coast, where the existing \ninfrastructure is in place, and to figure out a way to get that gas to \nmarket quickly.\n  Mr. President, we cannot fool ourselves and say we can just snap our \nfingers and the price of natural gas is going to go down, we are going \nto have a ready and available supply just because we pass legislation. \nWe recognize it is a period of time in coming. But what can be sent is \nthe signal to the market that that supply of natural gas is on its way \nin an expedited manner.\n  The best way--the best way--to produce more gas quickly, to get it on \nmore quickly, is to open parts of the eastern Gulf of Mexico. This \nproposal before us is to finally allow OCS development in part of \nformally proposed lease sale 181 off the Florida, Alabama, and \nMississippi coasts and to open acreage south of that sale--some 8.3 \nmillion acres in all that have been previously closed in moratoria. In \nreturn for speeding such leasing, this bill prevents development within \n125 miles of the Florida Peninsula, swaps out existing leases within \nthat buffer, and prevents leasing east of the Military Mission Line to \nprotect the military training facilities, at least until the year 2022.\n  This proposal, this legislation that we have in front of us, is a \nreasonable compromise. It was one that was attempted but not completed \nduring the debate last year over the Energy Policy Act of 2005. So what \nwe have in front of us today is an outgrowth of that bill.\n  In the Energy Policy Act, we allocated billions of dollars to foster \nenergy conservation and greater energy efficiency. We moved toward and \nwe pushed renewable energy development, such as wind, solar, and \nbiomass. We funded new technology to further coal while working to help \nsequester the carbon. There was a push made on the front of a new \ngeneration of nuclear power. We funded hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle \ndevelopment and new transportation and building technology. There were \ngood things contained within that Energy bill. But what was not \ncontained in that legislation--or since that legislation was passed--\nwas an increase in domestic production of fossil fuel.\n  This legislation will balance last year's Energy bill by actually \nletting us get up to 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas flowing to \nthe market and, again, flowing to the market in a more expedited manner \nthan might otherwise be seen.\n  There have been those who have stood on the floor today speaking \nabout the various protections contained in this legislation. There is a \nprotection of Florida's tourism and military bases. It doesn't \njeopardize the fisheries. When we look to what happened last year when \nthese massive hurricanes came through the gulf, while there were a few \nminor spills following those hurricanes, there were no well failures or \nmajor pipeline breaks from the record intensity of the hurricanes. So \nwe look to the development that is out there in the OCS area and can \nreally point to environmental integrity.\n  The proposal before us gives the States of Alabama, Mississippi, \nLouisiana, and Texas reasonable revenues to offset the impacts of OCS \ndevelopment off of their coasts, particularly, again, in view of what \nthey suffered after Hurricanes Rita and Katrina. It allows the Federal \nGovernment to keep 50 percent of the revenues in the Federal Treasury. \nThis is the exact same percentage that it gets from oil and gas \ndevelopment onshore, whether the onshore development is in New Mexico \nor California or Oklahoma. It gives the coastal States 37.5 percent to \noffset their cost as being the host for that offshore development. It \nalso shares 12.5 percent of such revenues with all the States for park \nand habitat improvements through contributions to the stateside Land \nand Water Conservation Fund. This is an effort to help alleviate the \ntruly chronic underfunding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund \nwithout affecting land ownership and private property rights. This \nmoney would generally go toward building ballfields, neighborhood \nparks, recreational opportunities, not buy up the private land or to \nharm private property rights.\n  As I have reviewed this legislation and have worked with the \nsponsors, I do need to certainly give credit to the chairman of the \nEnergy Committee, Mr. Domenici, for his efforts in bringing this matter \nto where we are today, and also to my colleague from Florida, Senator \nMartinez, who has been working with the chairman to craft legislation \nthat he believes will work for the people of Florida, and certainly to \nmy colleague and friend from Louisiana, who has been working for years \nto achieve a level of revenue sharing for her State, a battle we know \nhas been waged for many years. That is what I would like to speak to \nright now.\n  My only major disappointment with this measure is that it doesn't \nprovide revenue sharing to all the States that choose to allow OCS \ndevelopment off of their coasts. The question has to be asked, why not? \nWhy would you not include all of those States which have made the \nchoice to allow for that development off of their coasts? If they are \ngoing to allow for it, why would they not be eligible or able to take \nadvantage of Federal revenue sharing as well? I don't believe there is \na rational explanation for not including all the States.\n  We have heard some of the arguments--that the Federal Government \nshould share revenues with the States only in those waters from 3 to 12 \nmiles offshore where Federal production\n\n[[Page S8251]]\n\nmight drain onshore or State hydrocarbon reservoirs. Again, the \nquestion has to be asked: Why is that? For the past three decades, the \nFederal Government has shared revenues from onshore development with \nall States. The only possible excuse for not extending that policy to \nthe offshore would be if the coastal States bore no impacts from \noffshore development. But that would imply that somehow or other the \ndevelopment offshore kind of sprouts magically from nowhere without any \nonshore activity. We know that is not the case.\n  I had the opportunity to go to Port Fourchon, LA, which is the \njumping-off place for the offshore activity. It is a beehive of \nactivity through there--airports and helicopter pads, all the services \nthat have to come in, whether it is the food or the people moving back \nand forth, to support that offshore activity. We know that offshore \nactivity just doesn't magically happen without some onshore impact. I \nknow my friend from Louisiana has spoken quite eloquently to the \nimpacts of OCS development in their waters. I will let her and others \nfrom the Gulf States speak to that impact.\n  I wish to talk about the impact of OCS development on my State of \nAlaska. In Alaska, we have been seeking some sort of Federal revenue \nsharing to offset the cost of OCS development along our 34,000 miles of \nshoreline for nearly two decades. For budget reasons, we lost out in \nthe 1991-1992 Energy bill. We lost it again in 1995 with the \nConservation and Recovery Act, CARA. It was proposed and debated. It \nran into other political hurdles. And we lost again last year in the \nEnergy bill. That was partially because you had certain landlocked \nStates that didn't want to see current Federal revenues go to just the \ncoastal States. But you have to stop and think, if there is not some \nfair form of revenue sharing to offset the impact costs, why should the \ncoastal States allow OCS production, particularly given the recent ease \nof obtaining the moratorium to prevent them? And without such \nproduction, where are we going to be as a country? Americans will be \npaying even more when they fill up their cars, their trucks, cook their \nfood, heat their homes. That is reality. That is the consequence.\n\n  In Alaska, we currently have OCS production from just one field. This \nis the Northstar field in the Beaufort Sea. It produced 22.4 million \nbarrels of oil last year. Since it was within 12 miles of the shore, \nAlaska received $10.8 million in revenue sharing. If that field had \nbeen more than 12 miles from the shore, Alaska would have received \nnothing. There is actually a little bit of an exception to that because \nlast year in the Energy Policy Act, there was a very small amount of \naid that was directed to the State for 4 years to assist with the \nimpact onshore of the offshore development.\n  Previously, Senator Bingaman made a point. I believe he was correct \nwhen he said that Alaska contains nearly a dozen OCS bases off of our \ncoast, all but one of them--this is the North Aleutian Shelf, down near \nAlaska's Bristol Bay--being open to leasing. The North Aleutian Shelf \nis closed by Presidential moratorium. But when we look at Alaska's \nOuter Continental Shelf, we are looking at the potential of 26.6 \nbillion barrels of oil and 132 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. This \nis according to the mean estimates. That production would more than \ndouble the Nation's known reserves of oil and nearly equal the amount \nof gas likely along the coasts of the rest of the Nation. But to \naccommodate OCS development and any proposed future OCS development in \nthe Beaufort and Chukchi Seas--we have other potential areas, in Cook \nInlet, the State governmental units--the State of Alaska, the North \nSlope Borough, local governments have to spend millions of dollars on \nhosts of services to protect, to regulate, to inspect, and to support \nthe OCS development.\n  For instance, the State of Alaska's Department of Environmental \nConservation spends more than half a million dollars a year to inspect \nand monitor oil and gas operations. This is just in northern Alaska. \nThe State's Department of Transportation and Public Facilities spends \nnearly $10 million each year to keep the Dalton Highway going up to the \nNorth Slope open so that we can move oil and gas equipment and our \nsupplies north. This also helps to maintain the Deadhorse Airport.\n  The North Slope Borough spends nearly $1 million for search-and-\nrescue capabilities. This is not counting the cost to the Alaska State \ntroopers if they have to mobilize to assist oil workers who might \nperhaps get in trouble. The State of Alaska spends money on coastal \nzone planning to understand the impacts of OCS development. The State \nalso spends millions of dollars on new infrastructure to handle the \narrival and the movement of employees and materials that are needed to \nsupport the oil industry offshore.\n  Last week in Fairbanks, the State broke ground on a $90 million \nexpansion of the Fairbanks International Airport terminal. This \nexpansion is partially needed to accommodate the oil workers who may be \njumping off for OCS work. Last year down in Anchorage, the State \nfinished work on a 440,000-square-foot terminal expansion at the \nairport there, costing well over $100 million. So our airports are \nclearly impacted by the effects on the industry.\n  As things are happening, we see the impact within our communities. \nThe local governments, smaller communities from Barrow to Kotzebue, \nKenai to Dillingham, and Kodiak to Sitka, are all spending money to \nprepare for the possible development of the State's coast. The point is \nto recognize that there are very real costs to offshore development \nthat are borne by the States that serve as service and support bases \nfor the development.\n  It is true that States sometimes recoup part of the costs through \nincome taxes on workers or through property taxes on businesses that \nwill support the facilities onshore. They may gain a small stipend from \nFederal coastal zone planning funds. But when you look at how much is \ngained, it is fair to say that the recovery has seldom covered their \ncosts.\n  So the question would be to the State: Why would you even welcome OCS \ndevelopment off of your coast? This is where you need to take the \nbigger picture. Our energy security, reliability, the whole issue \nsurrounding the vulnerability we have as a nation because of our \nreliance on others for our energy sources, this is why it is essential \nthat we as a nation figure out a way to produce more oil and gas \ndomestically. Sharing oil and gas revenues with States in a fair manner \nwill ensure that energy can get to market. It is that fact which is \nprobably the difficulty with this legislation in terms of passage of a \nfair revenue-sharing system. That may be because we have some around \nhere who would want to discourage States from allowing any OCS \ndevelopment, perhaps out of environmental concerns, perhaps displaced \nenvironmental concerns. But denying coastal States needed revenues is \none way to discourage greater offshore oil and gas production.\n  Last week, Senator Stevens and I sought to ensure that any revenue \nsharing proposed in this bill would apply also to Alaska or to any \nState that allows OCS development off of its shores. We were told at \nthat time that if that provision stays in, it would be a death sentence \nfor this bill.\n  I have been asked many times in the past few days have I changed my \nposition on this legislation, have I changed my position in support of \nopening lease sale 181 to exploration and development. I have not. I \nhave not changed that. I remain committed to a sound policy, which I \nbelieve this is, that allows for the opening of lease sale 181.\n  I can appreciate why it was tailored so that revenue from the gulf \nwould only be shared among the Gulf States. I can appreciate where they \nare coming from. I can appreciate the narrow scope of the Senate \nversion and the delicate negotiation that went into it. But from a \nmatter of equity, from a matter of fairness, for those States that are \nwilling to open their coasts, their States, to allow for the \ndevelopment offshore, it is only right that allowing all the States who \nhave OCS development off their shores to share in some form of revenue.\n  By structuring the revenue sharing that we have before us in this \nlegislation in this manner, Alaska is the only currently producing OCS \nState that allows new development that would not receive any aid. It \nwas suggested last week that, well, Alaska is asking for a special \ndeal. That is absolutely not the\n\n[[Page S8252]]\n\ncase. We are asking to be treated the same as any other currently \nproducing State when it comes to revenuesharing. So to those of you who \nsuggested this was something special for Alaska, it was absolutely not. \nIt was equitable for all those States that are currently producing. So \nby excluding Alaska, we are the only State that is disenfranchised when \nit comes to the Federal revenue sharing right now.\n  I have had an opportunity to go down and observe for myself--so I \nhave seen with my own eyes--what is happening in Louisiana, in the \ngulf, with the erosion. As I was presiding earlier, I was reminded \nagain by the minority leader that Louisiana loses three football fields \nof land a day. But we also, in the State of Alaska, face serious \nerosion challenges. We have some 80 villages that are facing coastal \nerosion problems. I use the word ``problems'' lightly, because in some \nof the communities it is an absolute crisis; the villages are dropping \ninto the ocean. We may not be hit by the hurricane forces we see in the \ngulf that are given names and much publicity through the media, but \nmany parts of coastal Alaska are hit by storms that meet the definition \nof hurricanes. There are winds exceeding 75 miles an hour, waves and \nstorm surges that can equal those of the hurricanes. The big difference \nis they are not named as hurricanes. We don't get that attention or \nthat focus. Money from OCS development could help pay for mitigation \nefforts and perhaps, in some cases, pay for village relocation costs. \nSo Alaska is not unlike the other Gulf States--Louisiana, Mississippi, \nAlabama, and Texas--for coastal mitigation and habitat protection.\n  I am sure we will have an opportunity on this floor to discuss a lot \nmore about the coastal erosion problems in Alaska in the future. I do \nfeel strongly that we need to pass a bill to speed oil and natural gas \nleasing in the Gulf of Mexico. It will provide natural gas for our \nNation, while helping the Gulf Coast States gain the revenues they need \nnot just to recover from the hurricanes but to deal with the coastal \nerosion and wetlands habitat loss issues they face.\n  I believe the formula for such aid should cover all States that allow \nOCS development off their coasts, while providing other aid to all \nStates that need it.\n  I tell my colleagues that, regardless of the outcome of the bill--and \nI intend to support the measure--I will continue to seek to provide aid \nto all of the coastal States that allow OCS development, especially \nsince all other States gain an equal sharing of revenues from energy \ndevelopment on-shore. It truly is the only equitable thing to do.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak on the measure without counting against the time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 3711, the Gulf of \nMexico Energy Security Act, which can certainly be described simply \nthat it will open a portion of the gulf to exploration for oil and \nnatural gas.\n  I don't want to be understood as criticizing or begrudging anybody \ntheir opinions in opposition to the bill, but it seems to me that given \nwhat the country has gone through and is going through because of the \nhigh cost of energy, it should not be a difficult debate to allow the \nUnited States to explore for oil that is within or close to its \nborders, doing that in a way that is sensitive to the environment and \nto other considerations in order to produce more oil and natural gas \nthat will lower costs, ease the pressure on our consumers, and allow \nour economy to grow and continue to produce jobs.\n  How difficult is it in a time such as this to decide that we are in \nfavor of getting more oil and natural gas? I speak as a person who \noffered the renewable fuel standard in committee. I am cochairman of \nthe renewable fuels caucus. I am a huge believer that ethanol, \nbiodiesel, and renewable fuel attained through those feedstocks and \nother feedstocks is the future of this country in terms of energy. It \nis the way we are going to get energy independence and reduce \ndependence on foreign oil in the long term.\n  But our people need relief now, or as soon as we can get it to them. \nNatural gas prices set record highs last winter. They exceeded $15 per \nthousand cubic feet. We are paying much higher than our competitors are \npaying and, as a result of that, according to the Industrial Energy \nConsumers of America, since 2001, natural gas prices have significantly \ncontributed to the loss of 3 million manufacturing jobs and the \nshifting of future investment overseas.\n  I know this is true. There are people who have come to my office and \ntold me they don't want to send jobs overseas, but they cannot compete \nbecause of the high cost of natural gas. The Government has encouraged \nindustry to use natural gas and utilities to use natural gas in \nproducing energy because natural gas is a clean fuel. We have all heard \nthe commercials--and it is true--that natural gas is environmentally \nvery friendly. It makes no sense to pass laws and otherwise encourage \nproducers to rely on natural gas and then not to explore for the \nnatural gas we have available.\n  It is hurting the American farmer. It hurts the farmers for a lot of \nreasons. Farmers have to absorb the high energy costs just as any other \nconsumer, but, specifically, most of the price of nitrogen \nfertilizers--90 percent of the price of nitrogen fertilizers is due to \nthe cost of natural gas, because natural gas is a feedstock in the \nproduction of virtually all commercial nitrogen fertilizers \nmanufactured in the United States. It is not just used to power the \nfacilities that produce fertilizers; it is actually part of the \nfertilizer itself. So in 2002, farmers were paying $250 per ton for \nanhydrous ammonia, and in 2005, $415 per ton, an increase of well over \n50 percent.\n  Why is this happening? Why is the price of natural gas and oil going \nup? It is because supply relative to demand is going down. Demand is \nexpected to grow--demand for natural gas--by over 30 percent. Yet, \nsince 1998, even though we are drilling more for natural gas, \nproduction has declined by 1.5 percent. That shows we are getting all \nwe can out of the available fields. Yet that is not enough. We must \nhave access to domestic resources and specifically to the easily \nrecovered oil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Energy is vital to any economy. We all know that. We have learned in \nthe last year or two that high energy prices are certainly not a good \nthing. That is something most of us knew as a matter of common sense, \nbut we have now learned that as a matter of experience.\n  We can make a difference with this piece of legislation and we can \nmake a difference soon. Resource estimates for the area that would be \nopened indicate that there are 1.26 billion barrels of oil there and \n5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. The natural gas supply made \navailable by this compromise legislation would be enough to heat and \ncool nearly 6 million homes for 15 years. I don't know why they use 6 \nmillion homes for 15 years as a measurement, but that surely seems a \nlot to me, and certainly it is a lot more natural gas than we now have \navailable.\n  I have listened to the arguments offered against the legislation. A \nlot of them have centered around where the revenue from the natural gas \nexploration is going to go. A lot of it is going to go to the coastal \nStates under this compromise. I certainly would be willing to consider \nsomething that directed that revenue somewhere else. But the reality is \nthis is what we have to do in order to get the oil and natural gas in \nthe first place. If we cannot pass this legislation, there is not going \nto be any exploration. If there is no exploration, there are no \nrevenues. So I am certainly willing to support the legislation on that \nbasis. It will help ease the energy situation for the employees of my \nmanufacturers in Missouri. It will help ease the price of fertilizer \nfor my farmers. It will help ease the energy crisis in this country. \nClearly, it seems worth doing to me.\n  It is certainly not all we need to do. We should not structure our \nenergy policy on the assumption that we can\n\n[[Page S8253]]\n\ncontinue to rely on oil and natural gas indefinitely, because we \ncannot. That is why the Energy bill last year encouraged a production \nof so many other different kinds of energy--nuclear, renewables, coal, \nwind. It is all important to the future, but this is important to the \nfuture as well. So I am pleased to support the legislation.\n  I congratulate the Senators who have worked so hard on a bipartisan \nbasis. I know it has not been easy. Certainly, it has been nowhere near \nas easy as it should have been given the common sense that I think \nunderlies this piece of legislation. I am glad they put it together. I \nhave wanted to do something such as this for some time. It makes no \nsense when our manufacturers are crying for energy, our farmers are \ncrying for energy, our consumers need energy, to turn down the \nopportunity to explore for the energy we have right offshore and that \nwe can get in a way that fully protects the environment and other \nconcerns.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senate for its indulgence, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on behalf \nof S. 3711 and that the time not be counted against the Republican \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 3711, which is the \nGulf of Mexico Energy Security Act. I am heartened by the fact that \nthis is a bipartisan effort, agreed to by those Senators who represent \nour Gulf States. It is an important step in continuing to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil, and we need to increase our supply of \ndomestic oil and gas. Certainly, this is a step in the right direction.\n  My approach to the energy needs of this country has always been that \nwe need to have a broad-based approach. I was pleased with the Energy \nbill we passed in the last session of Congress which provided for a \nbroad approach to meet our energy needs in this country.\n  I think we understood as a body that in order to meet the short-term \nneeds of this country's energy needs, we need to continue to rely on \nfossil fuels. We need to continue to expand exploration for oil and \ngas. We need to continue to rely on coal. But in addition, we also need \nto be looking at additional sources of energy, particularly the \nrenewable energy area, which is wind, solar, geothermal, and biofuels, \nas well as looking at sources such as hydroelectric and nuclear power.\n  As I look back on the effects of that bill we passed last session, I \nam already beginning to see positive effects from that legislation, and \nI am heartened by that. I can see those energy developments occurring \nin my own State, which involves new technologies, such as looking at \noil shale as a source of a high-grade fuel that requires little \nrefinement.\n  Our current energy prices clearly still indicate that all is not well \nwith supply, and the demand is still greater than supply. We need to \nalso look at conservation. But right now with this bill, we are \nconcerning ourselves with supply.\n  While the price of natural gas is well below what it was this time \nlast year, these prices are still well above what we were paying \nseveral years ago; and, as my colleague from Missouri mentioned, it is \nhaving an adverse impact throughout our economy, not the least of which \nit is having a serious adverse impact on our agricultural sector.\n  I believe the fact that prices have decreased at all is directly due \nto the fact that we passed the Energy Policy Act last year. We have all \nseen the figures: 27 new ethanol plants have broken ground; 401 E-85 \nfueling pumps have been installed. These are pumps that provide an \nethanol-gasoline mixture. And the number of hybrid vehicles has \nincreased. Between now and the year 2020, the 15 new efficiency \nstandards included in the bill will save 50,000 megawatts of energy, \nand the amount of electricity generated from renewable sources has \nincreased dramatically. But we need to do more to encourage domestic \nproduction of oil and gas.\n  It is argued--and I think argued well--that we should be reducing our \nenergy consumption and increasing the amounts of energy we get from \nrenewable and alternative sources. I agree. But the reality is that \nreducing consumption and increasing alternative resources does not \nhappen overnight. I cannot ask my constituents to park the car and turn \noff the lights until we get there.\n  The estimates of the resources that will be made available under this \nproposal are 1.26 billion barrels of oil and 5.8 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas. These are not insignificant amounts. These resources will \nprovide a strong source of domestic energy for our country.\n  I believe that the compromise struck by this bill is a good one. The \nfact that almost every Member who represents a coastal State that is \naffected cosponsored this bill strikes me as significant. I strongly \nbelieve in local control, and as part of that, I often defer to Members \nwho represent a State if a bill will directly affect that State. I use \nthe example of wilderness designation. If a bill designating wilderness \nin a certain State is sponsored and supported by both Members of that \nState, I see no reason not to support it. The same is true here. If the \nMembers from the coastal States are supportive of this bill, I support \nthem.\n  I was hopeful that we would have the chance to address an amendment I \nwanted to offer on funding for the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program. \nThis particular program is extremely important to States, such as \nColorado, that have a high percentage of federally owned land. Many \npeople are unaware of the fact that 35 percent of Colorado is owned by \nthe Federal Government. Federal ownership of these lands can be \nbeneficial, but there is an unseen cost to local communities, to local \ngovernments. The Federal Government does not pay property taxes, and \nthis translates into reduced revenue for local governments while there \nare some costs that they are burdened with in trying to meet the needs \nof the Federal agencies that are in that county or local community.\n  For Colorado, it means $129 million each year in lost property tax \nrevenue. This is funding that could be used for education, law \nenforcement efforts or road building. Unfortunately, PILT, or payment \nin lieu of taxes, is chronically underfunded, and the amendment I \nplanned on offering would have helped to overcome this annual \nshortfall.\n  Regardless of the fact that my amendment will not be considered, I am \npleased that we are moving on this bill. I am hopeful that we can \ncontinue to put in place policies that will allow us to increase \ndomestic production of all energy sources which will, in turn, reduce \nour reliance on foreign sources.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I withhold my request, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, is there a limit on the amount of time \nI may speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator needs consent to speak, as the \nmajority's time has expired.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, 2 years ago, the Senator from South \nDakota, Mr. Johnson, and I introduced a bill we called the Natural Gas \nPrice Reduction Act. We did that to give focus to the energy debate. We \nwere hearing a lot about the price of gasoline. Gasoline prices were \nhigh and remain high because of the huge supply and demand around the \nworld. We know that. We know that is going to continue for a while, \nmost likely. We know that China is growing. We know that India is \ngrowing. We know that the United States and our huge economy uses 25 \npercent of all the oil in the world. And so the supply and the demand \nare going to require that the price of oil, therefore gasoline, is \ngoing to be high for a while.\n  We wanted to shift the focus to natural gas, which we didn't hear \nabout as much at that time, because natural gas prices in this country \nhad gone from the lowest in the world to the highest in the world. This \nwas a huge problem for our country.\n  High gasoline prices are a big problem every day. Natural gas prices \nare a bigger problem every day. They are a bigger problem for farmers \nwho have seen their fertilizer costs go up. They\n\n[[Page S8254]]\n\nare a bigger problem for homeowners as they pay to heat and cool their \nhomes, and they see their bills go up. They are a bigger problem for \nblue collar workers in this country, such as the 1 million blue collar \nand white collar men and women--Americans in good-paying jobs--who work \nin the chemical industry. These are the kinds of jobs about which we \nall make speeches. We don't want them to be outsourced. We don't want \ntheir jobs to go overseas.\n  If a chemical plant uses natural gas as a raw material--meaning, for \nexample, as Dow Chemical testified before our Energy Committee that 40 \npercent of the cost of its product was natural gas--and if the price of \nnatural gas is $14 or $15 a unit in the United States compared to $2 or \n$3 a unit in some other part of the world that has a good, reasonable \neconomy, guess where that chemical plant is going to end up. It is \ngoing to be there, not here. Guess where those 1 million jobs are going \nto be. They are going to be there, not here.\n  That is why of the 70 or 80 new chemical plants being built around \nthe world, only one of them is in the United States. There are several \nreasons for that, but the main reason is the high cost of natural gas.\n  So for the farmer, for the blue collar worker, for the homeowner, the \nhigh price of natural gas is a great big problem. We saw that 2 years \nago, and so Senator Johnson and I offered our bill to try to lower the \nprice of natural gas.\n  Energy policy is like a big freight train. It is hard to get started, \nit takes a long time to get going, and then it is hard to stop.\n  So the Energy Policy Act that the Congress adopted in a bipartisan \nway a year ago, which included a great many of the parts of our Natural \nGas Price Reduction Act, is just beginning to have some effect. But \ntoday as we talk about this deep sea drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, it \nis important that we put it in the context of the whole picture because \nthis is the whole picture: If we want to reduce the price of natural \ngas in the United States and lower the cost of home heating and cooling \nbills, and lower the cost of fertilizer for farmers, and if we want to \nkeep those chemical jobs and other jobs in the United States, then \nthere are several things we need to do.\n  The first thing we need to do is conservation, and the Energy Policy \nAct of a year ago had an important section on conservation.\n  The second thing we need to do is produce large amounts of \nelectricity in some way other than using natural gas. Using natural gas \nto produce electricity is like burning the antiques in your backyard to \nmake a fire. But most of the new electric powerplants have been using \nnatural gas over the last 10 or 15 years.\n  The Energy Policy Act had important new sections to encourage the use \nof nuclear power, which supplies 20 percent of our power while \nproducing no mercury, no sulfur, no hydrogen, and no carbon. It is 70 \npercent of our carbon-free energy. That affects global warming.\n  So the first way to reduce the cost of natural gas is conservation. \nWe provided for that.\n  The second way was to encourage nuclear power, and there has begun to \nbe a renaissance of nuclear power production in the United States.\n  The third thing we did was to encourage the production of power from \nclean coal. Fifty percent of our electricity comes from coal. We have a \nlot of coal. We are the Saudi Arabia of coal--we all say that--but it \nis dirty. It does produce mercury, it does produce nitrogen, it does \nproduce sulfur, and it does produce carbon. So we need clean coal, and \neventually we need to capture the carbon, put it in the ground to store \nit somewhere, and we need large amounts of energy.\n  We also had significant dollars in support of renewable energy, \nwhether it was for fuels or for electricity. We also made it easier to \nimport natural gas through LNG terminals from around the world, which \nwe are going to have to do for a while. We also made it easier to \nrefine. All of those things had to do with natural gas. But one thing \nwe didn't do was increase our supply of natural gas at home.\n  But we have come a long way. Two years ago, you couldn't even talk. \nYou couldn't have a polite conversation on the Senate floor about \noffshore drilling because it was an unmentionable word. People would \nrun out of the room as if you said something bad. But, last year, when \nthe Energy Policy Act came up, we had a majority of votes on this floor \nfor an offshore drilling provision that would have permitted a State \nsuch as Virginia, for example, to drill for gas and oil--with the rigs \nso far off the coast you couldn't see them--and give a share of the \nrevenues to Virginia, which it might use for education or to lower \ntaxes or for coastal beach refurbishment, and put the rest in the \nFederal Treasury. That is a pretty good idea, but we couldn't get it \npassed because here it takes 60 votes to overcome objections from a \nminority of senators.\n\n  We also had the perfectly obvious idea of enlarging the area of \ndrilling in the area called Lease Sale 181 in the Gulf of Mexico, deep \nsea drilling for natural gas which we are talking about today, but we \nweren't able to do that a year ago. So what this piece of legislation \ndoes--at a time when high natural gas prices still are problems for the \nhomeowner, the blue-collar worker, and the farmer in this country--is \nto give the most immediate relief we can in terms of supply. It doesn't \ntake the place of conservation. It doesn't take the place of nuclear \npower. It doesn't take the place of coal or renewable energy or LNG or \nall of these other things we authorize--but it adds to that, and we \nought to do it. Lease Sale 181 means that the four gulf producing \nStates will have a chance to share in the revenues that come; that is \ncoastal assistance in this area damaged by the hurricanes.\n  Twelve and a half percent of the revenues will go to the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund, so every State will have that for city parks, \nsoccer fields and other things. That is an appropriate use. The \nremaining half of the revenues will go to the Federal Treasury.\n  So I am delighted that this bill has come to the floor. I was \ndelighted with the large vote we had this morning--86 votes--to move \nahead. I am very hopeful that with the cloture vote on Monday, we will \nhave more than 60 votes.\n  I believe this is important for the American people to know that \nsometimes senators stand up and say: Well, why are we debating this \nissue or that issue? I see the assistant Democratic leader on the \nSenate floor. Sometimes I hear the assistant Democratic leader saying \nthings like: Why are we talking about this issue or that issue? Why \naren't we talking about gasoline prices or natural gas prices? Mr. \nPresident, we are. This legislation is about natural gas prices, this \nis about blue-collar workers, this is about farmers, and this is about \nhomeowners. This is the way we increase the supply and lower the price.\n  It is that simple: produce energy here instead of bringing it in from \nthe Middle East or some other part of the world.\n  Senator Domenici deserves an enormous amount of credit for working on \nthis bill, as do Senator Martinez, Senator Landrieu, Senator Vitter, \nand many others. The bill is a limited, sensible step in the right \ndirection. I would like to see us go further and give Virginia the \nopportunity if it wishes to have offshore drilling, but that would \ndisrupt the consensus we have here, and I don't want to disrupt that \nconsensus.\n  So it is very important that the American people know that as we \ncontinue the debate this week and then come back here Monday and vote, \nwe will be voting on the surest way to increase the supply of natural \ngas in this country. That will make it more likely for the 10,000 \nworkers at Eastman Chemical in east Tennessee that their jobs will stay \nin east Tennessee instead of moving to Germany, and that the farmers' \njobs will stay in west Tennessee instead of moving to Brazil, and that \nthe homeowners will be able to turn on their heat in the winter and \nturn up their air-conditioner in the summer and still be able to afford \nit. That is exactly what this is about. A vote for this legislation is \na vote for the blue-collar worker, for the farmer, and for the \nhomeowner, and a vote against it is a vote against the blue-collar \nworker, against the farmer, and against the homeowner. That is pretty \nsimple. That is pretty straightforward. We have several days to think \nabout it.\n  I am delighted to see that there are Democrats and Republicans for \nthis. I\n\n[[Page S8255]]\n\nhope the large number of votes we saw in favor of cloture this morning \ncontinues.\n  We have a big economy, which means we have big energy needs. Yes, we \nwant the conservation we put into law a year ago. We want this \nrenaissance of nuclear power. We want clean coal with carbon \nrecaptured. We want renewable power, we want LNG from overseas, and we \nwant other things. We want more refining capacity. But supply is a part \nof the picture, and the legislation we are debating today is the most \nobvious example of increasing supply.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation. I am delighted \nwith the way the leadership has presented it to the Senate. It will \nhelp the country. I hope the blue-collar workers, the farmers, and the \nhomeowners are listening because this debate and this vote will be \nabout them and their future and their pocketbooks.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thought my colleague from the great \nState of Tennessee, Senator Alexander, made an excellent statement. \nAlthough I might disagree with some part of it, I really believe he is \nspeaking to this issue in good terms. I was heartened by the fact that \nthe first thing he said about energy was conservation. I believe that \nis a critical starting place.\n  I am going to give the Senator from Tennessee four numbers--not for \nthe lottery, for the Powerball or anything, but four numbers to think \nabout. The numbers are 3, 25, 4, and 3 again. Here is what they \nsignify.\n  We have within our command and control in the United States of \nAmerica 3 percent of the energy reserves of the world--3 percent. \nEverything we could possibly turn to and explore and bring out of the \nEarth, whether offshore or in the continental United States, is 3 \npercent.\n  Twenty-five: We consume 25 percent of the world's energy. It is clear \nthat we cannot drill our way into energy independence. It just does not \nwork. The numbers do not come together.\n  The next number is 4. Four represents the number of months of natural \ngas which we hope we can bring out of this offshore drilling for the \nUnited States--a 4-month supply of natural gas for our country.\n  The final number, 3, represents a 3-month supply of the oil our \ncountry consumes.\n  So as important as exploration is and finding new sources, you had \nthe right starting point. You hit the nail on the head. We cannot drill \nour way out of energy dependence, looking at the 3 percent that we \nhave, the 25 percent we consume, and we cannot rely on even offshore \ndrilling to give us more than just a respite from the demands we are \ngoing to face in the future, the competition we face around the world.\n  So my feeling--and I think the feeling of many on both sides of the \naisle--is what we should look for is environmentally responsible \nexploration.\n  I have made no secret of the fact that I think the notion of drilling \nin the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a terrible idea. It has been \nrejected by Congress year after year. It is an act of environmental \ndesperation that we would go to a wilderness area--a wildlife refuge \narea, I should say to be more specific--and say that after a few years, \nwe have to start drilling there because there is no other place for \nAmerica to go in order to give us confidence we will have energy \nsources in the future. So I haven't hidden my feelings about that \nparticular project, but I am open to the suggestion that this may work.\n  I have not made a final commitment on the bill pending before us. I \njoin with my colleagues in moving it forward. Let's move this debate \nforward. Let's bring this issue to the floor.\n  A couple of the things mentioned by the Senator from Tennessee are \nintriguing. Nuclear power--I am not sure nationally how much \nelectricity is generated by nuclear power. It may be a third, it may be \na little more.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, if the----\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The answer is 20 percent of all our electricity in the \nUnited States and 70 percent of our carbon-free electricity is produced \nby nuclear power.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee. In my \nhome State of Illinois, the number is 50 percent. Fifty percent of our \nelectricity is generated by nuclear power. So for those who say: Get \nrid of it tomorrow, they better be ready to sit in darkness for a while \nin my State of Illinois if that is their option.\n  But I hope the Senator from Tennessee feels as I do, that the future \nof nuclear power is wedded to two issues we have to deal with \nforthrightly: what are we going to do with the nuclear waste that is \nlikely to threaten us in some form or another for generations to come, \nfor hundreds, if not thousands, of years; and secondly, how do we \npromote nuclear power without promoting the production of nuclear \nweapons?\n  We are facing that issue everywhere--in North Korea, in Iran. As we \nlook at the world, we worry that countries moving toward nuclear power \nare, in fact, also creating an option for the production of nuclear \nweapons, which would make the world perhaps more self-sufficient when \nit came to electricity but in a more dangerous state if it led to \nnuclear proliferation.\n  Those are the two challenges with nuclear power as I see them.\n  I believe--maybe I am not being realistic here, but I believe they \ncan be addressed and they should be addressed. If we address them in a \nresponsible fashion, the day may come--and I hope it does--when we can \nsay that the spent nuclear fuel rods coming out of the nuclear \npowerplants are no longer a threat to the health and safety of America \nand that the production of nuclear power is not an invitation to \nproduce nuclear weapons. Those are two things I think we have to face \nhead-on.\n  I am lured by the notion that this is carbon-free power--\nelectricity--having seen a production of a documentary by a gentleman \nfrom Tennessee by the name of Gore. Al Gore's documentary ``An \nInconvenient Truth'' was an unsettling experience as he laid out in an \nhour and a half or so, I thought with real clarity and precision, the \nchallenge of global warming and what will happen if we continue to add \ncarbon dioxide to the atmosphere, increasing greenhouse gases and \nglobal warming, watching climate change, and all of the things that are \nlikely to occur. It is a challenge to all of us. So I salute the \nSenator from Tennessee because there are many things he said with which \nI agree.\n  I am going to look at this bill carefully. I am troubled; I think the \nallocation of money to the States is very generous. It is a departure \nfrom where we have been in the past for offshore drilling to this \nextent, this far away from the coast. But I am going to look at it \ncarefully and honestly to see if it is the right approach before I make \na final decision. But I thank him for his statement on the floor here \nthis evening relative to energy, and there is probably more that brings \nus together than divides us on this important issue.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin pertaining to the introduction of S. 3744 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 25th \nanniversary of the Tahoe Rim Trail Association--an organization of \nvolunteers that came\n\n[[Page S8256]]\n\ntogether to build one of the world's premier trails--the Tahoe Rim \nTrail. This Saturday, the association will hold a Silver Anniversary \nCelebration to honor this occasion, and I am pleased to acknowledge \ntheir efforts here today.\n  The Tahoe Rim Trail Association is a successful public-private \npartnership that was founded in 1981. The original idea was to bring \ntogether community leaders, volunteers, and government agencies such as \nthe Forest Service and the Nevada Division of State Parks to establish \na trail around the Lake Tahoe Basin. Working hand-in-hand, volunteers \ncreated the incredible 165-mile trail that now exists around Lake \nTahoe, allowing visitors a new way to experience one of the most \nmagnificent places in America.\n  Visitors to the Tahoe Rim Trail are struck by the incredible \ndiversity of the landscape and the wealth of wildlife. From the \nwildflowers of our alpine meadows to the soaring mountain peaks of the \nSierra Nevada, the Tahoe Rim Trail offers something for everyone. \nVisitors to the trail enjoy a diverse range of opportunities from \nhiking and backpacking to horseback riding and mountain biking. \nPortions of the trail are also handicapped accessible so that everyone \nmay enjoy this important piece of our State's rich natural heritage.\n  Although the trail is now complete, the Tahoe Rim Trail Association \ncontinues to educate visitors about the trail. Every Tuesday and \nSaturday during the summer months, the association organizes a group of \nvolunteers to maintain and enhance the trail. These important efforts \nand community partnerships ensure that Nevadans, Californians, and \npeople from around the world will be able to enjoy the beauty of the \nLake Tahoe Basin for generations to come.\n  I am pleased to recognize the 25th anniversary of the Tahoe Rim Trail \nAssociation, and I hope that all of my colleagues will have the \nopportunity to visit this incredible part of Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/26/senate-section/article/S8256-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8256-S8257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        16TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, July 26, marks the 16th anniversary \nof the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  On this 16th anniversary, we celebrate one of the great, landmark \ncivil rights laws of the 20th century--a long-overdue emancipation \nproclamation for people with disabilities.\n  We also celebrate the men and women, from all across America, whose \ndaily acts of protest and persistence and courage moved this law \nforward to passage 16 years ago.\n  We celebrate some 50 million Americans with disabilities, who now \nbegin each day with the right to equal opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living, and economic self-sufficiency.\n  That is the triumph we celebrate today.\n  That is the spirit that made the Americans with Disabilities Act \npossible.\n  And that is the promise that will continue to move this country and \nthe disability community forward.\n  Our society is so dynamic and so rapidly changing, we are often \noblivious to quiet revolutions taking place in our midst. One such a \nrevolution has been unfolding since the Americans with Disabilities Act \nbecame law 16 years ago.\n  How soon we forget that, prior to the ADA, Americans with \ndisabilities routinely faced prejudice, discrimination, and exclusion--\nnot to mention physical barriers to movement and access in their \neveryday lives. People with disabilities faced blatant discrimination \nin the workplace. They were often denied employment, no matter how well \nqualified they were. People in wheelchairs faced a nearly impossible \nobstacle course of curbs, stairs, and narrow doors.\n  One of those courageous people who fought for passage of the ADA was \na young Iowan with severe cerebral palsy named Danette Crawford. I \nremember vividly when I first met Danette in 1990, when I was making \nthe final push to get ADA through Congress. She was just 14 and one of \nthe brightest persons I had ever met. I talked to her about what ADA \nwould mean to her in terms of educational and job opportunities--\nensuring that she would not be discriminated against in the workplace.\n  She listened to all this, and in her wonderful way, she said: \n``That's very nice, very important, Senator. But, you know, all I \nreally want to do is just be able to go out and buy a pair of shoes \njust like anybody else.'' And, of course, she was right. That is \nexactly what the ADA is all about.\n  The reach--the triumph--of the ADA revolution is all around us. It \nhas become part of America. In May, I attended a convention in downtown \nWashington of several hundred disability rights advocates, many with \nsevere impairments. They arrived on trains and airplanes built to \naccommodate people in wheelchairs. They came to the hotel on Metro and \nin regular busses, all seamlessly accessible by wheelchair. They \nnavigated city streets equipped with curb cuts and ramps. The hotel \nwhere the convention took place was equipped in countless ways to \naccommodate people with disabilities. A woman on the dais translated \nthe speeches into sign language so that people with hearing \ndisabilities could be full participants.\n  For those of us who are able-bodied, these many changes are all but \ninvisible. For a person who uses a wheelchair, they are transforming \nand liberating. So are provisions in the ADA outlawing discrimination \nagainst qualified individuals with disabilities in the workplace and \nrequiring employers to provide ``reasonable accommodations.''\n  Just as important, the ADA has changed attitudes. It used to be \nperfectly acceptable to treat people with disabilities as second-class \ncitizens, to exclude and marginalize them. I remember my brother, \nFrank, who was deaf. Frank was the real inspiration behind all of my \nwork in the Senate on the Americans with Disabilities Act. He passed \naway 6 years ago, a month before the 10th anniversary of ADA. He always \nsaid that he was sorry that the ADA was not there for him when he was \ngrowing up but that he was very happy that the ADA is here now for \nyoung people so they can have a better future.\n  Frank lost his hearing at an early age. Then he was taken from his \nhome, his family and his community and sent across the State to the \nIowa State School for the Deaf. People often referred to it as the \nschool for the ``deaf and dumb.'' Yes, that is the insensitive way that \npeople used to talk. I remember my brother telling me, ``I may be deaf, \nbut I am not dumb.''\n  While at school, Frank was told he could be one of three things: a \ncobbler, a printer's assistant, or a baker. He said he didn't want to \nbe any one of those things. They said: OK, you are going to be a baker. \nSo after he got out of school, Frank became a baker. But that is not \nwhat he wanted to do. Frank stubbornly refused to accept the biases and \nstereotypes that society tried to impose on him. He fought for--and \nwon--a life of dignity.\n  But I remember how difficult everyday tasks were for him. For \nexample, I remember, as a young boy, going with my older brother Frank \nto a store. The salesperson, when she found out that Frank was deaf, \nlooked through him like he was invisible and turned to me to ask me \nwhat he wanted. I remember when he wanted to get a driver's license, he \nwas told that ``deaf people don't drive.'' So the deck was stacked \nagainst Frank in a thousand ways, strictly because he was a person with \na disability.\n  I remember when my brother finally found a job to his liking. He got \na job at a manufacturing plant in Des Moines--a good job at Delavan \nCorporation. Mr. Delavan decided he wanted to hire people with \ndisabilities, and so my brother went to work there. It was a great job. \nHe became a drill press operator making nozzles for jet engines. He \ntook enormous pride in his work.\n  Later on, when I was in the Navy, I remember coming home on leave for \nChristmas. I was unmarried at the time, as was Frank. So I went with \nhim to the company where he worked, which was putting on a Christmas \ndinner. I didn't expect anything special. But it turned out that they \nwere honoring Frank that night because in 10 years at Delevan, he had \nnot missed a single day of work and hadn't been late once.\n  That is characteristic of how hard-working and dedicated people with \ndisabilities are when they are given a\n\n[[Page S8257]]\n\nchance in the workplace. Frank worked at that plant for 23 years and \nmissed just 3 days of work, and that was because of a blizzard.\n  Today the brazen discrimination and prejudice that Frank faced are \npart of what seems like a medieval past. We have overcome the false \ndichotomy between ``disabled'' and ``able.'' We recognize that people \nwith disabilities--like all people--have unique abilities, talents, and \naptitudes and that America is better, fairer, and richer when we make \nfull use of those gifts.\n  We have made amazing progress in just 16 years. For millions of \nAmericans with disabilities, it truly is a revolution. It has been a \nquiet revolution, but it has also been a profound revolution.\n  The day that the ADA passed was the proudest day of my legislative \ncareer. But every Senator who voted ``aye'' can look back, 16 years \nlater, with enormous pride in this achievement. We were present at the \ncreation. But our creation now has a robust life of its own. The ADA \nhas been integrated into the fabric of American life. It has changed \nlives--and changed our Nation. It has made the American Dream possible \nfor tens of millions of people who used to be trapped in a nightmare of \nprejudice and exclusion. This truly is a triumph.\n  I am reluctant, in any way, to take away from the celebration of this \nanniversary, but I am obliged to point out that the ADA revolution is \nnot yet complete.\n  When we passed the ADA, we set four great national goals for \nAmericans with disabilities: equal opportunity, independent living, \nfull participation, and economic self-sufficiency. There is more work \nthat needs to be done to reach the full promise of these goals.\n  Right now, 16 years after the passage of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, it is a shocking fact that more than 60 percent of \npeople with disabilities are not employed. We need to do a better job \nof ensuring that people with disabilities have job opportunities--and \nnot just any job but one that is equal to their interests and talents \nand pays accordingly.\n  We need to make sure that people with disabilities have access to \nhealth care, with accessible medical equipment and properly trained \nmedical professionals. We also need to make sure that they have access \nto health and wellness programs that focus on their unique needs. Just \nthis week, I introduced a bill--S. 3717--that will go a long way toward \naccomplishing these goals.\n  At the same time, we need to continue our progress in reversing the \ninstitutional bias in Medicaid. We need to move away from the days when \ntwo-thirds of Medicaid long-term-care dollars are spent on \ninstitutional services, with only one-third going to community-based \ncare.\n  My bill, S. 401, also known as MiCASSA--which is short for the \nMedicaid Community-Based Attendant Services and Supports Act--would \nlevel the playing field by requiring States to cover community services \nunder their Medicaid Programs.\n  With appropriate community-based services and supports, we can \ntransform the lives of people with disabilities. They can live with \nfamily and friends, not strangers. They can be the neighbor down the \nstreet, not the person warehoused down the hall. This is not asking too \nmuch. This is the bare minimum that we should demand for every human \nbeing.\n  The ADA is to people with disabilities what the Emancipation \nProclamation was to African-Americans. But one of the great shames of \nAmerican history is that it took a full century from the Emancipation \nProclamation until the Civil Rights Act actually made good on Lincoln's \npromise.\n  I say to my colleagues, we cannot allow history to repeat itself. We \ncannot wait a century for people with disabilities to be fully \nintegrated into our society and our workforce. We need to fulfill the \nfull promise of the ADA now.\n  Yes, it takes money to pay for personal attendant services. But I \nthink of my nephew, Kelly, who became a paraplegic while serving in the \nmilitary. The Veterans Administration pays for his attendant services. \nThis allows Kelly to get up in the morning, go to work, operate his \nsmall business, pay his taxes, and be a fully contributing member of \nour society.\n  That is what every person with a disability wants. The costs of \nMiCASSA would be largely offset by the benefit of having people with \ndisabilities who are employed, paying taxes, and contributing to the \neconomy.\n  It is a disgrace that, as I said, more than 60 percent of people with \ndisabilities do not have jobs. Right now, they are unemployed and \ndependent. We want them employed and independent. This would be a boon \nfor them. It would be a boon for the economy. And it would be a boon \nfor the budget.\n  So I cannot think of a better way to celebrate the 16th anniversary \nof the ADA than by rededicating ourselves to completing the ADA \nrevolution. This means passing MiCASSA. This means passing the \nPromoting Wellness for Individuals with Disabilities Act. It means \ngiving people with disabilities not just the right to be independent \nand have a job but the wherewithal to be independent and hold a job.\n  Mr. President, one final thought: In sign language, there is a \nwonderful sign for the word ``America.'' It is this: all the fingers in \none hand joined tightly together, with the other hand tracing a circle \naround the joined fingers. This describes an America for all, where we \nare not separate, where no one is left out, and we are all embraced by \na circle, the circle of the American family.\n  For centuries, Americans with disabilities were tragically left out \nof that circle. Our American family was not yet whole, not yet fully \ninclusive. The passage of the ADA 16 years ago rectified that. It \nbrought everyone, including people with disabilities, into the circle. \nIt made our American family--at last--complete.\n  That is the historic achievement we celebrate today. That is the \nhistoric achievement that we must safeguard for generations to come. \nOne America. One inclusive American family that respects the dignity, \nthe value, and the civil rights of all, including Americans with \ndisabilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/26/senate-section/article/S8257-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8257-S8258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SCHIP AT 10: A DECADE OF COVERING CHILDREN\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to commend the Finance \nCommittee and Senators Hatch and Rockefeller for holding a hearing on \nthe State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP. This program has \nmeant a decade of health care coverage for millions of low-income \nchildren who would otherwise be uninsured.\n  My interest and commitment to the success of the SCHIP program goes \nback to its inception. My father, the late Senator John H. Chafee, \nalong with Senator Rockefeller, designed and introduced S. 674, the \nChildren's Health Insurance Provides Security, CHIPS, Act on April 30, \n1997. With help from a bipartisan coalition of Members, including \nSenators Hatch and Kennedy, this effort came to fruition later that \nyear when Congress approved the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, SCHIP.\n  When SCHIP was introduced there were 10 million uninsured children in \nthe United States including 3 million who were eligible for Medicaid \nbut were not enrolled. The SCHIP program sought to alleviate this unmet \nneed by offering States additional Federal funds if they provided \nMedicaid coverage to children from families whose income was under 150 \npercent of the Federal poverty level. This would mean coverage for a \nfamily of four earning $30,000 per year. The bill also provided grant \nfunds for States to reach out and enroll eligible children.\n  Although some States were slow to implement their programs, to date \nall 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the 5 territories have \nSCHIP programs in operation. The SCHIP program has been a tremendous \nsuccess; the share of uninsured children has dropped from 23 percent to \n15 percent of the population since 1997. Today, more than 4 million \nlow-income children who would otherwise be uninsured have access to \ndoctors, immunizations, and preventative health care through SCHIP. \nSince 1997, enrollment has steadily increased to the point that 6.2 \nmillion children are currently covered.\n  Rhode Island's program has also been a success story. Since the \nprogram began on October 1, 1997, that State has enrolled 25,573 \nuninsured children. The State has also expanded its income eligibility \nrequirement to cover additional low-income families. One reason for \nthis great success is the SCHIP program's flexibility in benefit \nstructure\n\n[[Page S8258]]\n\nand design. States are allowed to expand eligibility levels, cover \nparents of children on SCHIP, and in some cases childless adults. Rhode \nIsland has utilized this flexibility to develop innovative strategies \nto address its uninsured.\n  One example of this innovation was Rhode Island's recognition of the \nimportance of covering families. Studies cited by the Kaiser Commission \non Medicaid and the Uninsured show that parents are more likely to \nenroll their children in SCHIP if the entire family is covered. Parents \nwho have the proper health care coverage are more likely to stay \nhealthy and avoid missed days at work. The same is true of their \nchildren; preventative screenings and immunizations will allow them to \nremain healthy, avoid expensive hospitalizations, and stay in school.\n  States may appeal to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for \nwaivers to expand their program beyond current law requirements. Along \nwith 15 other States, Rhode Island has a waiver that allows it to use \nSCHIP funds to cope with the growing number of uninsured. States such \nas Arizona, Idaho, Oregon, Minnesota, New Mexico, and Virginia have \nsimilar waivers.\n  We have a growing crisis with the number of uninsured in this \ncountry. Estimates place the number of uninsured at 45 million, up from \n41 million a few years ago. We should reward States that use innovative \napproaches with their SCHIP programs to expand coverage. Until \ncomprehensive solutions are found to help States fill the coverage \ngaps, we should not penalize them for taking advantage of existing \nresources and programs.\n  To this end, I have been proud to support legislation that maintained \nfunding for the SCHIP program and reallocated funding to coverage-\nexpanding States. In 2003 I was the lead Republican on legislation \nintroduced by Senator Rockefeller to keep $2.7 billion in the program \nuntil the end of fiscal year 2004 and reallocate funds to other States \nthrough fiscal year 2005. This bill also included a provision I fought \nfor that is important to States like Rhode Island. It allows States \nwith expansive Medicaid Programs that covered uninsured children prior \nto SCHIP's enactment to use 20 percent of SCHIP funds to cover these \nchildren. This is significant since SCHIP provides a higher Federal \nmatch than Medicaid. States that did the right thing by covering pre-\nSCHIP children were being penalized by not receiving the higher match.\n  In closing, I thank Senators Rockefeller and Hatch for holding a \nhearing on SCHIP and honoring its tremendous accomplishments over the \npast 10 years. The SCHIP program has been an integral part of our \nhealth care safety net. As we turn to reauthorization and the \nchallenges facing the program in fiscal year 2007, I look forward to \nworking with the bipartisan coalition whose vision created the program. \nWe must work together to keep SCHIP strong so that the progress and the \ninnovations made with the program will not be lost.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/26/senate-section/article/S8258-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PASSAGE OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I wish to add my voice to the celebration \nof a significant event in this Senate: the renewal of the Voting Rights \nAct for 25 years. This legislation is part of our efforts in the Senate \nto come together to make sure the America of 2031 is a whole lot more \nsuccessful at bridging racial divides than we are today.\n  I grew up in a large Jewish family in New York City. One of my \nparent's favorite entertainers was a Jewish comedian named Georgie \nJessel. I am sure some of my senior colleagues remember him. In the \n1950s he was a good friend of the stunning and talented African-\nAmerican singer and actress Lena Horne. From time to time they would go \nout to dinner. You should know that even in New York in those days, \nthey had segregated clubs. Well, by chance or by accident, Mr. Jessel \nscheduled one of their dinner dates in one of those clubs. The maitre'd \ntook one look at her skin color and said indignantly, ``Who made your \nreservation?'' Jessel shot back, ``Abraham Lincoln.''\n  Lincoln made a reservation for us all. One hundred and forty years \nlater, we are still struggling to keep it.\n  One of my most vivid experiences since I came to the Senate was a \ncivil rights delegation to Alabama sponsored by the Faith and Politics \nInstitute a couple years ago. Representative John Lewis helped to lead \nthe delegation, and shared with us his experiences. We stopped at the \nRosa Parks Museum at Troy State University in Montgomery and reflected \non the bus boycott. We visited the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist \nChurch, where the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., used to preach, and \nthe civil rights Memorial. I was struck with the fact that I visited \nthese historic locations in peace and security. A generation ago, the \nvisitors who came from outside the South to these locations endured \nthreats, vilification, and violence.\n  This visit reminded me of a simple truth: Individuals such as Parks, \nKing and so many others, shape our society. As we look at the \nchallenges and injustices of the world around us, we often ask the \nquestion, How can we change the world? I think we often look in the \nwrong place for change. We look to big government, big business, big \nentertainment, or big publishing to bring about change. It is \ncomparatively easy to change a speech or a law or a budget. The real \nchallenge is in changing hearts. And that job falls to all of us who \nare willing to speak out, willing to model understanding and willing to \nchange. Our hope lies in the fact that in America, there are no \n``ordinary people.''\n  I often like to say that a leader without followers is just a person \ntaking a walk. The Dr. Kings and Rosa Parks are all around us, in need \nof the followers and workers who will inspire major change.\n  Every person has the ability to shape our Nation with their vote. As \na democracy, this Nation is built on the idea that we look to the \npeople, and the way we do that is by the power of their vote. Voting is \nthe recognition that each person, each individual, each vote, is \nimportant. We cannot afford to sustain any impediment to that process. \nIf we do not defend the freedom to vote, the product of our democracy \nis dulled and diminished--it is not a true reflection of what is \nAmerica.\n  Legislation we passed in the Congress has been crucial: the Civil \nRights Act, the Voting Rights Act, and a series of additional measures \nright into our own decade. Vigorous enforcement of those statutes is \nessential. The Voting Rights Act recognizes that one of the best things \nthat government can do for their people is make them secure to cast \ntheir votes. The Voting Rights Act recognizes that in a free society, \nthe people lead.\n  The United States is unique in world history because we are a nation \nbuilt upon rights rather than privileges. We believe we have been \nendowed by our Creator--not our government--with rights such as life, \nliberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n  The American concept of rights is a large set. We have the freedom of \nreligion. We have the freedom of speech and assembly. We have the right \nto be secure against government intrusion in our homes and private \naffairs. We have a free press. And to a greater degree than ever, we \nhave the freedom to vote in this country and to have those votes count.\n  If you pull any one of those freedoms out of the set, the whole thing \ncollapses. Each of our rights protects and reinforces all the others. \nAll the American rights get stronger with the passage of this bill and \nthat's something to celebrate.\n  But we shouldn't pat ourselves on the back for too long. We can deal \nwith voting inequality by strictly and aggressively enforcing this law, \nbut we have a long list of issues of economic inequality to deal with. \nWe have achievement gaps in our schools. We have housing gaps in our \nhome ownership markets. We have health gaps in access to quality care.\n  Racial equality in America is race without a finish line. We have \nfinished a lap today, but as Robert Frost wrote, ``We have promises to \nkeep, and miles to go before we sleep.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/26/senate-section/article/S8258-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8258-S8259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO FLOYD LANDIS, WINNER OF THE 2006 TOUR DE FRANCE\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate an \nincredible feat of physical and mental endurance, a feat that was \ncompleted on Sunday, July 23. Floyd Landis, a native\n\n[[Page S8259]]\n\nof Lancaster County, PA, completed the 20th stage of the 2006 Tour de \nFrance with an overall time of 89 hours, 39 minutes and 30 seconds, \nwinning the race by 57 seconds in the closest three-way finish in the \nlong history of the tour.\n  In winning the 93rd Tour de France, Floyd Landis became just the \nthird American cyclist to win this most prestigious of races, joining \nprevious American victors Greg Lemond and Lance Armstrong. He, like \nthem before him, has become the face of American cycling, and, frankly, \nwe could not ask for a better spokesman.\n  The Tour de France, with this year's race totaling over 2,200 miles, \nis known around the globe as one of the toughest physical challenges in \nthe sporting world. It is an incredible feat for anyone to finish this \ngrueling, 20-stage race. But that Floyd Landis finished--and that he \nwon--is even more astounding. Landis suffers from osteoporosis of the \nhip, an ailment so severe he will require hip replacement surgery in \nthe very near future. Yet, in a staggering display of determination and \nmental toughness, Landis put aside the pain that was, in his words, \n``bad, it's grinding, it's bone rubbing on bone,'' to win the race in \nconvincing fashion.\n  Landis and his Phonak Hearing Systems team also demonstrated that \ncycling is a mental challenge as much as a physical one. In spite of \nthe temptation to stay as the frontrunner and in the face of various \npundits questioning their strategy, Phonak purposely relinquished the \noverall lead of the race in the 13th stage, conserving their energy for \nthe late push that ultimately resulted in victory.\n  In the course of the race, Floyd Landis also proved the wisdom of the \noft-quoted adage, ``Never give up.'' After struggling through the 16th \nstage, a stage which saw him lose 10 minutes and fall from first to \neleventh place, Landis stunned the field and the pundits with what \nformer champion Lemond aptly described as ``the best day I've seen in \ncycling in years . . . maybe ever,'' winning the 17th stage by more \nthan 6 minutes and putting himself in prime position to win the race. \nLandis followed up his epic ride with a strong showing in the final \nindividual time trial, outpacing his closest rival by nearly a minute \nand a half and regaining the overall lead, a lead he held for the \nremainder of the race.\n  Floyd Landis grew up in Farmersville, PA, a small town located about \n50 miles to the southeast of Harrisburg. The Landis family was and is a \ntight-knit, modest group that instilled in Floyd a belief in the merit \nof working hard. As the story goes, Floyd was often so inundated with \nchores that the only time he could ride was in the middle of the \nnight--which, of course, he did. Surely, as with so many of us, Floyd \nLandis's family played an integral role in shaping him into the man he \nis today and in the successes that he has enjoyed.\n  Floyd Landis, whom I am proud to call a fellow Pennsylvanian, has \nproven that with determination and an immense strength of spirit, even \nthe most extreme obstacles can be overcome and success can be attained. \nHe has inspired countless Americans across our Nation, and many more \naround the world, and I congratulate him on his remarkable achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/26/senate-section/article/S8259-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8259-S8261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF JEROME A.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these letters \nin support of Jerome Holmes be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 21, 2006.\n     Hon. James M. Inhofe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inhofe: I am writing to encourage the \n     confirmation of the nomination of Jerome A. Holmes to be a \n     United States Circuit Judge for the Tenth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals.\n       As a U.S. District Judge for over 30 years I have known and \n     worked with many federal law clerks, lawyers, district and \n     circuit judges. I have known first hand of their \n     intelligence, skills, judgment, character, temperament and \n     sense of fairness. In every single one of these criteria Mr. \n     Holmes has uniquely excelled. His scholarship and other \n     credentials are well documented so permit me to emphasize one \n     critically important additional one. Mr. Holmes is dedicated \n     completely to the rule of law, the proper role of the \n     judiciary and to applying and interpreting the law without \n     regard to personal views on given issues. I have seen this \n     commitment guide his every professional task, in civil and \n     criminal cases, as a law clerk, prosecutor and civil \n     practitioner. The Senators and the people of the country can \n     be assured that, if confirmed, Jerome Holmes will be a \n     circuit judge of compassion, fairness and a total commitment \n     to the rule of law. Having personally observed these \n     qualities throughout the years, I could not give a higher \n     recommendation.\n           Respectfully,\n     Ralph G.

In his many years of public service--\n     including over a decade with the Department of Justice--\n     Jerome has earned a reputation for excellence that few can \n     equal. He served as the Deputy Criminal Chief and the lead \n     prosecutor on some of the most important and challenging \n     investigations and cases in this Office. He was recognized by \n     his fellow career prosecutors for his legal talents, \n     fairness, and fine character.\n       As Assistant United States Attorneys together, I had the \n     opportunity to work closely with Jerome on counterterrorism, \n     public corruption, and civil rights investigations and cases. \n     I observed first-hand his tremendous dedication, legal \n     acumen, judgment, ethics, professionalism, and commitment to \n     equal justice under the law.\n       I am confident that, as a Judge on the Court of Appeals, he \n     will continue to serve our Nation with great distinction.\n       If I can provide you any further information, please do not \n     hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     John C.

James M. Inhofe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inhofe: I am writing in support of the \n     nomination of Jerome A. Holmes, Esq. to the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. I have know Jerome by \n     reputation since 1991 when I was working for the Honorable \n     Glenn English (D-OK) and personally since 1993 when I moved \n     back to Oklahoma to begin my legal career.\n       Jerome is a known leader in a multitude of community \n     activities. He currently serves as a Commissioner on the \n     American Bar Association's Commission on Homelessness and \n     Poverty where his local work has translated into national \n     recognition. He also serves as Chairman of the Board for our \n     local City Rescue Mission, a homeless shelter located in \n     Oklahoma City. As a member of the board myself, I can attest \n     to Jerome's devotion to assisting those who are less \n     fortunate and his incredible leadership style culminating in \n     proven results for the homeless of Oklahoma.\n       Hard work and dedication to his profession are just some of \n     Jerome's hallmarks through which he has earned the respect of \n     his colleagues in the legal profession. He always displays a \n     judicious demeanor and temperament that will serve him and \n     his country well on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. The \n     first person to turn the lights on and the last to turn the \n     lights off at our office, Jerome's unwavering commitment to \n     his chosen profession is evident. I highly recommend Jerome \n     Holmes for confirmation--both personally and professionally--\n     one cannot find a better nominee.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  William H.

Inhofe,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: I write to support the nomination of Jerome \n     Holmes to serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Tenth Circuit. Having served as United States Attorney for \n     the years 2001--2005, I am well acquainted with the very high \n     standards expected in the federal judicial system, and I know \n     that Jerome would be an outstanding addition to the bench.\n       I have known Jerome for many years in the course of us both \n     practicing law in Oklahoma City. I worked closely with Jerome \n     when we were both Assistant U.S. Attorneys in the early 1990s \n     and observed first hand Jerome's work ethic, professional \n     excellence, and intelligence.\n       Later when I returned to the U.S. Attorney's Office in \n     2001, I had the opportunity to work very closely with Jerome \n     again. One of Jerome's strengths is his ability to take on \n     and be successful with the hardest and most complex tasks. \n     For example, he served as Anti-Terrorist Coordinator for the \n     Western District of Oklahoma. He made a success of that \n     position because of his ability to analyze the complex issues \n     involved, his ability to work well with many different \n     government agencies, and his outstanding judgment. He also \n     proved himself to be an outstanding administrator in his \n     service as Deputy Chief of the Criminal Division.\n\n[[Page S8260]]\n\n       One of the most significant cases Jerome prosecuted was a \n     public corruption case involving the Oklahoma Department of \n     Health. In that case, a nursing home owner had been bribing \n     the Deputy Commissioner of the Department of Health. Jerome \n     tried the case, won convictions, and won the appeals. The \n     case was significant not only because it was a complex and \n     difficult public corruption case, but because it led to \n     material reform at the Department of Health and within the \n     nursing home industry in Oklahoma. The case is an example of \n     the dedication Jerome brings to his work as a public servant.\n       Jerome's character is beyond reproach. He approaches every \n     task with the highest level of professional integrity and \n     ethics. He has the right temperament for service on the bench \n     as well. He can be counted on to be courteous, fair, and \n     reasonable in any endeavor.\n       Jerome is well liked and well respected within the local \n     bar. His ability to get along with people and inspire trust \n     in others is illustrated in his election as Vice President of \n     the Bar Association for the State of Oklahoma and his \n     selection to serve on prestigious community boards such as \n     the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, the Oklahoma \n     Academy for State Goals, and the Oklahoma City National \n     Memorial Foundation.\n       Jerome would be an outstanding court of appeals judge. He \n     possesses the judgement, intelligence, professional \n     excellence, and integrity to be a truly great judge.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Robert G. McCampbell.\n                                  ____\n\n                                  Oklahoma City, OK, July 6, 2006.\n     Re Nomination of Jerome A. Holmes\n\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: This letter is written to you in your \n     capacity as a member of the Senate Committee on the \n     Judiciary, and in support of the pending nomination of Jerome \n     A. Holmes to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. Under \n     separate cover I have also written to Senator Specter with a \n     copy to Senator Leahy. Rather than merely sending a copy of \n     the other letter to you, I wanted to take time to write to \n     you personally.\n       For the past 30 years I have had the pleasure of serving as \n     a member of the legal profession, as an active trial lawyer \n     on both the State and Federal level. For 22 of those years, I \n     have also served as the chief municipal judge for the City of \n     The Village, a community located in the northwest quadrant of \n     the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. My practice is not on \n     the appellate level, although, of necessity, I carefully \n     follow the decisions that emanate from the appellate courts.\n       Since my primary practice involves criminal defense, I \n     have, on numerous occasions, had reason to meet with, oppose \n     and observe Attorney Holmes. There has never been a time when \n     I felt the nominee was anything less than candid, \n     knowledgeable, professional and ethical. He is a worthy \n     opponent, an excellent trial attorney, and has the respect of \n     my fellow defense counsel.\n       The appellate courts of our country need--and deserve--to \n     have jurists of Attorney Holmes' high caliber. I have \n     absolutely no doubt that the nominee would devote his \n     considerable intellect to ensuring that the Constitution is \n     properly protected and that cases before him are decided \n     based on the law. If he is elevated to the Tenth Circuit, \n     there will undoubtedly be times when I disagree with his \n     opinion, as is always the case. I can, however, assure you \n     that I firmly believe he will never insert personal beliefs \n     or bias into his judicial thoughts.\n       Please permit me a point of personal privilege as part of \n     this letter.\n       In 1961 I reported to Marine Barracks, 8th & Eye Streets, \n     as a PFC just out of Parris Island. For the next two years I \n     served as a member of Ceremonial Guard Company.\n       The highlight of my tour at 8th & Eye was on July 12, 1962 \n     when, as a member of the Silent Drill Team, I had the honor \n     of drilling for President Kennedy, the reviewing officer that \n     evening for the Sunset Parade. I saved the program and sent \n     it to the President. An autographed copy of the program and \n     the transmittal letter from Ms. Lincoln occupy a position of \n     honor on my office wall.\n       Senator, I am a Democrat, with deep ties to the party. My \n     father was a Central Committeeman in Ohio, and my grandmother \n     was the party's poll watcher in our small town. I imagine \n     Attorney Holmes is a Republican or he would not have been \n     nominated. His party affiliation does not bother me in the \n     least. He is a lawyer first and foremost and will, I believe, \n     continue to bring honor to our profession and Constitutional \n     protection to our clients.\n       As I told Senator Specter, should an opportunity present \n     itself, I would be honored to personally appear before the \n     Committee to speak on behalf of Jerome Holmes.\n           Respectfully yours,\n     Robert A. Manchester, III.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         Oklahoma City University,\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                                 Oklahoma City, OK, July 21, 2006.\n     Re Confirmation of Jerome Holmes\n\n     Senator James Inhofe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n       Dear Senator Inhofe: I write in support of the confirmation \n     of Jerome Holmes to serve as a Judge of the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\n       I have worked closely with Mr. Holmes over a period of \n     years on an important committee of the Oklahoma Bar \n     Association tasked with revising the rules of professional \n     conduct for lawyers. As co-chair of this committee, I \n     observed him closely. He was always extremely well-prepared, \n     thoughtful, cooperative, and considerate. In addition, as a \n     supervisor of student externs from my law school, he was \n     always conscientious and responsible.\n       While Mr. Holmes has taken positions on issues with which I \n     disagree, I have no reservations regarding the criteria by \n     which he should be judged in this confirmation: professional \n     competence, integrity, and judicial temperament.\n       Thus, I hope the Senate will confirm Jerome Holmes for this \n     position.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                              Lawrence K.

I \n     know him to be very intelligent, very diligent and to possess \n     a high degree of competence on the functioning of the federal \n     judicial system. His background in the law will serve him \n     well in this position. He is dedicated to serving the justice \n     system and the legal profession.\n       Although I am a registered Democrat, I believe Jerome \n     Holmes is entitled to non-partisan support because he will be \n     an outstanding jurist who will follow the law, not personal \n     views or beliefs.\n       I hope the Senate will confirm Jerome Holmes for this very \n     important judicial post.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  William G.

In that position, he demonstrated common sense \n     and fairness in applying the law.\n       When Robert Macy retired as the District Attorney for \n     Oklahoma County, I served, at the appointment of then \n     Governor Frank Keating, on the committee to select a \n     successor. Jerome Holmes was one of the finalists, and I was \n     assigned the task of doing a workup on his skills, abilities, \n     and suitability for the job. In that capacity, I interviewed \n     several federal judges and several agents of the F.B.I. who \n     had observed and worked with Jerome in his years in the U.S. \n     Attorney's Office. All were high in their praise for Jerome, \n     his dedication, and work ethic.\n       He has been most helpful in establishing minority \n     scholarships here at the College of Law.\n       He is a delightful person, and I commend him to you for \n     this judgeship enthusiastically and without reservation.\n                                                  Andrew M.

Holmes\n\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: I am honored to support the \n     nomination of Jerome A. Holmes to the Tenth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals. I am a deputy public defender, Chair of the ABA \n     Commission on Homelessness and Poverty and co-founder of the \n     Homeless Court Program.\n       Jerome is a member of the ABA Commission on Homelessness \n     and Poverty. Jerome's contributions to the Commission's \n     discussions on homeless and poverty issues are always well \n     reasoned and articulate. He is inquisitive and insightful. \n     Commission members rely on his input and value his \n     contributions.

Holmes, Esq. to the United States \n         Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\n\n     Hon. James M. Inhofe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inhofe: I am writing in support of the \n     nomination of Jerome A. Holmes, Esq., to the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. I have known Jerome \n     since 2001 when Jerome and I were selected for the class of \n     Oklahoma City Leadership. In 2003, Jerome was asked to serve \n     as a director on the board of City Rescue Mission, a local \n     homeless shelter and rehabilitation center located in \n     Oklahoma City.\n       Jerome is a recognized leader in many levels of community \n     service. Locally, he currently serves as Chairman of the \n     Board for City Rescue Mission. His leadership has greatly \n     contributed to City Rescue Mission's national recognition as \n     a model rescue mission for the homeless and poor. Nationally, \n     he currently serves as a Commissioner on the American Bar \n     Association's Commission on Homelessness and Poverty where \n     his work has received national recognition. I can personally \n     attest to Jerome's leadership ability seasoned with character \n     and integrity.\n       Jerome is passionately dedicated to his profession as well \n     as his volunteer leadership roles. He has gained the \n     respected of his colleagues in the legal profession as well \n     as those in the human services realm. I have witnessed Jerome \n     in a variety of leadership situations and have always been \n     greatly impressed with his demeanor, temperament, and \n     thoroughness. Jerome is the first person I call when I need a \n     fair unbiased carefully considered point of view--he leaves \n     no stone unturned. I highly recommend Jerome Holmes for \n     confirmation to the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Tenth Circuit--he will serve our country well.\n           Respectfully,\n                                             Rev. Glenn Granfield,\n     President/CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                             Oklahoma City, OK\n\n                                                    July 24, 2006.\n     Hon. James Inhofe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inhofe: This letter is written to support the \n     nomination of Jerome Holmes to the 10th Circuit Court of \n     Appeals. I am an African American attorney and active member \n     of the community as well as an adjunct teacher at Douglass \n     High School and I hope that Jerome is confirmed by the U.S. \n     Senate. I have known Jerome for almost 15 years and I am very \n     proud to call him a friend. It was that friendship I relied \n     upon when I asked that he serve as a volunteer coach for the \n     Frederick Douglass High School Mock Trial team which has a \n     predominantly African American student population.\n       Jerome was very instrumental in helping the Frederick \n     Douglass team in the first year of competition advance in the \n     competition. It was a result of his personal and professional \n     dedication to the students that he was successful in helping \n     inspire these young African American students both male and \n     female to excel in this academic competition. I know Jerome \n     stated that he was greatly enriched by the young men and \n     women that competed on his team.\n       I strongly believe that Jerome Holmes has the integrity, \n     personal track record and character to represent the 10th \n     Circuit in a successful manner. Jerome Holmes is a good \n     person who has always reflected his strong belief in the \n     American dream. I personally witnessed as he was able to \n     effectively, passionately and successfully share with the \n     Douglass students that the dreams they hold can be realized \n     in the same manner. I am confident that Jerome Holmes if \n     given the opportunity to serve will uphold the Constitution \n     first and foremost and serve in such a manner that I along \n     with the mock trial students at Douglass will celebrate this \n     achievement.\n       If I can provide additional information please don't \n     hesitate to contact me.\n                                          L.

Mr. President, this past June, the National Association of \nDevelopment Organizations, NADO, formed the Rural Planning \nOrganizations of America, RPO America, a national voluntary \norganization, which was designed to strengthen our Nation's rural \ntransportation planning, development, and infrastructure system.\n  Under the leadership of NADO, RPO America will support rural \ntransportation planners and practitioners by providing professional \ndevelopment, peer networking, research and educational initiatives in \norder to promote and showcase the benefits and value of transportation \nplanning and infrastructure development throughout our Nation's rural \ncommunities.\n  Investing in our rural roadways and bridges is more than just \ninvesting in concrete and steel; it is also an investment in our \nfuture. For this reason, it is essential that our Nation's rural \ntransportation professionals be provided with the necessary tools and \nsupport to promote and showcase the value, benefits, and \naccomplishments of rural transportation planning and development.\n  Efficient transportation infrastructure plays a critical role in a \nsuccessful and thriving community. Furthermore, a reliable \ntransportation system within our Nation's rural community is not only \ncritical to our rural communities but also to our Nation's economy.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing this \nnewly formed organization that will support the role of rural \ntransportation planners and the efforts to improve rural community \naccess throughout the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/26/senate-section/article/S8261-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8261-S8262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SMALL BUSINESS PENSION AND RETIREMENT SAVINGS\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as chair of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I have long believed that it is my \nresponsibility and the duty of this Chamber to help small businesses, \nas they are the driver of this Nation's economy, responsible for \ngenerating approximately 75 percent of net new jobs annually.\n  On Monday I introduced legislation that would help to address the \nretirement needs of millions of small business employees. My bill will \nmake it easier for small employers to offer pension and 401(k) benefits \nto their employees, who typically have lower retirement savings rates. \nMy bill makes it easier for small businesses to offer a ``DB/K plan'' \nwhich is a combination of a defined benefit plan and a section 401(k) \nplan that is included in a single plan document. Currently, due to \ndefined benefit plans' complex rules and high establishment costs, many \nsmall businesses are unable to set up these types of pension plans for \ntheir employees. Instead, many small businesses choose to offer less \ncomplex 401(k) plans that do not require employer contributions and \noffer their employees less guaranteed retirement benefits.\n  Many small employers would like to offer defined benefit pension \nplans but are currently hampered by top-heavy rules designed to prevent \nlarge companies from exclusively offering pensions to key employees. \nThese well-meaning regulations prevent most small companies, with a few \nkey employees, from providing pension benefits. Legislation that \nestablishes DB/K plans would provide small businesses with reasonable \nexemptions from these top-heavy rules. This increased flexibility will \nenable employers to offer employees pension benefits as well as the \ncapability to save incrementally in 401(k) type accounts.\n  Another advantage of DB/K plans is that they offer employees \nincreased flexibility. Employees with DB/K plans would be allowed to \ntake their DB/K assets with them when they switch employers. This \nportability would make DB/Ks attractive to many younger employees, who \ntend to change jobs often. Portability is a DB/K innovation not offered \nby traditional defined benefit plans which have vesting periods and \nstop accumulating value when the employee leaves a company. For older \nworkers, the main attraction would be the defined benefit feature, \nwhich provides that at least part of their retirement savings would \nprovide a monthly pension check at retirement.\n  According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, only 16 percent \nof employees at companies with 10 workers or fewer and 32 percent of \nemployees at companies with 100 employees or fewer participate in their \ncompany-sponsored retirement savings plans. Comparatively, almost 60 \npercent of employees at companies with more\n\n[[Page S8262]]\n\nthan 1,000 workers save for retirement through a company sponsored \nplan. Small business workers' low participation rates in retirement \nsavings plan are troubling as small businesses employ half of all \nprivate sector employees. Many policymakers who are closely watching \nthe aging of the American population worry that small business owners' \nand their employees' low savings rates will leave this group \ninadequately prepared to pay for their retirements. The creation of DB/\nK plans is one option for helping small business owners and their \nemployees increase their overall retirement savings.\n  Under this legislation each part of the DB/K plan would be subject to \nthe present-law rules for defined benefit plans or 401(k) plans, but \nthe rules would be simplified. Like 401(k) plans, the proposed DB/Ks \nwould allow employees to make pretax contributions to their accounts, \ncould include employer matching funds and permit employees to invest \ntheir 401(k) portion in mutual funds etc. The assets of both components \nof the DB/K plan could be held in a trust covered by a single trust \ninstrument. However, the assets of the defined benefit component of the \nplan and the assets of the 401(k) component of the plan must be clearly \nidentified and allocated to the appropriate part of the trust.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/26/senate-section/article/S8262-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ``DISCOVERY'' SPACE SHUTTLE LANDING\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise in celebration of the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration's successful return to Earth of \nSpace Shuttle Discovery and to welcome the crew of flight STS-121 home.\n  Over the last few decades, NASA has experienced tragic lessons in the \ndangers of space exploration. That is why it was heartwarming to see \nCommander Steven Lindsey, Pilot Mark Kelly, and Mission Specialists \nMichael Fossum, Lisa Nowak, Stephanie Wilson, and Piers Sellers, safely \nreturn home after spending 13 days in orbit.\n  After two weather-related delays, the Discovery launched on July 4, \n2006, Independence Day. During the STS-121 mission, the crew made \ncritical tests of shuttle safety improvements. In addition, the crew \ntransported European Space Agency astronaut, Thomas Reiter, to the \nInternational Space Station where they delivered additional supplies \nand equipment. During their time on the International Space Station, \nthe STS-121 crew worked in conjunction with the Expedition 13 crew on \njoint operations. The crew also performed maintenance on the \nInternational Space Station's mobile transporter and tested orbiter \nheat shield repair techniques during their three space walks. The \nflight marked the 115th space shuttle flight and was the second flight \nsince the 2003 Columbia tragedy.\n  This successful mission is a testament to NASA and our valiant \nastronauts that continue to strive for excellence. Through current \nexploration, the lives of those lost in both the Columbia and \nChallenger accidents, including Astronaut Ellison Onizuka, who was born \nand raised in my home State of Hawaii, live on. I am proud of the \nadvances we have made in space exploration and am grateful for all \nthose who have made the dream of space exploration possible. Again, I \nextend my warm welcome to the Discovery crew and congratulate them on \ncompleting their mission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/26/senate-section/article/S8262-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING YVONNE GOODMAN\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Gross, \nfor 25 years. She began helping me the first day I arrived on Capitol \nHill and continued until she retired in 2002. In total, Yvonne served \nthe people of Iowa for a remarkable 53 years. There is no doubt that \nIowans benefited from her loyalty to their representatives in the \nCongress and her standard of excellence in her work. I was very \nfortunate to have her on my staff. Yvonne was from Osage, IA. She was a \nspecial person and a valuable and trusted employee. She made a great \ncontribution with her selfless and dedicated public service. Her \nhusband Jim is also a friend. He, too, worked in government and shared \nYvonne's commitment to the people's business. Yvonne and Jim were an \nintegral part of my office family for 28 years. They touched the lives \nof so many fellow staffers with their caring ways. They were gardeners \nwho loved to share their beautiful flowers and plants.

Mr. President, on behalf of all Oregonians, I wish \nto recognize the recent accomplishments of Oregon's first national park \nat Crater Lake.\n  President Theodore Roosevelt had never set his eyes on the deep blue \nwaters of Crater Lake when he signed the law in 1902 making Crater Lake \nthe fifth oldest national park in the United States. He was, however, \nwell aware of the 17-year battle fought to make its protection a \nreality. The father of Crater Lake, William Gladstone Steel, devoted \nhis life to seeing Crater Lake protected and walked these halls of \nCongress to make sure that the majesty of this Oregon jewel was forever \nenshrined. Hard work and perseverance have been at the core of the \nentire storied history of Crater Lake National Park.\n  On August 25, 2006, the Crater Lake National Park will open the doors \nto its new Science and Learning Center. Just as William Gladstone Steel \nspent his early years participating in scientific experiments at Crater \nLake, the Science and Learning Center will provide the public with an \nentry into one of nature's most spectacular laboratories. Scientists, \nteachers, students, artists and the general public alike will benefit \nfrom this new facility at the park, which will be one of a very few \nNational Park Service Learning Centers in the Nation.\n  The opening of the Crater Lake Science and Learning Center is the \nculmination of many years of perseverance and hard work from the \ndedicated staff and partners of Crater Lake National Park. \nSpecifically, I want to recognize the dedication and ingenuity of \nCrater Lake National Park Superintendent, Charles ``Chuck'' Lundy. \nChuck has gone above and beyond the call of duty and Oregon is lucky to \nhave him at the helm of the Crater Lake ``Phantom Ship.'' During \nChuck's 8-year tenure at the Park, he has worked in the spirit of \nWilliam Gladstone Steel using his innovative mind to mold the future of \nAmerica's deepest and most pristine lake. The Crater Lake Centennial \nlicense plate campaign, under Chuck's direction, has given each and \nevery Oregonian the ability to express just how special Crater Lake is \nto them and to our State. As of July of 2006, 138,000 license plates \nhave been purchased by Oregonians, with the proceeds going directly to \nthe new Science and Learning Center.\n  Mr. President, I am extremely proud of the successes being exhibited \nby the outstanding team of National Park Service employees at Crater \nLake National Park. I congratulate them on the opening of the Science \nand Learning Center and wish them all the best as they continue to \npreserve and protect the national park Oregonians love so much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/26/senate-section/article/S8262-4", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8262-S8263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PASSING OF MAX METZGER\n\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I wish today to recognize the \npassing of my friend Max Metzger this past Saturday morning. As we \ngrieve the loss for his family, the citizens of St. Paul are grateful \nfor the music he brought to them. As the former mayor of St. Paul, I \nhad the opportunity to become acquainted with Max and was touched by \nthe love of music he brought to our community.\n  To say Max was an icon in the St. Paul Music scene would be an \nunderstatement. For 56 summers he brought music to thousands of \nMinnesotans, conducting pops concerts at the Como Lakeside Pavilion. He \nwas a gifted musician, director, and entertainer. He was a kind and \ngentle man with a great sense of humor, a love for his city, and \npassionately devoted to his wife Nell.\n\n[[Page S8263]]\n\n  Max Metzger was born in Germany in 1922, and his family emigrated to \nthe United States in 1931. His mother was Mady Metzger-Zeigler, an \ninternationally renowned mezzo-soprano who founded the St. Paul Opera \nWorkshop. Max was involved in the Workshop for several decades, before \ntaking it over upon his mother's death in 1979.\n  Yet while Max clearly loved music and had a high aptitude for \nproducing and performing, he had not inherited his mother's beautiful \nvoice. In fact, his mother made Max promise never to sing or she would \ndisown him.\n  So Max found other outlets for his musicality. He started to play the \nbassoon at a young age. He played with the St. Paul Civic Opera \nWorkshop, directed the Civic Opera orchestra, and played with a \nsymphony orchestra in Duluth.\n  Max Metzger personified the thriving arts culture in St. Paul for \ndecades, touching innumerable lives. In fact, in appreciation of his \namazing deeds and accomplishments, the City of St. Paul dedicated a \nstreet in his name in beautiful Como Park. The Nobel Prize winning poet \nT.S. Eliot once said that ``you are the music while the music lasts.''\n  Mr. President, the music will last in the hearts and minds of \ncountless Minnesotans, thanks to Mr. Max Metzger.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/26/senate-section/article/S8263-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FREDERICK P.

Their vision and \nhard work has paved the way for the opening of the Frederick P. \nGriffith, Jr. Water Treatment Facility on July 15, 2006. The Griffith \nplant is truly state of the art and we are proud that the Commonwealth \nhas such an entity leading the way and setting such high standards for \nthe rest of the country. Leaders at Fairfax Water truly recognize the \nimportance of protecting our natural resources and preserving the \nfacets of the surrounding area.\n  I think it is most important to recognize that this new facility \nembodies our Nation's commitment to homeland security. The Griffith \nplant is equipped with numerous security measures which go a long way \nto ensure that Fairfax Water's nearly 1.5 million customers are well \nprotected from potential threats be they natural or manmade. This is \ncomforting to know especially when one considers the large number of \ncritical government facilities which are served by Fairfax Water. These \nfacilities include Fort Belvoir U.S. Army Reservation, Fort Belvoir \nProving Grounds, facilities of the Central Intelligence Agency, U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service Laboratories, U.S. Navy Family Housing, U.S. \nCoast Guard Information Systems Center, facilities of the General \nServices Administration, facilities of the U.S. Department of State; \nand office space and warehouses for the U.S. Securities and Exchange \nCommission. As the senior Senator from the Commonwealth of Virginia, I \nam proud that these important installations are in my State. They \nprovide many crucial services to all Americans, and have \nresponsibilities beyond the Commonwealth. I am proud that Fairfax Water \nserves its local and national constituencies so well.\n  Mr. President, I am sure that my colleagues will join me in offering \ncongratulations and continued success to my friends at Fairfax \nWater.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/26/senate-section/article/S8263-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RECOGNIZING ROOSEVELT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, MANKATO, MINNESOTA\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today I honor Roosevelt Elementary \nSchool, in Mankato, MN, which recently earned an Award for Excellence \nin Education for its exceptional and innovative achievements in \neducating children.\n  Roosevelt Elementary School is truly a model of educational success, \nin keeping with its mission: ``To Educate the Whole Child . . . For \nLife.''\n  In 2005, the Minnesota Department of Education recognized Roosevelt \nElementary as a five-star school in both reading and math, an \nachievement reached by less than 7 percent of all Minnesota schools. \nAnother source of school pride is the significant progress made in \nthese subjects over the past 7 years.\n  In 1998, the math and reading scores of Roosevelt's third graders \nwere well below the threshold necessary for the ``adequate yearly \nprogress'' under the existing State standards. The average math score \nin 1998 was 1401, and the average reading score was 1361; an average of \n1420 was necessary for the State's ``adequate yearly progress'' \ndesignation. Thanks to a concerted ``team effort,'' to improve \nachievement, test scores have risen dramatically. In 2005, the average \nreading score was 1594, an increase of 193 points over the 1998 \naverage; the average math score was 1650, an increase of 289 points.\n  The Roosevelt fifth graders showed similar gains. Their lowest \naverage scores of 1408 in reading and 1395 in math occurred in 1999. In \n2005, the average reading score was 1719, an increase of 311 points; \nthe average math score increased to 1641, an increase of 246 points.\n  Roosevelt attributes its success to the strong team effort, involving \nteachers, administrators, and parents working closely together to set \ngoals and objectives for the children.\n  Another component of the success of all of Mankato's schools is the \ntremendous support from the community. Last fall, Mankato-area voters \napproved two referenda: to provide $6 million to update many existing \nbuildings throughout the district and to provide $3.5 million over 7 \nyears to update the schools' technology. In 2002, voters approved a \n$2.5 million per year operating referendum.\n  Much of the credit for Roosevelt Elementary School's success belongs \nto its principal, Rick Lund, and the dedicated teachers. The students \nand staff at Roosevelt Elementary School understand that, in order to \nbe successful, a school must go beyond achieving academic success; it \nmust also provide a nurturing environment where students can develop \nthe knowledge, skills, and attitudes for success throughout life.

It \nachieves the goal embodied in its mission statement: ``Learning and \nSucceeding Together for Tomorrow's World.''\n  Kennedy Elementary is implementing Reading First, a 3-year program \nwhich provides intensive professional development for all teachers, \nkindergarten through third grade. One teacher from both the fourth and \nfifth grades also takes part, to ensure continuity of reading \ninstruction beyond the third grade.\n  Since 2002, Kennedy teachers have, on their own time, attended study \ngroups that meet for 2 hours each week. They follow a protocol to \nexplore scientifically based reading research, which they apply in \ntheir teaching. The teachers regularly review test data to tailor their \nreading instruction to each child. Teams of teachers, including the \nclassroom teachers, the title I reading teacher, and the English \nlanguage learner teachers, collaborate to create successful \nintervention plans for any pupil performing below grade-level \nbenchmarks in reading. During the study groups, teachers also review \nand critique video clips of each other's teaching. Through this process \nof reflection, teachers evaluate themselves to improve their \ninstructional techniques and teaching practices.\n  The North Central Association for Accreditation and School \nImprovement recently conducted a peer review of Kennedy Elementary \nSchool's reading instruction. The school earned a perfect score.\n  The study and research of the Kennedy Elementary Leadership Team \nidentified early educational interventions and programs to increase\n\n[[Page S8264]]\n\nachievement. This research resulted in specific changes intended to \nimprove the achievement of all children, including a full-day \nkindergarten program, hiring an additional English language learner \nteacher, and adding three reading intervention teachers. In addition, \nmore teachers were hired to reduce class sizes in grades K-3.\n  Another component of the success of all of Mankato's schools is the \ntremendous support from the community. Last fall, Mankato-area voters \napproved two referenda: to provide $6 million to update many existing \nbuildings throughout the district and to provide $3.5 million over 7 \nyears to update the schools' technology. In 2002, voters approved a \n$2.5 million per year operating referendum.\n  Much of the credit for Kennedy Elementary School's success belongs to \nits principal, Greg Stoffel, and the dedicated teachers. The students \nand staff at Kennedy Elementary School understand that, in order to be \nsuccessful, a school must go beyond achieving academic success; it must \nalso provide a nurturing environment where students can develop the \nknowledge, skills, and attitudes for success throughout life. All of \nthe faculty, staff, and students at Kennedy Elementary School should be \nvery proud of their accomplishments.\n  I congratulate Kennedy Elementary School in Mankato for winning the \nAward for Excellence in Education and for its exceptional contributions \nto education in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/26/senate-section/article/S8264-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RECOGNIZING WASHINGTON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, MANKATO, MINNESOTA\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today I honor Washington Elementary \nSchool, in Mankato, MN, which recently earned an Award for Excellence \nin Education for its exceptional and innovative achievements in \neducating children.\n  Washington Elementary School is truly a model of educational success. \nThe school is one of 9 elementary schools in Mankato and serves 380 \npupils, including a large number of children of diverse backgrounds, \nand many who settled in Mankato upon arriving from other countries. \nThirteen percent of Washington children are English language learners, \nand 40 percent qualify for free or reduced-price lunches.\n  The large percentages of English language learners and children from \nlow-income families present a significant challenge to the school; and \nalthough Washington Elementary has never failed to make adequate yearly \nprogress relative to the requirements of No Child Left Behind, that \nsuccess has required a constant focus on academic achievement.\n  The staff at Washington Elementary consistently strive to make \nclassroom learning more meaningful by finding connections with all \nother aspects of the children's daily lives. Teachers also demonstrate \ntheir belief that the children can and will succeed; they then take \ntime to celebrate their pupils' successes.\n  At a monthly celebration assembly, a feature of the continuing focus \non acknowledging successes, children are publicly recognized for \ncurricular and noncurricular attainments, which can involve such areas \nas most improved, citizenship, and academic achievement. At each \nassembly, every teacher recognizes three pupils, who receive student-\nof-the-month ribbons. Their names are also posted in the school's front \nlobby. It is a goal that, by the end of the year, every child will have \nbeen recognized for some accomplishment. This recognition builds self-\nesteem, promotes a sense of individual responsibility, and effectively \nmotivates pupils to work hard academically.\n  Another component of the success of all of Mankato's schools is the \ntremendous support from the community. Last fall, Mankato-area voters \napproved two referenda: to provide $6 million to update many existing \nbuildings throughout the district, and to provide $3.5 million over 7 \nyears to update the schools' technology. In 2002, voters approved a \n$2.5 million per year operating referendum.\n  Much of the credit for Washington Elementary School's success belongs \nto its principal, Judi Brandon, and the dedicated teachers. The \nstudents and staff at Washington Elementary School understand that, in \norder to be successful, a school must go beyond achieving academic \nsuccess; it must also provide a nurturing environment where students \ncan develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes for success throughout \nlife. All of the faculty, staff, and students at Washington Elementary \nSchool should be very proud of their accomplishments.\n  I congratulate Washington Elementary School in Mankato for winning \nthe Award for Excellence in Education and for its exceptional \ncontributions to education in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/26/senate-section/article/S8264-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNIZING THE BREN ROAD EDUCATION CENTER, MINNETONKA, MINNESOTA\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today I honor the Bren Road \nEducation Center, in Minnetonka, MN, which recently earned an Award for \nExcellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative achievements \nin educating children.\n  The Bren Road Education Center is truly a model of educational \nsuccess. The center serves high school students, who often present the \ngreatest challenges for educators. Those enrolled at Bren Road have \nbeen referred by their school districts and come with behavioral \nproblems, unsuccessful social interactions, and, in some cases, \nneurobiological disorders and developmental delays. Nearly all students \nhave significant special education needs in the areas of emotional and \nbehavior functioning. Many have substance abuse and/or mental health \nillnesses or a history of involvement with the juvenile courts. All the \nteachers and staff at the Bren Road Education Center approach these \ntremendous challenges with the assumption that their students will \nsucceed.\n  The Bren Road Education Center opened its doors in September, 2005, \nwith a true sense of excitement and promise. One observer said, ``There \nwas a sense of relief that the students at the Bren Road Education \nCenter would now have a new chance, an opportunity for success, and a \nbright future!''\n  The staff at Bren Road consider each student to be unique, and they \nwork tirelessly to build relationships with the students by engaging \nthem respectfully. The philosophy at Bren Road is that these young \npeople have often struggled unsuccessfully in traditional, large high \nschools, because their particular needs had gone unrecognized. Given \nthe right environment, appropriate support, positive relationships with \nadults, and opportunities to give and receive respect, they can do well \nin an academic setting.\n  Bren Road's individualized instruction in reading, writing, and math \nprepares students to pass State-level proficiency tests. Experimental \nlearning labs including science, art, and independent living labs \nafford students hands-on learning and vocational experiences. One \nstudent was repeatedly suspended from his regular high school, because \nhe could not control his anger. At Bren Road, however, he has developed \nhis interest in woodworking and takes pride in making Adirondack \nfurniture.\n  Much of the credit for the Bren Road Education Center's success \nbelongs to its supervisor, Jan Joslin, and the dedicated teachers and \nstaff. The students and staff at the Bren Road Education Center \nunderstand that, in order to be successful, a school must go beyond \nachieving academic success; it must also provide a nurturing \nenvironment where students can develop the knowledge, skills, and \nattitudes for success throughout life. All of the faculty, staff, and \nstudents at the Bren Road Education Center should be very proud of \ntheir accomplishments.\n  I congratulate the Bren Road Education Center in Minnetonka for \nwinning the Award for Excellence in Education and for its exceptional \ncontributions to education in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/26/senate-section/article/S8264-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8264-S8265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNIZING THE EDEN PRAIRIE SCHOOL DISTRICT, EDEN PRAIRIE, MINNESOTA\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today I honor the Eden Prairie \nSchool District, in Eden Prairie, MN, which recently earned an Award \nfor Excellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative \nachievements in educating children.\n  The Eden Prairie School District is truly a model of educational \nsuccess.\n\n[[Page S8265]]\n\nThe district takes a systemwide approach to ending a subtle form of \nracism that can plague schools and other institutions.\n  Some schools use an approach to teaching that has a bias--an approach \nthat benefits white students and puts black students at a disadvantage. \nEden Prairie Schools Superintendent Dr. Melissa Krull, believes the \ndistrict has made progress toward a solution.\n  The 2005 Minnesota Comprehensive Assessments, MCA, results for Eden \nPrairie were impressive: All schools showed dramatic improvements. \nHowever, the district found that its Black students were not realizing \nthe same level of success as other students.\n  Eden Prairie found that even excluding factors such as poverty, \nlearning disabilities, and English as a second language, the district's \nBlack students were still not doing as well as White students, who \nearned approximately 22 to 25 percentage points more than Black \nstudents on the MCAs.\n  Eden Prairie Schools have made a great commitment of time and \nresources to eliminating the achievement gap. Eden Prairie \nadministrators base their response on research and data, breaking down \ntest results by racial groups, then determining which schools, \nclassrooms, and students need that extra attention.\n  The district created a program, at one elementary school, called \n``The Mom's Club,'' inviting single mothers to visit and talk with \nstaff and other single mothers while their sons interact with male high \nschool students to establish friendships. Through the district's Somali \nLiaison Program, a Somali staff member visits new Somali families to \nanswer questions about the schools and show families how to get \ninvolved. As part of a Homework Zone Initiative, staff members go to \napartment complexes with diverse families and offer free, afterschool \ntutoring.\n  Much of the credit for the Eden Prairie School District's success \nbelongs to its superintendent, Dr. Melissa Krull, the dedicated \nprincipals, teachers, and other staff. The students and staff within \nthe district understand that, in order to be successful, a district \nmust go beyond achieving academic success; it must also provide a \nnurturing environment where all students can develop the knowledge, \nskills, and attitudes for success throughout life. All of the faculty, \nstaff, and students at the Eden Prairie School District should be very \nproud of their accomplishments.\n  I congratulate Eden Prairie School District in Eden Prairie for \nwinning the Award for Excellence in Education and for its exceptional \ncontributions to education in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/26/senate-section/article/S8265-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNIZING THE ARTS HIGH SCHOOL--PERPICH CENTER FOR ARTS EDUCATION--\n                        GOLDEN VALLEY, MINNESOTA\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today I honor the Arts High School \nat the Perpich Center for Arts Education, in Golden Valley, MN, which \nrecently earned an Award for Excellence in Education for its \nexceptional and innovative achievements in educating children.\n  The Arts High School is truly a model of educational success. The \nschool is a residential, tuition-free, public high school delivering a \ncomprehensive education for eleventh- and twelfth-grade students \nmotivated to focus their studies on the arts. Enrollment is limited to \n310 students, affording a relatively small learning environment while \nallowing students from every part of Minnesota to take advantage of the \nwonderful arts resources in the Twin Cities. Dedicated and caring staff \nmembers furnish 24-hour supervision and coordinate many special \nactivities for dormitory residents. Its 16-year history has \ndemonstrated that the Arts High School is a highly effective means of \npromoting student achievement and artistic attainment.\n  In their morning classes, Arts High students study math, science, \nworld languages, English, and social studies. In the afternoon, they \ndelve deeply into their arts area studies; students can concentrate on \ndance, literary arts, media arts, music, theater, or visual arts. Over \nthe past 5 years, the Arts High has had 9 National Merit Scholarship \nFinalists, 6 Semifinalists, and 18 Commended Students.\n  Testimonials from the Arts High School's graduates convey their \nappreciation of the school's merits. Ashley Wilkinson, class of 2004, \nsays, ``My experiences at the Arts High School have given me the \nconfidence to approach any situation and succeed. The extra confidence \nhas made me stronger and prepared me for the world.'' Brian McManamon, \nclass of 1993, who is an MFA candidate at the Yale School of Drama, \nsays, ``As a student, I found myself continually interested in \nchallenging myself and experiencing not just acting, but taking a risk \nonce in a while and doing something I was not familiar with. I wouldn't \nbe where I am today, if I hadn't gone to the Arts High School.''\n  Much of the credit for the Arts High School's success belongs to its \nDirector, Rie Gilsdorf, and the dedicated teachers. The students and \nstaff at the Arts High School understand that, in order to be \nsuccessful, a school must go beyond achieving academic success; it must \nalso provide a nurturing environment where students can develop the \nknowledge, skills, and attitudes for success throughout life.

Mr. President, today I honor Mankato East Junior \nHigh School, in Mankato, MN, which recently earned an Award for \nExcellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative achievements \nin educating children.\n  Mankato East Junior High School is truly a model of educational \nsuccess. The school has formed a partnership with the Greater Mankato \nDiversity Council to augment the community's commitment to creating an \nenvironment of inclusiveness. Mankato East Junior High offers the \ncouncil's prejudice reduction workshops to the seventh and eighth \ngrades. The curriculum's core value is respect.\n  The seventh grade curriculum at Mankato East Junior High focuses on \n``Global Awareness/World Mindedness: If the World Were a Village.'' \nThis workshop identifies inequities in the distribution of resources \namong the world's people, and it encourages dialogue about how students \ncan contribute to finding a solution to the problem.\n  The eighth grade workshop, ``Vive la Difference,'' gives students an \nopportunity to participate in an activity to learn about the feelings \nand behaviors accompanying inclusion and exclusion.\n  Mankato East Junior High School also supports P.E.A.C.E. People \nExperiencing and Accepting Cultures Everywhere. Approximately 50 of the \nschool's 465 seventh and eighth graders participate in the PEACE \nproject, helping them find new ways to increase cultural awareness, \npromote acceptance among all students, speak out against violence and \nracism, teach tolerance, lead by positive example, serve the community \nthrough special projects, improve self-esteem, and support others.\n  As part of its efforts to increase awareness and appreciation of \nother cultures, Mankato East Junior High invites the Mixed Blood \nTheater to perform for the entire student body. This year's \npresentation, the ``Black Eagle,'' tells the story of Dr. Ronald \nMcNair, the African-American scientist who was aboard the Space Shuttle \nChallenger in 1986.\n  Another component of the success of all of Mankato's schools is the \ntremendous support from the community. Last fall, Mankato-area voters \napproved two referenda: to provide $6 million to update many existing \nbuildings throughout the district and to provide $3.5 million over 7 \nyears to update the schools' technology.

A Senate Joint Memorial adopted by the Colorado \n     General Assembly relative to recognition of NASA's space \n     exploration vision; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \n     and Transportation.\n\n                    Senate Joint Memorial No. 06-002\n\n       Whereas, since its inception in 1958, the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has accomplished \n     many great scientific and technological feats, in addition to \n     advancing humankind's knowledge of the earth and the \n     universe; and\n       Whereas, Colorado, a leader in the aerospace industry, is \n     home to more than 300 aerospace companies, has over 157,000 \n     direct and indirect employees supported by the aerospace \n     industry, and ranks third in the nation in private aerospace \n     absolute employment; and\n       Whereas, Colorado is home to Air Force Space Command with \n     facilities at Peterson, Schriever, and Buckley Air Force \n     bases as well as the operational home to the Air Force \n     Satellite Control Network and the Global Positioning System \n     (GPS), for accurate navigation, position determination, and \n     timing; and\n       Whereas, Colorado is also home to Northern Command, and the \n     Army Space Battle Lab, each providing the Department of \n     Defense with leading space technologies and homeland \n     security, aiding in the protection of America from \n     terrorists; and\n       Whereas, Colorado is home to world-class aerospace \n     companies such as Lockheed Martin Space Systems, Ball \n     Aerospace, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Raytheon, and hundreds \n     of small and mid-sized companies; and\n       Whereas, Colorado is home to world-class institutions of \n     higher learning that continue to keep Colorado premier among \n     the states with the most high-tech workers per capita and \n     many astronauts, including the first Native American \n     astronaut, and are the recipients of millions of dollars of \n     federal government space research science and engineering \n     grants and contracts; and\n       Whereas, Colorado is home to the Space Foundation, where \n     the Aerospace Industry meets and focuses on 21st century \n     education and the economic growth and strength of a broad \n     range of space enterprises; and\n       Whereas, the desire to explore is part of America's \n     character, and history has shown that space exploration \n     benefits all humankind through new technologies for everyday \n     application, new jobs across the entire economic enterprise, \n     economic contributions through new markets and commercial \n     products, education and inspiration, United States \n     leadership, increased security, and a legacy for future \n     generations; and\n       Whereas, a Space Exploration Vision has been articulated to \n     affirm the United States' commitment to human space \n     exploration and to give NASA a new focus and clear \n     objectives, including long-term human and robotic programs to \n     explore the solar system and a return to the moon that will \n     ultimately enable future exploration of Mars and other \n     destinations; and\n       Whereas, the Space Exploration Vision began with NASA \n     returning the space shuttle to safe flight, with the chief \n     purpose of completing assembly on the International Space \n     Station, in addition to developing a new crew exploration \n     vehicle to explore beyond earth's orbit to other worlds; and\n       Whereas, the Space Exploration Vision has the potential to \n     drive innovation, development, and advancement in the \n     aerospace and other high-technology industries across the \n     nation and in the state of Colorado; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Sixty-fifth General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado, the House of Representatives \n     concurring herein, That the General Assembly of the State of \n     Colorado hereby strongly encourages all members of the United \n     States Congress to support the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration's Space Exploration Vision to enable the \n     United States and the State of Colorado to remain leaders in \n     the exploration and development of space; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Joint Memorial be sent to \n     George W.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Texas relative to enacting a free \n     trade agreement between the United States and Taiwan; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 720\n\n       Whereas, Taiwan is Texas' fifth-largest foreign market, and \n     the agriculture and manufacturing sectors of the Texas \n     economy, most notably the computer and electronic products, \n     chemicals, and machinery industries, would benefit \n     significantly if the United States enacted a free trade \n     agreement with Taiwan; and\n       Whereas, a free trade agreement between the United States \n     and Taiwan would substantially reduce or eliminate most \n     import quotas, duties, and other trade barriers and expand \n     market opportunities for manufactured goods and agricultural \n     products from Texas and the entire United States; and\n       Whereas, the United States has completed or is in the \n     process of negotiating free trade agreements with several \n     countries and regions; reasons for pursuing a free trade \n     agreement with Taiwan include its status as the United \n     States' eighth-largest trading partner, its robust economy, \n     and its long-standing educational and cultural ties with the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan was admitted to the World Trade \n     Organization on January 1, 2001; a free trade agreement \n     between the United States and Taiwan would extend the \n     coverage of World Trade Organization agreements to products, \n     sectors, and conditions of trade that are now not adequately \n     covered, and it would provide a platform to address issues \n     such as Taiwan's 15.2 percent average tariff rate on \n     agricultural imports from the United States; and\n       Whereas, Public Law 107-210, the Trade Act of 2002, gives \n     the president the authority to enter into trade agreements \n     with foreign countries whenever the president determines that \n     one or more existing duties or other import restrictions of \n     any foreign country or the United States are unduly burdening \n     and restricting the foreign trade of the United States; and\n       Whereas, President George W. Bush, speaking before the \n     historic signing of the United States-Australia Free Trade \n     Agreement in 2004, emphasized that he supports free and open \n     trade because ``it has the power to create new wealth for \n     whole nations and new opportunities for millions of people'' \n     and ``has a record of creating jobs, raising living \n     standards, and lowering consumer prices''; Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the State of Texas, 79th \n     Legislature, Hereby respectfully encourage the president of \n     the United States to extend the benefits of free trade by \n     enacting a free trade agreement between the United States and \n     Taiwan; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the secretary of the senate forward official \n     copies of this Resolution to the president of the United \n     States, to the speaker of the house of representatives and \n     the president of the senate of the United States Congress, \n     and to all the members of the Texas delegation to the \n     congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-414. A Senate Joint Resolution adopted by the Colorado \n     General Assembly relative to the condemnation of the Chinese \n     government's persecution of practitioners of Falun Gong; to \n     the Committee on Foreign Relations\n\n                   Senate Joint Resolution No. 06-027\n\n       Whereas, Falun Gong is a peaceful spiritual movement that \n     originated in the People's Republic of China and has grown \n     rapidly worldwide, including thousands of practitioners in \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas, Falun Gong encourages its practitioners to \n     cultivate ``truthfulness, compassion, and forbearance''; and\n\n[[Page S8268]]\n\n       Whereas, the Constitution of the People's Republic of China \n     provides to its citizens freedom of speech, assembly, \n     association, and religious belief; and\n       Whereas, Falun Gong practitioners, as well as members of \n     pro-democracy groups and advocates of human rights reform, \n     have become targets of severe government persecution in China \n     in violation of China's own laws; and\n       Whereas, the 2005 United States Department of State's \n     annual report on International Religious Freedom cited the \n     Chinese government's persecution of Falun Gong \n     practitioners in China; and\n       Whereas, a 2005 press release from the United Nations \n     Special Rapporteur on Torture, Manfred Nowak, referred to \n     continuing ill-treatment and torture of Chinese ethnic \n     minorities, political dissidents, and religious groups, \n     including practitioners of Falun Gong; and\n       Whereas, Falun Gong practitioners report first-hand of the \n     Chinese government's terror campaign, which survivors say \n     includes persecution, arrests, imprisonment, torture, and \n     murder; and\n       Whereas, recent reports from Chinese journalists describe a \n     hospital in Sujiatun, a suburb of Shenyeng in northeast \n     China, that serves as a concentration camp for 6,000 Falun \n     Gong practitioners and in which the medical staff performs \n     experiments on detainees, including harvesting organs to be \n     sold; and\n       Whereas, in addition to persecution in China, Falun Gong \n     followers in the United States report that they have been \n     victims of spying, harassment, intimidation, and violence by \n     agents of the Chinese government; and\n       Whereas, the United States Constitution guarantees to its \n     citizens freedom of religion, association, and speech, which \n     allows Americans to live without fear and in accordance with \n     their personal beliefs; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Sixty-fifth General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado, the House of Representatives \n     concurring herein, (1) That we, the members of the Sixty-\n     fifth General Assembly, strongly urge the government of the \n     People's Republic of China to: (a) End immediately the \n     harassment, detention, physical abuse, and imprisonment of \n     its own citizens who exercise their legitimate rights to \n     freedom of religion, speech, and association; and (b) Cease \n     its interference in the constitutionally guaranteed religious \n     and political freedoms of United States citizens who practice \n     Falun Gong; and (2) That, in order to encourage China to \n     respect the religious freedom of its citizens, we urge the \n     government of the United States to: (a) Issue, an official, \n     public, diplomatic statement to the Chinese Foreign Ministry \n     condemning China's repeated violations of basic human rights \n     protected in international covenants to which the People's \n     Republic of China is a signatory; (b) Work with Chinese human \n     rights activists, including practitioners of Falun Gong, to \n     identify any Chinese authorities who have been responsible \n     for acts of violence and persecution against Falun Gong \n     followers in the United States; and (c) Investigate any \n     illegal acts committed by Chinese consular officials and \n     agents in the United States and determine an appropriate \n     legal response; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Joint Resolution be sent to \n     George W.

A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of Tennessee relative to the Meth-Endangered \n     Children Protection Act of 2005; to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                    Senate Joint Resolution No. 750\n\n       Whereas, meth trafficking and abuse is on the rise in the \n     United States, and it has increased sharply since 2000; \n     according to the 2003 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, \n     approximately 12.3 million Americans ages 12 and older \n     reported trying meth at least once during their lifetimes; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Office of National Drug Policy reports that \n     between 2000 and 2003, more than 51,000 illegal meth labs \n     were seized in the United States, and the number of \n     clandestine labs has been rising rapidly; in fact, a high \n     number of state and local governments now consider meth the \n     greatest drug threat in the country; and\n       Whereas, sadly, thousands of children have become innocent \n     victims of the meth epidemic; approximately 10,600 children \n     in the United States were affected by meth lab seizures and \n     incidents between 2000 and 2003; these children were either \n     present at lab seizures or lived where the labs were seized, \n     often in extremely filthy and neglectful conditions; and\n       Whereas, another 2,900 children were removed from their \n     homes during the same period because of neglect or abuse by \n     meth-addicted parents; incidents related to meth labs also \n     accounted for injuries to 96 children and the deaths of eight \n     others; in Tennessee alone, law enforcement seized nearly \n     1,200 labs between 2003 and 2004, representing a 397 percent \n     increase from 2000; Tennessee accounts for 75 percent of the \n     meth lab seizures in the Southeast, and more than 700 \n     children in Tennessee are placed in protective custody each \n     year as a result of meth lab seizures; and\n       Whereas, children exposed to meth because of a lab in the \n     home often need specialized services to overcome the effects \n     of their exposure; children removed from homes where meth is \n     manufactured can suffer from increased heart rate, agitation, \n     irritability and vomiting, muscle breakdown, fever, ataxia, \n     and seizures; they can also suffer physical, medical, \n     education neglect, and learning disabilities; and\n       Whereas, many of the children rescued from these \n     environments need specialized medical attention, \n     psychological care, and other services; unfortunately, few \n     states have the funds to provide these services or to provide \n     social workers and other professionals with the specialized \n     training and resources necessary to render appropriate care \n     to children and ensure that subsequent placements in foster \n     or adoptive homes are successful; and\n       Whereas, the Meth-Endangered Children Protection Act would \n     establish a $10 million annual competitive grant program to \n     support model efforts such as California's DEC program and to \n     assist states in establishing similar programs; grantees \n     would be required to provide matching dollars for federal \n     funds awarded under this grant; and\n       Whereas, thousands of children have become victims of the \n     rising meth epidemic; through no fault of their own, these \n     children, suffering at the hands of their meth-addicted \n     parents, urgently need medical attention, psychological care, \n     and social services; the Meth-Endangered Children Protection \n     Act is of vital importance in ensuring that our nation's \n     children recover from the ravages of meth abuse; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the 104th General Assembly of the \n     State of Tennessee, the House of Representatives concurring, \n     That we hereby urge the United States Congress to pass the \n     Meth-Endangered Children Protection Act of 2005 to aid the \n     most vulnerable victims of this terrible and destructive drug \n     epidemic; and be it further\n       Resolved, That an enrolled copy of this resolution be \n     transmitted to the President and the Secretary of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker and the Clerk of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and each member of Tennessee's \n     Congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-416. A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of Tennessee relative to the reauthorization of \n     the special provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965; to \n     the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                    Senate Joint Resolution No. 911\n\n       Whereas, following the Civil War, Congress adopted the \n     Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery, the Fourteenth \n     Amendment establishing the citizenship rights of all persons \n     born in the United States and requiring that no one be denied \n     due process or equal protection of the laws, and the \n     Fifteenth Amendment securing the right to vote for all \n     citizens, regardless of a person's race, color, or former \n     condition of servitude; and\n       Whereas, despite the enactment of these significant \n     constitutional commands, for nearly 100 years, states and \n     local jurisdictions passed laws and instituted practices \n     designed to circumvent the Civil War amendments; many states \n     erected barriers to access to the polls, including infamous \n     poll taxes and literacy or good character tests; African-\n     Americans, Latinos, and other minorities and those who \n     advocated on their behalf often were subjected to severe \n     violence and intimidation or, in some cases, death if they \n     attempted to register to vote or cast a ballot; and\n       Whereas, confronted with aggressive and relentless defiance \n     of the Constitution, Congress enacted the Voting Rights Act \n     of 1965 in order to ensure that the rights guaranteed by the \n     Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments were enforced; and\n       Whereas, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is widely viewed as \n     one of the most successful civil rights statutes ever \n     enacted; it bans literacy tests and other discriminatory \n     devices, outlaws discriminatory practices and procedures \n     during the voting process, authorizes the appointment of \n     federal election monitors and observers, and creates various \n     means for protecting and enforcing the rights of American \n     citizens, including racial and language minorities, to vote; \n     and\n       Whereas, although the struggle to ensure fairness in the \n     electoral process continues, as a result of the Voting Rights \n     Act, racial and language minorities have enjoyed enhanced \n     opportunities to participate in the electoral process, cast \n     votes, and elect their candidates of choice; and\n       Whereas, in 2007, certain ``special provisions'' of the \n     Voting Rights Act that were enacted to address discriminatory \n     voting practices and the present effects of those practices \n     could expire if not renewed by Congress; and\n       Whereas, these provisions include:\n       Section 2: This provision equips voters with the means to \n     challenge election laws that result in a denial or \n     abridgement of voting rights on account of race, color, or \n     language minority status;\n       Section 4: The coverage provision, which determines which \n     states and jurisdictions must seek Section 5 pre-clearance; \n     the coverage formula reaches states and jurisdictions with \n     some of the most active histories of discrimination;\n       Section 5: The federal pre-clearance of voting changes \n     provisions, which requires covered jurisdictions to prove \n     that voting\n\n[[Page S8269]]\n\n     changes are not discriminatory before they may legally take \n     effect;\n       Sections 6-9: The Federal Examiner/Observer provisions, \n     which set forth criteria for election monitoring by the \n     Department of Justice; and\n       Section 203: The bilingual voting materials provisions, \n     which mandate that certain voting materials must be \n     translated for language minorities in certain jurisdictions; \n     and\n       Whereas, by 2007, Congress will vote on whether to extend \n     these ``special provisions'' of the Voting Rights Act; the \n     effects of the long history of voting discrimination persist; \n     the ``special provisions'' of the Voting Rights Act continue \n     to be extremely important tools for protecting minority \n     voting; during the reauthorization process, Congress will \n     compile a record that sets forth the continuing effects of \n     the nation's widespread voting discrimination; and\n       Whereas, voting is the cornerstone of American democracy \n     and, during the reauthorization process, Congress and \n     individuals and organizations concerned with maintaining the \n     protections afforded by the Voting Rights Act of 1965 will \n     have an opportunity to present the evidence necessary to \n     support renewal of the ``special provisions'' of the Voting \n     Rights Act of 1965; in the meantime, all eligible voters \n     should register, confirm their registration status, and \n     exercise the right to vote so that the long struggle to \n     expand the franchise yields meaningful results: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the 104th General Assembly of the \n     State of Tennessee, the House of Representatives concurring, \n     That we hereby urge Congress to reauthorize the ``special \n     provisions'' of the Voting Rights Act of 1965; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the General Assembly of the State of \n     Tennessee will collaborate with all organizations dedicated \n     to ensuring the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act of \n     1965; and be it further\n       Resolved, That an enrolled copy of this resolution be \n     transmitted to the Speaker and the Clerk of the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the President and the Secretary of the U.S. \n     Senate, and each member of the Tennessee Congressional \n     Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-417. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Texas relative to memorializing \n     the Congress of the United States to address problems in the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs concerning the provision of \n     health care and benefits, the adjudication of claims, \n     accountability, and outreach and to enact legislation that \n     creates an appropriation formula that ensures predictable and \n     adequate funding for the health care programs of the Veterans \n     Health Administration; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 9\n\n       Whereas, military veterans who have served their country \n     honorably and who were promised and have earned health care \n     and benefits from the federal government through the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs are now in need of these \n     benefit; and\n       Whereas, the funding of the health care programs of the \n     Veterans Health Administration of the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs has failed to reflect the admission of newly eligible \n     veterans in the wake of the Veterans' Health Care Eligibility \n     Reform Act of 1996 and has fallen short of the amount needed \n     to counter soaring medical care inflation, resulting in a \n     funding shortfall of at least $10 billion; and\n       Whereas, the current discretionary method of funding the \n     health care programs of the Veterans Health Administration is \n     uncertain and is subject annually to the whim and competing \n     priorities of congress, to the detriment of the veterans \n     being served; and\n       Whereas, the Vietnam Veterans of America organization \n     supports the adoption of a new funding mechanism for the \n     health care programs of the Veterans Health Administration \n     that is indexed to medical inflation and the per capita use \n     of the administration's health care system; and\n       Whereas, the substantial delay in adjudicating veterans' \n     claims for service-connected disability compensation is \n     the cause of much anguish and anger among veterans and is \n     the result of a lack of funding of the Veterans Benefits \n     Administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs, \n     which has led to an insufficient number of adjudicators \n     and the inadequate training and supervision of \n     adjudicators; and\n       Whereas, while the vast majority of Department of Veterans \n     Affairs employees are dedicated to serving veterans, it is \n     necessary to ensure that employee accountability standards be \n     strengthened at senior and junior levels; and\n       Whereas, while more than five million veterans use the \n     Veterans Health Administration of the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs for their health care needs, tens of thousands more \n     are eligible for benefits of which they are unaware due, to \n     inadequate outreach efforts by the department: Now, therefore \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the State of Texas, 79th \n     Legislature, 3rd Called Session, hereby respectfully urge the \n     Congress of the United States to address problems in the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs related to the provision of \n     health care and benefits, the adjudication of claims, \n     accountability, and outreach and to enact legislation that \n     creates an appropriation formula that ensures predictable and \n     adequate funding of the health care programs of the Veterans \n     Health Administration; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the secretary of the senate forward official \n     copies of this Resolution to the secretary of veterans \n     affairs, the president of the United States, the president of \n     the senate and speaker of the house of representatives of the \n     United States Congress, and all members of the Texas \n     delegation to the congress with the request that this \n     Resolution be officially entered in the Congressional Record \n     as a memorial to the Congress of the United States of \n     America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-418.

A bill to regulate the judicial use of presidential signing \nstatements in the interpretation of Acts of Congress; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to introduce the \nPresidential Signing Statements Act of 2006. This bill achieves three \nimportant goals.\n  First, it prevents the President from issuing a signing statement \nthat alters the meaning of a statute by instructing Federal and State \ncourts not to rely on Presidential signing statements in interpreting a \nstatute.\n  Second, it permits the Congress to seek what amounts to a declaratory \njudgment on the legality of Presidential signing statements that seek \nto modify--or even to nullify--a duly enacted statute.\n  Third, it grants Congress the power to intervene in any case in the \nSupreme Court where the construction or constitutionality of any act of \nCongress is in question and a presidential signing statement for that \nact was issued.\n  Presidential signing statements are nothing new. Since the days of \nPresident James Monroe, Presidents have issued statements when signing \nbills. It is widely agreed that there are legitimate uses for signing \nstatements. For example, Presidents may use signing statements to \ninstruct executive branch officials how to administer a law. They may \nalso use them to explain to the public the likely effect of a law. And, \nthere may be a host of other legitimate uses.\n  However, the use of signing statements has risen dramatically in \nrecent years. As of June 26, 2006, President Bush had issued 130 \nsigning statements. President Clinton issued 105 signing statements \nduring his two terms. While the mere numbers may not be significant, \nthe reality is that the way the President has used those statements \nrenders the legislative process a virtual nullity.\n  The President cannot use a signing statement to rewrite the words of \na statute nor can the President use a signing statement to selectively \nnullify those provisions he does not like. This much is clear from our \nConstitution. The Constitution grants the President a specific, \nnarrowly defined role in enacting legislation. Article I, section 1 of \nthe Constitution vests ``all legislative powers . . . in a Congress.'' \nArticle I, section 7 of the Constitution provides that when a bill is \npresented to the President, he may either sign it or veto it with his \nobjections. He may also choose to do nothing, thus rendering a so-\ncalled pocket veto. The President cannot veto part of bill, however; he \ncannot veto certain provisions he does not like.\n\n  The Founders had good reason for constructing the legislative process \nas it is: by creating a bicameral legislature and then granting the \nPresident the veto power. According to The Records of the \nConstitutional Convention, the veto power was designed by our Framers \nto protect citizens from a particular Congress that might enact \noppressive legislation. However, the Framers did not want the veto \npower to be unchecked, and so, in article I, section 7, they balanced \nit by allowing Congress to override a veto by two-thirds vote.\n  As you can see, this is a finely structured constitutional procedure \nthat goes straight to the heart of our system of check and balances. \nAny action by the President that circumvents this finely structured \nprocedure is an unconstitutional attempt to usurp legislative \nauthority. If the President is permitted to rewrite the bills that \nCongress passes and cherry pick which provisions he likes and does not \nlike, he subverts the constitutional process designed by our Framers.\n  The Supreme Court has affirmed that the constitutional process for \nenacting legislation must be safe guarded. As the Supreme Court \nexplained in INS v. Chahda, ``It emerges clearly that the prescription \nfor legislative action in Article I, Section 1, clause 7 represents the \nFramers' decision that the legislative power of the Federal government \nbe exercised in accord with a single, finely wrought and exhaustively \nconsidered, procedure.''\n  So, while signing statements have been commonplace since our \ncountry's founding, we must make sure that they are not being used in \nan unconstitutional manner; a manner that seeks to rewrite legislation, \nand exercise line item vetoes.\n  President Bush has used signing statements in ways that have raised \nsome eyebrows. For example, Congress passed the PATRIOT Act after \nmonths of deliberation. We debated nearly every provision--often \nredrafting and revising. Moreover, we worked very closely with the \nPresident because we wanted to get it right. We wanted to make sure \nthat we were passing legislation that the executive branch would find \nworkable. In fact, in many ways, the process was an excellent example \nof the legislative branch and the executive branch working together \ntowards a common goal.\n  In the end, the bill that was passed by the Senate and the House \ncontained several oversight provisions intended to make sure the FBI \ndid not abuse the special terrorism-related powers to search homes and \nsecretly seize papers. It also required Justice Department officials to \nkeep closer track of how often the FBI uses the new powers and in what \ntype of situations.\n  The President signed the PATRIOT Act into law, but afterwards, he \nwrote a signing statement that said he could withhold any information \nfrom Congress provided in the oversight provisions if he decided that \ndisclosure would impair foreign relations, national security, the \ndeliberative process of the executive, or the performance of the \nexecutive's constitutional duties.\n  Now, during the entire process of working with the President to draft\n\n[[Page S8272]]\n\nthe PATRIOT Act, he never asked the Congress to include this language \nin the Act. At a hearing we held on signing statements, I asked an \nexecutive branch official, Michelle Boardman from the Office of Legal \nCounsel, why the President did not ask the Congress to put the signing \nstatement language into the bill. She simply didn't have an answer. I \nasked her to get back to me with the answer and I still have not gotten \na response.\n  Take another example, the McCain amendment. In that legislation, \nCongress voted by an overwhelming margin--90 to 9--to ban all U.S. \npersonnel from inflicting cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment on any \nprisoner held anywhere by the United States. President Bush, who had \nthreatened to veto the legislation, instead invited its prime sponsor, \nSenator John McCain, to the White House for a public reconciliation and \ndeclared they had a common objective: to make it clear to the world \nthat this government does not torture and that we adhere to the \ninternational convention of torture.\n  Now from that, you might conclude that by signing the McCain \namendment into law, the Bush administration has fully committed to not \nusing torture. But you would be wrong. After the public ceremony of \nsigning the bill into law, the President issued a signing statement \nsaying his administration would interpret the new law ``in a manner \nconsistent with the constitutional authority of the President to \nsupervise the unitary executive branch and as Commander in Chief and \nconsistent with the constitutional limitations on the judicial power.'' \nThis vague language may mean that--despite the McCain amendment--the \nadministration may still be preserving a right to inflict torture on \nprisoners and to evade the International Convention Against Torture.\n  The constitutional structure of enacting legislation must be \nsafeguarded. That is why I am here today to introduce the Presidential \nSigning Statements Act of 2006. This bill does not seek to limit the \nPresident's power--and this bill does not seek to expand Congress's \npower. Rather, this bill simply seeks to safeguard our constitution.\n  First, the bill instructs courts not to rely on Presidential signing \nstatements in construing an act. This will provide courts with much-\nneeded guidance on how legislation should be interpreted. The Supreme \nCourt's reliance on Presidential signing statements has been sporadic \nand unpredictable. In some cases--such as United States v. Lopez, where \nthe Court struck down the Gun-Free School Zones Act--the Supreme Court \nhas relied on Presidential signing statements as a source of authority, \nwhile in other cases, such as the recent military tribunals case, \nHamdan v. Rumsfeld, it has conspicuously declined to do so. This \ninconsistency has the unfortunate effect of rendering the \ninterpretation of Federal law unpredictable.\n  It is well within Congress's power to resolve judicial disputes such \nas this by enacting rules of statutory interpretation. This power flows \nfrom article I, section 8, clause 18 of the Constitution, which gives \nCongress the power ``To make all laws which shall be necessary and \nproper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other \npowers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United \nStates, or in any department or officer thereof.'' Rules of statutory \ninterpretation are necessary and proper to execute the legislative \npower. Moreover, any legislation that sets out rules for interpreting \nan act makes legislation more clear and precise which is exactly what \nwe aim to achieve here in Congress. Congress can and should exercise \nthis power over the interpretation of Federal statutes in a systematic \nand comprehensive manner.\n  Second, this bill permits the Congress to seek a declaratory judgment \non the legality of Presidential signing statements that seek to \nmodify--or even to nullify--a duly enacted statute. Again, this simply \nensures that signing statements are not used in an unconstitutional \nmanner.\n  Third, it grants Congress the power to intervene in any case in the \nSupreme Court where the construction or constitutionality of any act of \nCongress is in question and a Presidential signing statement for that \nact was issued. That way, if the court is trying to determine the \nmeaning or the constitutionality of an act, the Congress gets a voice \nin the debate.\n  Take for example United States v. Lopez. In that case, the Supreme \nCourt struck down the Gun-Free School Zones Act as beyond Congress's \npower to regulate commerce. Chief Justice Rehnquist relied, in part, on \nPresident George Bush's signing statement to support the Court's \nconclusion that the plain language of the statute does not suggest that \nit affects interstate commerce. Now, I do not see, in a case like this, \nwhy Congress should not get to explain its side. This bill would allow \nCongress to intervene and present evidence as to the meaning of an act \nin question.\n  This bill does not seek to limit the President's power and it does \nnot seek to expand Congress's power. It simply seeks to put measures in \nplace that will safeguard the constitutional structure of enacting \nlegislation. In preserving this structure, this bill reinforces our \nsystem of checks and balances and separation of powers set out in our \nConstitution and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 3734. A bill to amend title 28, United States Code, to allow a \njudge to whom a case is transferred to retain jurisdiction over certain \nmultidistrict litigation cases for trial, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Multidistrict \nLitigation Restoration Act of 2006.\n  The word ``Lexecon'' is well known in the Federal judiciary. It \nrefers to the 1998 Supreme Court decision holding that statutory \nauthority does not exist for transferee courts handling cases \ncentralized by the Multidistrict Litigation Panel, or the MDL Panel, to \nretain these cases for trial. For approximately 30 years, courts \nreceiving cases for pretrial proceedings from the MDL Panel invoked the \ngeneral venue statute to transfer cases to themselves for trial. The \nprocess worked well because the court that had handled the pretrial \nphase was well-versed in the case's facts and was in the best position \nto encourage all parties to reach a settlement, or--barring \nsettlement--make a final determination by adjudicating the dispute. But \nwith the Lexecon decision that practice ended, and ever since we have \nbeen left with a multidistrict, multiparty, multiforum system that is \ncostly, time-consuming, repetitive, inefficient, and often \ninconsistent.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the MDL Panel is an entity comprising \nseven judges, authorized to transfer civil actions pending in more than \none district and involving one or more common questions of fact to any \ndistrict court for coordinated pretrial proceedings. The MDL Panel \nauthorizes the transfer upon determining that it will be for the \nconvenience of the parties and witnesses, and promote the just and \nefficient conduct of such actions. Congress established this \ncentralization mechanism in 1968 to avoid duplication of discovery, \nprevent inconsistent rulings, and conserve the resources of the \nparties, their counsel, and the judiciary.\n  Typically, cases centralized by the MDL Panel are numerous and \ncomplex. About 150,000 cases with millions of claims have been resolved \nthrough the process since its creation. They have included such matters \nas mass torts, antitrust price fixing, securities fraud, and unfair \nemployment practices. The transferee judge becomes highly knowledgeable \nabout the litigation during his or her consideration of voluminous \npretrial proceedings. When all of the cases are remanded to the various \ntransferor courts following completion of pretrial proceedings, those \ncourts know little or nothing about the litigation. Even when all the \nparties agree to keep the matter that has been transferred in the court \nit was transferred to, it cannot be done under the current law. In some \ninstances, judges have followed cases to courts outside their judicial \ncircuit to conduct trial, at considerable inconvenience and expense, in \norder to spare other judges from the nightmare of having such mammoth \ncases so suddenly thrust upon them.\n  Let me give you an example of what this means in real terms. In my \nown State of Utah, there have been nearly 1,000 cases that have been \ntransferred\n\n[[Page S8273]]\n\neither in or out of Utah's judicial district by the MDL Panel since \n1968. In fiscal year 2005, there were nearly 50 cases transferred out \nof Utah through the MDL process. That is 50 cases that could be dumped \nback onto our judges in Utah without any warning or preparation. At the \nsame time, there were six MDL cases pending in Utah at the end of 2005. \nUnder the post-Lexecon system, one or more of our judges could be \nrequired to follow these cases to other districts throughout the United \nStates for trial. Both of these scenarios would prove to be a serious \nburden for a small judicial district like Utah, and could hamper or \ndelay justice for the people of my State. This is the same challenge \nour courts face nationwide as a result of the Lexecon decision.\n  Congress is the only entity that can solve these problems. Writing \nfor the Court in Lexecon, Justice Souter stated that ``the proper venue \nfor resolving the issue remains the floor of Congress.'' That is why I \nam introducing the Multidistrict Litigation Restoration Act of 2006 \ntoday, to give the Federal judiciary the necessary statutory authority \nto transfer multidistrict litigation cases for the purposes of trial. \nThis legislation will return the law to what was in effect for almost \nthree decades prior to the Lexecon decision. It will provide the MDL \nPanel with the most efficient option for resolving complex issues, the \nbest means to encourage universal settlements, and the most consistent \napproach for rendering decisions.\n  This legislation is supported by the Judicial Conference of the \nUnited States, the policy arm of the Federal judicial branch, as well \nas the U.S. Department of Justice. The legislation is also supported by \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce Institute for Legal Reform.\n  Moreover, this is not a partisan effort. Proposals to reform \nmultidistrict, multiparty litigation were first advanced by the Carter \nadministration. I introduced similar legislation in the 106th Congress \nwith Senators Leahy, Kohl, and Schumer. That bill passed the Senate by \nunanimous consent.\n  This legislation is long overdue. Lexecon was decided 8 years ago. \nThe House has passed a Lexecon fix four times since 1999. In a letter \nto the chairman of the MDL Panel, Judge Thomas W. Thrash, a Federal \ndistrict court judge for the Northern District of Georgia, reporting on \nthe disposition of a multidistrict litigation case that he was required \nto try in Texas because he could not transfer the case to Georgia, \nsummed up the situation well. Judge Thrash wrote, ``Needless to say, \nresolution of this case has been prolonged and involved greater expense \nto the judiciary . . . because of my inability to transfer the Northern \nDistrict of Texas case to myself for trial here in the Northern \nDistrict of Georgia. On the other hand, it would have been almost \ncriminal to dump this case on a new Northern District of Texas judge \nfor trial. . . . I hope that this problem will be fixed by Congress \nsoon.''\n  Mr. President, I share that hope. I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport the Multidistrict Litigation Restoration Act of 2006 and I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3734\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Multidistrict Litigation \n     Restoration Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) under section 1407 of title 28, United States Code \n     (enacted April 29, 1968), the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict \n     Litigation (in this section referred to as the ``Judicial \n     Panel''), a group of 7 Federal judges selected by the Chief \n     Justice of the United States, assists in the centralization \n     of civil actions which share common questions of fact filed \n     in more than 1 Federal judicial district nationwide;\n       (2) civil actions described under paragraph (1)--\n       (A) often arise from mass single-action torts that cause \n     death and destruction in which the plaintiffs are from many \n     different States; and\n       (B) often involve issues of critical importance to the \n     Nation, including information technology, intellectual \n     property, antitrust, contracts, and products liability cases;\n       (3) the Judicial Panel--\n       (A) identifies the 1 United States district court (referred \n     to in this section as the ``transferee court'') best equipped \n     at adjudicating pretrial matters; and\n       (B) after pretrial, remands individual civil actions back \n     to the district where the civil action was originally filed \n     unless that action has been previously terminated;\n       (4)(A) for approximately 3 decades, the transferee court \n     often invoked a general venue statute that authorizes a \n     district court to transfer a civil action in the interest of \n     justice and for the convenience of the parties and witnesses;\n       (B) in effect, the transferee court simply transferred all \n     of the civil actions for trial to itself; and\n       (C) this process worked well because the transferee court \n     was well-versed in the facts and law of the centralized \n     litigation and the court could assist all parties to settle \n     when appropriate;\n       (5) in 1998, the United States Supreme Court held that the \n     plain language of section 1407 of title 28, United States \n     Code, requires the Judicial Panel to remand all civil actions \n     for trial back to the respective districts from which such \n     actions were originally referred;\n       (6) the absence of authority to transfer a centralized \n     civil action for trial hampers the Judicial Panel and \n     transferee judges in their ability to achieve the important \n     goals of section 1407 of that title promoting the just and \n     efficient conduct of multidistrict litigation;\n       (7) the Judicial Panel has inherent rulemaking authority to \n     promulgate procedural rules pertaining to multidistrict \n     litigation which the Judicial Panel has already exercised to \n     ensure that when a centralization occurs all civil actions of \n     a similar nature then filed and all later civil actions that \n     may be filed are sent to 1 district court;\n       (8) Congress has statutorily conferred the Judicial Panel \n     with rulemaking authority for the conduct of its business not \n     inconsistent with the United States Constitution, Acts of \n     Congress, and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; and\n       (9) in civil actions in which punitive damages are to be \n     imposed, individual courts, including transferee courts, must \n     ensure that the measure of punishment is both reasonable and \n     proportionate to the amount of harm to plaintiffs and to the \n     amount of compensatory damages received.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to improve the \n     litigation system in the Nation to allow a Federal judge to \n     whom a civil action is transferred under section 1407 of \n     title 28, United States Code, to retain jurisdiction over \n     certain civil actions for trial to determine liability and \n     compensatory and punitive damages, if appropriate, in \n     compliance with due process requirements.\n\n     SEC. 3. MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION.\n\n       Section 1407 of title 28, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in the third sentence of subsection (a), by inserting \n     ``or ordered transferred to the transferee or other district \n     under subsection (i)'' after ``terminated''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(i)(I) Subject to paragraph (2) and except as provided in \n     subsection (j), any action transferred under this section by \n     the panel may be transferred for trial purposes, by the judge \n     or judges of the transferee district to whom the action was \n     assigned, to the transferee or other district in the interest \n     of justice and for the convenience of the parties and \n     witnesses.\n       ``(2) Any action transferred for trial purposes under \n     paragraph (1) shall be remanded by the panel for the \n     determination of compensatory damages to the district court \n     from which it was transferred, unless the court to which the \n     action has been transferred for trial purposes also finds, \n     for the convenience of the parties and witnesses and in the \n     interests of justice, that the action should be retained for \n     the determination of compensatory damages.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. TECHNICAL AMENDMENT TO MULTIPARTY, MULTI FORM TRIAL \n                   JURISDICTION ACT OF 2002.\n\n       Section 1407 of title 28, United States Code, as amended by \n     section 3 of this Act, is further amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``(j)(1) In actions transferred under this section when \n     jurisdiction is or could have been based, in whole or in \n     part, on section 1369 of this title, the transferee district \n     court may, notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     section, retain actions so transferred for the determination \n     of liability and punitive damages. An action retained for the \n     determination of liability shall be remanded to the district \n     court from which the action was transferred, or to the State \n     court from which the action was removed, for the \n     determination of damages, other than punitive damages, unless \n     the court finds, for the convenience of parties and witnesses \n     and in the interest of justice, that the action should be \n     retained for the determination of damages.\n       ``(2) Any remand under paragraph (1) shall not be effective \n     until 60 days after the transferee court has issued an order \n     determining liability and has certified its intention to \n     remand some or all of the transferred actions for the \n     determination of damages. An appeal with respect to the \n     liability determination and the choice of law determination \n     of the transferee court may be taken during that 60-day \n     period to the court of appeals with appellate jurisdiction \n     over the transferee court. In the event a party files such an \n     appeal, the remand shall not be effective until the appeal \n     has been finally disposed of. Once the remand has become \n     effective, the liability determination and the choice of law \n     determination shall not be subject to further review by \n     appeal or otherwise.\n\n[[Page S8274]]\n\n       ``(3) An appeal with respect to determination of punitive \n     damages by the transferee court may be taken, during the 60-\n     day period beginning on the date the order making the \n     determination is issued, to the court of appeals with \n     jurisdiction over the transferee court.\n       ``( 4) Any decision under this subsection concerning remand \n     for the determination of damages, other than punitive \n     damages, shall not be reviewable by appeal or otherwise.\n       ``(5) Nothing in this subsection shall restrict the \n     authority of the transferee court to transfer or dismiss an \n     action on the ground of inconvenient forum.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       (a) Multidistrict Litigation.--The amendments made by \n     section 3 shall apply to any civil action pending on or \n     brought on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Technical Amendment.--The amendment made by section 4 \n     shall be effective as if enacted in section 11020(b) of the \n     Multiparty, Multiforum Trial Jurisdiction Act of 2002 (Public \n     Law 107-273; 116 Stat. 1826 et seq.).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN (for himself, Mr. Reed, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. \n        Martinez):\n  S. 3739. A bill to establish a Consortium on the Impact of Technology \nin Aging Health Services; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senator Coleman, \nSenator Kohl, Senator Martinez, Congressman Ramstad, and Congresswoman \nEshoo, today to introduce the Consortium on the Impact of Technology in \nHealth Services Act.\n  We face a challenging and exciting time in the evolution of America's \nhealth care system. Today, roughly 40 million men and women are over \nage 65. A full doubling of the elderly population is predicted to occur \nby the year 2030--with the first of the baby boom generation turning 65 \nin the year 2011--only 5 years from now.\n  Nowhere is the aging of the population more apparent than in my home \nState of Rhode Island. We exceed the national average in terms of \ncitizens over the age of 65 as well as those over the age of 85. In a \nState of slightly more than a million people, almost 15 percent of the \npopulation is over the age of 65 today. According to Census Bureau \nestimates, the number of elderly is expected to increase to 18.8 \npercent of Rhode Island's population by 2025. Rhode Island also has one \nof the highest concentrations of persons age 85 and over in the \ncountry.\n  Dramatic increases in life expectancy over the last century can be \nattributed to tremendous advances in public health and medical \nresearch. These demographic changes also pose new challenges to our \nhealth care system that require creative and innovative solutions.\n  In addition to Americans living longer, keeping up with advancements \nin medical science poses unique burdens and challenges for our health \ncare system. We are facing shortages in a number of critical health \ncare fields--nurses, primary care physicians, and geriatricians--to \nname a few. These workforce issues further hinder our ability to keep \nup with the health care needs of aging Americans.\n  Greater use of technology has the potential to enhance the quality of \ncare to our aging population and enable seniors to remain healthy and \nlive independently longer.\n  The application of technology in the aging health care services field \nwould also help mitigate the burden on providers by allowing \nphysicians, home health care workers, and family members to keep in \nregular contact with patients and loved ones. Better monitoring of \nelderly patients would also serve to identify changes in their health \ncondition before a serious problem arises.\n  Smarter applications of technology in caring for the aged could also \naddress some of the growing concerns with skyrocketing budget deficits. \nAs we grapple with Medicare and Medicaid taking up a growing proportion \nof overall Federal spending, we need to carefully balance health care \nexpenditures while also improving the quality of care. We need to be \nthoughtful and wiser with our health care dollars as well as creative \nin the provision of services to the elderly.\n  The Consortium on the Impact of Technology in Health Services Act \nwill bring together experts from the medical, aging, and technology \nfields to build a vision and a framework for the development and \nimplementation of a 21st century health care system able to meet the \nneeds of our burgeoning aging population.\n  We need to change the way we think about health care for our Nation's \nseniors. We need a model that is oriented toward health promotion and \ndisease prevention. This legislation gives us a jumpstart on developing \nand implementing the tools and strategies needed to serve the senior \npopulation of America more effectively and with greater cost savings.\n  I am pleased to join with my colleagues in introducing this important \ninitiative and hope the Senate will give it careful consideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 3740. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reform \nthe system of public financing for Presidential elections, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I will introduce a bill to repair \nand strengthen the Presidential public financing system. The \nPresidential Funding Act of 2006 will ensure that this system that has \nserved our country so well for over a generation will continue to \nfulfill its promise in the 21st century.\n  The Presidential public financing system was put into place in the \nwake of the Watergate scandals as part of the Federal Election Campaign \nAct of 1974. It was held to be constitutional by the Supreme Court in \nBuckley v. Valeo. The system, of course, is voluntary, as the Supreme \nCourt required. Every major party nominee for President since 1976 has \nparticipated in the system for the general election and, prior to 2000, \nevery major party nominee had participated in the system for the \nprimary election, too. In the last election, President Bush and two \nDemocratic candidates, Howard Dean and the eventual nominee John Kerry, \nopted out of the system for the Presidential primaries. President Bush \nand Senator Kerry elected to take the taxpayer-funded grant in the \ngeneral election. President Bush also opted out of the system for the \nRepublican primaries in 2000 but took the general election grant.\n  It is unfortunate that the matching funds system for the primaries is \nbecoming less viable. The system protects the integrity of the \nelectoral process by allowing candidates to run viable campaigns \nwithout becoming overly dependent on private donors. The system has \nworked well in the past, and it is worth repairing so that it can work \nin the future. If we don't repair it, the pressures on candidates to \nopt out because their opponents are opting out will increase until the \nsystem collapses from disuse.\n  This bill makes changes to both the primary and general election \npublic financing system to address the weaknesses and problems that \nhave been identified by both participants in the system and experts on \nthe presidential election financing process. First and most important, \nit eliminates the State-by-State spending limits in the current law and \nsubstantially increases the overall spending limit from the current \nlimit of approximately $45 million to $150 million, of which up to $100 \nmillion can be spent before April 1 of the election year. This should \nmake the system much more viable for serious candidates facing \nopponents who are capable of raising significant sums outside the \nsystem. The bill also makes available substantially more public money \nfor participating candidates by increasing the match of small \ncontributions from 1:1 to 4:1.\n  One very important provision of this bill ties the primary and \ngeneral election systems together and requires candidates to make a \nsingle decision on whether to participate. Candidates who opt out of \nthe primary system and decide to rely solely on private money cannot \nreturn to the system for the general election. And candidates must \ncommit to participate in the system in the general election if they \nwant to receive Federal matching funds in the primaries. The bill also \nincreases the spending limits for participating candidates in the \nprimaries who face a nonparticipating opponent if that opponent raises \nmore than 20 percent more than the spending limit. This provides some \nprotection against being far outspent by a nonparticipating opponent. \nAdditional grants of public\n\n[[Page S8275]]\n\nmoney are also available to participating candidates who face a \nnonparticipating candidate spending substantially more than the \nspending limit.\n  The bill also sets the general election spending limit at $100 \nmillion, indexed for inflation. And if a general election candidate \ndoes not participate in the system and spends more than 20 percent more \nthan the combined primary and general election spending limits, a \nparticipating candidate will receive a grant equal to twice the general \nelection spending limit.\n  This bill also addresses what some have called the ``gap'' between \nthe primary and general election seasons. Presumptive Presidential \nnominees have emerged earlier in the election year over the life of the \npublic financing system. This had led to some nominees being \nessentially out of money between the time that they nail down the \nnomination and the convention where they are formally nominated and \nbecome eligible for the general election grant. For a few cycles, soft \nmoney raised by the parties filled in that gap, but the Bipartisan \nCampaign Reform Act of 2002 fortunately has now closed that loophole. \nThis bill allows candidates who are still in the primary race as of \nApril 1 to spend an additional $50 million. In addition, the bill \nallows the political parties to spend up to $25 million between April 1 \nand the date that a candidate is nominated and an additional $25 \nmillion after the nomination. The total amount of $50 million is over \nthree times the amount allowed under current law. This should allow any \ngap to be more than adequately filled.\n  Obviously, these changes make this a more generous system. So the \nbill also makes the requirement for qualifying more difficult. To be \neligible for matching funds, a candidate must raise $25,000 in \nmatchable contributions--up to $200 for each donor--in at least 20 \nStates. That is five times the threshold under current law.\n  The bill also makes a number of changes in the system to reflect the \nchanges in our Presidential races over the past several decades. For \none thing, it makes matching funds available starting on July 1 of the \nyear preceding the election, 6 months earlier than is currently the \ncase. For another, it sets a single date for release of the public \ngrant for the general election--the Friday before Labor Day. This \naddresses an inequity in the current system, under which the general \nelection grant is released after each nominating convention, which can \nbe several weeks apart.\n  The bill will also end the political parties' use of soft money for \ntheir conventions and requires presidential candidates to disclose \nbundled contributions. Additional provisions, and those I have \ndiscussed in summary form here, are explained in a section-by-section \nanalysis of the bill that I will ask to be printed in the Record, \nfollowing my statement. I will also ask that a copy of the bill itself \nbe printed in the Record, following my statement.\n  Mr. President, the purpose of this bill is to improve the campaign \nfinance system, not to advance one party's interests. In fact, with the \ncountry looking forward to the first Presidential election since 1952 \nwhere both the incumbent President and the sitting Vice-President are \nnot running, this is a perfect time to make changes in the Presidential \npublic funding system. Each party will have numerous candidates in the \nprimaries, and no party can claim it will be helped or hurt by these \nchanges.\n  Fixing the Presidential public financing system will cost money, but \nour best calculations at the present time indicate that the changes to \nthe system in this bill can be paid for by raising the income tax \ncheck-off on an individual return from $3 to just $10. The total cost \nof the changes to the system, based on data from the 2004 elections, is \nprojected to be around $360 million over the 4-year election cycle. To \noffset that increased cost, this bill caps taxpayer subsidies for \npromotion of agricultural products, including some brand-name goods, by \nlimiting the Market Access Program to $100 million per year.\n  Though the numbers are large, this is actually a very small \ninvestment to make to protect the health of our democracy and integrity \nof our Presidential elections. The American people do not want to see a \nreturn to the pre-Watergate days of unlimited spending on presidential \nelections and candidates entirely beholden to private donors. We must \nact now to preserve the crown jewel of the Watergate reforms and ensure \nthe fairness of our elections and the confidence of our citizens in the \nprocess.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional materials be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3740\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Under \n     the new matching system, individual contributions of up to \n     $200 from each individual will be matched at a 4-to-1 ratio, \n     so $200 in individual contribution can be matched with $800 \n     from public funds.\n       Candidates who remain in the primary race can also receive \n     an additional 1-to-1 match of up to $200 of contributions \n     received after\n\n[[Page S8279]]\n\n     March 31 of a presidential election year. This additional \n     match applies both to an initial contribution made after \n     March 31 and to contributions from individuals who already \n     gave $200 or more prior to April 1.\n       The bill defines ``contribution'' as ``a gift of money made \n     by a written instrument which identifies the person making \n     the contribution by full name and mailing address.''\n       (b) Eligibility for matching funds: Current law requires \n     candidates to raise $5,000 in matchable contributions \n     (currently $250 or less) in 20 states. To be eligible for \n     matching funds under this bill, a candidate must raise \n     $25,000 of matchable contributions (up to $200 per individual \n     donor) in at least 20 states.\n       In addition, to receive matching funds in the primary, \n     candidates must pledge to apply for public money in the \n     general election if nominated and to not exceed the general \n     election spending limits.\n       (c) Timing of payments: Current law makes matching funds \n     available on January 1 of a presidential election year. The \n     bill makes such funds available beginning on July 1 of the \n     previous year.\n\n\n    Section 3: Requiring Participation in Primary Payment System as \n        Condition of Eligibility for General Elections Payments\n\n       Currently, candidates can participate in either the primary \n     or the general election public financing system, or both. \n     Under the bill, a candidate must participate in the primary \n     matching system in order to be eligible to receive public \n     funds in the general election.\n\n\n               Section 4: Revisions to Expenditure Limits\n\n       (a) Spending limits for candidates: In 2004, under current \n     law, candidates participating in the public funding system \n     had to abide by a primary election spending limit of about \n     $45 million and a general election spending limit of about \n     $75 million (all of which was public money). The bill sets a \n     total primary spending ceiling for participating candidates \n     in 2008 of $150 million, of which only $100 million can be \n     spent before April 1. State by state spending limits are \n     eliminated. The general election limit, which the major party \n     candidates will receive in public funds, will be $100 \n     million.\n       (b) Spending limit for parties: Current law provides a \n     single coordinated spending limit for national party \n     committees based on population. In 2004 that limit was about \n     $15 million. The bill provides two limits of $25 million. The \n     first applies after April 1 until a candidate is nominated. \n     The second limit kicks in after the nomination. Any part of \n     the limit not spent before the nomination can be spent after. \n     In addition, the party coordinated spending limit is \n     eliminated entirely until the general election public funds \n     are released if there is an active candidate from the \n     opposing party who has exceeded the primary spending limits \n     by more than 20%.\n       This will allow the party to support the presumptive \n     nominee during the so-called ``gap'' between the end of the \n     primaries and the conventions. The entire cost of a \n     coordinated party communication is subject to the limit if \n     any portion of that communication has to do with the \n     presidential election.\n       (c) Inflation adjustment: Party and candidate spending \n     limits will be indexed for inflation, with 2008 as the base \n     year.\n       (d) Fundraising expenses: Under the bill, all the costs of \n     fundraising by candidates are subject to their spending \n     limits.\n\n\n Section 5: Additional Payments and Increased Expenditures Limits for \n     Candidates Participating in Public Financing Who Face Certain \n                       Nonparticipating Opponents\n\n       (a) Primary candidates: When a participating candidate is \n     opposed in a primary by a nonparticipating candidate who \n     spends more than 120 percent of the primary spending limit \n     ($100 million prior to April 1 and $150 million after April \n     1), the participating candidate will receive a 5-to-1 match, \n     instead of a 4-to-1 match for contributions of less than $200 \n     per donor. That additional match applies to all contributions \n     received by the participating candidate both before and after \n     the nonparticipating candidate crosses the 120 percent \n     threshold. In addition, the participating candidate's primary \n     spending limit is raised by $50 million when a \n     nonparticipating candidate raise spends more than the 120 \n     percent of either the $100 million (before April 1) or $150 \n     million (after April 1) limit. The limit is raised by another \n     $50 million if the nonparticipating candidate spends more \n     than 120 percent of the increased limit. Thus, the maximum \n     spending limit in the primary would be $250 million if an \n     opposing candidate has spent more than $240 million.\n       (b) General election candidates: When a participating \n     candidate is opposed in a general election by a \n     nonparticipating candidate who spends more than 120 percent \n     of the combined primary and general election spending limits, \n     the participating candidate shall receive an additional \n     grant of public money equal to the amount provided for \n     that election--$100 million in 2008. Minor party \n     candidates are also eligible for an additional grant equal \n     to the amount they otherwise receive (which is based on \n     the performance of that party in the previous presidential \n     election).\n       (c) Reporting and Certification: In order to provide for \n     timely determination of a participating candidate's \n     eligibility for increased spending limits, matching funds, \n     and/or general election grants, non-participating candidates \n     must notify the FEC within 24 hours after receiving \n     contributions or making expenditures of greater than the \n     applicable 120 percent threshold. Within 24 hours of \n     receiving such a notice, the FEC will inform candidates \n     participating in the system of their increased expenditure \n     limits and will certify to the Secretary of the Treasury that \n     participating candidates are eligible to receive additional \n     payments.\n\n\n Section 6: Establishment of Uniform Date for Release of Payments from \n      Presidential Elections Campaign Funds to Eligible Candidates\n\n       Under current law, candidates participating in the system \n     for the general election receive their grants of public money \n     immediately after receiving the nomination of their party, \n     meaning that the two major parties receive their grants on \n     different dates. Under the bill, all candidates eligible to \n     receive public money in the general election would receive \n     that money on the Friday before Labor Day, unless a \n     candidate's formal nomination occurs later.\n\n\n     Section 7: Revisions to Designation of Income Tax Payments by \n                          Individual Taxpayers\n\n       The tax check-off is increased from $3 (individual) and $6 \n     (couple) to $10 and $20. This amount will be adjusted during \n     each tax year after 2006. The amount will be adjusted for \n     inflation, and rounded to the nearest dollar, beginning in \n     2007.\n       The IRS shall require by regulation that electronic tax \n     preparation software does not automatically accept or decline \n     the tax checkoff. The FEC is required to inform and educate \n     the public about the purpose of the Presidential Election \n     Campaign Fund (``PECF'') and how to make a contribution. \n     Funding for this program of up to $10 million in a four year \n     presidential election cycle, will come from the PECF.\n\n\n       Section 8: Amounts in Presidential Election Campaign Fund\n\n       Under current law, in January of an election year if the \n     Treasury Department determines that there are insufficient \n     funds in the PECF to make the required payments to \n     participating primary candidates, the party conventions, and \n     the general election candidates, it must reduce the payments \n     available to participating primary candidates and it cannot \n     make up the shortfall from any other source until those funds \n     come in. Under the bill, in making that determination the \n     Department can include an estimate of the amount that will be \n     received by the PECF during that election year, but the \n     estimate cannot exceed the past three years' average \n     contribution to the fund. This will allow primary candidates \n     to receive their full payments as long as a reasonable \n     estimate of the funds that will come into the PECF that year \n     will cover the general election candidate payments. The bill \n     allows the Secretary of the Treasury to borrow the funds \n     necessary to carry out the purposes of the fund during the \n     first campaign cycle in which the bill is in effect.\n\n\nSection 9: Repeal of Priority in Use of Funds for Political Conventions\n\n       Current law gives the political parties priority on \n     receiving the funds they are entitled to from the PECF. This \n     means that parties get money for their conventions even if \n     adequate funds are not available for participating \n     candidates. This section would make funds available for the \n     conventions only if all participating candidates have \n     received the funds to which they are entitled.\n\n\n             Section 10: Regulation of Convention Financing\n\n       (a) Soft money ban: National political parties and federal \n     candidates and officeholders are prohibited from raising or \n     spending soft money in connection with a nominating \n     convention of any political party, including funds for a host \n     committee, civic committee, or municipality.\n       (b) Agreement not to spend soft money: To receive public \n     money for its nominating convention, a political party must \n     agree not to spend soft money on that convention and that it \n     will not accept any goods or services donated by any person \n     in connection with the convention.\n       These soft money prohibitions do not apply to payments by \n     Federal, state or local governments from general tax revenues \n     or payments from any person for the purpose of promoting a \n     particular city as the site for a future convention or to \n     welcome or provide shopping or entertainment guides to \n     convention attendees.\n\n\n            Section 11: Disclosure of Bundled Contributions\n\n       (a) Disclosure requirement: The authorized committees of \n     presidential candidate committee must report the name, \n     address, and occupation of each person making a bundled \n     contribution and the aggregate amount of bundled \n     contributions made by that person.\n       (b) Definition of bundled contribution. A bundled \n     contribution is a series of contributions totaling $10,000 or \n     more that are (1) collected by one person and transferred to \n     the candidate; or (2) delivered directly to the candidate \n     from the donor but include a written or oral communication \n     that the funds were ``solicited, arranged, or directed'' by \n     someone other than the donor. This covers the two most common \n     bundling arrangements where fundraisers get ``credit'' for \n     collecting contributions for a candidate.\n\n\n                       Section 12: Effective Date\n\n       Provides that the amendments will apply to presidential \n     elections occurring after January 1, 2006.\n\n[[Page S8280]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself and Mr. Allen):\n  S. 3743. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to improve \nnewborn screening activities, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nSHINE Act of 2006 with my colleague Senator George Allen. This \nlegislation is critical for the health of newborns and children.\n  Each year in our Nation at least 4 million newborns are screened and \nsevere disorders are detected in 5,000 of them. Although these numbers \nmay seem small, these disorders are often life threatening and can \ncause mental and physical disabilities if left untreated. Early \ndetection by newborn screening can lessen side effects or completely \nprevent progression of many of these disorders if medical intervention \nis started early enough.\n  I am proud to say that New York has been a leader in newborn \nscreening since 1960 when Dr. Robert Guthrie developed the first \nnewborn screening test. Since then, more than 10 million babies have \nbeen tested. In 2004, New York expanded their newborn screening panel \nfrom 11 to 44 conditions. These improvements were a concerted effort by \nState officials and parent advocacy groups like the Newborn Screening \nSaves Lives and Hunter's Hope Foundation. They share a common goal that \nevery child born with a treatable disease should receive early \ndiagnosis and lifesaving treatment so that they can grow up happy and \nhealthy. Today, we want to ensure that the great strides made by New \nYork can be a model for all States and that New York can continue to \nmake advancements that will benefit the children of New York and around \nthe Nation.\n  Newborn screening experts suggest States should test for a minimum of \n29 treatable core conditions. However, as of today, some States only \nscreen for seven conditions. Every child should have access to tests \nthat may prevent them from a life-threatening disease. Parents should \nnot have to drive across State lines to improve the health of their \nbaby. This bill establishes grant programs so that States can increase \ntheir capacity to screen for all the core conditions. Grant funds are \nalso available for States like New York to expand newborn screening \npanels above and beyond the core conditions by developing additional \nnewborn screening tests.\n  We should expect equity within newborn screening so that it does not \nmatter where your baby is born. This legislation will establish \nrecommended guidelines for States for newborn screening tests, \nreporting, and data standards. Our goal should be that affected babies \nbe identified quickly, babies who have the diseases should not be \nmissed, and the number of newborns falsely identified as sick should be \nminimized. By tracking the prevalence of diseases identified by newborn \nscreening within States, we will be able to meet these goals and \nimprove the long-term health of our children.\n  I hear from many parents how scary it is to have a sick child and to \nnot have a diagnosis. Many parents spend years trying to find out what \nis wrong with their child and feel helpless. This legislation will make \nsure that current information on newborn screening is available and \naccessible to health providers and parents. The SHINE Act will provide \ninteractive formats so that parents and providers can ask questions and \nreceive answers about the newborn screening test, diagnosis, follow-up \nand treatment.\n  Early treatment can prevent negative and irreversible health outcomes \nfor affected newborns. We should be doing all we can to give every \nchild born in our country the opportunity for a happy and healthy life.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following letters in support of this \nlegislation from the March of Dimes, Hunter's Hope Foundation, Save \nBabies Through Screening Foundation, and Blythedale Children's Hospital \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Save Babies Though Screening\n\n\n                                             Foundation, Inc.,\n\n                                     Scarsdale, NY, July 24, 2006.\n     Hon. Hillary Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: I am writing on behalf of the Save \n     Babies Through Screening Foundation to show our support for \n     the Screening for Health of Infants and NEwborns (SHINE Act). \n     As you know, our organization's mission is to improve the \n     lives of babies by working to prevent disabilities and early \n     death resulting from disorders detectable through newborn \n     screening. Our organization was founded in 1998 and is the \n     only organization solely dedicated to raising awareness in \n     regard to newborn screening.\n       We believe that this bill will greatly enhance the \n     expansion of newborn screening throughout the United States \n     and will save the lives of thousands of babies--our tiniest \n     citizens. Additionally, this will spare Parents the agonizing \n     pain of watching their children suffer as I can attest to \n     first-hand. With the great expansion of newborn screening, \n     children will be able to live healthy and productive lives.\n       We thank you for your vision and hard work. Nobody should \n     suffer the loss or impairment of a child when there are tests \n     and treatment available and this bill will put an end to \n     future suffering. Please feel free to contact me if we can be \n     of any assistance.\n           Regards,\n                                                  Jill Levy-Fisch,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                Hunter's Hope,\n\n                                  Orchard Park, NY, July 21, 2006.\n     Hon. Hillary Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: On behalf of the Hunter's Hope \n     Foundation, I respectively submit this letter as our full and \n     complete support for the bill titled ``Screening for Health \n     of Infants and NEwborns (SHINE Act)''.\n       The Hunter's Hope Foundation was established in 1997 by Pro \n     Football Hall of Fame member and former Buffalo Bills \n     Quarterback, Jim Kelly, and his wife, Jill, after their \n     infant son, Hunter, was diagnosed with Krabbe (Crab a) \n     Leukodystrophy, an inherited, fatal, nervous system disease.\n       The Foundation's mission is to: Increase public awareness \n     of Krabbe disease and other leukodystrophies, support those \n     afflicted and their families, identify new treatments, and \n     ultimately find a cure.\n       Since 1997, Cord Blood Transplant (CBT) has become a viable \n     treatment for Krabbe disease as well as a few other \n     leukodystrophies. But, CBT is only effective if the child is \n     treated before the disease inflicts irreversible damage to \n     the brain and nervous system. There are many other treatable \n     diseases that if not treated early will cause irreversible \n     damage. And, the number of such diseases continues to \n     increase with advancements in science and technology. We must \n     establish an infrastructure in our country that not only \n     addresses the immediate need, but also creates a system for \n     expansion. The SHINE Act will accomplish this.\n       Hunter passed away August 5, 2005. Like thousands of other \n     children, if he had been screened at birth, he may be living \n     a healthy life today. Please help these children and their \n     families and pass this bill. We implore you to expedite the \n     passing and implementing of this bill. With each day that \n     passes, children are suffering and dying needlessly.\n       Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Jacque Waggoner,\n     Board of Directors, Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Blythedale Children's Hospital,\n\n                                      Valhalla, NY, July 25, 2006.\n      Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: We are pleased to write this letter \n     of support for the Screening for Health of Infants and \n     Newborns Act of 2006. We commend you for your leadership in \n     calling for a uniform and comprehensive national approach to \n     screening newborns for the full panel of core conditions \n     recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and \n     endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics. If diagnosed \n     early, these disorders, including metabolic and hearing \n     deficiency, can be managed or treated to prevent severe \n     consequences.\n       As a hospital which provides a wide array of services to \n     children with special health care needs, we know how \n     important early detection and treatment of conditions can be. \n     We were particularly pleased to see the provisions of this \n     legislation which provide for a Central Clearinghouse of \n     current educational and family support information, critical \n     to assuring a national standard of care.\n       According to the latest March of Dimes Newborn Screening \n     Report Card, nearly two-thirds of all babies born in the \n     United States this year will be screened for more than 20 \n     life-threatening disorders. However, disparities in state \n     newborn screening programs mean some babies will die or \n     develop brain damage or other severe complications from these \n     disorders because they are not identified in time for \n     effective treatment.\n       At present, the United States lacks consistent national \n     guidelines for newborn screening, and each state decides how \n     many and which screening tests are required for every baby. \n     As a result, only 9 percent of all\n\n[[Page S8281]]\n\n     babies are screened for all of the 29 recommended conditions. \n     Clearly it is a wise investment to take full advantage of the \n     information available to detect treatable conditions in \n     children.\n       We commend you for your leadership on this most important \n     issue and look forward to working with you and your \n     colleagues to secure passage of this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Larry Levine,\n       President.\n     Judith Wiener Goodhue,\n       Vice Chair, Board of Trustees, Chair, Government Relations \n     Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               March of Dimes,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 2006.\n     Hon. Hillary Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: On behalf of more than 3 million \n     volunteers and 1,400 staff members of the March of Dimes, I \n     am writing to thank you for introducing the ``Screening for \n     Health of Infants and Newborns (SHINE) Act.'' If enacted, \n     this legislation would authorize grant programs to assist \n     states in expanding the number of conditions screened for at \n     birth and improve the dissemination of educational resources \n     to the public and healthcare providers.\n       As you know, disparities among states in health screening \n     at birth mean too many babies with serious birth defects are \n     not being diagnosed and treated in time to avoid long term \n     disability or even death. The March of Dimes has endorsed the \n     recommendation of the American College of Medical Genetics \n     that calls for every baby born in the United States to be \n     screened for twenty-nine disorders, including certain \n     metabolic conditions and hearing deficiency. The July 2006 \n     March of Dimes newborn screening report card made clear the \n     need for additional state efforts to expand programs to \n     screen for the full range of the twenty-nine disorders. \n     Specifically, only 9 percent of the babies born in the United \n     States were tested for all of the recommended conditions. The \n     ``SHINE Act'' will enhance state's capacity to expand the \n     number of screens and provide important newborn screening \n     educational materials to families via the internet.\n       We at the March of Dimes are sincerely grateful for your \n     efforts related to newborn screening and look forward to \n     working with you, and others in Congress with an interest in \n     newborn screening.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Marina L. Weiss,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n                               Public Policy & Government Affairs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Coleman):\n  S. 3744. A bill to establish the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad \nProgram; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am a lucky politician, a fortunate soul. \nI am lucky that early in my political life, I met two men who had a \ndramatic impact on me and on my decision to seek public office and to \nbe involved in public service. The first was a Senator from Illinois \nnamed Paul Douglas who served from 1948 to 1966 and decided in the year \n1966 to hire a college intern named Durbin from East St. Louis, IL, who \nwas going to school at Georgetown University. That was the first time I \never walked into a Senate office building, and I tell you, I was swept \naway by the experience. I knew at that time that I wanted to be a part \nof the excitement of this life on Capitol Hill and government, and I \ndidn't know how I would ever have a chance to do it. I never dreamed I \nwould run for office. But Paul Douglas, my first mentor in public \nservice and political office, was there at the right moment in my life \nto inspire me to pursue at least some aspect of public service.\n  He introduced me to a fellow named Paul Simon who later served as the \nU.S. Senator from Illinois. Paul was elected in 1984 and served until \n1996. During that 12-year period of time, I was a Member of the House \nof Representatives. For many years before, Paul Simon had been my \nclosest friend and mentor in politics. He gave me my first job out of \nlaw school, when my wife Loretta and I packed everything we owned in a \nvery small truck. She took the baby on a plane to fly to Springfield, \nIL, and I drove the truck out with our dog sitting in the front seat of \nmy U-Haul truck with me and took my first job working for then \nLieutenant Governor Paul Simon.\n  I was lucky. I learned the craft of politics from Paul Simon. I saw \nin his public service, in his public life, how good this job can be and \nhow important it can be if you realize you need to be driven by some \nbasic principles. Paul Simon used to say--and I have heard the speech \nso many times; I have even given it--that politics is about two things. \nFirst, people expect you to be honest, and I think he meant beyond \ndollar honesty--issue honesty; people expect you to tell them what you \nreally believe rather than try to hide what your beliefs might be in \nsome political double-talk.\n  The second thing Paul Simon says is that politics is about helping \nthe helpless. He believed there is some mission to this. He was a son \nof a Lutheran minister and a proud Christian but reached across to \nother denominations of religions for his own inspiration. He believed \nthat helping the helpless was an important part of government \nresponsibility.\n  Mr. President, today I am going to introduce legislation with Senator \nNorm Coleman of Minnesota. It is legislation that reflects the vision \nof Senator Paul Simon.\n  After the terrible attack of September 11, 2001, Paul Simon, typical \nof his outlook on the world, decided that he could imagine a more \npeaceful world, even in that time of great upheaval. He talked about \npromoting peace and security through understanding and global \nawareness. Specifically, he began to lay out a path to a United States \nthat would be populated by Americans who have been abroad and have a \npersonal connection to another part of the world. His vision was to \nhelp prepare a generation with greater cultural competence and real \nlife experience in societies unlike our own.\n  In the months before his untimely death, Senator Paul Simon came back \nto Washington to talk to me and his former colleagues in the Senate \nabout the need to strengthen this country's international \nunderstanding. As a direct result of his work, Congress established the \nAbraham Lincoln Study Abroad Commission to develop the framework for an \ninternational study abroad program for America's college students. I \nwas honored to serve on this bipartisan Lincoln Commission.\n  Late last year, the Commission published its report recommending the \nCongress establish a study abroad program for undergraduate students \nthat would help build this global awareness and international \nunderstanding. It is a privilege for me to introduce legislation based \non the recommendations of this Commission.\n  Paul Simon, like so many committed to strengthening our ability to \nlead by investing in the education of young people, struggled with the \nquestion of how America could lead while so few of our citizens have an \nappropriate knowledge and understanding of the world outside of our \nborders. The United States is a military and economic superpower, yet \nit is continuously threatened by a serious lack of international \ncompetence in an age of growing globalization. When you travel \noverseas, you cannot help but be struck by the fact that people in \nother countries know so much more about us than we know about them.\n  Our lack of world awareness is now seen as a national liability. The \nchallenges we face as Americans are increasingly global in nature, and \nour youth must be well prepared for its future. Our national security, \ninternational economic competitiveness, and diplomatic efforts in \nworking toward a peaceful society rest on our global competence and \nability to appreciate language and culture throughout the world.\n  Today I joined a number of our colleagues who walked across the \nRotunda over to the House of Representatives for a joint meeting of \nCongress where the Prime Minister of Iraq, Mr. al-Maliki, spoke to us. \nHe spoke in inspiring terms about his goals for Iraq, an Iraq that was \nbased on democratic principles, an Iraq that was based on freedom, an \nIraq that was free of terrorism.\n  The United States has made a major investment in that effort. We are \nnow in the fourth year of a war, a war that has claimed over 2,569 \nAmerican lives, including 102 brave soldiers from my home State of \nIllinois. Over 20,000 of our soldiers have returned with serious \ninjuries--2,000 of those with brain injuries and lives that will be \ncompromised and more challenging because they agreed to stand and serve \nand fight for America and they went to Iraq and paid a heavy price.\n\n  We have spent some $320 billion of American treasure on the war in \nIraq, and we continue to spend, by estimate, $3 billion every single \nweek on Iraq, realizing that the end is not near and\n\n[[Page S8282]]\n\nthere is no end in sight. We hope our troops will start to come home \nsoon, but there is no indication they will.\n  Yet, the best military leaders in America, when they sit face to face \nwith us here in private meetings, tell us the same thing we have heard \nfrom many members of this administration. We will not win in Iraq a \nmilitary victory. The victory ultimately has to be a political victory, \na victory where we convince the Iraqi people that this is a far better \ncourse to follow, to move toward self-governance and democracy, freedom \nand free markets, and to move away from the days of dictatorships and \nthe thinking that led people to a divisive moment in their lives. We \nneed to move away from that.\n  It suggests, even with the strongest military in the world, giving it \ntheir best efforts every single minute of every single day, the \nultimate answer in Iraq and so many other countries is not a military \nanswer. It is an answer that brings together political and economic \nelements that ultimately will spell the success of that nation.\n  The capacity of the United States to lead in the 21st century, not \njust in Iraq but all over the world, demands that we school new \ngenerations of American citizens who understand the cultural and social \nrealities beyond what they have experienced here at home. Senator Simon \nunderstood this. He saw the United States as a large community, part of \nan even larger world family. When he saw signs that read, ``God bless \nAmerica,'' Paul Simon used to say, ``I wish they would read `God bless \nAmerica and the rest of the world.' ''\n  Senator Simon was a great public servant. His service in Congress was \nexemplary. He was a man with an intrinsic sense of justice and passion \nfor the public good. His deep convictions were matched by a genuine \nzeal for the work he did here in Washington and back in Illinois.\n  When he retired from the Senate, there was a little ceremony on the \nfloor of the Senate, the likes of which this Chamber has never seen. \nThe decision was made that since Paul Simon always wore a bow tie, that \non one given day all of the Senators would come to the floor wearing \nbow ties. To Paul's surprise, he walked in here to find so many of his \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle saluting his retirement by \nwearing his trademark bow tie.\n  After he retired from the Senate, Paul Simon carried his vision and \nhis energy for leadership back to Southern Illinois University, \nfounding the Public Policy Institute at that university in Carbondale, \nIL. In that role, he trained future generations to understand the \nvalues he fought for his entire life.\n  The Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program, which Paul Simon \ninspired, is designed to encourage and support the experience of \nstudying overseas in countries whose people, culture, language, \ngovernment, and religion might be very different from ours. The bill I \nam introducing today with Senator Coleman would create a program that \nencourages nontraditional students to spend part of their undergraduate \ncareers in nontraditional study abroad destinations. It is said you \nnever understand a country until you visit it and you never appreciate \nyour home until you leave it. The program we envision provides direct \nfellowships to students but also provides financial incentives to \ncolleges and universities to make internal policy changes that make it \neasier for students to study abroad.\n  We believe it is the institutional change that will allow the U.S. to \nsustain a steady growth in the number of students who experience this \nlearning abroad. As we become a nation whose citizens have studied in \nother countries, we will become more understanding of the rest of the \nworld and they will come to know us better.\n  We learned this with the Peace Corps. As I travel around the world, I \nnever cease to be amazed at the impact which the Peace Corps has had on \ncountries, on small villages, and on people. I can recall visiting \nNepal. I went to Nepal with a former colleague from the home State of \nthe Presiding Officer, Oklahoma, Mike Synar. We went to a tiny little \nvillage way up in the mountains outside of Kathmandu. After we trekked \nup there at high altitudes, out of breath, we came to this little \nvillage and all of the people were there. They had the third eye on \ntheir head. There were garlands of flowers around their necks. They \nwere dressed in the best clothes they had, and offered us food. And as \nwe sat down, they asked us if we knew Paul Jones, from Pittsburgh, PA.\n  Of course, we didn't. But we didn't want to say that right off. We \nsaid, ``Who was he?''\n  ``Well, you must know him. He was our Peace Corps volunteer. He was \nhere for 2 years. He made such a difference in this village. You must \nknow Paul.''\n  I made up the name, but it goes to show you that the efforts and \ninvolvement of Americans overseas not only will help people there but \nwill help those who live through the experience. For so many Peace \nCorps volunteers that I met, it was a transformative moment, to serve \nin that Peace Corps at that moment in their life and to go through that \nexperience.\n  Sending more American students for that overseas experience will not \nonly help those students, it will help others around the world to see \nwho we are. Think of the battle of images going on in the world today \neven as we speak, images of America that are terrible, images that are \ndistorted, that are being shown to people around the world every day. \nAnd they say this is what America looks like when in fact it isn't even \nclose to the truth.\n  We can become a nation where we use our public education system to \nexpand not only the reach of America's message, but the experience of \nAmericans in other countries. I can think of no more appropriate \ntribute to honor Paul Simon, a great statesman himself, than to \nestablish this study abroad program.\n  In the weeks before Senator Simon's death, Senator Simon wrote the \nfollowing:\n\n       A nation cannot drift into greatness. We must dream and we \n     must be willing to make small sacrifices to achieve those \n     dreams. If I want to improve my home, I must sacrifice a \n     little. If we want to improve our Nation and the world, we \n     must be willing to sacrifice a little. This major national \n     initiative . . . can lift our vision and responsiveness to \n     the rest of the world. Those who read these lines need to do \n     more than nod in agreement [Paul Simon wrote.] This is a \n     battle for understanding that you must help wage.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to join Senator Coleman and myself in this \nbipartisan legislation to help keep alive Senator Paul Simon's vision \nfor a culturally aware and a better world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/26/senate-section/article/S8282-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8282-S8283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4695.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States is dangerously dependent on oil;\n       (2) that dependence threatens the national security, \n     weakens the economy, and harms the environment of the United \n     States;\n       (3) the United States currently imports nearly 60 percent \n     of oil needed in the United States, and that percentage is \n     expected to grow to almost 70 percent by 2025 if no actions \n     are taken;\n       (4) approximately 2,500,000 barrels of oil per day are \n     imported from countries in the Persian Gulf region;\n       (5) dependence on foreign oil has led to strategic \n     partnerships with some regimes that do not share the \n     democratic values of the United States;\n       (6) terrorists have identified oil as a strategic \n     vulnerability and have increased attacks against oil \n     infrastructure worldwide;\n       (7) oil imports comprise nearly 30 percent of the \n     dangerously high United States trade deficit;\n       (8) it is technically feasible to achieve oil savings of \n     more than 2,500,000 barrels per day by 2017 and 7,000,000 \n     barrels per day by 2026;\n       (9) those goals can be achieved by establishing a set of \n     flexible policies, including--\n       (A) increasing the gasoline-efficiency of cars, trucks, \n     tires, and oil;\n       (B) providing economic incentives for companies and \n     consumers to purchase fuel-efficient vehicles;\n       (C) encouraging the use of transit and the reduction of \n     truck idling; and\n       (D) increasing production and commercialization of \n     alternative liquid fuels;\n       (10) technology available as of the date of enactment of \n     this Act (including popular hybrid-electric vehicle models, \n     the sales of\n\n[[Page S8294]]\n\n     which in the United States increased 173 percent in the first \n     5 months of 2005 as compared with the same period in 2004) \n     make an oil savings plan eminently achievable;\n       (11) achieving those goals will benefit consumers and \n     businesses through lower fuel bills and reduction in world \n     oil prices;\n       (12) achieving those goals will help protect the economy of \n     the United States from high and volatile oil prices; and\n       (13) it is urgent, essential, and feasible to implement an \n     action plan to achieve oil savings as soon as practicable \n     because any delay in initiating action will--\n       (A) make achieving necessary oil savings more difficult and \n     expensive; and\n       (B) increase the risks to the national security, economy, \n     and environment of the United States.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to accelerate market penetration of electric drive and \n     alternative motor vehicles;\n       (2) to enable the accelerated market penetration of \n     efficient technologies and alternative fuels without adverse \n     impact on air quality while maintaining a policy of fuel \n     neutrality, so as to allow market forces to elect the \n     technologies and fuels that are consumer-friendly, safe, \n     environmentally-sound, and economic;\n       (3) to provide time-limited financial incentives to \n     encourage production and consumer purchase of oil saving \n     technologies and fuels nationwide; and\n       (4) to promote a nationwide diversity of motor vehicle \n     fuels and advanced motor vehicle technology, including \n     advanced lean burn technology, hybrid technology, flexible \n     fuel motor vehicles, alternatively fueled motor vehicles, and \n     other oil saving technologies.\n\n             Subtitle A--Oil Savings Plan and Requirements\n\n     SEC. _11.

Mr. OBAMA (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Biden, Mr. Bingaman, \nMr. Coleman, Mr. Specter, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Harkin) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill S. 3711, to \nenhance the energy independence and security of the United States by \nproviding for exploration, development, and production activities for \nmineral resources in the Gulf of Mexico, and for other purposes; which \nwas ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       On page 18, after line 17, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 6. FUEL ECONOMY REFORM.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Fuel \n     Economy Reform Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) United States dependence on oil imports imposes \n     tremendous burdens on America's economy, foreign policy, and \n     military.\n       (2) According to the Energy Information Administration, 60 \n     percent of the crude oil and petroleum products consumed in \n     the United States between April 2005 and March 2006 \n     (12,400,000 barrels per day) was imported. At a cost of $75 \n     per barrel of oil, Americans remit more than $600,000 per \n     minute to other countries for petroleum, money that could \n     have been spent creating domestic jobs and strengthening our \n     Nation's economy.\n       (3) A significant percentage of these petroleum imports \n     originate in countries controlled by regimes that are \n     unstable or openly hostile to the interests of the United \n     States. Dependence on production from these countries \n     contributes to the volatility of domestic and global markets \n     and the ``risk premium'' paid by American consumers.\n       (4) The Energy Information Administration projects that the \n     total petroleum demand in the United States will increase by \n     23 percent between 2006 and 2026, while domestic crude \n     production is expected to decrease by 11 percent, resulting \n     in an anticipated 28 percent increase in petroleum imports. \n     Absent significant action, our Nation will become more \n     vulnerable to oil price increases, more dependent upon \n     foreign oil, and less able to pursue our national interests.\n       (5) America's ability to broadly transition to alternative \n     fuels, such as cellulosic ethanol and hydrogen, is predicated \n     upon producing more fuel-efficient vehicles. Failure to do so \n     would tax scarce resources and increase long-term costs.\n       (6) Two-thirds of all domestic oil use occurs in the \n     transportation sector, which is 97 percent reliant upon \n     petroleum-based fuels. Passenger vehicles, including light \n     trucks under 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight, represent \n     over 60 percent of the oil used in the transportation sector.\n       (7) Corporate average fuel economy of all cars and trucks \n     improved by 70 percent between 1975 and 1987. Between 1987 \n     and 2006, fuel economy improvements have stagnated and are \n     much worse than the vehicle fuel economy in many developed \n     countries and some developing countries, including China.\n       (8) Significant improvements in engine technology occurred \n     between 1986 and 2006.\n\n[[Page S8309]]\n\n     These advances have been used to make vehicles larger and \n     more powerful, rather than to increase fuel economy. Between \n     1985 and 2005, average vehicle horsepower nearly doubled, \n     average vehicle weight increased by 25 percent, and \n     acceleration times for new vehicles improved by 25 percent. \n     During the same time period, average vehicle fuel economy \n     decreased by 2 percent.\n       (9) According to a 2002 fuel economy report by the National \n     Academies of Science, improvements in gasoline engine \n     technology offer the opportunity to increase fuel economy by \n     50 percent, while maintaining vehicle size and performance \n     and improving safety. The fleet analyzed by the Academies \n     would average 37 miles per gallon. When the report was \n     released in 2002, it noted that these technologies could be \n     available for wide use within 10 to 15 years.\n       (10) The 2002 fuel economy report study clearly states that \n     fuel economy can be increased without negatively impacting \n     the safety of America's cars and trucks. Some new \n     technologies can increase both safety and fuel economy (such \n     as high strength materials, unibody design, lower bumpers). \n     Design changes related to fuel economy also present \n     opportunities to reduce the incompatibility of tall, stiff, \n     heavy vehicles with the majority of vehicles on the road.\n       (11) A 2004 report by David Greene of Oak Ridge National \n     Labs entitled, ``The Effect of Fuel Economy on Automobile \n     Safety: A Reexamination'', demonstrates that fuel economy is \n     not linked with increased fatalities. The report notes that, \n     ``higher mpg is significantly correlated with fewer \n     fatalities''. In other words, a thorough analysis of data \n     from 1966 to 2002 indicates that vehicle manufacturers can \n     simultaneously increase fuel economy and improve vehicle \n     safety.\n       (12) A 2002 study entitled, ``An Analysis of Traffic Deaths \n     by Vehicle Type and Model'', by Marc Ross and Tom Wenzel from \n     the University of Michigan, demonstrates that large vehicles \n     do not have lower fatality rates than smaller vehicles. Ross \n     and Wenzel analyzed Federal accident data between 1995 and \n     1999 and showed that the Honda Civic and Volkswagen Jetta \n     both had lower fatality rates for the driver than the Ford \n     Explorer, the Dodge Ram, or the Toyota 4Runner. Even the \n     largest vehicles, such as the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, \n     had fatality rates that were no better than the Jetta or the \n     Nissan Maxima. In other words, a well-designed compact car \n     can be safer than an sport-utility vehicle or a pickup truck. \n     Design, rather than weight, is the key to vehicle safety.\n       (13) Significant change must occur to strengthen the \n     economic competitiveness of the domestic auto industry. \n     According to a recent study by the University of Michigan, a \n     sustained gasoline price of $2.86 per gallon would lead \n     Detroit's Big 3 automakers' profits to shrink by \n     $7,000,000,000 as they absorb 75 percent of the lost vehicle \n     sales. This would put nearly 300,000 Americans out of work.\n       (14) Opportunities exist to strengthen the domestic vehicle \n     industry while improving fuel economy. A 2004 study performed \n     by the University of Michigan concludes that the provision of \n     $1,500,000,000 in tax incentives over 10 years to enable the \n     retrofit of domestic manufacturing and parts facilities to \n     produce clean cars would lead to a gain of nearly 60,000 \n     domestic jobs and pay for itself through the resulting \n     increase in domestic tax receipts.\n       (c) Definition of Automobile.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 32901(a)(3) of title 49, United \n     States Code, is amended by striking ``rated at--'' and all \n     that follows through the period at the end and inserting \n     ``rated at not more than 10,000 pounds gross vehicle \n     weight.''.\n       (2) Fuel economy information.--Section 32908(a) of title \n     49, United States Code, is amended, by striking ``section--'' \n     and all that follows through ``(2)'' and inserting ``section, \n     the term''.\n       (3) Effective date.--The amendments made by this subsection \n     shall apply to model year 2009 and each subsequent model \n     year.\n       (d) Average Fuel Economy Standards.--\n       (1) Standards.--Section 32902 of title 49, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (A) in subsection (a)--\n       (i) in the header, by inserting ``Manufactured Before Model \n     Year 2012'' after ``Non-Passenger Automobiles''; and\n       (ii) by adding at the end the following: ``This subsection \n     shall not apply to automobiles manufactured after model year \n     2011.'';\n       (B) in subsection (b)--\n       (i) in the header, by inserting ``Manufactured Before Model \n     Year 2012'' after ``Passenger Automobiles'';\n       (ii) by inserting ``and before model year 2009'' after \n     ``1984'';

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 474, S. 3549.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3549) to amend the Defense Production Act of \n     1950, to strengthen Government review and oversight of \n     foreign investment in the United States, to provide for \n     enhanced Congressional oversight with respect thereto, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today the Senate will pass S. 3549, the \nForeign Investment and National Security Act of 2006. While I have \nreservations over the legislation as currently drafted, I have agreed \nto allow the bill to proceed to conference, given the assurances by the \nChairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Senator Shelby, that he will \nwork to address the concerns that I have raised.\n  The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States--known as \nCFIUS--was established 30 years ago to placate concerns in Congress \nover investments by Middle Eastern countries in American assets. Three \ndecades later, it is once again concern over the Middle East that is \ndriving Congress to overhaul the CFIUS process. This time, the outrage \nhas revolved around the proposed acquisition of port terminal \noperations in the U.S. by Dubai Ports World, a corporation owned by the \ngovernment of Dubai, one of the seven emirates that make up the United \nArab Emirates.\n  In the war on terror, the UAE has provided American and Coalition \nmilitary forces unprecedented access to its ports and territory, \noverflight clearances, and other critical and important logistical \nassistance. The UAE has played host to over 700 U.S. Navy ships at its \nports, including the Port of Jebel Ali--which is managed by Dubai Ports \nWorld--and to the Air Force at al Dhafra Air Base. The country also \nhosts the UAE Air Warfare Center, the leading fighter training center \nin the Middle East. The UAE has worked with us to stop terrorist \nfinancing and money laundering. Moreover, Dubai was the first Middle \nEastern entity to join the Container Security Initiative and the \nDepartment of Energy's Megaports Initiative, a program aimed at \nstopping illicit shipments of nuclear and other radioactive material. \nBut all of these details seem to have been lost in the rush to stop a \ncorporate transaction with a key ally in the war on terror.\n  Mr. President, there are at least two details in S. 3549 that cannot \nbe ignored because they will not help protect our homeland. Instead, \nthey will only harm America's economy, the strength of which is \ncritical to our national security.\n  One provision that I believe merits closer scrutiny would require \nCFIUS to notify several congressional committees, as well as individual \nmembers of Congress, of each and every transaction submitted to CFIUS's \nreview. This notification would be required well before CFIUS made any \ndetermination about the national security implications, if any, of the \nproposed transaction.\n  On its face, this provision would appear to be a reasonable effort to \nachieve transparency and accountability in the CFIUS process. However,\n\n[[Page S8318]]\n\nif this provision were enacted, a process that is meant to be a sober \nanalysis of the national security implications of a transaction would \nbecome a politically charged debacle. What other goal would be \naccomplished by providing notice to the members of Congress whose \nStates and districts are impacted by the transaction before any \ndetermination is made by CFIUS? The politicization of the CFIUS review \nprocess would discourage transactions that might be reviewed by CFIUS \nfor fear of financial or reputational harm. This, in turn, could reduce \nforeign direct investment or impose a risk premium on such investment \nthat would be detrimental to U.S. businesses seeking investment \ncapital.\n  A second provision that I believe needs further clarification would \nrequire CFIUS to investigate a proposed transaction whenever the matter \ninvolves ``any possible impairment to national security'' resulting \nfrom the acquisition of critical infrastructure or ``the possibility of \nan impairment to national security'' arising out of any transaction \nreviewed by CFIUS. Under these standards, many transactions that pose \nnegligible or no risk to national security will nonetheless be forced \ninto an extended 45-day investigation in addition to the initial 30-day \nreview period. According to the Department of Treasury, these standards \nwill lead to a significant increase in the number of investigations \nconducted by CFIUS. I strongly support a full and fair review of each \ntransaction submitted to CFIUS, and I believe that a transaction that \nposes a risk to our national security should not be approved, but that \nis not what the mandatory 45-day investigation provisions would \naccomplish. In my view, it would be better to use CFIUS resources to \ninvestigate transactions that raise genuine national security concerns.\n  I appreciate the interest of Senator Shelby and others to modify the \nCFIUS process, and I certainly do not doubt the sincerity of their \ndesire to protect our Nation from threats abroad. That is why I am \nconfident that my concerns with the legislation will be addressed in \nconference. If they are not, then I will be forced to object to the \nconference report.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nat the desk be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time \nand passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nany statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of the conference report to \naccompany S. 250, the Carl D. Perkins vocational education bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the House to the bill (S. \n     250) to amend the Carl D.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference \nreport to accompany S. 250, the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical \nEducation Improvement Act of 2006.\n  This legislation reflects a lengthy bipartisan effort to strengthen \nand improve Federal programs designed to support career and technical \neducation. I am very pleased to have worked with my friend and \ncolleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, from introduction of the \nbill in the Senate through today's consideration of the conference \nreport.\n  This legislation was reported favorably by the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee last Spring by a unanimous \nvote. The following day it passed the Senate on a vote of 99 to 0. I am \nencouraged by the broad support for this legislation and I am pleased \nto be able to recommend passage of this conference report.\n  This legislation is important for three reasons. The first reason is \nthe added emphasis on academic achievement. I commend the President and \nthe Governors for raising the issue of high school reform, and I \nbelieve this legislation is an important part of that process. \nImproving and strengthening the academic focus of the Perkins Act is \npart of a much larger effort to ensure that today's students will be \nready for tomorrow's reality, whether it is in college or the \nworkplace.\n  In 1998, when Congress last reauthorized the Perkins program, \nadditional emphasis on student academic achievement was incorporated \ninto the bill. That emphasis was critical, and the results have been \ndemonstrated in the program. More Perkins students are performing \nbetter on national reading and math assessments than ever before. The \nNational Assessment of Adult Literacy, released earlier this year, \npointed out that career and technical education students perform better \nthan their peers in both reading and math comprehension.\n  Another recent study of Arizona career and technical education \nstudents showed that students in career and technical training courses \nwere more likely to meet State math proficiency levels than students \nnot enrolled in technical training courses. That is good, because \ntoday's jobs are requiring stronger academic preparation than ever \nbefore, especially in math and science.\n  We are also facing a significant problem in terms of today's students \ncompleting high school and earning a secondary education degree. A \nsignificant amount of research, many college instructors, and employers \nagree that far too many high school graduates are not prepared for \ncollege-level classes and many more do not have the skills to advance \nbeyond entry level jobs.\n  Only 68 percent of the students entering the ninth grade 4 years ago \nare expected to graduate this year. For minority students, this number \nhovers around 50 percent. In addition, we continue to experience an \noverall dropout rate of 11 percent per year.\n  The Perkins Act emphasizes high school completion by making academic \ncourses more relevant. According to the National Assessment of \nVocational Education, now 2 years old, career and technical education \nstudents are three times more likely to apply academic skills to job \nrelated tasks than students in academic courses.\n  The Perkins program can help address the ``wasted senior year'' by \nhelping to improve student academic achievement. It does that by \nlinking learning to relevant applications and tasks. Students that are \nexcited about learning will always do better, and a great way to get \nstudents excited about learning is to show them how they will use the \nskills they are learning in real life.\n  For many students, understanding how they will use the skills they \nlearn can mean the difference between completing a high school degree \nand dropping out. For others, it means greater investment in their \nstudies than they might otherwise have. Making learning relevant is one \nof the best ways to ensure students stay interested in their \ncoursework, while also preparing them for college and the workforce.\n  In the bill we are now considering, we have made academic achievement \none of several core indicators of performance for programs receiving \nfunds from this act. As States are elevating their expectations for \nstudents under No Child Left Behind, we anticipate that career and \ntechnical education students will benefit from those same high \nexpectations. We believe that career and technical education programs \nshould be able to take credit for helping students improve their \nacademic achievement in core subject areas, like reading, math, and \nscience.\n  This legislation also emphasizes the connection to postsecondary \neducation. Many of today's high school students are entering college \nbehind the curve before they even start. Almost a third of all college \nstudents are taking some remedial education courses before graduating. \nWe need to make sure that more high school students are receiving the \ninstruction they need before they leave high school in order to be \nsuccessful in college.\n  The impact of the need for remedial academic instruction has dramatic \nconsequences. As many as three in four students requiring remedial \nreading instruction will not complete a postsecondary degree program. \nOver 60 percent of students requiring remedial math education will not \ncomplete a postsecondary degree.\n  The Perkins program is in a unique position to help prevent the need \nfor additional remedial education at the postsecondary level. Because \nthe program provides funds for both secondary and postsecondary \nschools, programs are more coordinated, and students have broader \nexposure to postsecondary education before leaving high school. \nA number of programs enabling students to earn concurrent credits for \nhigh school and college are springing up within the Perkins program, \nhelping students prepare for college and reduce their time to \ngraduation from a postsecondary degree certificate or degree program.\n\n  In Casper, WY, right now, the community college and the school \ndistrict are working on plans to create a hybrid career and technical \neducation center, which will help students earn credit toward a college \ndegree, learn relevant job skills, and meet challenging State academic \nstandards, all through a single sequence of courses. This legislation \nencourages more schools to begin innovative programs like the one being \ndeveloped in Casper.\n  The second reason this legislation is important is because it will \nhelp ensure we are preparing students for tomorrow's workforce. We are \nin the midst of a skills revolution. It is estimated that today's \nstudents leaving high school or college will have 14 different careers \nin their lifetimes. It is also estimated that the top 10 jobs 10 years \nfrom now haven't been invented yet. The question that faces all of us, \nput simply, is ``got skills?''\n  We must equip our workers with the skills the technology-driven \neconomy demands. We need to prepare our students for tomorrow's economy \nin order to remain competitive in the global marketplace. Nations such \nas China and India are rapidly catching up to our institutions in terms \nof quality, and they have a much larger student body from which to \ndraw. The only way we can compete in the changing economy is to \ngraduate students with the highest quality of academic and technical \nskills.\n  Earlier this month on the Senate floor we discussed the need for \nskills training and its impact on wages. I made a speech to the effect \nthat the problem we are facing is one of minimum skills--not minimum \nwages. The effect may be low wages, but the cause is low skills. We \nneed to address those workers who have few, if any, of the skills they \nneed to compete for a better job and command higher wages. We need to \nstart thinking in terms of skills, the kinds of skills that will help \nstudents support themselves and their families in the future.\n  Research shows that high school dropouts have an unemployment rate \ntwo times higher than high school graduates, and three times higher \nthan college graduates. Over time, the earning differential between \nhigh school and college graduates has increased as well. In 1980, \ncollege graduates earned 50 percent more during their lifetime than \nhigh school graduates. Today this differential has increased to 100 \npercent and continues to expand.\n  The programs supported by the Perkins Act help students learn and \ndevelop the skills they need to compete\n\n[[Page S8323]]\n\nin the workforce. In the bill before us, we have emphasized the need to \nprepare students for placement in high skill, high wage, or high demand \noccupations. These are the types of jobs that will ensure a stronger \nfuture for students and will help them become self-sufficient.\n  Eighty percent of the jobs created over the next 10 years will \nrequire some postsecondary education. However, the majority of those \njobs will require less than a 4-year degree. This is a critical issue, \nand we need to start now to meet the needs of the future workforce. I \nbelieve that a stronger, more effective Perkins program is an important \nway to address this issue.\n  By 2010 we face a projected skilled worker shortage of 5.3 million \nworkers. That's 5.3 million American jobs that can't be filled because \nour workers don't have the right skills. That is why career and \ntechnical education funds are so critical to the supply of skilled \nlabor in this country. These are precisely the types of careers for \nwhich the Perkins program is preparing students. Career and technical \nprograms in this country are preparing students with the skills to \nsucceed in health care, information technology, trade, manufacturing, \nand a host of other careers.\n  One of the most critical improvements we have made to the Perkins \nprogram in this bill is to strengthen the connection of career and \ntechnical education programs to the needs of businesses. If we are \ngoing to help fill the growing need for skilled workers, we need to \nensure Perkins programs are coordinating their instruction with current \npractices in industry and the needs of the local workforce.\n  Thousands of examples are available of schools connecting with \nbusinesses to help develop the right curriculum for available high \nskill, high wage jobs. At a roundtable I chaired earlier this year on \nhigh school redesign issues, several of the participants described \nprograms that linked academic programs at the high school or community \ncollege with the needs of the employers in the area. One such example \nwas a program that prepared students to work in a nearby nuclear energy \nplant. The area high school offered classes so students in the area \ncould begin the technical training to get a job at the nuclear \npowerplant, earning more than $40,000 a year to start.\n  That's the type of relevant instruction that we need to encourage and \nthat we are encouraging through this conference report. I expect that \nthe students performing well in their nuclear power management and \nsafety class are also performing well on State math and science \nassessments.\n  The final reason that this legislation is important is because it \nprovides a foundation for the redesign of Federal education policy. We \nneed to structure Federal education policies that provide students and \nadult learners have access to lifelong education opportunities. In this \n21st century economy, learning never ends, and school is never out.\n  The Perkins Act is one part of a ``three-legged stool'' of Federal \neducation and training programs, all of which we will have considered \nduring this Congress. The other two key pieces of this approach are the \nWorkforce Investment Act, and the Higher Education Act. This is the \nfirst of those three bills to make it through conference, but I hope we \nwill quickly follow with the others.\n  If we are going to stay competitive, Federal education programs need \nto help support seamless transitions from education to the workforce, \nthroughout life, from preschool through postsecondary education and \nbeyond. The conference report we are considering takes the first step \nin that direction by emphasizing the connection between academic and \ntechnical education and the workforce and postsecondary education. The \nWorkforce Investment Act and the Higher Education Act will be the next \ncritical steps in ensuring that American students are prepared for \ntoday and tomorrow's careers, many which haven't been invented yet.\n  Today's students are more and more likely to return to school \nthroughout their lives for additional training. Some estimates suggest \nthat as many as 75 percent of today's workers will need additional \ntraining just to stay current with their jobs. The modern college \nstudent reflects this trend perfectly. Today's average college student \nis likely to be older than 24, independent, and more likely to be \nfemale. They are also likely to have transferred institutions at least \nonce in their postsecondary career.\n  That snapshot reflects the reality that today's college students are \nthere for training and technical skills acquisition more than anything \nelse. Postsecondary education is one of the fastest means to \nadvancement in today's economy. With a postsecondary education, workers \nare more likely to keep their jobs and take advantage of opportunities \nto grow and advance in the workforce, or transition to another \noccupation as the workforce changes.\n  Federal policy needs to reflect the 21st century reality: we are in \nthe midst of a jobs revolution. We are going to experience dramatic \nchanges in the workforce over the next 10 to 15 years, and we need to \nstart now if we are going to adapt Federal education and training \npolicy to meet the coming crisis of too few workers with too few \nskills.\n  I am pleased that this legislation is now at the final stage of the \nprocess. We were able to move this bill quickly through committee and \nthe floor because we were able to work in a bipartisan manner to \nreauthorize a program that the members of the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee feel is an important part of the federal \neducation and training system. Although the intervening work took much \nlonger than I would have liked, I am happy to see the conference report \ntaken up in the Senate.\n  I want to thank Senator Kennedy and his staff for their hard work, \nand for the hard work of the Senate conferees. I specifically want to \nthank Carmel Martin, JD Larock, and Jane Oates from Senator Kennedy's \nstaff. Although I understand Jane has moved on to greener pastures, she \nhad a significant role to play in helping the legislation get to this \npoint. I also want to thank Mr. McKeon and Mr. Miller, as well as the \nother House conferees, for helping us get to this point, and their \nstaffs: Whitney Rhoades, Stephanie Milburn, Krisann Pearce, Lisa Ross, \nDenise Forte, Lloyd Horwich and many others. Finally, I want to thank \nmy own staff--Scott Fleming, Beth Buehlmann, Lisa Schunk, Ilyse Schuman \nand Katherine McGuire--for helping me to move this bill all the way \nthrough the legislative process. They have spent many long hours \nseeking agreement on the provisions of the conference report and have \ndone stellar work.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support adoption of the \nconference report.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased that we are acting on this \nbipartisan legislation to reauthorize the Perkins Career and Technical \nEducation Act, and I commend the chairman of our committee, Senator \nEnzi, for his willingness to have an open, bipartisan process for this \nlegislation. His leadership and the impressive work of his staff helped \nguide this bill successfully through the conference, and they deserve \ngreat credit for their leadership.\n  One of our highest priorities in Congress is to expand educational \nopportunities for every American. In this age of globalization, every \ncitizen deserves a chance to acquire the education and skills needed to \nparticipate in the modern economy, to fulfill their hopes and dreams, \nraise healthy families, and contribute to their communities. We will be \na fairer and stronger America when every citizen takes part.\n  In the global economy, the contributions of every American matter. We \nmust equip all our citizens to compete, not by lowering their pay and \nsending their jobs overseas but by increasing their skills. Career and \ntechnical education does that, by preparing students and adults for \n21st century jobs. With this reauthorization, career and technical \nprograms will continue to have a vital role in transforming the lives \nof students and workers, and we will have a stronger economy as a \nresult.\n  Since the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act in 1917, the Federal \nGovernment has recognized the important role of career and technical \neducation in the life of the Nation. As the needs of American business \nand industry have evolved, the revisions made to the Act over the years \nhave reflected those changes. It is clear that vocational education is \nno longer the 1950s\n\n[[Page S8324]]\n\nversion. It has evolved from shop classes into courses that use \ncutting-edge technology and focus on emerging and growing fields that \nwill become the jobs of the future. That is why we now call it career \nand technical education, and I am pleased to see that change reflected \nin the new title of this bill.\n  The Perkins Career and Technical Education Act gives both students \nand adults the academic course work and training they need to be \ncompetitive in the job market. The reauthorization of this legislation \nis especially important, since more and more people are taking \nadvantage of Perkins programs. Between 2002 and 2004, enrollment in \ncareer and technical education programs rose by 26 percent nationally. \nEnrollment in Tech Prep, the Perkins program that supports some of the \nmost creative efforts in the field, rose by more than a third. Nearly \nall high school students will take at least one career or technical \ncourse during their years in school. About half of all high school \nstudents and a third of all college students are involved in vocational \nprograms as a major part of their studies.\n\n  Perkins helps adults as well. In 2004, 6 million adults were enrolled \nin such programs at community, technical, and other colleges, learning \nnew skills and improving opportunities for employment. About 40 million \nadults participate in short-term occupational training.\n  Perkins programs do not just help one type of person. New immigrants, \nstruggling adults, women seeking jobs outside the home for the first \ntime--all benefit from the specially designed programs funded by the \nPerkins Act.\n  These programs help every kind of learner. In 2004, 10 million middle \nand high school students were taking courses that enabled them to \nexplore a career and be prepared to succeed in the workplace. The \nstudents are from many different backgrounds--from rural and urban \nareas, from schools large and small, and they studied fields such as \nagriculture, technology, health occupations, skilled trades and \nbusiness.\n  No matter where they are from, the data are clear. Perkins programs \nare helping them build a better life. According to the most recent \nNational Assessment of Vocational Education by the Department of \nEducation, students earned almost 2 percent more for each high school \noccupational course they took. That is about $450 per course based on \naverage earnings of $24,000. That adds up, especially for the 45 \npercent of all high school graduates who take three or more \noccupational courses.\n  The data also show that participants in career and technical \neducation at the postsecondary level can benefit from just 1 year's \nworth of courses. Even those who did not attain a credential still \nearned between 5 and 8 percent more than high school graduates with \nsimilar characteristics.\n  Today, career and technical education students are better prepared \nfor college. Almost two-thirds of all high school graduates of career \nand technical programs now enter some form of postsecondary education. \nWhen these programs are combined with a college prep curriculum, that \nnumber rises to 82 percent.\n  That is good progress, but we need to do even more. According to a \nstudy released last week by the Department of Education, career and \ntechnical education students are less likely to take advanced math \ncourses like trigonometry, precalculus, and calculus compared to other \nhigh school students. In college, they tend to earn fewer academic \ncredits, and fewer credits overall. And only one-quarter of career and \ntechnical education students graduate with a bachelor's degree--most \nearn associate's degrees or certificates.\n  That is why the improvements we have made in this reauthorization are \nso important.\n  We have maintained our commitment to Tech Prep. Students can enroll \nas early as the ninth grade in high-tech programs that lead to an \nassociate's degree. Tech Prep is a vital bridge that connects high \nschool to college for many students, and I welcome its role in this \nbill.\n  Our focus is on career and technical education programs that lead to \nincreased graduation rates, professional credentials, apprenticeships, \nand college opportunities. To do so, we have a strong accountability \nsystem that measures the progress that programs are making toward these \ngoals.\n  We have doubled our emphasis on making sure that career and technical \neducation programs reach those who too often have been left out, such \nas girls, women, and homemakers seeking jobs for the first time.\n  We have also addressed the needs of career and technical education \nteachers by giving them new opportunities to spend time in the \nindustries they are teaching about. In a world where cell phones and \ncomputers become obsolete in a year, these teachers need the best \npossible training so that they can continue to prepare students for \nsuccess. They are preparing the next generation for the workforce, and \ntheir knowledge-base must be state of the art.\n  This reauthorization is a signal to the millions of Americans who \nbenefit from career and technical education that the Federal Government \nunderstands how important these programs are. Massachusetts alone has \nmore than 100,000 students at the secondary and postsecondary level \nparticipating in Perkins programs. Our Commonwealth's support of \ntechnical training is far-reaching today and is rooted in our \nlongstanding commitment to technical education.\n  At the beginning of the 20th century, Worcester was a national leader \nin the development of trade and vocational education. Worcester Boys \nTrade School, founded in 1910, was among the first vocational schools \nin the Nation, training young men to be machinists, and fulfilling its \nmission of graduating ``well informed citizens and good workmen.'' \nToday, Worcester Vocational High School has a waiting list of 300 \nstudents. In 2005, 93 percent of its students passed the State \nassessment.\n  In August, it will move to a new state-of-the-art facility that will \naccommodate 1,500 day students and 3,000 working adults in afternoon \nand evening classes. Without Perkins funding, much of this would not \nhave been possible.\n  Perkins also supports high school programs that partner with \ncommunity colleges and local businesses to provide students with the \nacademic and technical skills they need to continue their education or \nto compete for high-skill, high-wage jobs immediately. The outcomes of \nthese programs are extraordinary. In Massachusetts, 96 percent of the \nstudents in the class of 2006 in career and technical education \nprograms passed the MCAS and earned their competency determination. \nAlready, 90 percent of the class of 2007 have done so. Over the last 2 \nyears, every one of the seniors at Blackstone Valley Tech in Upton has \npassed the MCAS and graduated on time. Last year, it was recognized as \na Vanguard Model School by the Massachusetts Insight Education and \nResearch Institute for its efforts to improve student achievement. It \nwas the first vocational technical school to receive this honor.\n  Because of Perkins, more than 12,000 career and technical education \nstudents at risk of failing he MCAS were placed in structured \ninternships at over 5,600 employer sites last year. These internships \nuse work-based learning plans to guide students' learning and \nproductivity on the job, and to measure the impact of the internship on \nstudent achievement.\n  Because of Perkins, every community college in Massachusetts has been \nable to hire instructional support staff and provide adaptive equipment \nfor students with disabilities enrolled in technical education \nprograms.\n  Because of Perkins, career and technical educators throughout the \nCommonwealth receive needed professional development and gain access to \ncurriculum-related resources, technical assistance, and training in a \nwide range of activities.\n  Massachusetts's career and technical education programs are \nimpressive, and they are successful because of the Perkins Act. We are \nproud of the vitality of our career and technical education programs in \nMassachusetts, and we know they are just a small number of the many \nstrong programs supported by the Perkins Act across the country.\n  I am pleased that we were able to work together with the House to \nproduce this bipartisan legislation. I commend Chairman Enzi, Chairman\n\n[[Page S8325]]\n\nMcKeon, and all the conferees and their staff for their good work on \nthis needed legislation.\n  Special thanks go to Scott Fleming, Beth Buehlmann, Lisa Schunk, and \nKelly Hastings with Senator Enzi; Allison Dembeck with Senator Gregg; \nMeredith Davis with Senator Frist; David Cleary with Senator Alexander; \nCelia Sims with Senator Burr; Glee Smith with Senator Isakson; Lindsay \nMorris with Senator DeWine; Lindsay Hunsicker with Senator Ensign; \nJuliann Andreen with Senator Hatch; Liz Stillwell with Senator \nSessions; Jennifer Swenson with Senator Roberts; Mary Ellen McGuire \nwith Senator Dodd; Rob Barron with Senator Harkin; Dvora Lovinger and \nRobin Juliano with Senator Mikulski; Sherry Kaiman with Senator \nJeffords; Michael Yudin with Senator Bingaman; Jamie Fasteau and Jill \nFeldstein with Senator Murray; Mildred Otero with Senator Clinton; \nKristen Romero and Amy Gaynor from Legislative Counsel, Denise Forte, \nLloyd Horwich, and Whitney Rhoades on the House Education Committee, \nand Carmel Martin, J.D. LaRock, and Liz Maher of my staff.\n  I especially recognize Jane Oates, who worked on my staff for 8 years \nand whose expertise, leadership, and persistence ensured that the \ncommittee produced a strong, bipartisan reauthorization. Jane's efforts \non Perkins are indicative of how she handles all things in life: always \ngiving 100 percent, always being a voice for the voiceless, always \ncommitted to finding a solution. Though Jane has not been directly \ninvolved in these last few months of the process, her good work in the \nearly stages of this bill has guided my staff and the rest of the \ncommittee through conference and to final passage today. Thank you, \nJane, for all you have done for the millions of students who benefit \nfrom Perkins every year for showing all of us in the Senate how to get \nthe job done.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am here today to support the \nreauthorization of an education bill designed to ensure the \ncompetitiveness of our country's workforce, the Carl D. Perkins Career \nand Technical Education Act, Perkins. Essential to strengthening the \nworkforce, Perkins not only prepares youth and adults for the careers \nof today, it prepares them for the careers of tomorrow. It is the first \nline of defense in ensuring America's competitive advantage worldwide.\n  We have heard a lot lately about American students losing their \ncompetitive edge. In math and science Americans score near the bottom \nof all industrialized nations on international exams. Our college drop-\nout rate is one of the highest in the world. We have dropped from first \nto fifth in the percentage of young adults with a college degree. \nSingapore has displaced the United States as the leading economy in \ninformation technology competitiveness. And the number of patents \nawarded to Americans is declining. All of this is having a detrimental \neffect on our global competitiveness.\n  Clearly, we need to increase our competitiveness from within. The \nconference agreement before us will help us to do that.\n  This reauthorization does a number of important things. First and \nforemost, it emphasizes accountability and improved results. Second, it \nimproves monitoring and enforcement. Third, it disaggregates \nperformance goals and report information by special populations so no \none will fall through the cracks. And fourth, it strengthens the ties \nbetween industry, high schools, and higher education by ensuring that \nteachers are well-trained, students are academically ready for college, \nand high schools are training students for the actual needs of their \ncommunities.\n  The premise of this legislation is that high schools, industry, and \nhigher education institutions need to work together to provide our \nworkforce with the skills they need in order to achieve and compete in \nthe 21st century. This bill works to ensure that American students are \nnot just getting a world class education, but the best education in the \nworld.\n  I would be remiss in my remarks if I did not mention the President's \nproposed elimination of the Perkins program in his annual budget for \nthe second year in a row. I hope that the administration understands \nthat our decision to move this legislation forward reflects our \nunwavering commitment to career and technical education. We will not \nlet this program fall by the wayside. Perkins will not be eliminated.\n  We often hear the pledge that we will leave no child behind. May I \nsuggest that we also make every effort to ensure that we leave no \ncareer and technical education student behind? Passage of these \nimportant provisions today will go a long way toward ensuring that \ncareer and vocational education students are not left behind in the \nclassroom, that they are being held to high academic standards, that \ntheir teachers are provided with the training they need to keep up to \ndate with the latest industry needs, and that high schools, industry \nand higher education work seamlessly together to provide our workforce \nwith the skills that they need to maintain America's economic dominance \nin the 21st century.\n  Career and technical programs are an essential part of keeping \nstudents in school and helping our nation train its workforce. And \nwhile I would not consider the conference agreement before us perfect, \nI am confident that it will go a long way in helping another generation \nof Americans succeed, and in doing so, strengthen the American economy \nand increase our competitiveness worldwide.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Carl D. Perkins \nCareer and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2005. To compete in \nthis global economy, we need to make sure our students have 21st \ncentury skills for 21st century jobs. Vocational and technical \neducation is an extremely important part of this effort. The Perkins \nAct, which provides $1.3 billion to help train more than 10 million \nAmericans across the country, is a vital investment in our Nation's \nhigh schools, community colleges, and our students.\n  The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical program gives a boost to \nAmerica's workforce development system by providing funds to schools \nthat teach technical skills ranging from auto shop to computer \nprogramming. The Perkins Act also supports practical career programs \nand links between secondary and postsecondary education, helping \nstudents to move up the opportunity ladder and prepare them for high-\nskill, high-wage jobs. Students who have completed Perkins-supported \nprograms are better prepared not only for higher education but for the \nworkplace.\n  The President has proposed eliminating funding for all vocational and \ntechnical education programs. This is the wrong way to go. If Perkins \nwas eliminated, high schools, technical schools, and community colleges \nin every State would suffer. In Maryland, our schools would lose almost \n$19 million. Last year, we had more than 150,000 students enrolled in \ncareer and technical programs in Maryland. In the United States, 97 \npercent of high school students take at least one career and technical \neducation course. One-third of college students are involved in career \nand technical programs. And almost 40 million adults attend short-term \noccupational training. If these schools had to close their doors or \nshut down their vocational programs, where would these students go to \nlearn the skills they need to get good paying jobs?\n  Vocational and technical education provides students across the \ncountry with opportunities to develop academic and technical skills \nthat are critical for economic and workforce development. It is our job \nin the senate to make sure these opportunities are there for the people \nwho need them and to invest in our human capital to create a world \nclass workforce. That is why I strongly support this bipartisan bill \nand I oppose any cuts to the Perkins Career and Technical Education \nprograms.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the conference \nreport accompanying S. 250, the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical \nEducation Act of 2006. More than ever, this country needs rigorous, \nrelevant career and technical education programs to help students \nprepare for postsecondary education and to address the shortage of \nhighly skilled workers necessary to meet the demands of the \ncontemporary workforce. A skilled and flexible workforce is essential \nto building a strong and dynamic economy and to maintaining our \ncountry's ability to compete in a global economy.\n\n[[Page S8326]]\n\n  According to a recent report issued by the National Academy of \nSciences, the scientific and technical building blocks of this Nation's \neconomic strength are eroding at a time when many other nations are \ngathering strength. As much as 85 percent of this country's per capita \ngrowth in income since World War II has come from science and \ntechnology. The National Academies projected that while the U.S. \neconomy is doing well today, current trends indicate that the U.S. may \nnot fare as well in the future, particularly in the areas of science \nand technology, where innovation is spurred and high-wage jobs follow.\n  We must produce students who are prepared to meet the challenges of \nthe 21st century workforce. I believe this bill provides real \nopportunities to meet those challenges.\n  In order to meet those challenges, however, career and technical \neducation--CTE--must be academically rigorous and enhance students' \ncritical thinking and applied skills. I believe this bill makes a \nnumber of significant improvements to ensure that CTE students \nparticipate in a rigorous and challenging curriculum, and realize \npositive educational and employment outcomes.\n  For example, the bill integrates challenging academic and technical \nstandards, aligned with No Child Left Behind and nationally-recognized \nindustry standards, into CTE instruction. In addition, the bill \nstrengthens educational and career pathways for students beyond high \nschool and makes significant strides in building alliances among high \nschools, 2- and 4-year colleges, business and industry, and community \norganizations. Further, the bill expands career guidance and academic \ncounseling services so that students have a career plan and career \nobjectives.\n  Well-prepared CTE teachers and good professional development are \nessential components of an effective, rigorous CTE curriculum. CTE \nteachers must possess the knowledge and skills to teach effectively. \nHence, this bill dedicates resources to promoting the leadership, \ninitial preparation, and professional development of career and \ntechnical education teachers to foster effective practices.\n  This bill is designed to improve student educational and employment \noutcomes, including their technical and workplace knowledge and skills. \nBut, we must be able to measure how well CTE programs are meeting the \nneeds of its students. Accordingly, the legislation will require states \nto identify core indicators of performance that include measures of \nstudent achievement on technical assessments and attainment of career \nand technical skill proficiencies.\n  Thus, it is essential to develop valid and reliable assessments of \ntechnical and career competencies that are aligned with national \nindustry standards and integrate industry certification assessments, if \navailable and appropriate. To address this need for high-quality \ntechnical assessments, this bill permits State leadership funds to be \nused to develop valid and reliable assessments of technical skills that \nare integrated with industry certification assessments where available.\n  In addition, the bill includes several new provisions for data \ncollection, utilization, and analysis, including provisions which allow \nthe State allocation to be used to support and develop State data \nsystems, and State leadership funds to be used to develop and enhance \ndata systems to collect and analyze data on postsecondary and \nemployment outcomes.\n  I am also pleased that this bill makes significant improvements to \nhelp Crownpoint Institute of Technology. Crownpoint plays a critical \nrole in ensuring Native American students have the education, skills, \nand training necessary to compete in the global economy, and this bill \nhelps Crownpoint get the funding they need to serve their students.\n  Yet, increasing academic and technical rigor alone is not enough to \nprepare students to enter into and compete in the 21st century \nworkforce. The learning environment students experience also heavily \nimpacts academic performance and student outcomes. When smaller \nlearning communities are in place, students benefit greatly: they \nexperience a greater sense of belonging to their schools and they have \nfewer discipline, crime, violence, and substance abuse problems.\n  I would like to highlight two high schools in my home State of New \nMexico which demonstrate some of the best practices of rigorous and \ninnovative career and technical education. Rio Rancho High School has \nserved as a model example of how academic rigor, hands-on-learning, \nstrong professional development, defined career pathways, and robust \nalliances are elements of a successful, quality CTE program. Rio Rancho \nhas created academies of study for all students, which allow students \nto: pursue career pathways to postsecondary education and beyond; take \ncore courses geared toward interests, skills, and competitive careers; \nform partnerships with instructors; and become part of a smaller \nlearning community within the larger high school. These academies allow \nstudents to explore personal strengths and interests in relationship to \ncareer planning and job markets. Rio Rancho has been designated as a \nMicrosoft Center of Innovation and Time Magazine has called Rio Rancho \none of the ten most innovative career and technical schools in the \nNation.\n  Another great example of innovative career and technical education \ncan be found at Albuquerque High School. In just a couple of years, the \ncareer academies at Albuquerque High School have demonstrated very \npositive student outcomes. The first students in Albuquerque's Academy \nof Advanced Technology have lower dropout rates and improved academic \nachievement.\n  Accordingly, this legislation recognizes that smaller learning \ncommunities and career academies are critical educational investments. \nAs Rio Rancho and Albuquerque High Schools demonstrate, rigorous career \nand technical education and smaller learning environments enhance \nstudents' achievement and motivation to learn.\n  Unfortunately, the formula as drafted in this bill will have a very \nnegative impact on career and technical education programs in many of \nour States. While I support the improvements sought in this bill, I am \nvery disappointed that states like New Mexico, Mississippi, \nPennsylvania, Iowa, Kansas, Ohio, Wisconsin, Illinois, Connecticut, \nLouisiana, Alabama, Missouri, and Idaho, just to name a few, will face \nsignificant cuts in funding next year alone. In fact, these cuts hit \nthe poorest States in this country the hardest. Assuming this program \nreceives level funding in appropriations in fiscal year 2007, 24 States \nlose money. If there are any cuts to the program at all, more than 30 \nStates could lose under this formula.\n  These losses are very real to the students participating in career \nand technical education at our high schools and community colleges. A \njunior in high school pursuing a career in medical technology might not \nbe able to finish her program in her senior year if funding is yanked.\n  Our students depend on programs like Perkins to provide them with \nessential job skills and training. It is not only unfair to pull \nfunding from our students, but unwise to cut funding from so many \nStates. Strong career and technical education programs are critical to \nthis Nation if we are to ensure a skilled and educated workforce. This \nformula is simply a step in the wrong direction.\n  Many of us talk about ensuring America's students are prepared to \nmeet the challenges of the 21st century workforce. We talk about \nprotecting America's competitive edge in the global economy. I firmly \nbelieve, however, that taking career and technical education programs \naway from some of our most needy students does not enhance our economic \nsecurity. Simply, a loss of funding means a loss of services to \nstudents.\n  Nevertheless, I firmly believe there are many positive aspects of \nthis legislation, and despite the funding formula, I support the \noverall bill. Effective career and technical education programs are \nnecessary to build a strong and dynamic economy and to maintain a \ncompetitive American workforce, and therefore, I support the passage of \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I support final passage of S. 250, the Carl \nD. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2006.\n  This important legislation, which reauthorizes the Carl D. Perkins \nVocational and Technical Education Act of\n\n[[Page S8327]]\n\n1998, will help strengthen both the workforce in my home State of Rhode \nIsland and across the Nation and ensure that our students have the \nnecessary skills and tools to access high-quality, high-wage employment \nand compete in an ever-expanding global economy.\n  I am pleased that Congress will reaffirm its overwhelming bipartisan \nand bicameral support for this program, especially in light of the \nPresident's efforts in his last two budget proposals to eliminate \nfunding for Perkins. For the 2006-2007 school year, our State, which is \nhome to 10 Career and Technical Centers and 54 high schools and \ncolleges offering career and technical education programs, would stand \nto lose an estimated $6.3 million in Perkins basic state and tech prep \nfunding under the President's proposed budget. These cuts are \nunjustifiable, especially at a time when it is ever more critical that \nwe provide a robust link between students and a highly skilled \nworkforce American business depends on to thrive.\n  As a cosponsor of the Senate version of this bill, I am pleased that \nmany of its comprehensive provisions on the recruitment, preparation, \nsupport, and professional development of career and technical education \nteachers, which I authored, have been included in the final version of \nthe bill before us today. I believe having a well-trained, qualified, \nand effective teacher in every classroom is the key for ensuring that \nstudents participating in career and technical education programs will \nachieve their fullest academic and career goals and aspirations.\n  The bill also contains a number of provisions that address the \nconcerns raised by educators in Rhode Island. First, S. 250 does not \ncombine the tech prep program with the basic State grant program at the \nFederal level as the House bill proposed. Second, the bill authorizes \nuse of State administration funding at up to 5 percent, funding which \nsupports such essential activities as developing a State plan, \nmonitoring career and technical education program efficiency, and \nproviding technical assistance to districts. Third, S. 250 adds a new \nState leadership incentive grant I authored for school districts and \npostsecondary institutions that elect to pool their funds for \ninnovative initiatives, including improving the professional \ndevelopment of career and technical educators and establishing and \nenhancing systems for accountability data collection.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senators Kennedy and Enzi, and their staffs, \nfor their work on this legislation and moving it toward final passage.\n  I am pleased to support this legislation. A highly skilled workforce \nnot only grows our economy, but maintains our Nation's competitive edge \nin the world. I look forward to the President quickly signing this bill \ninto law--which will hopefully signal a turnaround in his support for \nPerkins career and technical education programs--to help ensure that \nour students remain competitive and have the academic and technical \ntools to succeed.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to support the \nCarl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act. I was \nproud to cosponsor this legislation in the Senate, and I am proud that \nthe Congress is on the eve of passing it into law.\n  I am extremely pleased that this bill was written in a bipartisan \nfashion. I want to thank Senator Enzi, Senator Kennedy, Congressman \nMcKeon, and Congressman Miller for working so hard on this legislation. \nI hope that the HELP Committee will approach other education bills in \nthe same bipartisan process.\n  The legislation recognizes the important role of career and technical \neducation in the preparation of today's workforce. It rejects the Bush \nadministration's proposal to eliminate the Perkins program, a proposal \nthat would cost New York approximately $65 million a year. The bill \nbefore us today is evidence of the strong bipartisan commitment to \nmaintaining and strengthening Perkins.\n  The Perkins program plays a key role in helping young people and \npeople returning to school gain the skills they need to land high-\nquality jobs. Perkins is the largest Federal investments in our \nNation's high schools. Over 66 percent of all public high schools have \nat least one vocational and technical education program and 96 percent \nof high school students in this country take at least one vocational or \ntechnical course while in high school.\n  The Perkins program also plays a key role in postsecondary education. \nAccording to the National Center for Education Statistics, nearly 38 \npercent of all degree-seeking undergraduates are pursuing vocational \ncareers. These programs play a key role in educating our workforce and \ncensus data consistently shows that people with higher educational \nattainment have higher median incomes.\n  In New York, the demand for business career and technical education \nprograms increased by 44 percent between the 2002-2003 school year and \nthe 2003-2004 school year. In New York City, there was a 211-percent \nincrease in enrollment in the approved business program and a 55-\npercent increase in the technology and communications programs. And the \nvast majority of these students are succeeding academically. Eighty-\nfive percent of New York students who completed a career and technical \neducation program passed all of the required regent's exams.\n  The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act \ntakes the next step in strengthening career and technical education for \nthe 21st century. I am particularly pleased that this bill improves \nprograms and services for women and girls pursuing nontraditional \noccupations. Families, industries, and our economy as a whole benefit \nwhen women and girls pursue non-traditional, traditionally ``male'' \ncareers--in technology, math, science, and the construction and \nbuilding trades. Unfortunately, women continue to be significantly \nunderrepresented in these fields. For example, while the number of \nfemale carpenters has tripled since 1972, women still represent only \n1.7 percent of all carpenters. You can say the same about many other \nhigh-skill, high-wage trades.\n  Many of these skilled trades industries are experiencing a \nsignificant labor shortage and experts expect these shortages to get \nworse over the next two decades as many workers retire. If women were \nto enter these professions, most of which are unionized and pay a \nlivable paycheck and benefits, women would increase their earnings and \nstandard of living for their families. For example, a journey-level \nelectrician will make over half a million dollars more than a typical \ncashier in a 30-year career.\n  This bill requires States to measure students' participation and \ncompletion in career and technical programs in nontraditional fields \nand to disaggregate their data on performance by gender and race. In \naddition, programs will be required to prepare special populations for \nhigh-skill, high-wage occupations that will lead to self-sufficiency. \nThese important provisions will go a long way toward helping more women \nachieve economic security for their families.\n  The bill also provides comprehensive professional development for \ncareer and technical education teachers and aligns secondary and \npostsecondary indicators with those established in other programs to \nultimately reduce paperwork.\n  Finally, I am pleased that the bill maintains Tech Prep as a separate \nprogram, maintaining the position proposed in the Senate bill. \nInnovative Tech Prep programs in New York have made a real difference \nin the lives of students. For example, the Syracuse City Health Center \nTech Prep program reduced the achievement gap between ethnic groups--\nwhite versus non-white--to 2.8 percent. And at least 65 percent of \nstudents in the Syracuse City Health Careers Tech Prep program enroll \nin health-related professions, where New York has a critical shortage, \nafter high school. In New York State, the average age of nurses is 47 \nand 80 percent of current nurses will reach retirement age within 10 \nyears.\n  The Perkins program is extremely important--not just for the numbers \nof students it serves but for the communities that benefit from a \nbetter prepared workforce as a result of these programs. This is why \nfor the last 4 years I have spearheaded a bipartisan letter to the \nSenate Appropriations Committee requesting additional funding for \nPerkins.

Again, this is a very carefully crafted \nbipartisan bill. It is very targeted and will move us closer to energy \nindependence. So we hope we can finish the bill at the earliest time.\n  We have other important issues to address before we finish our work \nprior to the August adjournment. Therefore, the leader hopes that we \ncan continue to work on other measures as we process this important \nenergy security measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/26/senate-section/article/S8328-4", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
