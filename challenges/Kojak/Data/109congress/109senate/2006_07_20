Mr. President, it is my honor and pleasure to welcome our \nguest Chaplain this morning, the Reverend Ed Sears of Winston-Salem, \nNC. Reverend Sears is from my hometown, and it is an honor to have him \nin Washington today blessing the Senate.\n  Reverend Sears is the senior pastor at Grace Baptist Temple in \nWinston-Salem. He has faithfully served Grace Baptist's congregation of \nover 1,000 members for the past 25 years. Reverend Sears first heard \nhis call to serve in 1971 and has since used his faith to minister and \nlead. In addition to his service to his church and his community, \nReverend Sears holds the distinction of blessing both the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate. In 2003, Reverend Sears was the guest \nChaplain in the House and now honors us this morning in the Senate. \nGrace Baptist Temple, the city of Winston-Salem, and I appreciate his \nfaith and fellowship.\n  Reverend Sears has been happily married for 39 years.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 9, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 9) to amend the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Majority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this morning we are proceeding directly to \nH.R. 9, the voting rights reauthorization bill. We have a unanimous \nconsent order that provides for up to 8 hours of debate today, although \nI do not expect all that time will be necessary. We will proceed to a \nvote on passage of H.R. 9 whenever that time is used or yielded back, \nand therefore that vote will occur sometime this afternoon, and I \nexpect passage of that voting rights reauthorization bill.\n  There are several circuit and district court judges that will require \nsome debate and votes today. We will have a unanimous consent agreement \non those debate times shortly, and we will likely consider those \njudicial nominations following the passage of the Voting Rights Act.\n  We have been working on an agreement on the child predator \nlegislation for a short debate and vote, which will occur today, and we \nhope to have that agreement as well.\n  Finally, we have an order to proceed to the child custody protection \nbill today, and we have Senators who would like to speak on this issue \nlater today as well.\n  Having said that, the schedule will require votes over the course of \nthe day--possibly into the evening--in order to finish. Although there \nis a lot to do and people have requested time\n\n[[Page S7950]]\n\nto be set aside, I think a lot of that time can be yielded back over \nthe course of the day and we will be able to complete the schedule as I \nhave laid out.\n  In a few moments, after the chairman makes his opening statements on \nthe Voting Rights Act reauthorization, I will return with an opening \nstatement as well. It has been a process we have expedited in many ways \nbecause the importance and significance of this legislation is very \nclear. So I am delighted that we are moving to it this morning and that \nwe will be passing it later this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Are we prepared to proceed at this time with the \nconsideration of the Voting Rights Act?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this is a historic day for the Senate and \nreally a historic day for America as we move forward with Senate action \nto reauthorize the Voting Rights Act. This action, coming from the \nJudiciary Committee in our executive session yesterday afternoon, \npassed unanimously--18 to 0--moves the Senate toward completion of this \nreauthorization today and for submission to the President and for the \nformal signing next week.\n  In an era where many have challenged the ability of the Congress to \nfunction in the public interests and in an era where there is so much \npartisan disagreement, it is good to see the two parties in the House \nand the Senate coming together to reauthorize this very important \nlegislation.\n  I thank and congratulate the members of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee for pulling together and moving ahead at this time, with a \nprodigious amount of work, to bring this important matter to the floor. \nThe committee has proceeded with 9 hearings. We have had 46 witnesses. \nWe have had 11 leading academics come to testify from such \ndistinguished institutions as the Yale Law School, Stanford University, \nthe University of Pennsylvania Law School, New York University Law \nSchool, and others.\n  The House of Representatives held 12 hearings to gather evidence on \nvoting discrimination, featuring testimony from some 46 witnesses.\n  We have had some of the leading luminaries in the Nation testify, \nsuch as Professor Chandler Davidson, coauthor of the landmark book on \nthe Voting Rights Act ``Quiet Revolution in the South;'' Theodore Shaw, \nDirector-Counsel and President of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education \nFund; Fred Gray, veteran civil rights attorney who began his career in \nthe midst of the civil rights movement in the 1950s and has represented \nsuch civil rights leaders as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Mrs. Rosa \nParks.\n  We have been mindful in presenting these witnesses and compiling this \nrecord that the Supreme Court has required very extensive records. \nThe Supreme Court struck down parts of the landmark legislation \nprotecting women against violence because the Court disagreed with the \ncongressional ``method of reasoning.'' It is a little hard to \nunderstand that conclusion, but they have the final word. They have a \ntest on the adequacy of the record; that it be congruent and \nproportional. It is sometimes hard to understand exactly what that test \nis, but we are on guard to compile a very extensive record in order to \navoid having the act declared unconstitutional.\n\n  The bill which we will vote on today accomplishes many important \nitems. First, it strengthens voting rights protections nationwide by \nallowing voters who successfully challenge illegal voting practices to \nrecover reasonable expenses of litigation. Second, it extends the \nprotections for voters with limited English skills for 25 years. Those \nvoters will continue to enjoy the protection of bilingual ballots and \nassistance at the polls. It also extends for 25 years the requirements \nthat the Department of Justice preclear any voting change in certain \ncovered jurisdictions where there has been a history of discrimination. \nThe bill clarifies how the preclearance protections should work, \nguaranteeing that voting laws enacted with a discriminatory purpose \nnever get enacted into law. So, it moves America in the right \ndirection.\n  The benefits and effects of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 have been \nprofound, to put it mildly. It is the political power of the minorities \nfor whom the Voting Rights Act was designed who pushed the Congress \nforward a year in advance of the expiration of the Voting Rights Act, \nto move ahead and get this important job done early.\n  If you contrast 1964, before the Voting Rights Act was passed, with \nwhat is happening in America today, it is a different America. It is a \ndifferent political reality. In 1964, there were only approximately 300 \nAfrican Americans in public office, including just 3 in the Congress. \nFew, if any, Black elected officials came from the South. Today, there \nare more than 9,000 Black elected officials, including 43 Members of \nCongress. This is the largest number ever. Quite a record. The Voting \nRights Act has opened the political process for many of the \napproximately 6,000 Latino public officials who have been elected, \nincluding 263 at the State or Federal level, 27 of whom serve in \nCongress.\n  This progress is especially striking in covered jurisdictions where \nhundreds of minorities hold office. In Georgia, for example, minorities \nare elected at rates proportionate to or higher than their numbers. In \nGeorgia, the voting-age population is 27 percent African American. \nAlmost 31 percent of its delegations to the House of Representatives \nare African American, and 26.5 percent of officials elected statewide \nare African American. Black candidates in Mississippi have achieved \nsimilar success. The State's voting age population is 34 percent \nAfrican American. Almost 30 percent of its representatives in the State \nHouse and 25 percent of its delegations in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives are African American.\n  The Congress of 1965 relied on evidence that Black registration was \nso dramatically lower than White registration that the differences \ncould only be explained by purposeful efforts to disenfranchise Black \ncitizens. Indeed, in some cases, the gap was 50 percentage points. In \nAlabama, Black registration was just at 18 percent, and in Mississippi, \na little over 6 percent. Today, in Alabama and Louisiana, Blacks are \nregistered at approximately the same rate as White voters, and in \nGeorgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Texas, Black registration and \nturnout in the 2004 election was higher than that of the Whites.\n  The Congress of 1965 relied on findings of Federal courts and the \nJustice Department that the covered States were engaged in the practice \nof deliberate unconstitutional behavior. For example, the 1965 Senate \nreport noted that Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi had lost every \nvoting discrimination suit brought against them, and in the previous 8 \nyears, each State had eight or nine courts find them guilty of \nviolating the Constitution.\n\n  Today, the statistics paint a starkly different picture. Since 1982, \nonly six cases have ended in court ruling or a consent decree finding \nthat one of the 880 covered jurisdictions had committed \nunconstitutional discrimination against minority voters. During that \ntime, six cases have found that a noncovered jurisdiction committed \nunconstitutional discrimination against minority voters. If the data is \nfocused on the last 11 years, the results are even more dramatic. Since \n1995, only two cases ended in a finding that a covered jurisdiction \nunconstitutionally discriminated against minority voters.\n  Looking at voting rights cases paints a similar picture. In 1982, 39 \ncourt cases ended with a finding that one of the 880 covered \njurisdictions had violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. That is \nthe provision that prohibits discrimination nationwide. During the same \nperiod of time, 40 court cases have ended with a finding that one of \nthe noncovered jurisdictions have violated Section 2. Not a perfect \nrecord, but it shows that discrimination has become more incidental and \nless systematic.\n  There is no doubt this improved record is a direct result of the \nVoting Rights Act. When we take a look at civil rights legislation \ngenerally, the Voting Rights Act is the most important part of our \neffort to give minorities--give all Americans--their full range of \nconstitutional civil rights.\n  When we take a look at the activities of the three distinguished \nwomen for whom the Voting Rights Act has been named--Coretta Scott \nKing, Rosa Parks, Fannie Lou Hamer--we see the\n\n[[Page S7951]]\n\nenormous contribution which they have made. Mrs. King, the widow of \npioneering civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., devoted a \nlifetime to opposing racism, whether the 1960s segregation Alabama or \nthe 1980s apartheid in South Africa. Fortunately, she lived to see so \nmuch of the progress America has made. Sadly, her husband, Dr. King, \ndid not see that.\n  I recall, not too long ago, when Mrs. King came to the Senate, in the \nadjoining room to the Senate Chambers, and spoke out forcefully on the \nissues of civil rights. She was a real heroin in America, to pursue the \nwork of Dr. King.\n  Every American schoolchild knows the story of Miss Rosa Parks who, on \nDecember 1, 1955, refused to give up her seat to a white passenger. She \nexplained her motivation simply:\n\n       People always say that I didn't give up my seat because I \n     was tired, but that isn't true. I was not tired physically. . \n     . . I was not old, . . . I was forty-two. No, the only tired \n     I was, was tired of giving in.\n\n  Fannie Lou Hamer first learned that African Americans had a \nconstitutional right to vote in 1962, when she was 44 years old. Ms. \nHammer later explained that, despite death threats and violence, she \nwas determined to exercise her constitutional rights and said:\n\n       The only thing that they could do to me was to kill me, and \n     it seemed like they had been trying to do that a little bit \n     at a time ever since I could remember.\n\n  So we come to this day in the Senate where we are on the verge of \npassing the Voting Rights Act, reauthorizing it as the House has done. \nThe President will be speaking within the hour to the NAACP convention \nand doubtless will refer proudly to the acts of the Congress in \npresenting him with this bill.\n  I want to pay tribute to the Judiciary Committee. All the members \nworked very hard to get these nine hearings and to examine the \nwitnesses and to create a record. Senator Kennedy, who is on the floor, \nhas been a stalwart leader in this field for a very long time. He was \nhere when the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed. Not too many \ncurrent Members of the Senate were present. Senator Byrd, Senator \nInouye--this is not in my prepared text. I may be omitting someone. \nSenator Stevens came shortly thereafter--1968.\n  Senator Kennedy doesn't need a microphone when he speaks about civil \nrights in this Chamber. He can be heard on the House floor--quite a \ndistance away, past the Rotunda. He has not only been a spokesman for \nthis act, he has been a persistent advocate. Not that it needed a whole \nlot of advocacy to persuade the latest chairman or my distinguished \nranking member, Senator Leahy, to move ahead. This has been our \npriority item. We got the Judiciary Committee together on a Wednesday \nafternoon. It is pretty hard to get the Judiciary Committee together \nany time and to get a quorum, but we were present, 16 of the 18 \nmembers. One member was on the floor managing a bill and the other \ncouldn't be there. So there was that kind of enthusiasm.\n  Now I want to yield to Senator Leahy, the distinguished ranking \nmember. The committee has quite a record for 18 months. We moved \npromptly on January 4 to confirm the President's designee for Attorney \nGeneral. We moved ahead to pass reform legislation on class actions and \nbankruptcy. We moved ahead, with Senator Leahy's leadership and the \nleadership of Judge Becker, to move asbestos out of committee--yet to \nbe acted on, on the floor. We have confirmed two Supreme Court Justices \nand have moved the immigration bill out of committee. But none of our \nactivities has been as important as the one we presented to the floor \nof the Senate yesterday when we voted out the Voting Rights Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional materials be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Below is a summary of all the cases that Senate Judiciary \n     Committee staff has located in which a court or a settlement \n     found a constitutional violation of voting rights.\n       Only six cases resulted in a finding that a covered \n     jurisdiction committed unconstitutional discrimination \n     against minority voters. Six cases ended in a finding that \n     found that a covered jurisdiction had committed \n     unconstitutional discrimination against white voters. Six \n     cases in non-covered jurisdictions found unconstitutional \n     voting practices against minority voters, and two against \n     white or majority voters.\n       An additional 22 cases found a constitutional violation, \n     but these did not involve racial discrimination or any \n     conduct addressed by the Voting Rights Act. Accordingly, \n     these cases are not relevant evidence for reauthorization.\n       Staff reviewed the ACLU's 867-page Voting Rights Report, \n     which discusses 293 cases brought since June 1982. Staff also \n     reviewed the database for the University of Michigan Law \n     School Voting Rights Report. The database was constructed by \n     searching the ``federal court'' databases of Westlaw or Lexis \n     for any case that was decided since June 29, 1982 and \n     mentions section 2, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1973. Of all the \n     identified section 2 lawsuits, 209 produced at least one \n     published liability decision under section 2. Staff reviewed \n     the ``state reports'' introduced into the record and \n     available at RenewTheVRA.org. Finally, staff reviewed the \n     consent decrees introduced into the November 8, 2005 House \n     Judiciary Committee hearing on the minority language \n     provisions of the Voting Rights Act.\n\n         I. Covered Jurisdictions Discriminating Against Voters\n\n\n                                Alabama\n\n       (1) Hunter v. Underwood, 730 F.2d 614 (11th Cir. 1984), \n     affirmed 471 U.S. 222 (1985) (ACLU Rep., p. 51).\n       The ACLU represented two voters who were disenfranchised \n     under a nearly 80 year-old law that prohibited those who had \n     committed a ``crime of moral turpitude'' from voting. Id. at \n     p. 52. The court struck down the law because there was \n     evidence that when it was adopted in the early 1900s, the \n     legislators intended to disenfranchise black voters. The \n     Supreme Court unanimously affirmed that, in view of the proof \n     of racial motivation and continuing racially discriminatory \n     effect, the state law violated the Fourteenth Amendment.\n       (2) Dillard v. City of Foley, 926 F. Supp. 1053 (M.D. Ala. \n     1995) (ACLU Rep., p. 57).\n       African American plaintiffs in the City of Foley, Alabama, \n     filed a motion to require the City to adopt and implement a \n     nondiscriminatory annexation policy and to annex Mills \n     Quarters and Beulah Heights. Plaintiffs also claimed that the \n     City had violated section 5 and section 2. As a result of \n     negotiations, the parties entered into a consent decree. The \n     decree found plaintiffs had established ``a prima facie \n     violation of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the \n     United States Constitution.'' Id. at p. 59.\n       (3) Brown v. Board of School Comm'rs., 706 F. 2d 1103 (11th \n     Cir. 1983) (U Mich. L.Rep., http://www.votingreport.org.).\n       A class of African American voters challenged Mobile \n     County's at-large system for electing School Board members. \n     In 1852, Mobile County created at-large school board \n     elections of 12 commissioners. In 1870, the election \n     procedures changed; instead of selecting all 12 \n     commissioners, voters would select 9 of the 12 and the other \n     3 would be appointed. This system had the effect of ensuring \n     minority representation on the school board. In 1876, the \n     Alabama state legislature eliminated the Mobile County school \n     board system and returned the County to the 1852 at-large \n     election scheme which remained in effect until this suit was \n     brought.\n       The district court found that by re-instating the at-large \n     election system, the Alabama state legislature intended to \n     discriminate against African Americans in Mobile County in \n     violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment. The \n     Eleventh Circuit affirmed.\n\n\n                                Georgia\n\n       (4) Miller v. Johnson: 515 U.S. 900 (1995) (ACLU Rep., 126-\n     27).\n       In August 1991, the Georgia legislature adopted a \n     congressional redistricting plan based on the new census \n     containing two majority minority districts--the Fifth and the \n     Eleventh. A third district, the Second, had a 35.4% black \n     voting age population. The state submitted the plan for \n     preclearance, but the Attorney General objected to it. \n     Following another objection to a second plan, the state \n     adopted a third plan which contained three majority black \n     districts, the Fifth, the Eleventh, and the Second. The plan \n     was precleared on April 2, 1992. Following the decision in \n     Shaw v. Reno, a lawsuit was filed by white plaintiffs \n     claiming that the Eleventh Congressional District was \n     unconstitutional. One of the plaintiffs was George DeLoach, a \n     white man who had been defeated by McKinney in the 1992 \n     Democratic primary. Although the Eleventh District was not as \n     irregular in shape as the district in Shaw v. Reno, the \n     district court found it to be unconstitutional, holding that \n     the ``contours of the Eleventh District . . . are so \n     dramatically irregular as to permit no other conclusion than \n     that they were manipulated along racial lines.'' The Supreme \n     Court affirmed. It did not find the Eleventh District was \n     bizarrely shaped, but it held the state had ``subordinated'' \n     its traditional redistricting principles to race without \n     having a compelling reason for doing so. The court criticized \n     the plan for splitting counties and municipalities and \n     joining black neighborhoods by the use of narrow, sparsely \n     populated ``land bridges.'' On remand the district court \n     allowed the plaintiffs to amend their complaint to challenge \n     the majority black Second District, which the court then held \n     was unconstitutional for the same reasons it had found the \n     Eleventh District to be unconstitutional, [and] the \n     legislature adjourned without adopting a congressional plan.\n\n[[Page S7952]]\n\n       (5) Common Cause v. Billups: 4:05-CV-201 HLM (N.D. Ga.) \n     (ACLU Rep., 185-91).\n       The Department of Justice precleared the photo ID bill on \n     August 26, 2005. The ACLU filed suit in federal district \n     court, charging the law violated the state and federal \n     constitutions, the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and the 1964 Civil \n     Rights Act. The district court issued a preliminary \n     injunction holding plaintiffs had a substantial likelihood of \n     succeeding on several grounds, including claims that the \n     photo ID law was a poll tax and violated the equal protection \n     clause of the Constitution. The state appealed to the \n     Eleventh Circuit, which refused to stay the injunction. In an \n     attempt to address the poll tax burden cited by the district \n     court in its injunction, the Georgia legislature passed a new \n     photo ID bill providing for free photo identification cards.\n       (6) Clark v. Putnam County: 168 F.3d 458 (11th Cir. 1999) \n     (ACLU Report at 384-89).\n       In 1997, four white plaintiffs filed a lawsuit challenging \n     the constitutionality of the majority black county commission \n     districts as racial gerrymanders in violation of the Shaw/\n     Miller line of cases. In January 2001, the district court \n     dismissed the complaint. The Eleventh Circuit reversed, \n     holding that the district court erred in failing to find \n     unconstitutional intentional discrimination.\n\n\n                               Louisiana\n\n       (7) Hays v. Louisiana, 515 U.S. 737 (1995) (ACLU Rep., p. \n     481).\n       White plaintiffs successfully challenged Louisiana's Fourth \n     Congressional District as unconstitutional ``race-conscious'' \n     redistricting. Id. at p. 481. The Supreme Court granted \n     cert., but then dismissed the case for lack of standing.\n\n\n                             North Carolina\n\n       (8) Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899 (1996) (ACLU Rep., p. 513).\n       The 12th District of North Carolina was 57% black and was \n     persistently challenged by white voters and its boundaries \n     were considered by the Supreme Court four separate times. The \n     ACLU participated as an amicus in defending the \n     constitutionality of the 12th District. In 1996, the Supreme \n     Court struck down the plan for the 12th District on the \n     grounds that race was the ``predominant'' factor in drawing \n     the plan and the State had subordinated its traditional \n     redistricting principles to race. Id.\n\n\n                             South Carolina\n\n       (9) Smith v. Beasley, 946 F. Supp. 1174 (D.S.C. 1996) (ACLU \n     Rep., p. 572).\n       White voters filed suit in 1995 challenging three state \n     senate districts. A year later, another group of white voters \n     filed suit challenging nine house districts. In both cases, \n     the plaintiffs claimed that the districts were drawn with \n     race as the predominant factor in violation of the Shaw/\n     Miller line of decisions. The cases were consolidated for \n     trial, and black voters, represented by the ACLU, intervened \n     to defend the constitutionality of the challenged districts. \n     Following a trial, a court issued an order in September 1996, \n     finding three of the challenged senate districts and nine of \n     the house districts unconstitutional because they ``were \n     drawn with race as the predominant factor.''

Tex. 1986) (U Mich. \n     L.Rep., http://www.votingreport.org).\n       Latino plaintiffs argued that the at-large election system \n     diluted their votes. The parties agreed to a court order that \n     eliminated the election scheme and defendants submitted a \n     proposal in which four trustees would be elected from single-\n     member districts and three would be elected at large. \n     Plaintiffs objected and filed a plan in which all seven \n     trustees would be elected from single-member districts. The \n     court, applying Gingles and the totality-of-circumstances \n     tests, held that defendants' plans violated section 2 and the \n     Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment. The court ordered that a \n     seven-member district plan for electing trustees be \n     immediately implemented according to district boundaries \n     drawn by the court.\n\n\n                                Virginia\n\n       (11) Moon v.

In 1997, the district \n     court invalidated the Third Congressional District, finding \n     that race had predominated in drawing the district and that \n     the defendants could not adequately justify their use of race \n     as a districting factor.\n       (12) Pegram v. City of Newport News, 4:94cv79 (E.D.Va. \n     1994) (ACLU Rep., p. 714).\n       In July 1994, the ACLU filed suit on behalf of African \n     American voters challenging the at-large method of city \n     elections in the City of Newport News. On October 26, 1994, a \n     consent decree was entered in which the City admitted that \n     its at-large system violated section 2 as well as the \n     Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. The consent decree \n     required the City to implement a racially fair election plan.\n\n      II. NON-COVERED JURISDICTIONS DISCRIMINATING AGAINST VOTERS\n\n\n                               California\n\n       (1) Garza v. County of Los Angeles, 918 F.2d 763 (9th Cir. \n     1990) (U Mich. Law School's Report. http://\nwww.votingreport.org).\n       Latino voters alleged that district lines for the Los \n     Angeles County Board of Supervisors were gerrymandered to \n     dilute their voting strength. Plaintiffs requested creation \n     of a district with a Latino majority for the 1990 Board of \n     Supervisors election. The Ninth Circuit affirmed that the \n     County had adopted and applied a redistricting plan that \n     resulted in dilution of Latino voting power in violation of \n     section 2, and by establishing and maintaining the plan, the \n     County had intentionally discriminated against Latinos in \n     violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection \n     Clause.\n\n\n                                Florida\n\n       (2) McMillan v. Escambia County, 748 F.2d 1037 (11th Cir. \n     1984) (U Mich. L.Rep., http://www.votingreport.org).\n       Black plaintiffs claimed that the at-large election of \n     county commissioners in Escambia County diluted their voting \n     power in violation of section 2 and the Fourteenth and \n     Fifteenth Amendments. The district court found that the State \n     had not implemented the plan with a racially discriminatory \n     purpose, but it had maintained it with such a purpose.\n\n\n                                 Hawaii\n\n       (3) Arakaki v. Hawaii, 314 F.3d 1091 (9th Cir. 2002) (U \n     Mich. L.Rep., http://www.votingreport.org).\n       A group of Hawaiian citizens of various ethnic backgrounds \n     sued the State of Hawaii alleging that the requirement that \n     those appointed to the Office of Hawaiian Affairs must be of \n     Native Hawaiian ancestry violated the Fourteenth Amendment, \n     the Fifteenth Amendment, and section 2 of the Voting Rights \n     Act. The Eleventh Circuit found that the restriction on \n     candidates running for Office of Hawaiian Affairs on the \n     basis of race violated the Fifteenth Amendment as well \n     section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The Ninth Circuit vacated \n     the district court's judgment that the Fourteenth Amendment \n     had also been violated because plaintiffs did not have \n     standing to challenge the appointment procedures.\n\n\n                               New Mexico\n\n       (4) United States v. Socorro County, Civ. Action No. 93-\n     1244-JP (November 8, 2005 House Judiciary Committee Hearing \n     Record)\n       The United States sued pursuant to sections 2, 12(d), and \n     203 of the VRA, alleging violations of the VRA and the 14th \n     and 15th Amendments arising from Socorro County's election \n     practices and procedures as they affected Native American \n     citizens of the county, including those Native American \n     citizens who rely on whole or in part on the Navajo language. \n     In its 1993 consent agreement, the defendants did ``not \n     contest that in past elections [the county] failed to make \n     the election process in Socorro County equally available to \n     Native American and non-Native American citizens as required \n     by Section 2 [of the VRA] and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth \n     Amendments, nor [did] defendants contest that in past \n     elections the county has failed to comply fully with the \n     minority language requirements of Section 203 [of the VRA].''\n       (5) United States v. Bernalillo County, Civ. Action No. 98-\n     156 BB/LCS (November 8, 2005 House Judiciary Committee \n     Hearing Record)\n       The United States sued pursuant to sections 2, 12(d), and \n     203 of the VRA, alleging violations of the VRA and the 14th \n     and 15th Amendments arising from Bernalillo County's election \n     practices and procedures as they affected Native American \n     citizens of the county, including those Native American \n     citizens who rely on whole or in part on the Navajo language. \n     In its 1998 consent decree, the defendants did ``not contest \n     that in past elections the county has failed in particular \n     areas to make the election process as accessible to Native \n     American citizens as it was to non-Native American citizens \n     as is required by Section 203, Section 2, and the Fourteenth \n     and Fifteenth Amendments.''\n\n\n                                New York\n\n       (6) Goosby v. Town Bd. of Town of Hempstead, 180 F. 3d 476 \n     (2d Cir. 1999) (U Mich. L.Rep., http://www.votingreport.org).\n       Representatives of the Town Board of Hempstead were chosen \n     through at-large elections. African American voters alleged \n     that they were unable to elect their preferred candidates. \n     The district court held that the at-large elections violated \n     section 2 and ordered the Town to submit a six single-member \n     district remedial plan. The Board submitted two plans. The \n     one the Board preferred was a two-district system, consisting \n     of one single-member district and one multi-member district. \n     The other plan consisted of six single-member districts. The \n     district court held that the two-district plan violated the \n     Fourteenth Amendment, but the six-district plan did not. The \n     Board appealed. The Second Circuit affirmed the district \n     court's holding that the Board's proposed two-district \n     plan violated section 2 and the Fourteenth Amendment \n     because blacks had no access to the Republican Party \n     candidate slating process.\n\n\n                              Pennsylvania\n\n       (7) Marks v. Stinson, 1994 WL 146113 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 26, \n     1994) (U Mich. L.Rep., http://www.votingreport.org).\n       Republican candidate for State Senate, Bruce Marks, the \n     Republican State Committee and other plaintiffs challenged \n     the election of Democrat William Stinson for the Second \n     Senatorial District. Although Marks received approximately \n     500 more votes from the Election Day voting machines than \n     Stinson, Stinson received 1000 more votes than Marks in \n     absentee voting. Marks and the other plaintiffs contended \n     that Stinson\n\n[[Page S7953]]\n\n     and his campaign workers encouraged voters to undermine \n     proper absentee voting procedures and requirements, such as \n     falsely claiming that they would be out of the county or \n     would be physically unable to go to the polls on Election \n     Day. Plaintiffs also contended that Stinson and the other \n     Defendants had focused their efforts to encourage illegal \n     absentee voting on minorities.\n       The court held: (1) defendants violated plaintiffs' First \n     Amendment rights of association because plaintiffs were \n     denied the freedom to form groups for the advancement of \n     political ideas and to campaign and vote for their chosen \n     candidates; (2) defendants' actions denied plaintiffs' right \n     to Equal Protection by discriminating against the Republican \n     candidate and by treating persons differently because of \n     their race; (3) defendants violated plaintiffs' Substantive \n     Due Process right to vote in state elections by abusing the \n     democratic process; and (4) defendants improperly applied a \n     ``standard, practice, or procedure'' in a discriminatory \n     fashion in violation of the VRA, targeting voters based on \n     race and denying minority voters the right to vote freely \n     without illegal interference. Finally, the court ordered the \n     certification of Bruce Marks as the winner of the Second \n     Senatorial District seat for the 1993 Special Election \n     because Marks would have won the election but for the illegal \n     actions of the defendants.\n\n\n                               Tennessee\n\n       (8) Brown v. Chattanooga board of Comm'rs, 722 F. Supp. 380 \n     (E.D. Tenn. 1989) (U Mich. L.Rep., http://\nwww.votingreport.org).\n       Black citizens of Chattanooga sued the Board of \n     Commissioners for its use of at-large elections. The court \n     held: (1) applying the Gingles test, the method of electing \n     Board of Commissioners violated section 2 because the \n     electoral practice resulted in an abridgment of black voter's \n     rights; and (2) the Property Qualified Voting provision of \n     the Chattanooga charter violated the Fourteenth Amendment \n     under rational basis review because permitting a nonresident \n     who owns a trivial amount of property to vote in municipal \n     elections does not further any rational governmental \n     interest.\n\n           III. Constitutional Violations Not Involving Race\n\n       (1) Vander Linden v. Hodges, 193 F.3d 268 (4th Cir. 1999) \n     (ACLU Rep., p. 562).\n       Residents of Dorchester, Berkeley, and Charleston Counties, \n     in South Carolina, filed suit in 1991 alleging that the \n     counties' legislative delegation structure violated the \n     Fourteenth Amendment's one-person, one-vote requirement and \n     was adopted with an unconstitutional purpose to discriminate \n     against African American voters. The district court rejected \n     both claims. The Fourth Circuit held that the structure \n     violated the one-person, one-vote rule (making no findings of \n     discriminatory intent) and did not address the second claim.\n       (2) NAACP v. Board of Trustees of Abbeville County School \n     District No. 60, Civ. No. 8-93-1047-03 (D.S.C. 1993) (ACLU \n     Rep., p. 583).\n       The Board of Trustees of Abbeville County School District \n     60 traditionally consisted of nine members, five of whom were \n     elected from single member districts and two each from two \n     multi-member districts. African Americans were 32% of the \n     population of the school district, but all the districts were \n     majority white and only one member of the board was African \n     American. In 1993, black residents of the school district and \n     the local NAACP chapter filed suit challenging the method of \n     electing the board of trustees as violating the \n     Constitution's one person, one vote requirement and violating \n     section 2 by diluting minority voting strength. The court \n     decided that the existing plan for the board ``is an \n     unconstitutionally malapportioned plan, and is in violation \n     of sections 2 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act.'' Id. at 584.\n       (3) Duffey v. Butts County Board of Commissioners: Civ. No. \n     92-233-3-MAC (M.D. Ga.) (ACLU Report at 237-38).\n       Suit challenging districting plans for Board of Education \n     and Board of Commissioners that were determined to be \n     malapportioned after the 1990 census. Plaintiffs sought, and \n     obtained, a preliminary injunction finding that the election \n     districts were ``constitutionally malapportioned.'' Parties \n     entered consent decree that retained five single member \n     districts for both boards and established two majority black \n     districts. Plan was precleared by DOJ.\n       (4) Calhoun County Branch of the NAACP v. Calhoun County: \n     Civ. No. 92-96-ALB/AMER(DF) (M.D. Ga.) (ACLU Report at 238-\n     40).\n       1979 suit to enjoin the use of at-large elections for \n     failure to comply with Section 5. The county had changed to \n     at-large voting in 1967 following increased black \n     registration. A three-judge panel enjoined the at-large \n     scheme, finding it had never been submitted for preclearance. \n     A consent order then created five single-member districts, \n     two of which were majority black, and two at-large seats. \n     After the 1990 census, black voters again sued, alleging the \n     districts were malapportioned. According to the ACLU report, \n     ``the district court entered an order enjoining the upcoming \n     primary election for the board of education under the \n     malapportioned plan. The parties then agreed upon a new plan \n     that complied with the equal population standard and \n     maintained two of the districts as majority black.''\n       (5) Frank Davenport v.

(ACLU Report at 256-59).\n       The county had failed to preclear its change to an at-large \n     system of voting for county commissioners in 1967. In 1980, \n     members of the local NAACP challenged the at-large system and \n     the failure to comply with Section 5. The court found a \n     section 5 violation, which resulted in a return to single-\n     member districts. After the 1990 census showed the commission \n     districts to be malapportioned (and following an attempt to \n     create equal districts which was not precleared before a 1992 \n     legislative poison pill provision rendered it void), the \n     ACLU sued seeking a remedial plan for the upcoming \n     elections. The parties entered a consent decree in which \n     the county admitted the districts were malapportioned in \n     violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's one person one \n     vote requirement and agreed to the redistricting plan \n     which had been created before the 1992 poison pill \n     invalidated it. The plan was precleared by DOJ.\n       (6) Jones v. Cook County: Civ. No. 7:94-cv-73 (WLS) (ACLU \n     Report at 271-72).\n       The ACLU filed suit on behalf of black voters in 1994, \n     alleging that the county board of commissioners and board of \n     education districts were constitutionally malapportioned \n     after the 1990 census. According to the ACLU's report, ``In a \n     hearing on December 19, 1995, county officials agreed that \n     'the relevant voting districts in Cook County are \n     malapportioned in violation of the equal protection clause of \n     the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution.' \n     A consent decree allowed sitting commission members to retain \n     their seats but implemented a new plan, correcting the \n     malapportionment for the 1996 elections.''\n       (7) Thomas v. Crawford County: 5:02 CV 222 (M.D. Ga.) (ACLU \n     Report at 272-74).\n       2002 suit alleged single-member districts were \n     malapportioned in violation of the constitution's one-person-\n     one-vote principle. The plaintiffs won summary judgment and a \n     preliminary injunction to prevent elections from taking place \n     under the plan. The court adopted a plan that maintained two \n     majority-black districts.\n       (8) Wright v. City of Albany: 306 F. Supp. 2d 1228 (M.D. \n     Ga. 2003) (ACLU Rep. 289-93).\n       Black residents of the city, represented by the ACLU, sued \n     in 2003 to enjoin use of an allegedly constitutionally \n     malapportioned districting plan and requested that the court \n     supervise the development and implementation of a remedial \n     plan that complied with the principle of one person, one \n     vote, and the VRA. According to the ACLU report, ``In a \n     series of subsequent orders, the court granted the \n     plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, enjoined the pending \n     elections, adopted a remedial plan prepared by the state \n     reapportionment office, and directed that a special election \n     for the mayor and city commission [be] held in February \n     2004.''\n       (9) Woody v.

According to \n     the ACLU report, ``On October 14, 1992, the district court \n     entered a consent order involving the board of Education, \n     affirming that `Defendants do not contest plaintiffs' \n     allegations that the districts as presently constituted are \n     malapportioned and in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment \n     of the Constitution.' ''\n       (15) Cook v. Randolph County: Civ. No. 93-113-COL (M.D. \n     Ga.) (ACLU Report at 389-93).\n       According to the ACLU Report, ``On October 5, 1993, black \n     voters, represented by the ACLU, filed suit. They asked the \n     court to enjoin elections for the school board and board of \n     commissioners on the grounds that the districting plan for \n     both bodies was either malapportioned in violation of the \n     Constitution and Section 2, or had not been precleared \n     pursuant to Section 5. Later that month, on October 29, the \n     parties signed a consent order stipulating that the existing \n     county districts were malapportioned, and agreeing on a \n     redistricting plan containing five single member districts \n     with a total deviation of 9.35%. Three of the five districts \n     were majority black.''\n       (16) Houston v. Board of Commissioners of Sumter County: \n     Civ. No. 94-77-AMER (M.D. Ga.) (ACLU Report at 420-22).\n       The ACLU brought suit in 1984 on behalf of black county \n     residents charging that the five member board of county \n     commissioners was malapportioned in violation of the \n     Constitution and Section 2 of the VRA. The suit also charged \n     defendants with failing to secure preclearance of a valid \n     reapportionment plan under Section 5. According to the ACLU \n     Report, ``After plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction \n     to block the 1984 board of commissioners election, a consent \n     order was issued acknowledging that the districts were \n     malapportioned, and instructing both parties to submit \n     reapportionment plans to the court. . . . On February 27, \n     1985, after trial on the merits, the court ruled the \n     challenged plan unconstitutional and directed the defendants \n     to adopt a new plan and seek preclearance under Section 5 \n     within 30 days.''\n       (17) Cooper v. Sumter County Board of Commissioners: Civ. \n     No. 1:92-cv-00105-DF (M.D. Ga.) (ACLU Report at 422-23).\n       After the release of the 1990 census, the ACLU brought suit \n     on behalf of black plaintiffs, alleging that the county's \n     commission districts were malapportioned in violation of the \n     constitutional principle of one person, one vote. On July 27, \n     1992, the district court entered a consent order finding \n     ``malapportionment in excess of the legally acceptable \n     standard.''\n       (18) Williams v. Tattnal County Board of Commissioners: \n     Civ. No. CV692-084 (S.D. Ga.) (ACLU Report at 426-27).\n       After the 1990 census, the ACLU, on behalf of black \n     residents, sued to enjoin further \n     use of an allegedly constitutionally malapportioned \n     districting plan. According to the ACLU Report, ``On July 7, \n     1992, the district court, finding that the existing plan was \n     malapportioned, enjoined the July 1992, primary elections for \n     the board of commissioners and board of education until such \n     time as an election could be held under a court ordered or a \n     precleared plan.''\n       (19) Spaulding v. Telfair County: Civ. No. 386-061 (M.D. \n     Ga.) (ACLU Report at 431-33).\n       In September 1986, the ACLU filed suit on behalf of five \n     black voters alleging that \n     the county board of education was malapportioned. According \n     to the ACLU Report, ``On October 31, 1986, less than a week \n     before the November general election, the court entered a \n     consent order staying the elections, ordering a new \n     apportionment plan, and providing for a special election. The \n     court found that `Plaintiffs have established a prima facie \n     case that the current apportionment of the Board of Education \n     is in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment,' and required \n     the defendants to develop and implement a new apportionment \n     for the school board within 60 days.''\n       (20) Crisp v. Telfair County: CV 302-040 (S.D. Ga.) (ACLU \n     Report at 439-41).\n       The ACLU sued in August 2002, alleging that the county \n     commission lines were malapportioned in violation of the \n     Constitution and Section 2 of the VRA. According to the ACLU \n     Report, ``After plaintiffs filed suit, the county stipulated \n     that its commission districts were malapportioned, and that \n     `It is possible . . . to draw a five single member district \n     plan with at least one majority black district in Telfair \n     County.' The plaintiffs then filed for summary judgment and \n     asked the court to hold the existing plan unconstitutional \n     and order a new plan into effect. . . . Ruling that the \n     existing plan was malapportioned and `violates the one \n     person, one vote standard of the equal protection clause of \n     the Fourteenth Amendment,' the court noted that the plan had \n     been submitted for Section 5 preclearance and ruled the \n     motion for summary judgment was 'largely moot.' ''\n       (21) Holloway v. Terrell County Board of Commissioners: CA-\n     92-89-ALB/AMER(DF) (M.D. Ga.) (ACLU Report at 441-44).\n       In June 1992, the ACLU filed suit on behalf of black voters \n     challenging the malapportionment of the county board of \n     commissioners under the Constitution and Section 2 of the \n     VRA. According to the ACLU Report, ``After the \n     reapportionment suit was brought in 1992, defendants admitted \n     the plan was malapportioned. . . . The parties negotiated a \n     new redistricting plan, corrected the malapportionment, and \n     created two effective majority black districts. Despite this \n     agreement, the county proposed, and had the 1993 Georgia \n     General Assembly adopt, a redistricting plan which plaintiffs \n     did not support. . . . In February 1994, the Department of \n     Justice precleared the county's redistricting plan over the \n     objections of the black community. . . .''\n       (22) Flanders v. City of Soperton: Civ. No. 394-067 (S.D. \n     Ga.) (ACLU Report at 447-49).\n       According to the ACLU Report, ``in November 1994, the ACLU \n     again brought suit on behalf of black voters in Soperton, \n     challenging the five member city council as malapportioned in \n     violation of one person, one vote. . . . A consent order was \n     filed August 7, 1995, in which both parties agreed the city \n     election districts were malapportioned, and adopted a \n     districting plan with a total deviation of 6.8% that \n     contained two majority black districts of 75.34% and 72.92% \n     black voting age population, respectively.''\n\n[[Page S7955]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS20JY06.001\n     \n\n\n[[Page S7956]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS20JY06.002\n     \n\n\n[[Page S7957]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS20JY06.003\n     \n\n\n[[Page S7958]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS20JY06.004\n     \n\n\n[[Page S7959]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS20JY06.005\n     \n\n\n[[Page S7960]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS20JY06.006\n     \n\n\n[[Page S7961]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS20JY06.007\n     \n\n\n[[Page S7962]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS20JY06.008\n     \n\n\n[[Page S7963]]\n\n\n\n                                           MINORITY ELECTED OFFICIALS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   Citizen\n                               minority voting      Minority         Minority     Number minority     Minority\n            State               age population   percentage in    percentage in      officials     percentage in\n                                  percentage      State Senate     State House         (2001)        U.S. House\n                                (2000 Census)        (2005)           (2005)                         delegation\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama......................

Mr. President, it is with special thanks that I \nacknowledge Senator Leahy's leadership and cooperation, that I now \nyield to him.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President pro tempore, my dear friend, the senior \nSenator from Alaska, I see the majority leader on the floor. Is he \nseeking recognition?\n  Mr. FRIST. I will be making some comments, as I mentioned earlier, \nafter the distinguished ranking member.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, before I begin, I assume we will go back \nand forth, from side to side of the aisle on this. But as Democrats are \nrecognized, I ask it be in this order: Senator Kennedy for 20 minutes, \nSenator Durbin for 15, Senator Feinstein for up to 20 minutes, Senator \nSalazar for up to 15 minutes, as Democrats, are recognized. I ask \nunanimous consent to that.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate what the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania said. Senator Specter and I have been friends for many \nyears. I think we have accomplished a great deal in the Judiciary \nCommittee. I agree with him this is the most important thing we will \ndo. But I might also note, on a personal note about the Senator from \nPennsylvania, much of what was accomplished during that time he was \nfighting a very serious illness. I compliment the Senator from \nPennsylvania for his perseverance during that time.\n  The Voting Rights Act is the cornerstone of our civil rights laws. We \nhonor those who fought through the years for equality by extending the \nVoting Rights Act to ensure their struggles are not forsaken and not \nforgotten, and that the progress we have made not be sacrificed. We \nhonor their legacy by reaffirming our commitment to protect the right \nto vote for all Americans.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts, who is on the \nfloor, was in the forefront of this battle the first time around. He \nand his family, his late brothers, the President and brother Senator \nRobert Kennedy--President Kennedy, Senator Robert Kennedy, and now \nSenator Edward Kennedy, have been in the forefront of the civil rights \nbattle. This has been a personal thing for them. It has been a \ncommitment that has spoken to the conscience of our Nation, and I \napplaud my friend from Massachusetts for what he and has family have \ndone.\n  Reauthorizing and restoring the Voting Rights Act is the right thing \nto do, not only for those who came before--the brave and visionary \npeople who fought for equality, some at great personal sacrifice, some \neven giving their lives--but also for those who come after us, our \nchildren and our grandchildren. All of our children, all of our \ngrandchildren, should know that their right to vote will not be \nabridged, suppressed or denied in the United States of America, no \nmatter their color, no matter their race, no matter what part of the \ncountry from which they come.\n  I do thank the chairman for following the suggestion to convene the \nJudiciary Committee yesterday in special session to consider what \nreally is bipartisan, bicameral legislation to reauthorize the Voting \nRights Act. In fact, our Senate bill, S. 2703, is cosponsored by the \ndistinguished Republican leader and the distinguished Democratic \nleader, by a bipartisan majority of the Judiciary Committee and by a \nbipartisan majority of the Senate. In fact, at the end of our committee \nmeeting yesterday, we had a rollcall vote. We voted unanimously to \nreport our bill favorably to the Senate.\n  I mention that because so many of the things that have to go through \nthe Judiciary Committee tend to be of a divisive nature. This was a \nunanimous vote. I have commended all those in the Judiciary Committee \nwho worked so hard over the last several months to build a fair and \nextensive record and bring us to this point today. As I said earlier, I \ncommend Senator Kennedy for his work. I agree with Senator Specter, \nwhen he gets passionate about a subject he doesn't need a microphone.\n  I commend those who started with doubts--and there were serious \ndoubts; some regional, some for legal matters. But those who had doubts \nhave now come around to supporting our bipartisan bill.\n  Because the bill we take up today and the bill from the committee to \nreport are so similar, I know the Senate debate will be informed by the \nextensive record we have built before the Judiciary Committee. Over the \nlast 4 months, we held nine hearings on all\n\n[[Page S7964]]\n\naspects of this matter and on the overall bill itself. In another \nindication of bipartisanship, those hearings were chaired by large \nnumbers of members of the committee and chaired by both Republican and \nDemocratic Senators who wanted to send a signal that this is not a \npartisan matter.\n  All of those hearings were fairly conducted. Those Senate hearings \nsupplement those held in the House on this matter. Indeed, our first \nhearing was held for the express purpose of hearing from the lead \nsponsors from the House and to receive the results of their hearings \ninto our Senate Record. In fact, in anticipation of this bill coming to \nthe floor, I have included statements in the Record in the course of \nthis week to help make sure we have a complete record before the Senate \nbefore we vote. For example, on Tuesday, my statement focused on the \ncontinuing need for Section 5. On Wednesday, my statement focused on \nthe continuing need for Section 203. They reflect my views as the lead \nDemocratic Senate sponsor.\n  We have fewer than two dozen legislative days left in this session of \nCongress, so I appreciate the willingness of the Republican and \nDemocratic leadership to take up this important measure without delay. \nI know the House of Representatives had to delay consideration of the \nVoting Act for a month due to the recalcitrance of some, recalcitrance \nthat was overwhelmed in their vote. Here, I hope we do not suffer the \nsame delay. This is a time for us to debate, consider, and vote on this \nimportant legislation. We should pass the bill in the same form as the \nHouse so it can be signed into law before the Senate recesses for the \nremainder of the summer.\n\n  There has been speculation about why we are here today. Some tied it \nto the fact that for the first time in his Presidency, President Bush \nis going to appear before the National Association for the Advancement \nof Colored People, the NAACP. I, for one, applaud him for going before \nthe NAACP. All Presidents should, Republican or Democrat. And in fact, \nif that had anything to do with the success in getting this bill moved \nexpeditiously through the Senate, I have a number of other \norganizations I hope will invite him to get other legislation moving.\n  The House-passed bill and the committee-reported bill is very \nsimilar. We introduced them in a bipartisan, bicameral, coordinated \neffort in May. The only change made to the House-passed bill was the \ninclusion of a governmental study added in the House Judiciary \nCommittee. I urge the Senate to accept that addition.\n  The only change made during the Senate Judiciary Committee was to add \nan Hispanic civil rights leader to the roster of the civil rights \nleaders for whom the bill is named. We did this at the suggestion of \nSenator Salazar. It is a good suggestion. We did this unanimously. I \ncommend the Senator for it. As Senator Salazar has reminded us, ``Cesar \nChavez is an American hero. He sacrificed his life to empower the most \nvulnerable in America. He believed strongly in the democracy of America \nand saw the right to vote as a cornerstone of our freedom.'' I offered \nthe amendment in the Judiciary Committee and it was adopted without \ndissent.\n  I told Senator Salazar that I recall the dinner with Marcelle and \nmyself, our son Kevin and his wife Carolyn, and our granddaughter \nFrancesca in the small Italian restaurant, Sarduccis, in Montpelier, \nVermont. A family next to us came over to introduce themselves. It was \nCesar Chavez's son. He apologized for interrupting our dinner. He \nwanted to say hello. I told him how proud I was to be interrupted and \nto meet him because his father had been a hero of mine. They were in \nVermont because they were going to the Barre Quarry where the memorial \nto his father was carved.\n  I have also consulted with Senator Salazar. Neither of us wants to \ncomplicate final passage of the Voting Rights Act so I urge the Senate \nto proceed to the House-passed bill and resist amendments so it can be \nsigned into law without having to be reconsidered by the House. With \nrespect to the short title of the bill and the roster of civil rights \nleaders honored, I have committed to work with Senator Salazar to \nconform the law to include due recognition of the contribution to our \ncivil rights and voting rights by Cesar Chavez in follow up \nlegislation.\n  The Voting Rights Act reauthorization is named for three very \nimportant civil rights leaders, as the Senator from Pennsylvania \npointed out.\n  Fannie Lou Hamer was a courageous advocate for the right to vote. She \nrisked her life to secure the right to vote for all Americans. Coretta \nScott King was a tenacious fighter for equality for the civil rights \nmovement in the 1960s, and right up to the time of her passing. Many of \nus in this Chamber met the late Mrs. King. Everyone in the Senate can \nremember when less than a year ago the body of Rosa Parks lay in state \nin the Capitol. She was the first African American woman in our history \nto be so honored. She was honored because of her dignified refusal to \nbe treated as a second-class citizen sparked the Montgomery bus \nboycotts that are often cited as the symbolic beginning of the modern \ncivil rights movement.\n  Everyone in this Chamber would be horrified to think that somebody \nwould be treated differently because of the color of their skin, but in \nthe lifetime of every Senator sitting in this Chamber today, we have \nseen such discrimination. Let's make sure we take this step. It will \nnot remove all discrimination, by any means, but it is a major step to \nlet everyone in the country know that all of us are equal as Americans \nwith equal rights, despite the color of our skin.\n  Last week, after months of work, the House of Representatives, led by \nCongressmen John Conyers, Mel Watt, John Lewis, and Chairman \nSensenbrenner, rejected all efforts to reduce the sweep and effect of \nthe Voting Rights Act. Congressman John Lewis--himself a courageous \nleader during those transformational struggles only decades ago, a man \nwho was nearly killed trying to retain the rights of African Americans, \nsaid during the House debate:\n\n       When historians pick up their pens and write about this \n     period, let it be said that those of us in the Congress in \n     2006, we did the right thing. And our forefathers and our \n     foremothers would be very proud of us. Let us pass a clean \n     bill without any amendments.\n\n  That is my friend John Lewis from the House of Representatives. I \nwant our foremothers and forefathers to be proud of us, but I want our \nchildren and our grandchildren to be proud of us, too.\n  The bill we are considering in the Senate today passed the other body \nwith 390 votes in favor. In fact, the other body rejected all four \namendments offered. They wanted to have a clean bill. They listened to \nJohn Lewis. They listened to the others. I congratulate the House \ncosponsors, both Republicans and Democrats, for their successful \nefforts. I hope we can repeat them in the Senate.\n  On May 2, when our congressional leadership joined together on the \nsteps of the Capitol to announce a bipartisan and bicameral \nintroduction of the Voting Rights Act, it was a historic announcement. \nI noted in my journal it was one of the proudest moments I had in my \nyears in the Senate, an occasion almost unprecedented during the recent \nyears of partisanship.\n  Let's not relent in our fight for the fundamental civil rights of all \nAmericans. Working together, we should pass a clean bipartisan voting \nrights bill. Congress has reauthorized and revitalized the act four \ntimes, each time with overwhelming bipartisan support, pursuant to our \nconstitutional powers. This is not a time for backsliding. This is a \ntime to move forward together.\n  So let us unite to renew this cornerstone, let us rededicate \nourselves to its noble purpose, and let us commemorate the many who \nsuffered and endured to bring our cherished ideals closer to reality \nfor millions of our fellow Americans. Let us guarantee those rights for \nmillions of our fellow Americans to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it was about 3 weeks ago that I joined \nPresident Bush on a trip to Memphis, TN, where we were joined by a \nclose personal friend of mine, a man who is legendary in Tennessee and, \nindeed, throughout the country, the Rev. Dr. Ben Hooks.\n  Dr. Hooks is a widely recognized, widely acknowledged champion of \ncivil\n\n[[Page S7965]]\n\nrights. He presided with great courage and bold vision over the NAACP \nfor 15 years as its executive director. He is in town this week for the \nNAACP meeting which is going on as I speak.\n  He guided President Bush and myself, my wife Karyn, and the First \nLady through the remarkable and inspiring National Civil Rights Museum \nwhich has been constructed at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, which was \nthe actual site of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination. It was an \ninspiring visit, those moments as we walked through the exhibits, room \nto room, in that wonderful museum.\n  In many ways, it shook my own conscience. To hear Dr. Hooks speak, to \nhear him recount the events surrounding that time, was to have history \ncome alive. It was an ugly moment in our collective history, and \ncertainly not America's finest hour.\n  As we wandered through those rooms, listening to those words of Dr. \nHooks, what struck my conscience most was how we as a Nation pushed \nthrough that time, how we as a Nation persevered to correct injustice \njust as we have at other points in American history.\n  It reminded me of our ability to change, that when our laws become \ndestructive to our unalienable rights--life, liberty, the pursuit of \nhappiness--it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it.\n  It reminded me of the importance, the absolute necessity, of ensuring \nthe permanence of the changes we make, the permanence of our \ncorrections to injustice.\n  About 2 years ago, in the spring of 2004, Senator McConnell and I \ncame to the Senate and offered an amendment to extend the expiring \nprovisions of the Voting Rights Act permanently. However, at the \ninsistence of a number of my colleagues we withdrew our amendment, \nwhile making clear that we were absolutely committed to renewing this \nimportant piece of legislation. Indeed, that day has come.\n  A few months ago, I stood with Speaker Hastert, Chairman Specter, and \nChairman Sensenbrenner on the steps of the Capitol where we reaffirmed \nat that time our commitment to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act. Thus, \nI am pleased this Congress will act to reauthorize the Voting Rights \nAct and, indeed, today, right now, the United States is doing just \nthat.\n  We expedited it through committee under the leadership of Chairman \nSpecter so we could bring it to the Senate as quickly as possible. We \nwill complete that action in a few hours today.\n  Today the Senate is standing together to protect the right to vote \nfor all Americans. We stand together, putting aside partisan \ndifferences, to ensure discrimination at the voting booth remains a \nrelic of the past. We are working for a day when equality is more than \na principle upon which our laws are founded, a day when equality is a \nreality by which our society is defined. We are working for the day \nwhen our equality, our oneness, is reflected not only in our laws but \nin the hearts and minds of every American.\n  I hope and pray the day will come when racism and discrimination are \nonly a part of our past and not our present.\n  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 enshrined fair voting practices for all \nAmericans. The act reaffirmed the 15th amendment to the Constitution, \nwhich says that:\n\n       . . . the right of citizens of the United States to vote \n     shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by \n     any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of \n     servitude.\n\n  The Voting Rights Act ensured that no American citizen and no \nelection law of any State could deny access to the ballot box because \nof race, ethnicity, or language minority status. It took much courage \nand sacrifice to make that original Voting Rights Act into law, the \ncourage and sacrifice of leaders such as Rosa Parks, Martin Luther \nKing, Jr., Congressman John Lewis, to name a few.\n  They paved the way to end discrimination and open the voting booths \nfor millions of African Americans and other minorities who were \npreviously denied the right to vote.\n  In the 41 years--yes, it has been 41 years--since then, we have made \ntremendous progress. Thousands upon thousands of minorities have \nregistered to vote. Minorities have been elected to hold office at the \nlocal level, at the State level, and the Federal level in increasing \nnumbers.\n  In short, the Voting Rights Act has worked. It has achieved its \nintended purpose. We need to build upon that progress by extending \nexpiring provisions of the Voting Rights Act today.\n  We owe it to the memories of those who fought before us, to those \npeople who, right now, are reflected in those words of Dr. Hooks that \nwe heard as we traveled through that Civil Rights Museum, and we owe it \nto our future--a future where equality is a reality, a reality in our \nhearts and in our minds, not just the law--to reauthorize the Voting \nRights Act.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in voting for this critical \nlegislation. I look forward to the President signing it into law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Voting Rights \nAct, and I thank my colleague from Massachusetts who was here before me \nfor allowing me to now speak briefly on this particular issue.\n  The right to vote is quite literally the bedrock of the \nrepresentative democracy we enjoy today. We must enable American \ncitizens to fully participate in the political process if we are to \ntruly be a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. \nIt is central, and it is central that everybody is given that right in \nequal regard.\n  The importance of the Voting Rights Act cannot be underestimated. It \nhas transformed the face of our Republic and vindicated the noble \nvalues of our Nation. America has come a long way in the last four \ndecades, and it is my hope that the reauthorization of the Voting \nRights Act will help us to continue to extend the promise of democratic \nparticipation to every American.\n  I have had the chance, twice now, to do the civil rights pilgrimage \nthat the Faith in Politics group has sponsored to Selma, AL, to \nMontgomery, to several different places, and to hear from the firsthand \nexperiences of individuals who were involved in the civil rights \nmovement and in the freedom trails of the bus rides and in the \nprotests, about the importance that the VRA was to them, was to getting \ninvolved, and is central in getting everybody participating in the \ndemocracy and a true opportunity to register to vote and to actually \nvote. It was and is critical. It is critical that we extend it.\n  I also want to recognize and thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nthe central role his family has played in fighting for this particular \nlanguage, this legislation. And it is important.\n  Out of a strong desire to achieve this goal of everybody \nparticipating equally in this democracy, a bipartisan majority of \nCongress passed, and President Johnson signed, the Voting Rights Act of \n1965. The aim of the act two generations ago was to fulfill the \ndemocratic promise of the Civil War amendments to the Constitution--a \npromise left unmet for a century after that terrible war had ended.\n  The civil rights landscape has greatly improved in the country since \n1965, thanks in great part to the Voting Rights Act. The act has \nresulted in a tremendous increase in the ability of minority citizens \nto fully and fairly participate in our political system, both as voters \nand as candidates. The number of minority legislators has grown \nsubstantially.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the pending Voting Rights Act \nreauthorization bill which the Judiciary Committee reported out \nunanimously yesterday. This bill recognizes the achievements of many \nand particularly of three champions of the civil rights era: Fannie Lou \nHamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King. I believe we have a \nresponsibility to carry on the work of these great Americans by \nreauthorizing the expiring sections of the Voting Rights Act.\n  The bill does provide a flat bar to unconstitutional racial \ndiscrimination. It speaks clearly, aggressively, eloquently, and \nimportantly on this topic. We cannot have racial discrimination in this \ncountry, period. We are extending this act. It is an important act. It \nis one that has helped make the values of democracy real on a tangible \nbasis to individuals, and it is important that we extend it into the \nfuture.\n\n[[Page S7966]]\n\n  Mr. President, I am delighted to be a cosponsor of this bill. I urge \nmy colleagues to pass it. I believe it will pass overwhelmingly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is an historic day. In the quietness \nof the moment, on the floor of the Senate, we are talking about a major \npiece of legislation that is basic to the fabric of what America is all \nabout. But the quietness does not belie the fact that this is a \nmomentous piece of legislation that marks the continuation of this \nNation as a true democracy.\n  I want, at the outset, to commend my friends and leaders on the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Specter and Senator Leahy. I can remember \ntalking with both of them early on about putting this on the Senate \nagenda, putting it on the Judiciary Committee agenda. There are not two \nMembers of this body who are more committed to this legislation than \nChairman Specter and Senator Leahy.\n  We are here today because of their leadership and their strong \ncommitment to the concept of making sure that America is going to be \nAmerica by insisting on the extension of this voting rights \nlegislation. They have both been tireless during the course of the \nseries of hearings that we have held. They have been meticulous in \nterms of determining the witnesses that we would have and in building \nthe legislative record, which is so important and of such great \nconsequence in terms of maintaining the constitutionality of this \nlegislation, which is, of course, so important. So I thank both of them \nfor their leadership and their generous references earlier during their \nstatements.\n  Mr. President, the Constitution of the United States is an \nextraordinary document, the greatest charter that has ever been written \nin terms of preserving the rights and liberties of the people. Still, \nslavery was enshrined in the Constitution. And this country has had a \nchallenging time freeing itself from the legacy of slavery. We had a \ndifficult time in fighting the great Civil War. And we have had a \nchallenging time freeing ourselves from discrimination--all forms of \ndiscrimination--but particularly racial discrimination. And we had a \ndifficult time, particularly in the early 1960s, in passing \nlegislation--legislation which could be enormously valuable in freeing \na country from the stains of discrimination. But it takes much more \nthan just legislation to achieve that.\n  I was fortunate enough to be here at the time we passed the 1964 \ncivil rights bill that dealt with what we call public accommodations. \nIt is difficult to believe that people were denied access to public \naccommodations--the ability to go to hotels, restaurants, and other \nplaces because of the color of their skin--in the United States of \nAmerica. Mr. President, this legislation was debated for 10 months. Not \njust 1 day, as we all have today on voting rights, but for 10 months, \nthe Senate was in session as we faced a filibuster on that legislation.\n  Then, finally, Senator Everett Dirksen responded to the very eloquent \npleas of President Johnson at that time and indicated that he was \nprepared to move the legislation forward and make some adjustments in \nthe legislation. We were able to come to an agreement, and the law went \ninto effect.\n  In 1965, we had hours and hours and hours and hours during the course \nof the markup of the Voting Rights Act, and hours and hours and hours \non the floor of the Senate to pass that legislation, with amendment \nafter amendment after amendment. We were ultimately successful. And \njust off the Senate Chamber, in the President's Room--just a few yards \nfrom where I am standing today--President Johnson signed that \nlegislation.\n  Now, we continue the process. It has not always been easy during the \ncontinuation and the reauthorization of the Act. Rarely have we been as \nfortunate as we are today with the time agreement and an understanding \nthat we will consider this and finalize it this evening, in a way that \nwill avoid a contentious conference with the House of Representatives \nthat could have gone on for weeks and even months, as we've seen in the \npast. This legislation will go to the President's desk, and he will \nsign it.\n  There is no subject matter that brings out emotions like the issue of \ncivil rights. That is, perhaps, understandable. But it is still very \ntrue. No issue that we debate--health care, education, increasing the \nminimum wage, age discrimination, environmental questions--whatever \nthose matters are, nothing brings out the emotions like civil rights \nlegislation.\n  But here we have a very important piece of civil rights legislation \nthat is going to be favorably considered, and I will speak about that \nin just a few moments. We have to understand, as important as this \nlegislation is, it really is not worth the paper it is printed on \nunless it is going to be enforced. That is enormously important. As we \npass this legislation and we talk about its importance, and the \nimportance of its various provisions, we have to make sure we have an \nadministration and a Justice Department that is going to enforce it. \nThat has not always been the case.\n  Secondly, it is enormously important that we have judges who \ninterpret the legislation the way we intended for it to be interpreted.\n  We have, in this situation, a bipartisan interpretation. We have a \nbicameral interpretation. There should be no reason that any court in \nthis country--particularly a Supreme Court that is looking over its \nprovisions--should not understand very clearly what we intended, the \nconstitutional basis for it. We need judges who are going to interpret \nthis in good faith. That has not always been the case, and I will \nreference that in terms of my comments.\n  Then, we have to make sure we have a process and system so that, even \nif we have the legislation, and even if we have a Justice Department \ncorrectly interpret it, and even if we have judges correctly interpret \nit, we have to make sure there are not going to be other interferences \nwith any individuals' ability to vote. That is another subject for \nanother time, but enormously important.\n  We need all of those factors, at least, to make sure that this basic \nand fundamental right, which is so important, and which we are \naddressing today, is actually going to be achieved and accomplished for \nour fellow citizens.\n  Mr. President, we are, as I mentioned, poised to take another \nhistoric step in America's journey toward becoming the land of its \nideals. As we all know, the battle for racial equality in America is \nfar from over. The landmark civil rights laws that we have passed in \nthe past four decades have provided a legal foundation, but the full \npromise of these laws has yet to be fulfilled.\n  Literacy tests may no longer block access to the ballot box, but we \ncannot ignore the fact that discrimination is sometimes as plain as \never, and that more subtle forms of discrimination are plotted in back \nrooms, to be imposed by manipulating redistricting boundaries to dilute \nminority voting strength, or by systematic strategies on election day \nto discourage minority voting.\n  The persistence of overt and more subtle discrimination makes it \nmandatory that we reauthorize the expiring provisions of the Voting \nRights Act. This act is perhaps Congress's greatest contribution to the \nmarch toward equality in our society. As Martin Luther King, Jr., said, \nvoting is ``civil right number one.'' It is the right in our democracy \nthat preserves all others. So long as the vote is available and freely \nexercised by our entire citizenry, this Nation will remain strong and \nour other rights will be protected.\n  For nearly a century, the 15th amendment guaranteed that ``the right \nof citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or \nabridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, \ncolor, or previous condition of servitude,'' but it took the Voting \nRights Act of 1965 to breathe life into that basic guarantee. And it \ntook the actions of many brave men and women, such as those who \ngathered at the Edmund Pettis Bridge and faced the shameful violence of \nthose who would deny them the right to vote, before the Nation finally \nacted.\n  I'm honored to have fought in the Senate for the Voting Rights Act \neach time it was before Congress--from its historic passage in 1965 to \nthe votes to extend the act in 1970, 1975, and 1982\n\n[[Page S7967]]\n\nand to strengthen it along the way. I recall watching President Lyndon \nBaines Johnson sign the 1965 act just off this chamber in the \nPresident's Room. We knew that day that we had changed the country \nforever. And indeed we had. In 1965, there were only three African \nAmerican and three Latino Members of Congress. Today, there are 41 \nAfrican-American Members in the House of Representatives, one African-\nAmerican Senator, 22 Latino House Members, and two Latino Senators. \nThese gains would not have been possible without the Voting Rights Act.\n  I recall extending the expiring provisions of the act in 1970. I \nremember extending it again in 1975, and adding protections for \ncitizens who needed language assistance. We recognized that those \nvoters warranted assistance because unequal education resulted in high \nrates of illiteracy and low rates of voter participation in those \npopulations.\n  And I recall well extending the act again in 1982. That time, we \nextended the expiring provisions of the act for 25 years and \nstrengthened it by overturning the Supreme Court's decision in Mobile \nv. Bolden. That decision weakened the act by imposing an intent \nstandard pursuant to section 2 of the act, but despite the opposition \nof President Reagan and his Department of Justice, we were able to \nrestore the act's vitality by replacing that standard with a results \ntest that provides greater protection for victims of discriminatory \ntreatment.\n  Finally, in 1992, we revisited the act to extend and broaden its \ncoverage of individuals whose English language ability is insufficient \nto allow them to participate fully in our democratic system.\n  In memory of Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King, Jr. \nand Coretta Scott King, and Cesar Chavez, I feel privileged to have the \nopportunity to support extension of the act once again for another 25 \nyears.\n  Some have questioned whether there is still a need for the act's \nexpiring provisions. They even argue that discrimination in voting is a \nthing of the past, and that we are relying on decades-old \ndiscrimination to stigmatize certain areas of the country today.\n  I have heard the evidence presented over the past several months of \nhearings, and I can tell you that they are just plain wrong. Yes, we \nhave made progress that was almost unimaginable in 1965. But the goal \nof the Voting Rights Act was to have full and equal access for every \nAmerican regardless of race. We have not achieved that goal.\n  In considering this bill, the Senate Judiciary Committee has held \nnine hearings and heard from some 46 witnesses. In addition, we have \nreceived numerous written statements and have voluminous reports from a \nvariety of groups that have examined the state of voting rights in our \nNation. We have explored every aspect of the expiring provisions of the \nact, and have all come to one inescapable conclusion: continuing \ndiscrimination requires that we pass this bill and reauthorize the \nVoting Rights Act. The evidence demonstrates that far too many \nAmericans still face barriers because of their race, their ethnic \nbackground or their language minority status.\n  Section 5 is the centerpiece of the expiring provisions of the act. \nIt requires that covered jurisdictions preclear voting changes with the \nDepartment of Justice or the District Court in the District of Columbia \nby proving that the changes do not have a retrogressive purpose or \neffect. The act would reverse the second Bossier Parish decision and \nrestore the section 5 standard to its original meaning by making it \nclear that a discriminatory purpose will prevent section 5 \npreclearance. Even under the weaker standard that has governed since \nthe Bossier decision, the Department of Justice has had to object to \negregious discriminatory practices.\n  The act as reauthorized also overturns the Supreme Court's decision \nin Georgia v. Ashcroft, restoring section 5's protection of voting \ndistricts where minority voters have an ability to elect their \npreferred candidates. This revision would preclude jurisdictions from \nreplacing districts in which minority voters have the voting power to \nelect their preferred candidates with districts in which minority \nvoters merely exercise influence.\n  The number of objections under section 5 has remained large since we \nlast reauthorized the act in 1982. Astonishingly, Professor Anita Earls \nof the University of North Carolina Law School testified that between \n1982 and 2004, the Department of Justice lodged 682 section 5 \nobjections in covered jurisdictions compared with only 481 objections \nprior to 1982. In Mississippi alone, the Department of Justice objected \nto 120 voting changes since 1982. This number is roughly double the \nnumber of objections made before 1982.\n  Behind these statistics are stories of the voters who were able to \nparticipate in the political process because the Voting Rights Act \nprotects their fundamental right to do so. For example, in 2001, the \ntown of Kilmichael, MS, cancelled its elections just three weeks before \nelection day. The Justice Department objected to the cancellation, \nfinding that the town failed to establish that its actions were not \nmotivated by the discriminatory purpose of preventing African-American \nvoters from electing candidates of their choice. The town had recently \nbecome majority African-American and, for the first time in its \nhistory, several African-American candidates had a good chance of \nwinning elected office. Section 5 prevented this discriminatory change \nfrom being implemented, and as a result, three African-American \ncandidates were elected to the board of aldermen and an African-\nAmerican was elected mayor for the first time.\n  Consider the Dinwiddie County Board of Supervisors in Virginia. It \nmoved a polling place from a club with a large African-American \nmembership to a white church on the other side of town, under the \npretext that the church was more centrally located. We saw this tactic \nwhen we renewed the act in 1970. We didn't expect to see it again in on \nthe eve of the 21st century, but we did.\n  Some have argued that there has been a drop in the number of \nobjections in recent years. As the record shows, that decline is \nexplained by a number of reasons. First, of course, was the Supreme \nCourt's restrictive interpretation of the purpose standard, which we \nwill correct today. In addition, the numbers do not account for \nproposed changes that are rejected by the district court or proposed \nchanges that are withdrawn once the Department of Justice asks for more \ninformation or litigation begins in the District Court. Equally as \nimportant are the discriminatory changes the act has deterred covered \njurisdictions from ever enacting, and the dialog the act promotes \nbetween local election officials and minority community leaders to \nensure consideration of minority communities' concerns in the \nlegislative process.\n  And, of course, there are matters that merit objection, but have been \nprecleared by the Bush Department of Justice because the Department's \npolitical leadership refused to follow the recommendations of career \nexperts.\n  The Department twice precleared Georgia's effort to impose a photo \nidentification requirement for voting. The first time, the district \ncourt threw it out as an unconstitutional poll tax. That's right, a \npoll tax in 2006. In 1965, we fought the poll tax during the debate of \nthe original Voting Rights Act. After the Supreme Court ultimately held \nit unconstitutional, we thought this shameful practice had ended. But \nthe court found that the Georgia law was just a 21st century version of \nthis old evil.\n  Georgia reenacted the law without the poll tax, and the Court still \nfound that it unlawfully disadvantaged poor and minority voters, who \nare less likely to have the required identification.\n  Recently, the Supreme Court held that the Texas Legislature had \nviolated the Voting Rights Act by shifting 100,000 Latino voters out of \na district just as they were about to defeat an incumbent and finally \nelect a candidate of their choice. Once again, section 5 would have \nblocked this practice, but the leadership of the Department of Justice \noverruled career experts who recommended an objection.\n  The fact that the number of section 5 objections is a small \npercentage of the total number of submissions shouldn't be surprising. \nJurisdictions take section 5 into consideration when adopting voting \nchanges and many day-to-day changes are noncontroversial. What should \nsurprise and concern us is\n\n[[Page S7968]]\n\nthe fact that there continue to be objections and voting changes like \nthe ones that I have described.\n  It has also been argued that the section 5 coverage formula is both \nover and under-inclusive. The act addresses that problem by permitting \njurisdictions where Federal oversight is no longer warranted to ``bail \nout'' from coverage under section 5. We have letters from two of the \njurisdictions that have taken advantage of the bailout process \nexplaining that they did not find that process to be onerous. So far, \nevery jurisdiction that has sought a bailout has succeeded. For \njurisdictions that should be covered but aren't, the act contains a \nmechanism by which a court may order a non-covered jurisdiction found \nto have violated the 14th or 15th amendments to obtain section 5 \npreclearance for its voting changes. As a result, the act's \npreclearance requirement applies only to jurisdiction where there is a \nneed for such oversight.\n  The act will also reauthorize the provisions of the act that mandate \nthe provision of election assistance in minority languages. In the \ncourse of our consideration of this bill, we heard substantial evidence \ndemonstrating that these provisions are still necessary. The original \nrationale for enactment of these provisions was twofold. First, there \nare many Americans who speak languages other than English, many of whom \nare United States citizens by birth--including Native Americans, Alaska \nNatives, and Puerto Ricans. These Americans should not be denied the \nopportunity to be full participants in our democracy because of the \nlanguages they speak. They know they need to learn English to succeed \nin this country. That's why classes to learn English are oversubscribed \nall over the country.\n  Additionally, Congress concluded that many Americans--including \nNative Americans, Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, and Hispanic \nAmericans--suffer from inadequate educational opportunities that deny \nthem the opportunity to master English at a sufficient level to fully \nunderstand electoral issues and cast meaningful ballots. The nationwide \nstatistics illustrate the problem. Only 75 percent of Alaska Natives \ncomplete high school, compared to 90 percent of non-Natives, and only \n52 percent of all Hispanic Americans have a high school diploma, \ncompared to over 80 percent of all Americans. We heard testimony that \nwhile many of these people may speak conversational English, they have \nbeen denied the educational instruction--often as a result of \nintentional discrimination--that would allow them to understand complex \nelectoral issues and technical voting terminology in English alone.\n  Finally, it is crucial that we extend the guarantees of all of the \ntemporary provisions of the act for 25 years. Twenty-five years is not \na long time when compared to the centuries of oppression that the law \nis intended to overcome. While we have made enormous progress, it takes \ntime to overcome the deep-seated patterns of behavior that have denied \nminorities full access to the ballot. Indeed, the worst thing we could \ndo would be to allow that progress to slip away because we ended the \ncure too soon. We know that the act is having an impact. We know that \nit is deterring discrimination. And we know that despite the act, \nracial bloc voting and other forms of discrimination continue to tilt \nthe playing field for minority voters and candidates. We need to ensure \nthat jurisdictions know that the act will be in force for a \nsufficiently long period that they cannot simply wait for its \nexpiration, but must eliminate discrimination root and branch.\n  The time has come to renew the Voting Rights Act. This historic piece \nof legislation renews our commitment to the fundamental values of \nAmerica. It ensures that all of our citizens will have the right to \nplay an effective role in our governance. It continues us down the path \ntoward a democracy free of the blight of discrimination based on race, \nethnicity and language. As Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said: ``The time \nis always right to do what is right.'' The right thing to do is to pass \nthis bill and the time to do it is now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise as a Senator from Georgia to \nexpress my support and join a unanimous Senate in support for extension \nof the Voting Rights Act. I come to the well to speak from a different \nperspective than some. I was born in the South in 1944, educated in its \npublic schools in the 1950s and 1960s. I was in the fourth grade when \nBrown v. Board of Education was the ruling of the Supreme Court. I was \nin high school when the public schools of Atlanta were integrated. I \nwent to the University of Georgia when the first students integrated \nthat institution. I lived through all the changes that many refer to as \nhistory about which they have read.\n  I lived through it, being there and seeing the heroes and the \nchallenges and the transition through which the South has gone. Still, \nin speeches today we hear very often about the South in historic times, \nwhere wrong practices have been righted, but somehow we don't hear \nabout the heroes who made the Voting Rights Act go from a piece of \npaper and a law to practical reality in the South.\n  I am proud of so many citizens in Georgia, Black and White, urban and \nrural, Republican and Democrat, who over the past 41 years have made \nnot only the letter of that law but the spirit of that law the spirit \nof our State--not the least of whom is Congressman John Lewis, a man of \nunquestioned character and, for anyone who lived during the 1960s and \n1950s, unquestioned courage. He and I are of different races and \ndifferent political persuasions, but he is a man whose courage and \nconviction I honor and pay tribute to.\n  Mayor Ivan Allen, Jr., was a White mayor of Atlanta in the 1960s \nwhose actions would see to it that the actions passed in Congress were \nmade a reality smoothly in the city, which gained the reputation of a \ncity too busy to hate. We made a transition in a difficult time. We \nrighted difficult wrongs. We made the letter of the law the spirit of \nthe law.\n  Andrew Young, the first African-American mayor of Atlanta, in \nfollowing Sam Massell, who followed Ivan Allen, ensured that those \ntransitions continued in the 1980s, and that voting rights and all \nrights were the primary responsibility of our government and its \nleadership.\n  Carl Sanders, the Governor of Georgia, probably lost his chance at a \nsecond term because of his courageous stance on behalf of seeing to it \nthat the South continued to make progress.\n  Joe Frank Harris, from rural Georgia, who was Governor in the 1980s, \ncontinued in tandem with Andrew Young to see to it that our capital \ncity and State remained committed to all of the provisions of equality \nin our society.\n  The attorneys general in this issue are so important. Republican Mike \nBowers, during many years of service to our State as attorney general, \ntime and again saw to it that what was intended by the Voting Rights \nAct was the practice in our State.\n  Our current attorney general today, an African American, Thurbert \nBaker, is a tribute to the progress our State has made and is an \noutspoken defender of the Voting Rights Act and our State's intention \nto ensure that all of Georgia's legal residents, regardless of race or \nethnicity, have the right to vote.\n  A great Senator, Sam Nunn, served in this Senate, whose office I hold \nnow downstairs. Sam Nunn, during the years of the 1970s and 1980s and \nearly 1990s, was a steadfast beacon of support for ensuring that we \ncontinued the spirit and the letter of the Voting Rights Act.\n  The late Senator Paul Coverdell, a Republican from Georgia, in his \nterm in the Georgia legislature in the House and Senate, over 20 years \nof service, fought tirelessly to ensure that our State delivered on the \nguarantee of the right to vote for all Georgians.\n  As we reflect on the true wrongs that existed in the 1950s and 1960s, \nand where those wrongs may have taken place, we owe it to history and \nto the credit of these great individuals to pay tribute to those who \ntook the law and made it a reality. I am proud of my State. I am proud \nof the transition it has made. I pay tribute to its leaders.\n\n  My vote today in favor of the extension of the Voting Rights Act is \nin equal parts a commitment to that end and a tribute to those \nGeorgians who made the Voting Rights Act a reality in my State.\n\n[[Page S7969]]\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the right of a citizen to vote is the \nmost basic right in any democracy. At the signing of the Voting Rights \nAct in 1965 in this very Capitol Rotunda, the President of the United \nStates, Lyndon Johnson, said these words:\n\n       The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by \n     man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible \n     walls which imprison men because they are different from \n     other men.\n\n  The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a critical breakthrough in the \nstruggle for civil rights. However, the Voting Rights Act, which came \nthe next year, 1965, is considered the most important and successful \ncivil rights law of the 20th century, because it finally ensured every \nvoting-age citizen of this Nation a voice in his or her own fate.\n  The passage of the 14th amendment in 1868 and the passage of the 15th \namendment in 1870 both prohibited disenfranchisement on the basis of \nrace. But in the absence of legislative protection for the right to \nvote, that right was systematically denied to millions of African \nAmericans for nearly a century. Similarly, Mexican Americans, Asian \nAmericans, Native Americans, and Alaskan Natives were excluded from the \nballot box through an assortment of voting tests and intimidation.\n  We are all here today because of the courage and persistence of the \ncivil rights leaders of the last century, who fought so long and hard \nto attain the franchise the Constitution had already granted them.\n  Several of these heroes are memorialized in the title of this bill: \nFannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, Coretta Scott King, and Cesar Chavez. All \nof us owe them a debt of gratitude.\n  On this day, I am also mindful of the contributions Californians have \nmade in the civil rights battles. Let me share one story.\n  On June 10, 1964, the Civil Rights Act was being filibustered on this \nvery floor. No filibuster of a civil rights bill in the 20th century \nhad ever been broken. Senator Claire Engle of California, who held the \nseat I now occupy, was suffering at the time from terminal brain \ncancer. He was wheeled in dramatic fashion into this Chamber. He was \ntoo sick to speak, but he indicated his ``aye'' vote for cloture by \ngesturing toward his eyes. His vote proved to be the decisive 67th vote \nthat overcame the filibuster and ultimately led to passage of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964. Senator Engle died later that year. However, the \nfilibuster was no longer an impassable barrier to civil rights \nlegislation, and the Senate passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 the \nfollowing year. I thank my predecessor and I pay him tribute.\n  In the last 50 years, California has often been ahead of the curve in \nguaranteeing voting rights. In 1961, California prohibited election day \nchallenges based on literacy.\n  In 1971, California required that a copy of the election ballot in \nSpanish be posted in each polling place, where the language minority \npopulation was greater than 3 percent.\n  In 1973, California passed a law allowing the use of languages \nbesides English in polling places and required county clerks to recruit \nbilingual deputy registrars and precinct board members.\n  In 1975, California allowed voters to register to vote by mail.\n  In 2001, California passed the California Voting Rights Act--the \nfirst State voting rights act in the Nation--to combat racial bloc \nvoting.\n  Unfortunately, however, the end of the 20th century did not mark the \nend of efforts to disenfranchise minority voters in my State and the \nNation. Nevertheless, several provisions of the Voting Rights Act will \nexpire in August of 2007 if we don't take this action today.\n  Two of the provisions set to expire are particularly significant. The \nfirst is section 5, which requires jurisdictions with a history of \ndiscrimination to clear any changes in voting procedures with the \nDepartment of Justice before instituting any change.\n  The second is section 203, which requires language assistance for \nbilingual voters in jurisdictions with a large number of citizens for \nwhom English is a second language.\n  The section 5 so-called ``preclearance'' provision is critically \nimportant. I guess this is the section that has drawn the most comment \non this reauthorization. It is important because it stops attempts to \ndisenfranchise voters before they can start, not after they start.\n  In the last decade, the Department of Justice has repeatedly struck \ndown proposed changes to voting procedures under section 5 \npreclearance. This section has prevented the redrawing of municipal \nboundaries designed specifically to disenfranchise minority voters, \nblocked attempts to exclude minority candidates from the ballot, denied \nefforts to change methods of elections intended to dilute minority \nvoting strength, kept polling places from being moved to locations that \nwould have reduced minority voter turnout, and it has thrown out \nredistricting proposals that would have marginalized minority voters. \nClearly, this section has served us well.\n  In California, the rejection of a discriminatory redistricting plan \nin Monterey County under section 5 led to the first election of a \nLatino to the Monterey County Boards of Supervisors in more than 100 \nyears.\n  The most significant impact of section 5, I believe, is not from its \nenforcement mechanism but from its deterrent effect. Just as the \npresence of police deters more crime than is stopped by actual police \nintervention, it is likely that the threat of Government action \nprevents far more attempts to disenfranchise voters than the Department \nof Justice's review actually does.\n  Let me speak about section 203. Its requirement of language \nassistance in jurisdictions with a large number of citizens for whom \nEnglish is a second language has enabled citizens to vote who \notherwise, frankly, could not have.\n  For example, a study found that in the 1990 general election, \nbilingual assistance was used by 18 percent of Latino voters in the \nState of California.\n  Los Angeles is the largest and most diverse local election \njurisdiction in our country. It provides assistance under the Voting \nRights Act to voters in six languages other than English.\n  According to a November 2000 exit survey of language minority voters \nin Los Angeles and Orange County in California, 54 percent of Asian-\nAmerican voters and 46 percent of Latino voters reported that language \nassistance made them more likely to vote. That is actual documentation.\n  In a hearing before the Judiciary Committee on the impact of section \n203, Deborah Wright, acting assistant registrar and county clerk for \nLos Angeles County, testified that written translations are provided in \nLos Angeles County because of the complex nature of issues facing the \nvoters in our State. I can tell you that California ballots are among \nthe longest and most complicated in our Nation. She explained to our \ncommittee that California often presents voters with numerous, complex \nballot initiatives and propositions. Such complicated ballots challenge \nall voters to be prepared and to have the information they need prior \nto casting their ballots.\n  Often, a high level of English proficiency is needed even by native \nspeakers of English to understand these ballot initiatives and to cast \nan informed ballot. I myself have trouble sometimes understanding the \npropositions. I believe the California experience is persuasive that \nappropriate targeted language assistance makes it much more likely that \ninformed voters vote, and that is important.\n  My mother was an immigrant from Russia. She came here when she was a \nsmall child. She had only a primary school education. Her family was \nvery poor. Her parents never spoke English. She studied English and, as \nan adult, passed the language exam and became a naturalized citizen. \nStill, when it came time to vote, I helped her with her ballot. We \nwould go over the propositions, I would read them in English, we would \ndiscuss them, otherwise she could never fully understand them because \nthey were complicated and filled with legalese.\n\n[[Page S7970]]\n\n  As I said, California's ballots can be long, and despite ballot \nsimplification, which is now a part of the California ballot, they can \nstill be very confusing. Section 203 enables the full comprehension of \na ballot, and I believe that is very important.\n  We are reauthorizing this bill today. I don't believe we can permit \nthese provisions to expire and leave the next generation of Americans \nwithout full protection of their voting rights. That is why I am very \nproud to be a cosponsor of the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, Coretta \nScott King, and Cesar E. Chavez Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and \nAmendments Act of 2006.\n  This legislation will reauthorize the expiring provisions of the \nVoting Rights Act for an additional 25 years so that it can continue to \nbe a kind of deterrent to any chicanery, any manipulation, anyone's ill \nintent to prevent any group of voters from exercising their right to \nthe franchise under the Constitution of the United States.\n  Under the guidance of Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Leahy over \nthe last 2 months, our committee, the Judiciary Committee, has held 10 \nhearings on reauthorizing this act--10 hearings. As a matter of fact, I \ncan't remember any reauthorization in the 14 years I have been on the \ncommittee that has had 10 separate hearings. The exhaustive testimony \nfrom these hearings has confirmed both that these expiring provisions \nare still needed and that these provisions are constitutional.\n  In response to this record, yesterday the Judiciary Committee \nunanimously voted to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act. I was also \npleased to see the House pass the reauthorization last week with broad, \nbipartisan support. Today, this full Senate now has the opportunity to \noffer its own resounding endorsement of this very important bill.\n  Thomas Paine wrote over 200 years ago that:\n\n       The right of voting for representatives is the primary \n     right by which other rights are protected.\n\n  I couldn't agree more. Today will be a historic occasion as we \nreauthorize this important bill for another 25 years. I am very proud \nto play a small role as a member of the Judiciary Committee in this \nvote.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, at the outset of this historic day in the \nSenate, let me give my accolades to Senator Specter and to Senator \nLeahy for their leadership in the reauthorization of the Voting Rights \nAct. This is one of the finest days of the Senate of the 109th Congress \nbecause it is a demonstration of Republicans and Democrats coming \ntogether to deal with the very important question of our Nation.\n  I congratulate the Judiciary Committee and all of those who have \ncreated a template for how we should do business in the Senate.\n  I rise today to offer my unequivocal support for the Fannie Lou \nHamer, Rosa Parks, Coretta Scott King and Cesar E. Chavez Voting Rights \nAct Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006.\n  Almost a year ago, I stood on the Senate floor to pay tribute to the \nVoting Rights Act on the occasion of its 40th anniversary. In my \nremarks on that day, I urged my colleagues to rise above the \npartisanship that often plagues this body and to renew the promise of \nthe landmark civil rights legislation by reauthorizing the key \nprovisions that were set to expire in 2007. I am extremely pleased that \nthe Senate today is poised to take action on this important \nlegislation.\n  Without enforcement and accountability of our Nation's voting laws \nfor all Americans--for all Americans--the words of the Declaration of \nIndependence declaring ``All men are created equal,'' the words written \nin the Constitution guaranteeing the inalienable right to vote, and the \nmaxim of one person, one vote, those principles enshrined in our \nelected laws, are little more than empty words. The reauthorization of \nthe Voting Rights Act is fundamental to protect these rights and values \nand to ensure that they translate into actual practice, actual \nrepresentation, and an actual electoral voice for every American.\n\n  I especially thank Senator Leahy for offering an amendment on my \nbehalf in the committee that incorporated the name of Cesar E. Chavez, \na true American hero, into the title of the Senate's reauthorization \nbill.\n  Like the venerable American leaders who are now associated with this \neffort, Cesar Chavez sacrificed his life to empower the most vulnerable \nin America. He fought for all Americans to be included in our great \ndemocracy. It is only fitting that his name be a part of the \nreauthorization of the Voting Rights Act.\n  As we move forward, I believe incorporating the names of these \nhistoric American leaders underscores the importance of reflecting on \nthe history of our country and our never-ending--not yet completed--\nquest to become a more inclusive America.\n  When one looks back at our history, one learns some very painful \nlessons from that past. We must keep in mind that we, as a nation, for \nthe first 250 years of our history allowed one group of people to own \nanother group of people under a system of slavery simply based on the \ncolor of their skin. It took the bloodiest war of our country's \nhistory, even more bloody than World War II--the Civil War, where over \nhalf a million people were killed on our soil in America--to bring \nabout an end to the system of slavery and to usher in the 13th and 14th \nand 15th amendments to our Constitution. In my estimation, these three \namendments are the bedrock of the proposition that all constitutional \nliberties are endowed upon all Americans without exception. But it took \nmany long years for the promise of these amendments to be realized in \nour own Nation.\n  Notwithstanding the tremendous loss of blood and life during the \nCivil War, some years later, in 1896, in Plessy v. Ferguson, our own \nU.S. Supreme Court sanctioned a system of segregation and the doctrine \nof ``separate but equal.'' The Court's decision to uphold an 1890 \nLouisiana statute mandating racially segregated but equal railroad \ncarriages ushered in another dark period in our country's history where \nJim Crow was the law of the land throughout the South. Similar laws \napplied to other groups. Throughout the Southwest, Mexican Americans in \nmany places were systematically denied access to ``White Only'' \nrestrooms and other places of public accommodation. Just as there were \nsigns that said ``No Blacks Allowed'' in the South, there were also \nsigns in many places across our country that read ``No Mexicans \nAllowed.''\n  In the now infamous Plessy case, Justice Harlan, writing for the \ndissent in that case, looking ahead at the century to come, made the \nfollowing observation:\n\n       The destinies of the races, in this country, are \n     indissolubly linked together and the interests of both \n     require that the common government law shall not permit the \n     seeds of race hate to be planted under the sanction of law.\n\n  Justice Harlan's statement was profound in its forecast for America. \nIt is unfortunate that his words of warning were largely ignored for \nthe next half century. It was not until 1920, for example, that our \nConstitution even guaranteed the right of women to vote, and it was not \nuntil 1954 that the U.S. Supreme Court, under the very able leadership \nof Chief Justice Warren, struck down the ``separate but equal'' \ndoctrine as unconstitutional under the 14th amendment in the Brown v. \nBoard of Education case. That case was argued by Thurgood Marshall, \nanother American hero who gave his life for equal opportunity for all \nAmericans.\n  More hard-won change followed that 1954 decision of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  While the 15th amendment, which was ratified in 1870, guaranteed all \ncitizens the right to vote regardless of race, in 1965--that wasn't \nthat long ago--only a very small percentage of African Americans were \nregistered to vote in States such as Mississippi and Alabama. In \nMississippi in that year, only 6.7 percent of African Americans were \nregistered to vote, and in Alabama less than 20 percent were registered \nto vote.\n  The various tactics that were used back then to impede and discourage \npeople from registering to vote and casting their right in our \ndemocracy on election day ranged from literacy tests, poll taxes, and \nlanguage barriers, to overt intimidation and harassment. The Voting \nRights Act went on to attack those discriminatory practices in\n\n[[Page S7971]]\n\npeople's exercise of their fundamental right to vote.\n  On August 6, 1965, when President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting \nRights Act, America took a critical step forward in fulfilling our \nconstitutional ideals.\n  Just a year earlier, President Johnson had signed the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964 proclaiming that in America, as he said:\n\n       We believe that all men are created equal, yet many are \n     denied equal treatment. We believe that all men have certain \n     unalienable rights, yet many Americans do not enjoy those \n     rights. We believe that all men are entitled to the blessings \n     of liberty, yet millions are being deprived of those \n     blessings, not because of their own failures, but because of \n     the color of the skin.\n\n  President Johnson knew then what we still recognize today on this \nfloor of the Senate.\n  The enactment of both of these critical pieces of legislation in the \n1960s was another major step forward in our country's journey to become \nan inclusive America for all citizens--for all citizens--and enjoy the \nrights and protections guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.\n  When he recalled the day when the Voting Rights Act was signed by \nPresident Johnson, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., wisely pointed out \nthat:\n\n       The bill that lay on the polished mahogany desk was born in \n     violence in Selma, AL, where a stubborn sheriff had stumbled \n     against the future.\n\n  Dr. King was, of course, referring to Bloody Sunday, the Selma \nincident which took place on March 7, 1965, where more than 500 \nnonviolent civil rights marchers attempting a 54-mile march to the \nState capital to call for voting rights were confronted by an \naggressive and violent assault by the authorities.\n  In response to the violence in Selma and the death of Jimmy Lee \nJackson, who was shot 3 weeks earlier by a State trooper during a civil \nrights demonstration, President Johnson addressed Congress and the \nNation on March 15, 1965, to press for the passage of the Voting Rights \nAct. Indeed, President Johnson's speech served as a rallying call to \nthe Nation and to the Congress. In that speech, Lyndon Johnson said to \nthe Nation:\n\n       At times history and fate meet at a single time in a single \n     place to shape a turning point in man's unending search for \n     freedom. So it was at Lexington and Concord. So it was a \n     century ago at Appomattox. So it was last week in Selma, \n     Alabama.\n       This time, on this issue, there must be no delay, no \n     hesitation and no compromise with our purpose. We cannot, we \n     must not, refuse to protect the right of every American to \n     vote in every election that he may desire to participate in.\n\n  Five months later, on August 7, 1965, President Johnson signed the \nVoting Rights Act of 1965 into law.\n  In our country's history in America, we have often stumbled, but \ngreat leaders, such as Dr. King and those whose names are associated \nwith this authorization--Rosa Parks, Coretta Scott King, Fannie Lou \nHamer, and Cesar Chavez--those are people who gave their lives to make \ncertain that when we stumble, we get up and we continue our path of \nAmerica forward, we continue an America in progress.\n  Since the passage of the Voting Rights Act, the doors to opportunity \nfor political participation by previously disenfranchised groups have \nswung open. Their voices are now heard and counted across America. This \nprogress is evident through the Nation in all levels of government \ntoday. The number of Black elected officials nationwide has risen from \nonly 300 in 1964 to more than 9,000 today. In addition, today there are \nover 5,000 Latinos who now hold public office, and there are still \nhundreds more Asian Americans and Native Americans serving as elected \nofficials.\n  It is with this history in mind--and with the increasing diversity of \nour country--that I look to the future of an inclusive America \ncontinuing to fulfill the promises and guarantees to all Americans that \nour Constitution provides.\n  Our work is not yet done. Although significant advances to ensure \nvoting rights for all Americans have been made, the testimony presented \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee points to still an unfortunate \ntruth: that Americans are still too often being kept from the polls.\n  The greatness of this country depends on our learning and not \nforgetting the painful lessons of our past, including poll taxes and \nliteracy tests that prevented countless of individuals from exercising \ntheir right to vote.\n  I believe the United States, the Federal Government must remain \nvigilant in safeguarding all Americans' sacred right to vote. This \nlegislation today is a manifestation of that vigilance of the Congress. \nIt represents the Senate working at its best.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia is going to be recognized, but I have a quick housekeeping \nissue.\n  The distinguished chairman, the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania, and I want to make sure we go back and forth, side to \nside. So following the distinguished Senator from Virginia, we will go \nto the distinguished Senator from North Dakota. Following the next \nRepublican, I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois, Mr. Durbin, be recognized for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator from \nColorado for his speech. I mentioned him earlier in my speech on the \nfloor and his tremendous contribution to this bill. We can all agree \nthe time to end discrimination is still here, and we can work to do \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise to commend the Judiciary Committee \nbut most importantly commend to my colleagues on the passage of the \nVoting Rights Act renewal this afternoon.\n  I spoke right before Independence Day last month on June 29 on the \nimportance of certain principles as we celebrated the Declaration of \nIndependence. I quoted and I will quote again the importance of this \ndocument which is the spirit of America:\n\n       We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness--That to secure these \n     Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their \n     just Powers from the Consent of the Governed. . . .\n\n  So in our representative democracy, in our Republic, voting is how \nthe owners, the people of our country in their counties, cities, and \nStates, express their views for the just powers of our government.\n  I spoke on how it was important for the Senate to act on this measure \nas promptly as possible. I commend the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Specter, and the ranking member, Senator Leahy, for \nmoving yet another important piece of legislation this session. The \nenactment of the Voting Rights Act was absolutely necessary 41 years \nago and was passed during a tumultuous time in our Nation's history. \nHistory has proven, though, that this law was just and clearly \nappropriate to provide equal opportunities and protections to persons \nwith the desire to express themselves and give their consent at the \nballot box. We are all better off--we are so much better off--for the \nchoices made during that time because this strengthened the fabric of \nour country. It has made our country a more perfect union--and as we \nstrive to be a more perfect union, it has made us stronger as we have \nfaced the challenges of recent years, presently, and in the future.\n\n  What this legislation does is help ensure the fundamental right of \nall eligible citizens to vote. It sends a strong message, a renewal, a \nreconfirmation that no matter one's gender, race, ethnicity or \nreligion, you have an opportunity to vote if you are a law-abiding \ncitizen in this country. It is the core--it is absolutely the core of a \nrepresentative democracy, that we do have the participation of an \ninformed people. Again, the people are the owners of the Government.\n  Virginia has come a long way. They have come a long way because the \nConstitution said: You have the right to vote, but we all know that not \neveryone did have the right to vote. It took many years before African \nAmericans were allowed to vote, but then there were all sorts of \ndevices that prevented them from voting. It took many years before \nwomen were given the right to vote. Virginia has come a long way\n\n[[Page S7972]]\n\nsince the Voting Rights Act was enacted 41 years ago. I think it is \nimportant that the Act is reauthorized, not just for Virginia but \nthroughout the United States. It applies everywhere from Florida to \nAlaska to New York.\n  Some will argue that counties and cities and States cannot be removed \nfrom or ``bail out'' of preclearance if they so desire and have a good \nrecord. The facts are that there are 11 counties and cities in Virginia \nthat have been able to ``bail out'' of the Voting Rights Act by proving \nthat ``no racial test or device has been used within such State or \npolitical subdivision for the purpose or with the effect of denying or \nbridging the right to vote on account of race or color.'' The counties \nin Virginia that have been removed from this preclearance review are \nAugusta, Frederick, Greene, Pulaski, Roanoke, Rockingham, Shenandoah, \nand Warren and the cities of Fairfax, Harrisonburg, and Winchester.\n  The renewal of this act does not mean that the reauthorizing States \nstill engage in voter discrimination on the basis of race. Renewal \nshould instead be viewed as a continued unflagging commitment to \nensuring the protection of a law-abiding person's right to vote without \nsubversion or unwarranted interference.\n  Thanks in part to the Voting Rights Act, Virginia was the first State \nin our Union to popularly elect the first Governor who is an African \nAmerican. I hope that after this November's elections, Virginia will \nnot be the only State to have a Governor elected who is an African \nAmerican. In fact, I would be happy if there were two more Governors \nelected this year who are African American. The election in Virginia \nrepresented an inspirational success for one person, L. Douglas Wilder, \nwho was elected Governor because of his perseverance in winning. But it \nis also an advancement and a matter of pride, I think, and an \nachievement of the Commonwealth of Virginia, which only decades earlier \nhad counties that closed their public schools rather than integrate \nthem to comply with the Brown v. Board of Education decision.\n  Now, we realize we have made progress, but we need to continue to \nmake strides. We need to strive to be a society, as Martin Luther King, \nJr., stated, ``Where people are judged by the content of their \ncharacter rather than by the color of their skin.''\n  We must join together in our great country, a country that has \ntremendous promise, to make sure that everybody, no matter their race, \nor their ethnicity, or their religion, or their gender, has that equal \nopportunity to lead a fulfilling life, to compete and to succeed in our \ncountry.\n  The reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act is a tool that has, can, \nand will help achieve this goal of fairness in America. So I urge my \ncolleagues this afternoon to renew and pass this important piece of \nlegislation. We can and have debated the issue, but we also know the \nresults. The results of the Voting Rights Act has made this a more \nperfect union. Let's keep this country moving forward, making sure this \nis a land of opportunity for all. I commend this measure to the \npositive vote of all my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their attention, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I just this morning spoke to a couple of \nhundred young people called Junior Statesmen who are gathered in the \nCapitol. It is an organization that comes to the Capitol and learns \nabout Government. I talked to them about the Voting Rights Act some, \nand I talked to them about what we take so much for granted in this \ncountry, including the right to vote.\n  I described what happened, at least as I read the history books, on \nNovember 15, 1917, at Occoquan Prison. That is the day on which a good \nnumber of women were severely beaten at the Occoquan Prison. Several \ndozen women were picked up because they demonstrated in front of the \nWhite House. They were arrested for demonstrating because they were in \nthe streets demonstrating, insisting that women ought to have the right \nto vote in this country. Because they demanded the right to vote, \ndemonstrating in the streets of this capital, they were arrested and \ntaken to the Occoquan Prison. Among those women were Lucy Burns and \nAlice Paul.\n  The description of what they did to those women includes putting \nhandcuffs on Lucy Burns, tying the handcuffs with a chain, and then \nputting the chain above a cell door and letting her hang the entire \nevening, with blood running down her arms. That was the fate of Lucy \nBurns. Alice Paul had a tube forced down her throat. They tried to \nforce feed Alice Paul, and she nearly drowned. The transgression of \nthese women: They were demanding the right of women to vote.\n\n  It is interesting what some people have done to demand the right of \ncitizenship and what others so often and so regularly take for granted.\n  My colleague was talking, I believe, about the struggle that \nminorities in this country, including especially African Americans, \nhave made to have the right to vote, and I believe the previous speaker \nwas talking about Selma, AL, on March 7 in 1965, when State troopers \nbrutally beat civil rights workers. The marchers were fighting for \ntheir right to vote. On that day, in 1965, that day in March, they were \nbrutally beaten because they insisted on the right to vote, just as \nAlice Paul and Lucy Burns had done some 60 years before that.\n  Lyndon Johnson said this about what is called Bloody Sunday. He said:\n\n       At times, history and fate meet at a single time in a \n     single place to shape a turning point in man's unending \n     search for freedom. So it was at Lexington and Concord. So it \n     was last week in Selma, Alabama. There, long-suffering men \n     and women peacefully protested the denial of their rights as \n     Americans. Many were brutally assaulted. One good man, a man \n     of God, was killed.\n\n  From that, we know that the Voting Rights Act was passed a very short \ntime later.\n  Days later, in a joint session of Congress, President Johnson \noutlined the Voting Rights Act, and within months, the Congress had \npassed it.\n  Let me talk about another minority in this country, Native Americans, \nthe first Americans, those who were here first--American Indians. \nAlthough the Voting Rights Act applies to all Americans and all \nminorities, let me talk just a little about its impact on Native \nAmericans, American Indians.\n  They were first given U.S. citizenship rights in 1924. Think of that. \nAlmost a century and a half of this country's experience passed before \nIndians were recognized. It took from 1924, nearly 40 years later, for \nall of the States in this Nation to say to American Indians: Yes, you \nhave the right to vote. You have the full rights of American \ncitizenship. The last State to clear the hurdles and the obstacles to \nvoting by American Indians was New Mexico, in 1962, only 3 years before \nthe Voting Rights Act. Think of that. These were the Americans who were \nhere first. They lived here when the rest of us came here--American \nIndians.\n  We come today on the issue of extending the Voting Rights Act. I \nbelieve it has been almost a quarter of a century since we have done \nthat; 1982 was the last time Congress reauthorized the Voting Rights \nAct. It has been hailed by many as the single most effective piece of \ncivil rights legislation that has ever been passed.\n  I was in Philadelphia some weeks ago and went to the Constitution \nCenter. At the Constitution Center they have these statues of the 55 \nmen--yes, only men--who sat in that hot room in the hot summer and \nwrote the Constitution of the United States. The three words that began \nthat great document were, ``we the people''--not just some of the \npeople, all the people--``we the people.'' And all of the power in this \ndocument called the Constitution of the United States is vested in the \npower of one--one American casting one vote at one time. That is all \nthe power in this Government. That exceeds all the power of all the \nPresidents, all the power of all the Senators--the power of one person \nto cast one vote on one day to alter the destiny of this country.\n  Except we have learned over time that some have been denied that \nopportunity: African Americans, American Indians, women. It has taken a \nlong time and a bloody struggle, regrettably, to make certain that \neveryone has the right to exercise the power of one, to become part of \n``we the people.''\n  My guess is that the spirit of Lucy Byrne and Alice Paul exists in \nthis debate about voting rights. The spirit of\n\n[[Page S7973]]\n\nthe civil rights marchers who were beaten brutally--one lost his life \non that bloody Sunday--their spirit exists as this Congress turns again \nto the subject of voting rights and asks the question: Will we do \neverything possible to ensure that every American is able to exercise \nthe power of one as part of ``we the people'' in this great country? \nThat is why this is such an important piece of legislation. That is why \nsome take it for granted day after day. It is why others have given \ntheir lives for it.\n  Today, when this Congress passes the Voting Rights Act, to extend the \nVoting Rights Act once again, I think it will have been one of its \nfinest hours.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if you are a student of history, this is a \nmoment that you should reflect on and savor. Just a short time ago, I \ncame to the floor and sat in the back row and listened as Senator Ted \nKennedy of Massachusetts spoke. I wanted to be here to see it because \nSenator Ted Kennedy was one of the few who was a Member of the Senate \nwhen the Voting Rights Act passed in 1965, more than 40 years ago. He \nrecounted the struggle that led to the passage of that legislation--and \nit was a struggle. He talked about President Lyndon Baines Johnson \ncoming back to Capitol Hill, with which he was so familiar as a Member \nof the Senate, and just a few feet away from where I am standing, in \none of the small rooms known as the President's Room, signing the \nVoting Rights Act of 1965.\n  I wanted to come and hear Ted Kennedy tell that story because I do \nappreciate it--not just as history but because of what that meant to \nAmerica. Some say it was the most significant civil rights legislation \nin our history. It is hard to argue that it was not because if \nAmericans don't have the right to vote, they don't have the most basic \nright that we appreciate and treasure as American citizens.\n  On the day that President Lyndon Baines Johnson signed the Voting \nRights Act of 1965, he said it was one of the most monumental laws in \nthe history of American freedom. And then he said:\n\n       Today is a triumph for freedom as huge as any victory \n     that's ever been won on any battlefield. Today we strike away \n     the last major shackle of fierce and ancient bonds.\n\n  Those beautiful words were quoted in the autobiography of Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr. They are a reminder that what we are about today is \nnot just another piece of legislation. It is only 12 or 13 pages long--\nsmall by Senate standards--but what it does is make another commitment \nby our generation to the same basic values and principles that guided \nthis Congress to pass the first Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n  In August of last year, I was invited to Atlanta, GA, to represent my \ncaucus of the Senate to march with civil rights leaders and ordinary \npeople to celebrate the 40th anniversary of that Voting Rights Act. I \nwas proud to march in the footsteps of civil rights giants, to \ncelebrate a bill that has often been called the most significant civil \nrights law ever passed by Congress.\n\n  It has broad support today. Yesterday, in my Senate Judiciary \nCommittee it passed unanimously, with a bipartisan vote. That is a \ngreat tribute to that committee and where America's thinking is today \non Capitol Hill. But it was bitterly fought in 1965. People died for \nthat law. Civil rights workers James Cheney, Michael Schwerner, Andrew \nGoodman, and so many others were murdered simply because they had the \ncourage to step up and say every American has the right to vote.\n  It has been so long ago, it sounds like ancient history, and you may \nbe puzzled to think: People would give their lives? Ordinary people \nwould die over this, over this battle? The answer is yes. Black, White, \nand brown Americans came forward and said it was worth dying for \nbecause it really was the cornerstone of America's democracy.\n  Just a few years ago, I made a trip down South, my first step to \nSelma, AL. When the civil rights march at Selma took place, I was a \nstudent here in Washington. I sat around in my apartment with several \nother students and we talked about getting in a car and driving down to \nSelma and being part of that march. I remember it like it was \nyesterday. I couldn't get away from my job, I had other excuses, and I \ndidn't go. I have thought about that so many times, how I wished I had \nbeen there at that moment, to have been part of that historic march \nacross the Edmund Pettus Bridge, but I missed it and regretted it ever \nsince.\n  Three years ago, Congressman John Lewis, from the State of Georgia, \ninvited me, Senator Brownback of Kansas, and others to join him in a \nlittle commemorative pilgrimage to the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Early one \nSunday morning we got up and drove over to Selma and John Lewis and Sam \nBrownback and I walked across the Edmund Pettus Bridge.\n  John Lewis was the perfect person to bring us on that pilgrimage \nbecause he had been there on that bloody day when the first march took \nplace. When we went there on that Sunday morning, it was quiet and \npeaceful. But he marched us down to the very spot where the Alabama \nState Troopers turned and started beating him--beating him unconscious. \nHe fell to the ground and nearly died. But he survived and that cause \nsurvived and today John Lewis is a Congressman.\n  What does that have to do with this debate? Just last week, \nCongressman John Lewis spoke in the House about the history of the \nVoting Rights Act, and here is what he said:\n\n       When we marched from Selma to Montgomery in 1965, it was \n     dangerous. It was a matter of life and death. I was beaten, I \n     had a concussion at the bridge. I almost died. I gave blood, \n     but some of my colleagues gave their very lives.\n\n  It is good for us to reflect on that and to value what John Lewis and \nhis courage meant to America and so many others, and why this bill at \nthis moment is important for America. We honor the legacy of civil \nrights heroes by extending the Voting Rights Act provisions that would \nexpire in just a short time.\n  The bill itself is named after three extraordinary civil rights \nheroes: Coretta Scott King, who continued her husband's leadership of \nAmerica's movement for racial justice and human rights; Rosa Parks, \nwhat a brave lady, who ignited the Montgomery Alabama bus boycott; and \nFannie Lou Hamer, the sharecropper who became a civil rights champion. \nShe was nearly beaten to death trying to register to vote. And her \nfamous declaration? Fannie Lou Hamer said, ``I am sick and tired of \nbeing sick and tired.''\n  Last week, the House of Representatives passed the Voting Rights Act \nby a vote of 390 to 33. It was a proud moment for that Chamber. In his \nautobiography, Dr. Martin Luther King reflects on this Voting Rights \nAct, and this is what Dr. King wrote:\n\n       When President Johnson declared that Selma, AL, is joined \n     in American history with Lexington, Concord, and Appomattox, \n     he honored not only our embattled Negroes, but the \n     overwhelming majority of the nation, Negro and white. The \n     victory in Selma is now being written in the Congress. Before \n     long, more than a million Negroes will be new voters and \n     psychologically, new people. Selma is a shining moment in the \n     conscience of man. If the worst in American life lurked in \n     the dark streets of Selma, the best of American democratic \n     instincts arose from across the nation to overcome it.\n\n  What powerful and hopeful words.\n  It is wrong for us to equate racism and prejudice with the South in \nAmerica. Sadly, it has touched every corner of our great Nation. Every \none of us in our towns and communities and villages, North and South, \nEast and West, have struggled with some form of racism in the course of \nour history.\n  In the 1960s, Illinois fielded its first African-American candidate, \na woman named Fannie Jones from East St. Louis, IL, my hometown, who \nran for clerk of the Illinois Supreme Court. She lost. It wasn't even \nclose. But she was the first to try to run statewide.\n  Then fast-forward. By 1978, Illinois elected its first African-\nAmerican statewide, Roland Burris of Chicago, as State comptroller.\n  Now bring it to the present day, and I am honored that my State, \nIllinois, the land of Lincoln, can claim that the two biggest vote \ngetters in its history are African Americans: my close friend, \nSecretary of State Jesse White, and my colleague, in whom I have such \ngreat pride, Barack Obama the two biggest vote getters in the land of \nLincoln. It says a lot about how far we have come just in my short \npolitical lifetime.\n\n[[Page S7974]]\n\n  Yesterday, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to reauthorize this \nbill. Today, the Members of the Senate have an opportunity to make \nhistory by passing this strong, bipartisan extension of the Voting \nRights Act. A lot of people argued when this debate began that it was \nunnecessary. Voting rights? Where is that a problem in America, they \nsaid? I wish it were not a problem.\n\n  Listen again to what Congressman John Lewis said last week:\n\n       Yes, we have made some progress. We have come a distance. \n     We are no longer met with bullwhips, fire hoses, and violence \n     when we attempt to register and vote. But the sad fact is, \n     the sad truth is, discrimination still exists, and that is \n     why we still need the Voting Rights Act. . . . We cannot \n     separate the debate today from our history and the past we \n     have traveled.\n\n  We had hearings before the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, \nmore hearings than I have ever seen on any single piece of legislation: \n21 hearings on the Voting Rights Act over the past 9 months, 12 in the \nHouse, 9 in the Senate. Over 100 witnesses appeared or submitted \nstatements for the Record, thousands of pages of reports and evidence, \nso there would be no question about the need for this bill.\n  I attended and listened to some of these hearings. They were \ncontentious. People were debating whether we needed a Voting Rights Act \nor whether this was some vestige of America's past which had no \nrelevance today. But the evidence shows that attempts at voter \ndiscrimination are not simply a chapter from our history; they continue \nto threaten us and our democracy today. We have made progress as a \nnation over the past few decades, but discrimination endures, many \ntimes in more subtle forms.\n  A recent example was in the State of Georgia which passed two \ndifferent voter ID laws over the past year, over the strong objections \nof the African Americans who live in that State. They argued that this \nnew Georgia law would diminish the voting rights of the minorities, the \npoor, the elderly, and those without formal education. Both of \nGeorgia's laws were struck down by Federal courts. The first law was \ndetermined to constitute a modern day poll tax, an unconstitutional \ninfringement on the fundamental right to vote. The second law, slightly \nimproved, was struck down last week by a Federal judge who ruled it was \ndiscriminatory and unconstitutional.\n  This is what the New York Times said recently about ``Georgia's new \npoll tax,'' as they call it:\n\n       In 1966, the Supreme Court held that the poll tax was \n     unconstitutional. Nearly 40 years later, Georgia still is \n     charging people to vote, this time with a new voter ID law \n     that requires many people without driver's licenses--a group \n     that is disproportionately poor, black, and elderly--to pay \n     $20 or more for a state ID card. Georgia went ahead with this \n     even though there is not a single place in the entire city of \n     Atlanta where the cards are sold. The law is a national \n     disgrace.\n\n  And a reminder that laws which we now look back on with \nembarrassment, laws that required African Americans to pay a poll tax \nbefore they could vote, laws which had literacy tests and \nconstitutional tests before a person can vote, and say: That is the \npast; thank goodness it is behind us. This Georgia law which imposed a \nnew requirement for a voter ID, which would have cost many voters $20, \nwas, in the view of the Federal court system, a new poll tax.\n  Unfortunately, it is part of a pattern. Since 1982, the Federal \nJustice Department has objected to nearly 100 proposed changes to \nelection procedures in Georgia alone on the grounds that the changes \nwould have a discriminatory impact on minority voters. The Justice \nDepartment has sent Federal observers to monitor nearly twice the \nnumber of elections in Georgia since 1982 as it did between 1965 and \n1982.\n  Let me add again, though I am giving examples from Georgia, I do not \nstand here as a northerner by definition and argue we only find \ndiscrimination in the South. Discrimination and race has haunted our \nNation from coast to coast. It is naive and wrong to believe it is only \na southern phenomenon, but the fact is, in this situation, in Georgia, \nrepeatedly minority voters have been challenged and have been denied \nthe right to vote.\n  Both of the protections, the requirement the Justice Department \napprove changes to electoral procedures in States with histories of \nvoter discrimination and Federal monitoring of elections in such \njurisdictions, are only possible because of the sections of the Voting \nRights Act that must be renewed.\n  Let's take another case that is not in the South. Eighty-three \npercent of Buffalo County, South Dakota, is Native American, but they \nwere packed into a single State legislative district. Non-Natives, who \nmake up 17 percent of the population of the county, controlled two out \nof three seats on the county commission. Buffalo County was \nsuccessfully sued in the year 2003 in South Dakota. The case was \nsettled by a consent decree. In that consent decree, Buffalo County, \nSouth Dakota, admitted that its plan was discriminatory and agreed to \nsubmit to Federal supervision of future change.\n  Once again, it was one of the provisions of the Voting Rights Act \nwhich would expire without our action today--section 5--that entitled \nthe U.S. Justice Department to protect the rights of Americans to vote \nin South Dakota.\n  In another case in 2004, a Federal judge invalidated South Dakota's \nredistricting plan. In her opinion, the judge described the State's \nlong history of discrimination against Native Americans, including some \nvery recent examples. The judge quoted a South Dakota State legislator \nwho, in expressing opposition to a bill that would have made it easier \nfor Native Americans to register to vote, said in the year 2002:\n\n       I'm not sure we want that sort of person in the polling \n     place.\n\n  The record is thorough and clear. Voter discrimination continues. It \nremains a threat to American democracy. We need to pass this renewal of \nthe Voting Rights Act. We need to step back as a nation and ask some \nimportant questions, not pat ourselves on the back on a bipartisan \nbasis for passing this.\n  Why is it so many voting machines in cities where the poorest people \nlive don't work? Why is it people are denied their choices on the \nballots because they are stuck with voting machinery that is antiquated \nor just plain dysfunctional? Why is it those who are challenged time \nand time again turn out to be the poor, the dispossessed? Why is it \nthey have the toughest time when it comes to voting in America, if this \nis truly going to be a land of equal opportunity?\n  There were attempts in the House and Senate to weaken this Voting \nRights Act and I am glad they did not prevail. I am glad what we have \nbefore the Senate today is a strong, clear version of renewing this \nlaw. I want it to pass, but I don't want the conversation to end at \nthat point. I hope we will accept the responsibility to challenge any \nState and to challenge even ourselves if we are creating unnecessary \nand unfair obstacles to voters who are trying to exercise the most \nbasic right they have as Americans.\n  Whether you are Republican, Democrat, or Independent, we need to be \nunited in supporting the Voting Rights Act. This law, above all others, \nshould be above politics and partisanship. We need to make sure that \ntoday in the Senate, we are all on the right side of history. The \nVoting Rights Act has served as a beacon of our democracy for over 40 \nyears. It should not be allowed to expire until voting discrimination \nhas expired.\n  When it passed in 1965, it was because of the moral and physical \ncourage of people such as Congressman John Lewis of Georgia, Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr., Coretta Scott King, Rosa Parks, Fannie Lou Hamer, and \nso many others. Passing the Voting Rights Act also required the \npersistence and courage of Members of Congress.\n  No one in the Senate pushed longer and harder for voting rights for \nall Americans than a man named Paul Douglas of Illinois. My connection \nto the Senate began as a college student in 1966, a year after this law \npassed. I was an intern in the office of Senator Paul Douglas. I had \nthe privilege to work in his office. I guess I was lucky in that he \nneeded me every day. You cannot say that very often for an intern, but \nhe needed me because Senator Douglas was a veteran of the Marine Corps, \nfought in World War II, and had lost the use of his left arm in combat. \nHe insisted on signing every letter, so every night they would stack up \nall the mail that had been typed by all the people in his office, and \nSenator Douglas would sit at the long table, starting\n\n[[Page S7975]]\n\nat 5 o'clock, signing the letters, making little notes, making \ncorrections. I got to sit next to him and pull the letters away. I was \ndazzled. There I was within a foot or two of this great man who had \ndone so much.\n  He came back after fighting the war to fight for the rights of those \nwho were being discriminated against. He gave a lot of political blood \nin the Senate fighting for civil rights. If you read the LBJ books, \nstories of Lyndon Baines Johnson, you know that in the early days, \nbefore Lyndon Johnson became the great champion of the civil rights \nthat he was in his late career, he was in pitched battle with the likes \nof Estes Kefauver, Hubert Humphrey, and Paul Douglas over the issue of \ncivil rights, but the day finally came in 1965 when the Voting Rights \nAct passed. Senator Paul Douglas said it was his proudest achievement \nas a Senator.\n  Today, American troops are risking their lives--and many have given \ntheir lives--to secure the right to vote for the people of Iraq and \nAfghanistan. The absolute least we can do is to have the courage to \nprotect the right to vote for all Americans by giving resounding, \nbipartisan support to the renewal of the Voting Rights Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the reauthorization of the Voting \nRights Act brings back a lot of memories of my early life and \nchildhood. When I was born in the Deep South, in Alabama, segregation, \nregretfully, was still very much in vogue. I remember all too well \nsegregated restrooms, segregated entrances into movie theaters, and \nsegregated schools which still existed when I started in the first \ngrade in the late 1940s.\n  I subsequently lived with my parents in Alabama for a few years. Then \nwe moved to Louisville, KY, about the time Kentucky was integrating its \nschools in response to the 1954 landmark decision Brown v. Board of \nEducation. Integration in public schools in Kentucky was smoothly \naccomplished, I think a tribute to our State which is somewhat southern \nand somewhat a border State. Kentucky accommodated itself to a new \nreality of integrated schools rather easily with the minimum amount of \nsome of the distress that occurred in other parts further South and \nactually in some northern cities as well.\n  In the early 1960s, I had an opportunity to be an intern over on the \nHouse side in 1963. I was here that summer when the extraordinary march \non Washington occurred. I remember standing on the steps of the \nCapitol, looking down the Mall to the Lincoln Memorial. It was crowded \nwith people from one side to the other all the way down to the Lincoln \nMemorial which, of course, is where Martin Luther King, Jr. made that \nextraordinary ``I Have a Dream'' speech. I couldn't hear it because I \nwas at the opposite end of the Mall, but you sensed that you were in \nthe midst of an extraordinary event that was going to change America. \nThat night, I had an opportunity to watch the speech on television. You \nknew it was one of the most memorable speeches of all time in American \nhistory.\n  The next year, I had a chance to be an intern on the Senate side, in \nSenator John Sherman Cooper's office. Senator Cooper was probably the \nonly truly successful Kentucky Republican at that point in our history \nin our State. He was among the members of the Republican Party leading \nthe charge for the public accommodations bill of 1964, that is, the \ncivil rights bill of 1964 which, interestingly enough, on a percentage \nbasis, was supported by more Republicans in the Senate than by \nDemocrats. I think not many Americans know that, but that was, indeed, \nthe case. A higher percentage of Republicans supported the civil rights \nbill of 1964 than did Democrats.\n  I had a wonderful summer observing Senator Cooper at work when he \nwas, in effect, leading the charge on the Republican side, along with \nEverett Dirksen, to stop the longest filibuster in the history of the \nSenate--and it is still the longest filibuster--that was employed \nagainst the civil rights bill of 1964. That filibuster was broken while \nI was an intern that summer. It was an exciting time. The bill was \npassed and President Johnson signed it.\n  The next summer after I finished my first year of law school, I came \nback to Washington to visit some of the friends I had made in the two \nprevious summers, for a week or so. I happened to be in Senator \nCooper's office on the day President Johnson was to sign the 1965 \nVoting Rights Act in the Rotunda of the Capitol. Senator Cooper came \nout, grabbed my arm in the reception room of his office and walked me \nover to the Rotunda where I got an opportunity to watch President \nJohnson sign the voting rights bill. The Rotunda was full of people. I \nwas not exactly standing beside President Johnson--I was way off in the \ndistance--but I do recall the presence of President Johnson. He was an \nenormous man. Not only was he very tall, he had a huge head, huge \nfeatures, and he sort of stood out above this mass of humanity in the \nRotunda of the Capitol. And so it was, indeed, a memorable day. I \nhappen to have been there the day the original voting rights bill was \nsigned.\n\n  This is a piece of legislation which, obviously, has worked. African-\nAmerican voters are participating throughout America, and some \nstatistics indicate in greater percentages, really, in the South than \nin other parts of the country.\n  Coming on the heels of the removal of the discrimination in places of \npublic accommodations, this bill, the very next year, eliminated the \nbarriers to voting, so that all Americans could participate in the \nbasic opportunities each of us has to go into an establishment of our \nchoice--that decision having been made in 1964--and then to vote and to \nhave an impact on elections--that decision having been made in 1965.\n  We have, of course, renewed the Voting Rights Act periodically since \nthat time, overwhelmingly, and on a bipartisan basis, year after year \nafter year because Members of Congress realize this is a piece of \nlegislation which has worked. And one of my favorite sayings that many \nof us use from time to time is, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. This a \ngood piece of legislation which has served an important purpose over \nmany years.\n  I had an opportunity, as many of us did, yesterday to meet with \nmembers of the NAACP--which happens to be meeting here in Washington, \nas we speak--from my State in my office. They were excited to be here. \nThere were older people, middle-aged people, and younger people in this \ngroup, all of them thrilled to be in Washington and to be in \nWashington, potentially, at the same time this very important \nlegislation is going to be reauthorized. We know the President will be \nspeaking to the NAACP and will be signing the bill. We will be able to \npass it here in the Senate in a few hours. And this landmark piece of \nlegislation will continue to make a difference not only in the South \nbut for all of America and for all of us, whether we are African \nAmericans or not.\n  Mr. President, obviously, I rise today in support of this bill.\n  America's history is a story of ever-increasing freedom, hope, and \nopportunity for all. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 represents one of \nthis country's greatest steps forward in that story.\n  Our most basic founding ideal is that sovereignty flows up, from the \npeople to their elected leaders. The governors must have the consent of \nthe governed.\n  In order for that ideal to mean anything, every American must have \nfreedom of political expression--including the free, unfettered right \nto vote.\n  But prior to the Voting Rights Act's passage, for far too many \nAfrican Americans, America did not live up to its promise that ``all \nmen are created equal.'' Many African Americans were denied the right \nto vote.\n  Thanks to brave men and women who held sit-ins at lunch counters, \nrode in Freedom Rides, marched in our Nation's capital, or simply \nrefused to give up a seat on a bus, America was forced to look itself \nin the mirror, admit its failing, and recommit itself to its founding \nideals.\n  I am especially proud to stand in support of the reauthorization of \nthe Voting Rights Act because, as I said, I was there when President \nJohnson signed the original Act in 1965.\n  I was overwhelmed to witness such a moment in history, and moved that \nmy hero, Senator Cooper, at the spur of the moment, had brought me to \nwitness it.\n\n[[Page S7976]]\n\n  It fills me with personal pride that I can today carry on a small \npart of Senator Cooper's legacy by voting to reauthorize the bill he \nworked so hard and so courageously to pass 41 years ago.\n  The Voting Rights Act has proved to be a success for America. On \nMarch 15, 1965, President Johnson spoke before a joint session of \nCongress and challenged them to pass this historic legislation.\n  At that time, he said:\n\n       The time of justice has now come, and I tell you that I \n     believe sincerely that no force can hold it back . . . and \n     when it does, I think that day will brighten the lives of \n     every American.\n\n  History has proven President Johnson correct. The Voting Rights Act \nbrought about greater justice for all. And while we celebrate that \nachievement, we must continue to strive for more.\n  I know my colleagues will join me in recognizing that our country \nwill and must continue its progress toward a society in which every \nperson, of every background, can realize the American Dream. With the \npassage of this bill, we are reaffirming that Dream.\n  I believe I am safe in predicting this legislation will be approved \noverwhelmingly this afternoon, and it is something all Members of the \nSenate, on both sides of the aisle, can feel deeply proud of having \naccomplished.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Voting \nRights Act. I have in my pocket here a small copy of the U.S. \nConstitution that Senator Byrd gave me a few months ago. It is \nsomething I cherish.\n  In February of 1870, the Constitution was amended with the 15th \namendment. It says, in section 1:\n\n       The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall \n     not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any \n     State on account of race, color, or previous condition of \n     servitude.\n\n  Section 2 says:\n\n       The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by \n     appropriate legislation.\n\n  That was passed in 1870. Just a few years after the close of the \nCivil War, the 15th amendment was added to the Constitution. But it \ntook this Congress really 95 years before it acted, in a meaningful \nway, to implement that second section which allows Congress to \nimplement this law.\n  I am reminded that in the last 50 years we have made a lot of \nprogress when it comes to race relations in this country. We have \nopened doors. We have provided opportunities. We have changed things. \nIt has really been a remarkable change for the better. However, I think \nevery Senator would acknowledge today that there are still miles that \nneed to be traveled. I know that when Lyndon Johnson rallied the Nation \nto press for the passage of the Civil Rights Act back in 1965, he said:\n\n       This time, on this issue, there must be no delay, no \n     hesitation and no compromise with our purpose. We cannot, we \n     must not, refuse to protect the right of every American to \n     vote in every election that he may desire to participate in.\n\n  Five months after the march in Selma, AL, President Johnson signed \nthe Voting Rights Act into law. The Voting Rights Act, in that context, \nin that time, put an end to literacy tests, poll taxes, and other less \ndirect methods to prohibit or discourage people from voting. They were \nclearly discriminatory tactics used all over this country but in the \nSouth particularly.\n  In the South, after the Voting Rights Act passed in 1965, African-\nAmerican registration rose to a record 62 percent within just a few \nyears after the passage of the Voting Rights Act.\n  It has been an amazing success. When it was enacted, there were only \n300 African-American public officials in this country--only 300. Today, \nthere are over 9,000. And the number of Latino elected officials is \nover 6,000.\n  So there is no doubt the Voting Rights Act is important, that it has \nbeen very effective. There is no doubt that it is one of the most \nimportant things Congress has done to equalize and give opportunity to \nall Americans. It is also--there is no question about it--just as \nimportant today as it was four decades ago.\n  I know the NAACP national convention is being held in Washington this \nweek. I know they are very supportive of this. There are countless \ncivil rights groups and organizations that are supportive of this, and \nthey want to renew, reauthorize, and restore this act. I appreciate \nthat, and I respect that. But also, in a broader context, this vote \ntoday allows us to stand not just with the NAACP, not just with civil \nrights groups but to stand with America.\n  We have made, as I said, significant strides. We have done some great \nthings, provided a lot of opportunity, opened a lot of doors. And we \nstill have a few miles to go.\n  One thing I have noticed, as former attorney general of the State of \nArkansas, is that over the last few years there has developed a new \ngeneration of tactics to prevent people from voting, and some of these \nare very subtle. Some of these have to do with annexations or even \nredistricting that could be done for discriminatory purposes or \nchanging the polling place without a lot of notice or making it very \ndifficult for some people to get to. The Voting Rights Act is important \ntoday to make sure those practices end as well.\n  It is hard for some of us to admit today--because we have made so \nmuch progress--that we still need this important legislation. I think \neverybody here wishes we did not. We would love to say we have \naccomplished the task and that we have equal voting opportunity for \nevery American. We would all love to say that. But in reality, we know \nwe do not, and we know we must continue the struggle.\n  I am also reminded, in closing, what Woodrow Wilson said about this \ncountry. One time he said:\n\n       America is the only idealistic nation in the world.\n\n  I think he was right about that. We are an idealistic nation. We \nalways strive for the better. In fact, we strive for perfection. We try \nto reach the ideal. We do not always get there. Certainly, the \ntreatment of African Americans through the history of this Nation is a \nclear example of that. We do not always get to the ideal. We do not \nalways get to the goal we set for ourselves. But one thing that makes \nAmerica different from a lot of countries is that we try. We try. And \nwe go the extra mile to try to make opportunities for people in this \ncountry and to try to live up to the ideals of our Founding Fathers and \nthose ideals on which this Nation was founded. The Voting Rights Act is \na very important part of that.\n  I thank my colleagues for listening today, and I thank my colleagues \nfor their votes today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I, too, rise today to speak in support \nof the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting \nRights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006. I am pleased to \nbe a cosponsor of and to have participated in the hearings held by the \nJudiciary Committee on this incredibly significant legislation.\n  The Voting Rights Act may very well be the most important piece of \nFederal legislation ever passed, for without a meaningful chance to \nvote, there can be no equality before the law, no equal access to \njustice, no equal opportunity in the workplace or to share in the \nbenefits and burdens of citizenship. Brave Americans risked their very \nlives in marches and demonstrations to pass this historic legislation.\n  The electoral process in this country has improved significantly as a \nresult of the Voting Rights Act. This success is evident in the \nincreased participation in elections by minority voters and in the \nenhanced ability of minority voters to elect candidates of their \nchoice. There is no doubt that progress has been made.\n  But I think that Ted Shaw, the president of the NAACP Legal Defense \nand Education Fund, put it best when he testified before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee that:\n\n       The Voting Rights Act was drafted to rid the country of \n     racial discrimination--not simply to reduce racial \n     discrimination in voting to what some view as a tolerable \n     level.\n\n  As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and as the ranking \nmember of the Subcommittee on the Constitution, you can take it from me \nthat the committee has done due diligence in examining this issue. But \nyou do not have to take it from me, of course. The extensive record the \ncommittee has compiled powerfully demonstrates the importance of the \nreauthorizing legislation before us today.\n\n[[Page S7977]]\n\n  Even in recent election cycles, Americans continue to be \ndisenfranchised by discriminatory redistricting plans, through the \ndenial of voting materials they are entitled to under the law, and \nthrough changes to election procedures that disadvantage minority \ncandidates and voters, among other things.\n  It is also worth noting that just a few weeks ago, the Supreme Court \nrecognized that discriminatory redistricting plans are not simply a \nvestige of the past--finding a purposeful effort to dilute the voting \npower of over 100,000 Latino Americans. It is clear to me that we have \ncome a long way from the bridge in Selma, AL, but we have not come far \nenough.\n  Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act has been instrumental in bringing \nabout the dramatic improvements in voting rights and representation for \nminorities in covered areas. Keeping it in place, with a reasonable \nbailout provision, is the best way to be sure we do not lose the \nprogress that has taken place.\n  Let me just say in response to some comments that were made during \nthe Judiciary Committee's hearings that all Members of Congress, \nregardless of whether they are in a covered or noncovered jurisdiction \nand regardless of their political affiliation, have an interest in \nensuring the continued effectiveness of the Voting Rights Act. As \nFederal legislators, we have a responsibility to address and eliminate \ndiscrimination wherever it is found. The integrity of our elections and \nof our very democracy depends on it.\n  Let's not falter now. Let's not stop or turn back the clock but, \nrather, build on the extraordinary success of this legislation and \nreaffirm the promise that all citizens, no matter what the color of \ntheir skin, can participate fully and equally in the electoral process. \nWe must reauthorize the expiring provisions of the act. We must ensure \nthat section 5 can continue to serve as a powerful deterrent to \nviolations in areas of the country with a history of systemic \ndiscrimination at the polls.\n  We must also reauthorize section 203, which has empowered many voters \nwith limited English proficiency to participate in our democratic \nprocess. It is also important that the Senate restore the original \nunderstanding of the act with respect to the opportunity-to-elect \nstandard and to election procedures with discriminatory intent.\n  There is much more work to do in terms of eradicating discrimination \nfrom our elections process, and reauthorizing and strengthening the \nVoting Rights Act is, of course, a step in the right direction. I will \nvote in favor of H.R. 9, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you, Mr. President. Before speaking about this \nvery important piece of legislation we are about to pass, I wish to \nbriefly just indicate a thank you to the State Department.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Stabenow are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Fannie Lou \nHamer, Rosa Parks, Coretta Scott King, and Cesar Chavez Voting Rights \nReauthorization Act of 2006. We all know that this reauthorizes \nexisting but currently expiring provisions of the Voting Rights Act for \n25 more years. I personally believe that when this was instituted in \n1965, there should not have been an expiration date and would prefer \nthat in this bill there not be an expiration date. But I am \nappreciative of the fact that we have bipartisan support to continue \nthis provision, and hopefully at some point we will be able to take off \nthe ending date.\n  I think about standing in this very important spot in the Senate. \nRight around the corner from us is a room we call the President's Room \nthat President Lyndon Johnson used in 1965 to sign the original \nlegislation because of its significance. We all know this is the \nbedrock of our democracy, the right to vote, the right to vote without \nharassment, intimidation, with correct information, knowing your vote \nin fact will be counted.\n  I am proud of the fact that one of the folks who this bill is named \nafter is Rosa Parks, who is from Detroit. We claim her as our own and \nare so proud of all she has done, along with the others this bill has \nbeen named after. But we are very proud that the mother of the civil \nrights movement is from our own beloved Detroit.\n  Before 1965 and the bill's passage, we had communities with explicit \npoll taxes and literacy tests to prevent people of color from voting. \nWe have in fact made great progress on civil rights since the original \nlaw. But as many of my colleagues have said, there is much more to be \ndone. Now, unfortunately, we have more subtle and sometimes not so \nsubtle forms of voter intimidation and suppression. Voters too many \ntimes are being told of the wrong polling place or flyers and phone \ncalls tell people that the election was moved. I know in my State we \nhave struggled with misinformation going out around elections. Why is \nit that it is predominantly in our cities where the lines are the \nlongest, the voting machines are the oldest, and, in fact, there are \nfewer machines? We need to know we are not done with what this bill \nrepresents until those things are fixed, until every voting machine \nworks, until there is enough to make sure everyone can vote, until \nthere is a paper backup so we know the votes are being recorded \naccurately, and until every person or group that attempts to harass \nanybody in terms of exercising their American right to vote has been \nstopped.\n  These practices are a reminder that our laws are only as good as the \npeople who enforce them. That is the commitment we have behind it, to \nmake sure that the principles and ideals of our democracy and of \nAmerica are upheld.\n  Passing this bill is a very important step for us. I am pleased this \nhas been placed on the agenda and that we are going to come together \noverwhelmingly and pass it today. We need to make sure we are willing \nto take the next steps. We have election reform legislation introduced \nin the Senate that needs to be passed. For the life of me, I cannot \nimagine why when I go to the ATM machine, I can get a piece of paper, a \nreceipt that tells me about my transaction, and yet there is resistance \nto us having a paper backup so we know that in fact the integrity of \nour vote and the voting process has been maintained. I hope this will \nbe phase one in a series of things we do to make it clear that everyone \nin America has the right to vote, that we are stronger because of that. \nWe certainly know we are a better country, a stronger country because \nof the law that was passed in 1965, the Voting Rights Act, and that we \nwill be stronger because of this legislation's passage and that we, in \nfact, will be at our strongest and our best when we are fully committed \nto an accurate, full, and open voting process for every person and \nevery community in America.\n  I urge adoption of the bill and thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise to enthusiastically support the \nreauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. I will speak to that issue, \nbut with the permission of the leadership, following these remarks, I \nask unanimous consent that Senator Wyden and I be given a half an hour \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, above the dais, our Nation's motto, e \npluribus unum, is chiseled in the marble. That is more than a motto; it \nis one of America's greatest ideals. But it is an ideal that we are \nconstantly in an effort to realize as fully as is humanly possible. Our \nNation has made great progress on becoming one, and becoming one begins \nat the ballot box. Our Nation began at a time when even the institution \nof human slavery was tolerated--tragically for nearly 70 years--leading \nthen to a horrendous Civil War that claimed the lives of nearly a \nmillion Americans trying to fully realize what that motto means. The \ninstitution of slavery was ended--thankfully--too late but ended \nnevertheless.\n  In the bitter years that followed, the years of Reconstruction and \nall the heartache that flowed from the Civil War, there was a period of \ntime in part of our country where African Americans were denied access \nto the ballot box and were disenfranchised by that. But it isn't just \none region of the country where we have to constantly be vigilant about \nrace relations; it is a challenge all over America. The challenge \nbegins in every heart and in\n\n[[Page S7978]]\n\nevery home. It is a fact that the Jim Crow laws were specifically \ndesigned to intimidate African Americans from voting. Thankfully, with \nthe passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, under the signature of \nPresident Lyndon Johnson, the constitutional promise was fully \nrealized, and now we have an opportunity to extend it.\n  The Voting Rights Act is already a statute, but certain of its \nprovisions will expire if we do not do this. We have the privilege to \ndo so today.\n  The 15th amendment of the Constitution says: The right of citizens of \nthe United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United \nStates or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition \nof servitude. The 19th amendment was adopted later in 1920, which \nextended that right to women. But as I said, not until the Voting \nRights Act were all the subtle and insidious barriers dropped around \nthe country that prevented African Americans from exercising their \nfranchise.\n  Lyndon Johnson said, when he signed this act, that he did so so the \nfull blessings of American life can be fully realized. For the full \nblessing of American life begins at the ballot box. Tragically, not all \nAmericans exercise their right to vote, but those who want to should be \nable to have access, that their vote be cast and counted and that it be \ndone so without intimidation or without fear.\n  I rise to fully support this. My mother used to always say, treat \nothers as they would want to be treated. That is another way of saying, \ntreat others the way you would want to be treated. I have heard from \nmany of our African-American citizens who have urged my vote for this. \nI proudly and with pleasure do so today. I suspect we will vote on this \nlater.\n  I believe the law is a teacher. The Voting Rights Act has taught \nAmericans all over the continent that this is a central right and, \ntherefore, I believe we are doing the right thing in reauthorizing \nthese provisions that otherwise will expire.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Smith and Mr. Wyden pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 3701 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I also congratulate our colleagues who have \nworked tirelessly to ensure the authorization of the exceptionally \nimportant Voting Rights ct. This law plays a critical role in ensuring \nthat the right of all Americans to vote is protected. I intend to speak \nmore extensively later on about the Voting Rights Act.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senators \nCornyn and Hatch from the Judiciary Committee--Senator Hatch having \nchaired the committee for several years--and the assistant majority \nleader of the Senate, Senator McConnell, to speak on the legislation \nrenewing the Voting Rights Act.\n  Let me begin by saying I support the Voting Rights Act extension. \nThis law was critical to ending over 90 years of voting discrimination \nagainst African Americans in the South. Prior to this law, many States \nenforced discriminatory policies that were designed to and that did \nprevent African Americans from voting. Since that law was enacted, many \nof the same States where African Americans first voted in far lower \nnumbers than Whites now have higher percentage of African Americans \nvoting than other races.\n  The Voting Rights Act is a historic achievement that has corrected \none of the glaring injustices of our Nation's past. It has been an \nimportant step in our Nation's continuing progress toward our founding \nideal that all men are created equal.\n  Mr. President, I wish to address some questions that have been raised \nabout this reauthorization and ask my colleagues if they concur in my \ninterpretation.\n  The bill amends section 5 by legislatively abrogating two Supreme \nCourt cases interpreting the act: Reno v. Bossier Parish and Georgia v. \nAshcroft. These changes are related to one another. They are designed \nto operate together to achieve a common objective: the protection of \nnaturally occurring legislative districts with a majority of minority \nvoters.\n  The two changes to section 5 accomplish this goal by enhancing and \nrefocusing the operation of section 5. These changes simultaneously bar \nredistricters from denying a large, compact group of minority voters a \nmajority-minority district that it would receive in the absence of \ndiscrimination, and also to bar redistricters from breaking up a \ncompact majority-minority district that has been created in the past.\n  Some have raised the specter that Federal bureaucrats will abuse the \nauthority we are giving them under this provision, that they will \ncharacterize all manner of practices as having a ``discriminatory \npurpose.'' In particular, there has been some suggestion that the new \nlanguage will be abused by the Justice Department to require creation \nof the maximum number of Black majority districts possible or the \nmaximum number of so-called coalition or influence districts, in which \nminority voters are combined with enough White voters of similar \npartisan leanings to elect a candidate.\n  I don't think this is what the bill does, or that it can be \nreasonably read to do this. To say something has a discriminatory \npurpose is a term of art. It is the language of the jurisprudence of \nthe 14th amendment, of cases such as Washington v. Davis, which define \nwhen particular action constitutes racial discrimination and violates \nthe Constitution.\n  There is a well-defined body of case law defining when racial \ndiscrimination violates the U.S. Constitution. That case law provides \nclear borders to the limits of the Executive discretion being granted \nin this bill.\n  One traditional and important standard for identifying \nunconstitutional racial discrimination is to ask whether the challenged \ncourt action departs from normal rules of decision. In the case of \nredistricting, courts and the Justice Department would ask: Was the \ndecision not to create a Black majority district a departure from \nordinary districting rules? If a State has a large minority population \nconcentrated in a particular area, ordinarily rules of districting--\nfollowing political and geographic borders and keeping districts as \ncompact as possible--would recommend that these voters be given a \nmajority-minority district. If the redistricters went out of their way \nto avoid creating such a majority minority--one that would be created \nunder ordinary rules--that is unconstitutional racial discrimination, \nand it is banned by this bill. But this bill does not require the \ncreation of a majority-minority district that would not be created \nunder default districting rules. Nor does the bill require the creation \nof coalition or influence districts. It bars discrimination against \nracial minorities, not against electoral advantages sought by either \nRepublicans or Democrats. Moreover, no group is entitled to always be \nincluded in a district where the candidate of its party will prevail.\n  This section's abrogation of Bossier Parish does not permit a finding \nof discriminatory purpose that is based, in whole or in part, on a \nfailure to adopt the optimal or maximum number of compact minority \nopportunity districts or on a determination that the plan seeks \npartisan advantage or protects incumbents. With the language of this \nbill, we are importing the constitutional test in section 5, and \nnothing else. With this understanding, I support this improvement to \nsection 5 of the Voting Rights Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I add that I share the views of my \ncolleague from Arizona. Like he, I represent a State that is covered by \nsection 5 of the Voting Rights Act which is one of the sections that is \nbeing reauthorized today, hopefully. I thus paid close attention to the \nchanges being made in that section.\n  Like my colleague from Arizona, I supported the provision that \neffectively instructs the Justice Department to refuse to preclear a \nvoting practice that is motivated by a discriminatory, unconstitutional \npurpose. I also agree this is all this change does. It does not \nauthorize the Justice Department to define for itself what is a \n``discriminatory purpose.'' The Constitution and the courts have \nalready done that, and it is that constitutional\n\n[[Page S7979]]\n\ndefinition that is being incorporated in this legislation.\n  That standard bars discrimination against a racial group, and it does \nnot require discrimination in favor of any racial group. Thus, it does \nnot require those drawing electoral maps to create misshapen districts \nsimply in order to create as many majority-minority districts as \npossible. Nor does it require that minority voters be placed as often \nas possible in districts where candidates of the party they support \nwill prevail.\n  The equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution does not say all \ncitizens are equal, but that some are more equal than others. Nor \nshould the Voting Rights Act say that. The Voting Rights Act should not \nbe read to require creation of so-called coalition districts that \nproduce a Democratic or a Republican representative, as the case may \nbe. I think that would raise serious constitutional questions if we \nadopted a free-flowing definition of purpose--or authorized the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice to invent one--that is untethered from the \nConstitution itself. I think this is sufficiently clear from the bill's \nincorporation of constitutional terms of art that I am confident this \nis how the provision will be applied by the Justice Department and by \nthe courts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would simply add there is a general \nagreement among Senators on this point. If someone is saying the bill \nauthorizes the Justice Department to block a voting change because of a \nperceived discriminatory purpose that does not violate the \nConstitution, I have not heard them say it. Therefore, the bill should \nnot be construed to require the creation of any district other than the \nmajority-minority district that would be created if race were not \nconsidered--that would be created if instead only traditional \ndistricting principles were applied. Certainly a constitutionally \ngrounded approach does not--does not--require the creation of the \nmaximum number of majority-minority or Democratic or, for that matter, \nRepublican-leaning districts.\n  If those doing the redistricting refuse to create a naturally \noccurring majority-minority district, they are discriminating by race. \nBut if they simply refuse to create a district where different races \ncombine to elect a candidate of their preferred party, the \ndiscrimination is not against the races--it is hard to see how anyone \ncould discriminate against both races by the same act--but rather it is \nagainst that party. And as unhappy as that party might be about being \ndenied such a district, the denial does not violate the Constitution. \nObviously, giving the Justice Department discretion to redefine what \n``discriminatory purpose'' means would be controversial. This is \nconsensus legislation precisely because it avoids such litigation \ntraps. It enforces the Constitution's requirements and no more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think the point the distinguished assistant \nmajority leader made is very important, and I am glad there is \nagreement on this important matter.\n  I also wish to discuss one other of the bill's changes to section 5. \nThat is the provision abrogating the Supreme Court's decision in \nGeorgia v. Ashcroft. That Supreme Court case held that, when conducting \na retrogression analysis of section 5 under the act, a court or the \nJustice Department should gauge whether a new electoral map has \ndiminished a minority group's opportunities to participate in the \npolitical process by looking, in part, to whether the new plan creates \ncoalition districts, or influences districts--that is the term they \nuse--whether it protects positions in legislative leadership for \nminority representatives, and whether minority representatives support \nthe new plan.\n  Many people objected to this aspect of the Ashcroft decision because \nof its perceived potential to put a partisan thumb on the scale, so to \nspeak, in the redistricting process. Their concern was if the fact that \na coalition or influence district elects a candidate that minority \nvoters largely voted for, then even if that candidate was not the \nminority group's preferred candidate of choice, any plan that does not \npreserve that district would be considered retrogressive under the \nVoting Rights Act.\n  Similarly, there was concern that under Ashcroft, if a new voting map \nwere to give advantage to legislative races to one party, and minority \nrepresentatives--including committee chairmen and legislative leaders--\noverwhelmingly were members of the opposite party, then that plan, too, \nwould be deemed retrogressive for that reason.\n  Personally, I do not think the Ashcroft decision should be read that \nway. I think it is clear the court intended to give States the option \nof using influence or coalition districts, but it did not intend to \nrequire the use of such districts, or to prevent them from later \nchanging such districts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as one of the strong supporters of the \nVoting Rights Act, having supported it before in my Senate service, I \nhave been very interested and, frankly, pleased with the comments that \nhave been made. Let me add to what Senator Kyl said.\n  Moreover, even if we are wrong about how George v. Ashcroft would \nhave been interpreted and applied in the future, in any event, today's \nbill clearly ends any risk that section 5 of the Voting Rights Act will \nbe applied as a one-way ratchet favoring Democrats or Republicans at \nthe expense of one or the other.\n  As the House committee report makes clear, the bill ``rejects'' the \nSupreme Court's interpretation of section 5 in George v. Ashcroft and \nestablishes that the purpose of section 5's protection of minority \nvoters is, in the words of the bill's new subsection (d), to ``protect \nthe ability of such citizens to elect their preferred candidates of \nchoice.''\n  It is important to emphasize this language does not protect just any \ndistrict with a representative who gets elected with some minority \nvotes. Rather, it protects only a district in which ``such citizens''--\nminority citizens--are the ones selecting their ``preferred candidate \nof choice'' with their own voting power. I emphasize the words ``such \ncitizens'' and ``preferred'' because they are key to this part of the \nbill and keep it consistent with the language abrogating Bossier \nParish. Both parts have a limited but important purpose: protecting \nnaturally occurring majority-minority districts.\n  The new subsection guarantees that districters will not discriminate \nagainst creating such districts. And this new subsection (d) ensures \nthey will not break up such districts, at least not when neutral \ndistricting principles continue to commend the creation of such a \ndistrict.\n  I note in passing that forcing the preservation of a noncompact \nmajority-minority district likely would run afoul of the Supreme \nCourt's ruling against racial gerrymanders in Shaw v. Reno. And, like \nsubsection (c), all that subsection (d) does is protect naturally \noccurring majority-minority districts. By limiting non-retrogression \nrequirements to districts in which ``such minority citizens'' are able \nwith their own vote power to elect ``preferred candidates of choice''--\nnot just a candidate of choice settled for when forced to compromise \nwith other groups--the bill limits section 5 to protecting those \nnaturally occurring, compact majority-minority districts with which \nsection 5 was originally concerned.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me just say one final thing. I very much \nagree with Senator Hatch that the bill limits section 5, protecting \nthose naturally occurring, compact majority-minority districts with \nwhich section 5 was originally concerned, and that nothing in this \nsection of the act should be interpreted to require that the \ncompetitive position of the political party favored by minority voters \nbe maintained or enhanced in any district. This change made by the bill \nis not intended to preserve or ensure the electability of candidates of \nany political party, even if that party's candidates are supported by \nmembers of minority groups.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I agree very much, and I am glad that \nwe can put this issue to bed.\n  By anchoring section 5 in the concept of ``preferred candidates of \nchoice''--another term of art whose meaning is\n\n[[Page S7980]]\n\ncemented in the Supreme Court's precedents--I think this bill \neliminates any risk that section 5 of the Voting Rights Act will be \ninterpreted to protect coalitions and influence districts and other \ntools of purely partisan gerrymanders. The term ``preferred candidates \nof choice'' has a clear meaning in the court's precedents: Minority \ncandidates elected by a minority community.\n  I think the use of this language eliminates the risk that courts will \nconstrue section 5 to protect candidates who rely on minority votes for \ntheir margin of victory in the general election but are not elected by \na majority-minority district. And I agree that it may be good policy \nfor a State to create districts in which different groups will combine \nto elect a common party candidate, but Federal law should not be used \nto require that the State permanently preserve such a district.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would simply add to the comments of the \nassistant majority leader that I, too, am glad that we have eliminated \nany risk in Georgia v. Ashcroft, and section 5 would be applied to \nrequire preservation of anything other than districts that allow \nnaturally occurring minority-group majorities to elect minority \ncandidates. Locking into place so-called coalition or influence \ndistricts would wreak havoc with the redistricting process and would \nstretch the Voting Rights Act beyond the scope of the Congress's \nauthority under the 14th amendment.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have some additional remarks that I \nwould like to make on this important legislation.\n  Forty-one years ago, when signing the landmark Voting Rights Act of \n1965 into law, Lyndon Johnson, the President of the United States, a \nformer member of the Senate whose seat I am privileged to hold, \ndescribed the act's passage as ``a triumph for freedom as huge as any \nvictory that has ever been won on any battlefield.'' President \nJohnson's words captured the importance of the act's passage. It was a \nhard-fought victory at a tense time in American history.\n  It is no secret why the Voting Rights Act was necessary. It was \nadopted at the height of the civil rights movement, when numerous \njurisdictions throughout the United States had intentionally, \nsystematically disenfranchised Blacks and other minorities from the \nelectoral process.\n  As a witness before the Senate Judiciary Committee noted, a Senate \nreport from 1965 found that in every voting discrimination suit brought \nagainst Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi, both the district court \nand the Court of Appeals found ``discriminatory use of tests and \ndevices''--devices such as literacy, knowledge, and moral character \ntests. The Senate concluded that these were not ``isolated deviations \nfrom the norm'' but, instead, ``had been pursuant to a pattern or a \npractice of racial discrimination.'' Such practices had driven down to \n29.3 percent the average registration rate for Black citizens in these \nStates--29.3 percent.\n  Worse yet, violence and brutality were common. In 1961, a Black voter \nregistration drive worker in McComb, MS was beaten by a cousin of the \nsheriff; a worker was ordered out of the registrar's office at gunpoint \nand then hit with a pistol; a Black sympathizer was murdered by a State \nrepresentative; another Black who asked for Justice Department \nprotection to testify at the inquest was beaten and killed 3 years \nlater; a White activist's eye was gouged out; and, finally, 12 student \nnonviolent coordinating committee workers and local supporters were \nfined and sentenced to substantial terms in jail. And those were just \nsome of the many terrible incidents that occurred.\n  This type of bigotry and hatred at the polls, coupled with escalating \nviolence and even the murder of activists, is the backdrop against \nwhich the Voting Rights Act was adopted--permanently enshrining into \nlaw the long-unfulfilled promise of citizenship and democratic \nparticipation for all Americans as guaranteed by the 15th amendment to \nthe U.S. Constitution.\n  The permanence of the Voting Rights Act is something that I am afraid \nis sometimes misunderstood or misstated in the popular press. The act's \ncore provision found that section 2 prohibits the denial or abridgement \nof the right of any citizen to vote on account of race or color.\n  That provision is permanent. That provision will never expire, and we \nare not addressing this permanent provision by the reauthorization that \nwe will vote on today.\n  Instead, we are addressing what at the time was a temporary, 5-year \nperiod where provisions were adopted to subject certain jurisdictions \nto Federal oversight of the voting laws and procedures until the intent \nof the Voting Rights Act was accomplished. This provision, section 5, \nalong with later-added provisions designed to protect voters from \ndiscrimination based upon limited English proficiency, has been renewed \nseveral times since it was originally passed and will expire in the \nsummer of 2007. Those are the provisions which we are addressing here \ntoday and which this vote today will reauthorize.\n  Today, we are considering the renewal of these provisions at a time \nwhen we can look back with some pride as a country and say that the \nVoting Rights Act has fulfilled its promise. It worked.\n  Today, we live in a different--albeit still imperfect--world. Today, \nno one can claim that the kind of systemic, invidious practices that \nplagued our election systems 40 years ago still exist in America. \nToday, the voter registration rates among Blacks, for example, in the \ncovered jurisdictions is over 68.1 percent, as this chart indicates, \nhigher than the 62.2 percent found in noncovered jurisdictions.\n  Let me repeat that, Mr. President, because I think it is important. \nEarlier, you heard me say that as a result of the violence and the \ndiscrimination against Black voters in three Southern States before the \nVoting Rights Act was passed, voter registration rates for African \nAmericans was about 29 percent. But today, 40 years later, as a result \nof the fact that the Voting Rights Act has accomplished its purpose, we \nnow see voting registration rates nationwide at 62.2 percent. Perhaps \nthe most amazing thing is that the rate of voter registration in those \nareas that were covered by section 5, because they had a history of \ndiscrimination and violation of the voting rights of minority voters, \nis actually higher than the rest of the country--68.1 percent--as \nopposed to 62.2 percent for the noncovered jurisdictions.\n  A review of the voter registration data since the act's original \npassage shows that the covered jurisdictions have demonstrated equal or \nhigher voter registration rates among Black voters as noncovered \njurisdictions since the mid-1970s.\n\n  I realize, though, this is not the only measure of the performance of \nthe act. Another important indicator of its success is the continual \ndecline--almost to the point of statistically negligible numbers--of \nobjections issued by the Department of Justice to plans submitted under \nsection 5 for pre clearance. You can see on this chart that I have \ndemonstrated here, going back to 1982, to 2005--and again, this is for \nthe nine covered jurisdictions--this is what we are focusing on with \nthis reauthorization. In those nine covered jurisdictions that were \nrequired under section 5 to submit their election changes for \npreclearance, you see that in 1982, for 2,848 submissions, there were \n67 objections to those changes or a rate of roughly 2.32 percent. But \nif you jump down to 2005--let's go to 1995--it shows that this is \nreally a bipartisan success under both Republican and Democrat \nPresidential administrations. In 1995, you can see that out of 3,999 \nsubmissions, requests for pre clearance under section 5, there were \nonly 19 objections as required through the required procedures.\n  So you see actually the number of objections dropping from 2.32 \npercent to, in 1995, under one-half of 1 percent. And the good news is, \nit just keeps getting better. In 2005, there were 3,811 submissions, \nand only 1 objection for preclearance of a change in voting practices \nor procedures in the covered jurisdictions. So I would submit that both \nthe voter registration rates for African American voters in the covered \njurisdictions, and the plummeting, really, of objections sustained to \nsubmissions requesting preclearance under\n\n[[Page S7981]]\n\nsection 5, are strong and compelling evidence that, in fact, the Voting \nRights Act has achieved--largely achieved--the purposes that Congress \nhad hoped for and that no doubt millions of people who had previously \nbeen disenfranchised had prayed for.\n  The evidence demonstrates the continued improvement of access to \noffice for minorities. The statistics in the House record indicate that \nhundreds of minorities are now serving--not just getting to vote, they \nare actually serving in elected office, accomplishing again one of the \nimportant purposes of the Voting Rights Act. Indeed, in Georgia, \nminorities are elected at rates proportionate to or higher than the \nnumbers proportionate to the general population would otherwise \nindicate. While Georgia's population is 28.7 percent African American, \n30.7 percent of its delegation to the United States House of \nRepresentatives, and 26.5 percent of the officials elected statewide \nare African American, a remarkable accomplishment.\n  Black candidates in Mississippi have achieved similar success. The \nState's population is 36.3 percent African American, and 29.5 percent \nof its representatives in the State House, and 25 percent of its \ndelegation in the United States House of Representatives are African \nAmerican.\n  In light of this strong indication that the act has largely achieved \nthe purposes that Congress had intended, of course, the logical \nquestion before us is whether these provisions under section 5 should \nbe reauthorized. The Judiciary Committee hearings were enlightening on \nthis point, and I want to congratulate Chairman Specter for readily \nceding to requests that were made to have a complete record so that not \nonly Congress but the courts that may later examine this record can see \nwhat the facts are. Senator Specter worked hard to hold a sufficient \nnumber of fair and balanced hearings, but given our busy schedule on \nthe Senate floor, that was not always easy to accomplish. However, I \nthink it might have been beneficial for the long-term viability and \nsuccess of the Voting Rights Act had we engaged in serious, reasoned \ndeliberation over some of the suggested possible improvements, some \nsuggested by our witnesses--improvements that would underscore the \nact's original purpose. It would modernize it to reflect today's \nreality. It would possibly expand the coverage of section 5 to \njurisdictions where recent abuses have taken place or, perhaps, have \nimproved the so-called bailout procedures for those jurisdictions that \nhad a successful record of remedying, indeed eliminating, \ndiscrimination when it comes to voting rights.\n\n  One idea that was offered was to update the coverage formula. I don't \nknow if that is a good idea, but I would like to know. Some suggest \nthat such an update would gut the act. I, for one, certainly don't want \nto see that happen. I don't want to see the act gutted. But I am \nskeptical that this would be the result. The amendment that was voted \non in the House, for example, would have updated the coverage trigger \nto the most recent three Presidential elections from the current point, \nor trigger, of 1964, 1968, and 1972 elections.\n  As I understand it, the map, after an update to cover the most recent \nthree Presidential elections, would look something like this. In other \nwords, rather than the nine covered jurisdictions, you would see \njurisdictions around the country, both at the State and local level--\nprimarily at the local level--that would focus on the places where the \nproblems really do exist and where the record demonstrates with some \njustification for the assertion of Federal power and intrusion into the \nlocal and State electoral processes.\n  If this is an accurate reflection of the effects of updating the \ntrigger to the most recent three Presidential elections, it certainly \nchanges the map. But I suggest, just looking at this, it hardly guts \nit.\n  It would have also been beneficial for us to have had a full \ndiscussion of ways to improve the act to ensure its important \nprovisions were applied in a congruent and proportional way, something \nthe Supreme Court will take into consideration when it considers the \nrenewed act.\n  Yesterday, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted overwhelmingly to \nextend the expiring provisions of the act and adopt several substantial \nrevisions included by the House, so I think it is important to comment \non the House revisions to the act. In other words, we are not just \nreauthorizing the Voting Rights Act as it existed previously, there \nhave been changes made. So I think it is important for us to identify \nthose changes and reflect on them for a moment.\n  There has been some debate about the meaning of these provisions. My \nunderstanding is that the purpose of these provisions is fairly \nstraightforward, and I think the House legislative history reflects \nthis; that is, the purpose is to ensure minorities are not prevented \nfrom holding elected offices in bodies such as Congress and ensure that \nno intentional, unconstitutional discrimination is allowed to proceed. \nIt is important that our understanding about these provisions be clear \nso that their application will be likewise clear.\n  I think the colloquy that we had on the Senate floor just a few \nmoments ago helps to make that as clear as we possibly can.\n  In short, the Voting Rights Act is simply the most important and most \neffective civil rights legislation ever passed, bar none. The extension \nof the expiring provisions is important for the continued protection of \nvoting rights, even though it would have been preferable and even \npossibly constitutionally advisable for us to review the application of \nthe act's preclearance and other provisions.\n  Unfortunately, the act's language was a bit of a foregone conclusion, \nprohibiting the kind of debate and discussion and perhaps amendment \nprocess that might have been helpful to protect the act against future \nlegal challenges.\n  Few issues are as fundamental to our system of democracy and the \npromise of equal justice under law as the Voting Rights Act. I support \nreauthorization of the expiring provisions because the purpose of the \nVoting Rights Act is genuine, its goals are noble, and its success, as \nI hope to have demonstrated, is unparalleled.\n  But I do want to say in conclusion that I share the concerns \nexpressed by Chief Justice Roberts in the most recent redistricting \ncase that has been heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. I hope the day will \ncome when we will no longer, to use his words, be ``divvying us up by \nrace.''\n  It is my sincere hope that we will move beyond distinctions based on \nrace in our policymaking, lest we, in the words of Justice Anthony \nKennedy, make ``the offensive and demeaning assumption that voters of a \nparticular race, because of their race, think alike, share the same \npolitical interests, and will prefer the same candidates at the polls.\n  The question in the end is, Is this bill that we will vote on today \nthe very best possible product?\n  I would have to say the answer to that is, apparently not.\n  In response to the question, is this the very best that we can do at \nthis time?'' I would have to conclude, yes, it is. And I support it for \nthat reason.\n  I see my distinguished colleague from New York on the Senate floor.\n  I yield the floor to her and anyone else who seeks an opportunity to \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am also here to voice my support for \nthe Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights \nAct Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006. It is so fitting that \nthis legislation reauthorizing this landmark Civil Rights Act would be \nnamed for three women who are so well known as heroines of the struggle \nfor civil rights in our own country.\n  Thousands of Americans risked their lives, and some unfortunately \nlost them, during the civil rights movement to challenge an electoral \nsystem that prevented millions of our fellow citizens from exercising \ntheir constitutional right to vote.\n  After a long struggle by activists and everyday citizens, President \nJohnson introduced and eventually signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 \ninto law.\n  I vividly remember the day, 41 years ago, when I sat in front of our \nlittle black and white television set and watched President Johnson \nannounce the signing into law of the Voting Rights Act. He opened his \nspeech to the Nation that night with these memorable words:\n\n\n[[Page S7982]]\n\n\n       I speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of \n     democracy.\n\n  That was the culmination of a long struggle which continues even now \nbecause we still must work vigilantly to make certain that those who \ntry to vote are allowed to do so, and that we keep watch to guarantee \nthat every vote is counted.\n  President Johnson was right all those years ago. When you deny a \nperson his or her right to vote, you strip that individual of dignity \nand you weaken our democracy. The endurance of our democracy requires \nconstant vigilance, a lesson that has been reinforced by the last two \nPresidential elections, both of which were affected by widespread \nallegations of voter disenfranchisement.\n  I believe we have a moral as well as a political and historical \nobligation to ensure the integrity of our voting process. That was our \nNation's obligation in 1965; it remains our obligation today.\n  As we turn on our news and see the sights of conflict, as we hear the \nstories of sectarian violence, as we struggle to help nations \nunderstand and adopt democracy in their own lands, we more than ever \nmust ensure that America is the place where the right to vote is fully \nand equally available to every citizen.\n  We still have work to do, to renew protections for the right to vote, \nto enforce safeguards that guarantee the right to vote, and strengthen \nour election laws so that our right to vote is not impeded by accident \nor abuse. While parts of the Voting Rights Act are permanent, there are \nthree important sections set to expire next year unless they are \nrenewed.\n  Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act requires that the Federal \nGovernment or a Federal court approve or, in the language of the act, \n``preclear'' all changes to voting procedures by jurisdictions that \nhave a history of discrimination. The importance of this provision \ncannot be overstated. Section 5 is the bulwark. It stands to ensure \nthat all minorities have equal access to the ballot box. Not only has \nSection 5 been used to strike down potentially discriminatory changes \nto election laws, but it has also deterred them.\n  Equally important is the reauthorization of sections 6 through 9, \nwhich authorize the Federal Government to send examiners and observers \nto jurisdictions with a history of voter discrimination and voter \nintimidation, and to ensure that by the presence of the Federal \nGovernment--which represents all of us--no one will engage in such \ndespicable behavior.\n  Finally, section 203 of the Voting Rights Act requires bilingual \nassistance for areas with a concentration of citizens with limited \nEnglish proficiency, including bilingual ballots, if necessary. Voters \nwith limited English proficiency would in many instances be unable to \nparticipate in our political process and to fully exercise their rights \nof citizenship if this assistance were not available to help them \nunderstand what is on a ballot.\n  Sometimes, even though I speak English, I think I need help \nunderstanding what is on some of our ballots when we have all kinds of \nbond issues and other kinds of activity. Imagine if you are, as are \nsome of the people I have met, a legal immigrant from Latin America who \nis so proud to be a citizen and so worried she will make a mistake when \nshe first goes to vote, or an elderly gentleman who came to this \ncountry fleeing oppression in the former Soviet Union, who speaks only \nRussian but has become a citizen, is learning English and wants to be \nable to understand what he is voting for. At a time when we are \nembroiled in a debate about how best to assimilate immigrants and to \nsend out the message that we want people in our country to learn \nEnglish, to participate as citizens, we don't want to set up any \nartificial barriers to them feeling totally involved in and supportive \nof and welcomed by our great democracy.\n  These expiring sections of the Voting Rights Act, sections 5, 203, 6 \nthrough 9, have all been reauthorized--first in the House, then in the \nJudiciary Committee yesterday here in the Senate. I am very pleased \nthat has happened because I think we still need them.\n  Of course, we have made so much progress. I am very proud of the \nprogress our Nation has made, when you go back and look over more than \n200 years of history, what we have accomplished--it is just a \nmiraculous, wonderful happening that could only occur in this great \ncountry of ours where we have steadily and surely knocked down the \nbarriers to participation.\n  But are we perfect? Of course not. There is no such thing as \nperfection on this Earth. We have survived as a nation and as the \noldest democracy in part because we have had checks and balances and we \nhave been under the rule of law, not of men. So this reauthorization is \ncritical to making sure we still have the framework to make it possible \nfor every person to believe that he or she can vote, and that vote will \nmatter. Of course, the Voting Rights Act only works if it is actually \nenforced. We can have all the laws in the world. We have seen in so \nmany authoritarian regimes, totalitarian regimes, where they have great \nsounding laws. The laws sound as though they are next to paradise, but \nit does not matter because no one enforces the laws.\n\n  Unfortunately, I am worried we may be at that point in our own \ncountry when it comes to voting rights. The civil rights division at \nthe Department of Justice has been purged by many of the people, career \nlawyers who enforced the law regardless of whether it was against \nDemocrats or Republicans or in any part of the country. Now it is \nfilled with political appointees who often choose ideology over \nevidence. That has resulted in a failure to enforce the Voting Rights \nAct. There are lots of examples. Look at the news coverage this past \nDecember: Six career lawyers and two analysts in the Department of \nJustice's civil rights division, it was reported, were basically \noverruled when they made recommendations about the Texas redistricting \nplan. The civil rights division officials were overruled when they \nrecommended against Georgia's voter photo ID requirement which \ndisadvantaged African Americans, the elderly, and other voters. \nFinally, that law was enjoined by a Federal court.\n  These are isolated incidents in some people's minds, but I see, \nunfortunately, a pattern. We need to make sure our laws have teeth; \notherwise, they are just for show, they do not make any difference at \nall. Unfortunately, almost two-thirds of the lawyers in the voting \nsection of the civil rights division have left in the last few years. \nThat sends a very disconcerting message that maybe the Voting Rights \nAct will be honored by word but not by deed.\n  I hope when we reauthorize it, as I am confident we will do in the \nSenate, we will send a message that we expect it to be enforced and \nthat it means something; otherwise, we are not going to be fulfilling \nthe promise of a Constitution that sets voting and democracy at its \ncore. I hope we will not only reauthorize the Voting Rights Act, that \nwe will enforce the Voting Rights Act and, third, we will change some \nof our other laws to protect against some of the abuses now taking \nplace around the country when it comes to voting.\n  We have to strengthen our electoral system so that basic democratic \nvalues are protected as voting technology evolves and as it threatens \nto undermine the right to vote. We need to put a few simple principles \ninto law and we should do it sooner rather than later so that we count \nevery vote and we make sure every vote is counted.\n  That is why I drafted and introduced, along with some of my \ncolleagues in both Houses, the Count Every Vote Act, because I believe \nall Americans ought to have a reasonable opportunity to register and \ncast their vote if they are citizens. That should be part of being a \ncitizen.\n  In fact, I met with a group of young high school students from New \nYork. We were talking about how we can get more young people involved \nin voting. One of them asked, when we turn 18, why aren't we \nautomatically registered? That is a great idea. Citizens should be \nautomatically registered. We need to make this part of the growing up \nin America. You turn 18, you get registered to vote, beginning a \nlifetime habit of voting.\n  We also need to make sure every American citizen will be able to \ncount on the fact that their name will not be illegally purged from the \nvoter roles. We have seen that happen. It is still happening. What \nhappens is, someone\n\n[[Page S7983]]\n\nin the political position of a State says, we will purge the voter \nroles to get rid of people who have moved or who may not be eligible to \nvote. I don't disagree with that. People who don't live in a \njurisdiction or are not eligible should not be permitted to vote.\n\n  Instead of purging on that very limited basis, oftentimes they purge \nhundreds and thousands of people unfairly, unlawfully. Someone shows up \nto vote and they are told, we are sorry, you are not registered to \nvote. The person does not know what has happened, but they are \nprohibited from voting.\n  Every American voter who shows up at the polls should be confident \nthey do not have to wait hours to cast ballots. I did a town hall \nmeeting in Cleveland with my friend Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs \nJones. We heard testimony from some students from Kenyon College who \nhad to wait for 10 and 12 hours to be able to vote. They were eligible, \nthey were registered, they were anxious to vote, and because of the way \nthe number of voting machines was allocated and the discouragement that \nwas meant to be sent that you would have to wait so long, it was an \nunfair treatment of these young people and not in keeping with our \ndesire to increase the number of people who vote in our country.\n  We also need to make sure the system of voting has not been \ncompromised by politics or partisanship. It is flat wrong for someone \nwho runs an election to also be running in the election and thereby be \nsupervising their own election, or for someone to be running for \nelection to some position, get the support of the person running the \nelection as his campaign manager or spokesman. That is a conflict of \ninterest. That ought to be prohibited. People need to feel, and they \nhave every right to feel, confidence in the integrity of our electoral \nsystem.\n  Finally, every American voter should know there are adequate \nsafeguards against abuses or mistakes caused by the new computerized \nvoting machines. There have been so many problems. They have broken \ndown, they have double counted, they have failed to count, tests have \nbeen run showing how easy they are to hack into. We do not need that. \nWe need a system people can count on. If we can go to an ATM and \nwithdraw money, if we can have all the other advantages from access to \ncomputers and the Internet, for goodness sakes, we ought to be able to \nuse electronic voting without raising questions about whether it is \nbeing truthful, whether it is being accurate, and whether it is even \nbeing operated correctly.\n  This effort to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act is part of a larger \nstruggle about basic rights, basic values, and basic opportunities. It \nis, at root, a struggle to ensure that we live up to the promise of \ndemocracy in this Nation. We do need to reinstate the decades-old \nvoting rights protections. We need to enforce those voting rights \npresentations. We need to strengthen those voting rights protections. \nWe need to do that because that is what we are as Americans. That is \nwhat we expect of ourselves.\n  I hope after we reauthorize the Voting Rights Act, which I am \nconfident we are going to do, then we turn our attention to making sure \nwe enforce it, that we are doing everything we can to encourage people \nto vote, make it easy for them to vote, and make sure that every vote \ncounts.\n  Our ideals are important to us as Americans. Our principles about who \nwe are, what we believe in, our core values as to what it means to be \nan American. I hope and trust when it comes to the most important \nfunction in a democracy--namely, running elections and giving people \nthe right to make decisions about who governs us--that we will be \nsecond to none. We cannot say that now because other countries, \nfrankly, are doing a better job than we are, but today is a good first \nstep to get us back on the track of making sure that the world's oldest \ndemocracy demonstrates clearly we know how to run elections that people \nhave confidence and trust in and that we want every single citizen to \nfeel welcome to participate and to make the decisions that will \ndetermine the future of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in support of a bill to extend \nthe expiring provisions of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. While I support \nthis bill, I continue to have some serious concerns with several \naspects of it, not the least of which is the extension for an \nextraordinary 25 years.\n  The act, originally passed in 1965, was unquestionably needed to \nbring the promise of the Constitution to many of our citizens who had \nbeen shut out of our national political process. The original act, a \nremedial measure to deal with past discrimination, provided that \ncertain provisions would sunset after 5 years. I have grave concerns \nthat a 25-year extension may well, by itself, doom the act in a future \nconstitutional challenge, given the Supreme Court's jurisprudence \nconcerning the need for narrowly tailored remedial measures to deal \nwith past discrimination.\n  Members of the House raised legitimate concerns last week and \nadvanced positive amendments which I believe would have strengthened \nthis bill and updated it to reflect the reality of profoundly improved \nrace relations which exist today in my home State of Georgia.\n  Let me talk about the positive progress. Today, a higher percentage \nof Black citizens in Georgia are registered to vote than are White \ncitizens: 66 percent compared to 59 percent. Today, a higher percentage \nof Black citizens in Georgia turn out the vote than do White citizens: \n51 percent compared to 48 percent. The number of Black elected \nofficials in Georgia has climbed steadily, from 30 in 1970 to 249 in \n1980, a 730-percent increase, to 582 in 2000.\n  Let me talk about my home county which is in rural Georgia, the very \nsouthern part of our State. Our community is a beneficiary of this \nVoting Rights Act. Over the years, several members of our Black \ncommunity have been elected to city council, county commission, and \nschool board posts.\n  Men and women such as Wesley Ball, Frank Wilson, Lamont Alderman, \nJustina Lewis, George Walker, Trudy Hill, Betty Hagin, Luke Strong, \nJr., the Rev. Ronald Wilson, Debra Boyd, and Stine George. All of these \noutstanding men and women have been very professional public servants \nin representing our school board, our city, as well as our county.\n  I am very proud to live in a city and county that has had individuals \nsuch as these as its representatives.\n  Currently, there are nine statewide Black elected officials in \nGeorgia, most of whom, interestingly enough, defeated White opponents, \nincluding the current attorney general, three State supreme court \njustices, including the chief justice, and the State labor \ncommissioner.\n  Today, 4 of Georgia's 13 Members of the U.S. House are Black, two of \nwhom represent majority White districts.\n  One of the continuing concerns about the bill as currently written is \nit mandates that Georgia continues to be a ``covered jurisdiction.'' \nThat designation requires any election law change, no matter how minor, \nto be precleared by a Federal bureaucracy. Other States with much less \nimpressive minority progress and less impressive minority participation \nare not covered, while Georgia is. Many of us share the view that this \nseems both unfair and unwise.\n  Only a short while ago my colleague from Illinois acknowledged that \nvoting discrimination occurs in noncovered States, yet he and others \nleave unaddressed the issue of whether the formula adopted in 1964 \nshould be modernized to reflect the reality of 2006, so that \nappropriate discrimination can be dealt with wherever it exists.\n  Despite these concerns, I will vote in favor of this bill. It is a \nsymbol of progress to so many of our citizens and it has made a \ndifference in the lives of a generation of Georgians, Black and White.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for up \nto 20 minutes after the distinguished Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I modify my request and ask unanimous \nconsent\n\n[[Page S7984]]\n\nthat after Senator Obama speaks, and after a Republican has spoken \nafter Senator Obama, that I could be recognized for up to 20 minutes at \nthat time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the revised unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I will not object, but I say to the Senator from \nOregon, if we could have the Senator from Illinois proceed, then the \nSenator from South Carolina, Mr. Graham, proceed, and then the Senator \nfrom Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, that is exactly the kind of scenario I \nenvisioned, and I appreciate that from the Senator from Georgia, and \nrenew my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise today both humbled and honored by the \nopportunity to express my support for renewal of the expiring \nprovisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. I thank the many people \ninside and outside Congress who have worked so hard over the past year \nto get us here. We owe a great debt of gratitude to the leadership on \nboth sides of the aisle. We owe special thanks to Chairmen \nSensenbrenner and Specter, Ranking Members Conyers and Leahy, and \nRepresentative Mel Watt. Without their hard work and dedication, and \nthe support of voting rights advocates across the country, I doubt this \nbill would have come before us so soon.\n  I thank both Chambers and both sides of the aisle, as well, for \ngetting this done with the same broad support that drove the original \nact 40 years ago. At a time when Americans are frustrated with the \npartisan bickering that too often stalls our work, the refreshing \ndisplay of bipartisanship we are seeing today reflects our collective \nbelief in the success of the act and reminds us of how effective we can \nbe when we work together.\n  Nobody can deny we have come a long way since 1965. Look at the \nregistration numbers. Only 2 years after the passage of the original \nact, registration numbers for minority voters in some States doubled. \nSoon after, not a single State covered by the Voting Rights Act had \nregistered less than half of its minority voting-age population.\n  Look at the influence of African-American elected officials at every \nsingle level of government. There are African-American Members of \nCongress. Since 2001, our Nation's top diplomat has been African \nAmerican. In fact, most of America's elected African-American officials \ncome from States covered by section 5 of the Voting Rights Act--States \nsuch as Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Georgia.\n  But to me, the most striking evidence of our progress can be found \nright across this building in my dear friend Congressman John Lewis, \nwho was on the front lines of the civil rights movement, risking life \nand limb for freedom. On March 7, 1965, he led 600 peaceful protesters, \ndemanding the right to vote, across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, \nAL. I have often thought about the people on the Edmund Pettus Bridge \nthat day, not only John Lewis and Hosea Williams, who led the march, \nbut the hundreds of everyday Americans who left their homes and their \nchurches to join it--Blacks and Whites, teenagers, children, teachers, \nbankers, shopkeepers; what Dr. King called a beloved community of God's \nchildren ready to stand for freedom.\n  I wonder sometimes: Where did they find that kind of courage? When \nyou are facing row after row of State troopers on horseback, armed with \nbilly clubs and tear gas--when they are coming toward you spewing \nhatred and violence--how do you simply stop, kneel down, and pray to \nthe Lord for salvation?\n  But the most amazing thing of all is that after that day, after John \nLewis was beaten within an inch of his life, after people's heads were \ngashed open and their eyes were burned, and they watched their \nchildren's innocence literally beaten out of them--after all that, they \nwent back and marched again. They marched again. They crossed the \nbridge. They awakened a nation's conscience, and not 5 months later the \nVoting Rights Act of 1965 was signed into law. It was reauthorized in \n1970, in 1975, and in 1982.\n  Now, in 2006, John Lewis--the physical scars of those marches still \nvisible--is an original cosponsor of the fourth reauthorization of the \nVoting Rights Act. He was joined last week by 389 of his House \ncolleagues in voting for its passage.\n  There were some in the House, and there may be some in the Senate, \nwho argue that the act is no longer needed, that the protections of \nsection 5's ``preclearance'' requirement--a requirement that ensures \ncertain States are upholding the right to vote--are targeting the wrong \nStates. Unfortunately, the evidence refutes that notion.\n  Of the 1,100 objections issued by the Department of Justice since \n1965, 56 percent occurred since the last reauthorization in 1982. Over \nhalf have occurred since 1982. So despite the progress these States \nhave made in upholding the right to vote, it is clear that problems \nstill exist.\n  There are others who have argued we should not renew section 203's \nprotection of language minorities. These arguments have been tied to \ndebates over immigration and they tend to muddle a noncontroversial \nissue--protecting the right to vote--with one of today's most \ncontentious debates.\n  But let's remember, you cannot request language assistance if you are \nnot a voter. You cannot be a voter if you are not a citizen. And while \nvoters, as citizens, must be proficient in English, many are simply \nmore confident that they can cast ballots printed in their native \nlanguages without making errors. It is not an unreasonable assumption.\n  A representative of the Southwestern Voter Registration Project is \nquoted as saying:\n\n       Citizens who prefer Spanish registration cards do so \n     because they feel more connected to the process; they also \n     feel they trust the process more when they understand it.\n\n  These sentiments--connection to and trust in our democratic process--\nare exactly what we want from our voting rights legislation.\n  Our challenges, of course, do not end at reauthorizing the Voting \nRights Act. We have to prevent the problems we have seen in recent \nelections from happening again. We have seen political operatives purge \nvoters from registration rolls for no legitimate reason, prevent \neligible ex-felons from casting ballots, distribute polling equipment \nunevenly and deceive voters about the time, location, and rules of \nelections. Unfortunately, these efforts have been directed primarily at \nminority voters, the disabled, low-income individuals, and other \nhistorically disenfranchised groups.\n  The Help America Vote Act, or HAVA, was a big step in the right \ndirection. But we have to do more. We need to fully fund HAVA if we are \ngoing to move forward in the next stage of securing the right to vote \nfor every citizen. We need to enforce critical requirements such as \nstatewide registration databases. We need to make sure polling \nequipment is distributed equitably and equipment actually works. We \nneed to work on getting more people to the polls on election day.\n  We need to make sure that minority voters are not the subject of some \ndeplorable intimidation tactics when they do go to the polls. In 2004, \nNative American voters in South Dakota were confronted by men posing as \nlaw enforcement. These hired intimidators joked about jail time for \nballot missteps and followed voters to their cars to record their \nlicense plates.\n  In Lake County, OH, some voters received a memo on bogus board of \nelection letterhead, informing voters who registered through Democratic \nand NAACP drives that they could not vote.\n  In Wisconsin, a flier purporting to be from the ``Milwaukee Black \nVoters League'' was circulated in predominantly African-American \nneighborhoods with the following message:\n\n       If you've already voted in any election this year, you \n     can't vote in the presidential election. If you violate any \n     of these laws, you can get ten years in prison and your \n     children will get taken away from you.\n\n  Now, think about that. We have a lot more work to do. This occasion \nis a\n\n[[Page S7985]]\n\ncause for celebration. But it is also an opportunity to renew our \ncommitment to voting rights.\n  As Congressman Lewis said last week:\n\n       It's clear that we have come a great distance, but we still \n     have a great distance to go.\n\n  The memory of Selma still lives on in the spirit of the Voting Rights \nAct. Since that day, the Voting Rights Act has been a critical tool in \nensuring that all Americans not only have the right to vote but have \nthe right to have their vote counted.\n  Those of us concerned about protecting those rights cannot afford to \nrest on our laurels upon reauthorization of this bill. We need to take \nadvantage of this rare, united front and continue to fight to ensure \nunimpeded access to the polls for all Americans. In other words, we \nneed to take the spirit that existed on that bridge, and we have to \nspread it across this country.\n  Two weeks after the first march was turned back, Dr. King spoke, and \nhe told a gathering of organizers and activists and community members \nthat they should not despair because the arc of the moral universe is \nlong, but it bends toward justice. The arc of the moral universe is \nlong, but it bends toward justice. That is because of the work that \neach of us does that it bends toward justice. It is because of people \nsuch as John Lewis and Fannie Lou Hamer and Coretta Scott King and Rosa \nParks--all the giants upon whose shoulders we stand--that we are \nbeneficiaries of that arc bending toward justice.\n\n  That is why I stand here today. I would not be in the Senate had it \nnot been for the efforts and courage of so many parents and \ngrandparents and ordinary people who were willing to reach up and bend \nthat arc in the direction of justice. I hope we continue to see that \nspirit live on not just during this debate but throughout all our work \nhere in the Senate.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I wish to take a few moments to add my voice to the Senate debate in \nterms of why I will vote for the Voting Rights Act reauthorization.\n  No. 1, I am a member of the Judiciary Committee, and I wish to \ncongratulate our chairman, Senator Specter, and our ranking member, \nSenator Leahy, for getting the bill out of committee. It was an 18-to-0 \nvote. I have enjoyed that committee in many ways, and one of the \nhighlights of my time on that committee is getting this piece of \nlegislation to the floor for a vote. I anticipate an overwhelming vote \nfor the Voting Rights Acts.\n  There are so many ways to say why, and so many approaches to explain \nthe continued need. But the best I can say, in terms of my voice being \nadded to the debate, is that I recognize it is just a voice, that I am \nin the Senate--I just turned 51 years old, a child of the South. I grew \nup in the 1950s and 1960s, and I went to segregated schools until, I \nthink, the fifth or sixth grade.\n  My life is better because of the civil rights movement.\n  It has enriched the country. I have been able to interact with people \nin ways that would have been impossible if segregation had stood and, \nas Senator Obama indicated, his career in the Senate is possible. I \nwould argue that most Americans' lives are better because in America \nyou can interact in a meaningful way now. And one of the interactions \nis to be able to vote.\n  But it is just a voice I add. To get here, literally, to get the \nVoting Rights Act passed back in the 1960s, people died. They shed \ntheir blood, their sweat. They put their hopes and dreams for their \nchildren on the line. They were willing to die for their insistence \nthat they play a meaningful role in American society. And the most \nmeaningful way you can participate is to be able to vote without fear.\n  Dr. King is a fascinating historical figure now. He was a fascinating \nman while he lived. I have been in the military for quite a while. I \nhave been around a lot of brave people--pilots who take off and fly in \nharm's way. I sort of have an affinity for military history. I always \nadmired the people who would go up the hill in the face of overwhelming \nforce or stand with their comrades when it looked as though all hope \nwas lost because that was the right thing to do.\n  They were willing to sacrifice their life not only for their country \nbut for their fellow service members, the people in their unit. How \nhard that must have been. Some people rise to the occasion and some \ndon't. Those who rise to the occasion are called heroes, rightly so. \nThose who fail to rise to the occasion are called human beings.\n  All human beings, me included, should celebrate the heroes. The thing \nthat I admire most about Dr. King and his associates is that it is one \nthing to put your own life at risk. It is another thing to put your \nfamily at risk. I would imagine, never having met Dr. King, that one of \nhis biggest fears was not about his personal safety but about what \nmight happen to his family. To me that is the ultimate act of bravery, \nto know that if you do nothing, your family is going to be locked into \na system where life is very meaningless. And to do something so heroic \nand so challenging that you put your family at risk had to be a very \nhard decision.\n  So as we reauthorize the Voting Rights Act, we need to remember, all \nof us who vote, that it is not that big a deal. There is no one in the \nSenate. Hardly anyone is listening. We have some visitors here in the \nCapitol. It is going to pass pretty quickly. Everybody knows the \noutcome. In the 1960s, people did not know the outcome. I argue that \nthe fact we reauthorized this without a whole lot of discussion and \nrancor is the best testament to its success. All the fears and all the \nplaying on people's prejudices that would come from integration, if it \ncame about, or allowing everyone to vote, if it came about, they were \njust that--baseless fears. As you look back from 2006 over the history \nof the Voting Rights Act, there is nothing to fear. Allowing Americans \nto fully participate in a democracy has been a wonderful thing. \nAllowing people to go to the movie they went to go to and go to the \nrestaurant they want to eat at and play on the same sports teams as \nevery other person in their neighborhood, regardless of race, creed, or \ncolor, is a wonderful thing. At the time it was a frightful thing.\n  That says nothing about this generation being good and the last \ngeneration being evil. It speaks to the weakness of humanity. Within \nall of us there is a fear that can be tapped into. We have to guard \nagainst that. We have to be on constant guard not to let the issues of \nour day play on our fears.\n  I argue that one of those issues we are dealing with today that is \nplaying on the fears of the past and the weaknesses of humanity is the \nimmigration issue. I hope as we move forward on the immigration issue, \nwe can understand that obeying the law is an essential part of America, \nand people need to be punished when they break it. But America's \nstrength has been absorbing people from all over the world, from \ndifferent backgrounds, races, and creeds, and allowing them to share in \nthe American dream. We should do it in an orderly way, not a chaotic \nway.\n  To the issue at hand, the Voting Rights Act will be extended. I \nbelieve it is for 25 years. Some of the data in the act is based on \n1968, 1972 turnout models. The act does not recognize the progress \nparticularly in my region of the country. I think it should have, but \nit didn't. So we will just move on.\n  South Carolina has made great strides forward in terms of African \nAmerican voting participation and minority African American \nrepresentation at all levels of State government and local government. \nMy State is better for that. I am proud of the progress that has been \nmade. To those who made it happen, those who risked their blood, sweat \nand tears, I owe you a debt, as everyone of my generation does. When I \ncast my vote today, it will be in your honor and your memory.\n  I hope 25 years from now it can be said that there will be no need \nfor the Voting Rights Act because things have changed for the better. I \ncan't read the future or predict what the world will be like 25 years \nfrom now or what America will be like. But if we keep making the \nprogress we have in the last 25 years, it can happen.\n  It is incumbent upon each Member of this body--regardless of \npolitical differences, party affiliation, or personal background--to \ntry to bring out the\n\n[[Page S7986]]\n\nbest in our country no matter how hard the issue might be, no matter \nhow emotional it might be, and no matter how much people play on our \nfears. Just as those who came before us rejected the desire to play on \nfears and prejudices and risked their personal safety, I hope this \ngeneration of political leaders that I am now a part of will live up to \nthe ideals demonstrated by Americans in the past who were brave, who \nrisked it all for the common good.\n  I will close with this thought: As Senator Obama said, if we can \nembrace the spirit that led to the Voting Rights Act--a sense of fair \nplay, fair treatment--and apply it to other areas and other issues \nfacing our Nation, we will be much stronger. It is with that sense of \npurpose and hope that I will vote to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act.\n  To my fellow South Carolinians, you have come a long way. You have \nmuch to be proud of. But we, like every other part of this country, \nstill have a long way to go.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the reauthorization of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n  I was a member of the Indianapolis School Board and mayor of \nIndianapolis during the civil rights movement, and I witnessed \nfirsthand the critical importance of promoting justice and \nunderstanding in our communities. Following the tragic death of Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr., while I was serving as mayor, so many of my \nfriends and neighbors in Indianapolis came together in peace and \nreconciliation, and I am grateful that our city served as a model to so \nmany other cities that were unfortunately stricken with violence and \ndivision.\n  It is in the spirit of justice, harmony, and compassion that we must \njoin together to pass this important legislation. This is a signal \nmoment for the Senate, and I am pleased that President Bush will sign \nthis bill into law as the 41st anniversary of the signing of the Voting \nRights Act approaches on August 6.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to voice my support for \nreauthorizing the Voting Rights Act of 1965. H.R. 9, the bill to \nreauthorize the Voting Rights Act, is an important piece of \nlegislation. I wish to take a few moments to express my thoughts on the \ngreat progress prompted by the Voting Rights Act in my State, as well \nas to express a few concerns.\n  My home State of Alabama--the site of the Selma to Montgomery voting \nrights march--had a grim history on voting rights. Before 1965, only 19 \npercent of African Americans in our State were registered to vote, and \nthey were denied the right to vote through any number of tactics and \nstrategies. Behind those tactics and strategies--the multiple ``tests \nand devices''--lay a ruthless decision to deny Black citizens the right \nto vote so that the majority of the White community could maintain \npolitical power.\n  The results of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were some of the best \nthings that ever happened to Alabama. Before the Voting Rights Act, \nAlabama had fewer than a dozen Black elected officials. As of 2001, the \nmost recent figures available, Alabama had over 750 African-American \noffice holders--second only to Mississippi. These elected officials \ninclude a U.S. Congressman, 8 State senators, 27 members of the State \nHouse of Representatives, 46 mayors, 80 members of county commissions, \nschool board members, town council members and the like.\n  Voter registration rates for Blacks and Whites in Alabama are now \nvirtually identical. In fact, in the last Presidential election, \naccording to the Census Bureau, a larger percentage of African \nAmericans voted than Whites in the State of Alabama. Now, that was the \ngoal of the act--to have this kind of progress occur. In fact, over the \npast 15 years, Alabama has not had a single court find the State guilty \nof violating the 15th amendment or the very broad protections afforded \nby section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The same cannot be said of \nArkansas; Colorado; Hawaii; Ohio; Maryland; Massachusetts; Missouri; \nMontana; Nebraska; Wisconsin; Chicago, IL; Hempstead, NY; Los Angeles \nCounty, CA; or Dade County, FL--none of which are covered by section \n5's preclearance requirement.\n  The people of Alabama understand that these changes in our State are \ngood, and they do not want to do anything that would suggest that there \nis any interest in moving away from the great right to vote. We want to \nreauthorize the Voting Rights Act. How we reauthorize the act is \nsomething that is worthy of discussion, however. The witnesses we have \nheard in the Judiciary Committee over the past couple of months have \nhad many different ideas, and after hearing from them, I am concerned \nthat we should have listened more carefully to some of their \nrecommendations.\n  My concerns stem, in part, from the extraordinary nature of some of \nthe temporary provisions of the Voting Rights Act particularly the \n``preclearance'' requirement of section 5. Section 5 requires Alabama \nand other covered jurisdictions to ``preclear'' any change in ``any \nvoting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, \nor procedure with respect to voting.'' The preclearance requirement \napplies to ``[a]ny change affecting voting, even though it appears to \nbe minor or indirect.'' As a representative of the Department of \nJustice testified in the House of Representatives, ``There is no de \nminimis exception'' to the preclearance requirement.\n  In 1966, the Supreme Court in South Carolina v. Katzenbach upheld \nsection 5's preclearance requirement ``as a\nnecessary and constitutional response to some States' `extraordinary \nstratagem[s] of contriving new rules of various kinds for the sole \npurpose of perpetuating voting discrimination in the face of adverse \nfederal court decrees.' '' The Court ``acknowledged that suspension of \nnew voting regulations pending preclearance was an extraordinary \ndeparture from the traditional course of relations between the States \nand the Federal Government,'' but ``held it constitutional as a \npermitted congressional response to the unremitting attempts by some \nstate and local officials to frustrate their citizens' equal enjoyment \nof the right to vote.'' In other words, the preclearance requirement \nwas an extraordinary response to an extraordinary problem--unrelenting \nefforts by some State and local officials to contrive new rules for \nvoting and elections after each defeat in Federal court.\n  During the reauthorization process, we have been presented relatively \nlittle present-day evidence of continued ``unremitting attempts by some \nstate and local officials to frustrate their citizens' equal enjoyment \nof the right to vote'' as was the case in 1965--especially the kind of \nchange-the-rules-after-losing tactics that prompted the section 5 \npreclearance requirement. According to Richard L. Hasen, William H. \nHannon Distinguished Professor of Law at Loyola Law School in Los \nAngeles: ``In the most recent 1998 to 2002 period, DOJ objected to a \nmeager 0.05 percent of preclearance requests. Updating these data, DOJ \ninterposed just two objections nationwide overall in 2004, and one \nobjection in 2005.'' These data suggest relatively isolated attempts to \ninterfere with voting rights not widespread, ``extraordinary \nstratagem[s]'' to perpetuate discrimination in voting.\n  To be sure, there have been examples of misconduct, such as the \ncancellation of the June 5, 2001, city council and mayoral elections in \nthe town of Kilmichael, MS, and I do not want to minimize those \nviolations in any way. Such misconduct did not appear to be common or \nwidespread, however, and it could have been remedied through ordinary \nlitigation under section 2 of the act and 42 U.S.C. Sec.  1983. In \nfact, a disturbing aspect of the Kilmichael incident is that the \nattorney general's objection to the cancellation of the election came \non December 11, 2001 over 7 months after the election had been \ncanceled. This was no doubt due in part to the town's failure to submit \nthe change in a timely fashion, but it nonetheless appears that \nminority voters would have received justice more quickly through a \nlawsuit in Federal court, accompanied by a request for a preliminary \ninjunction and/or a temporary restraining order.\n\n  In light of the dearth of present-day preclearance objections or \nevidence of violations that, due to their nature or number, cannot be \nremedied through litigation, I am concerned that reauthorizing section \n5's preclearance requirement for 25 years as proposed in\n\n[[Page S7987]]\n\nH.R. 9 will not pass constitutional muster in the litigation that is \ncertain to follow its enactment. In City of Boerne v. Flores, the \nSupreme Court held that when Congress enacts legislation to enforce \nconstitutional guarantees, ``[t]here must be a congruence and \nproportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the \nmeans adopted to that end.'' The Court cited the Voting Rights Act of \n1965 as an example of appropriate congressional enforcement legislation \nthat it had upheld. The Court observed, however, that ``[s]trong \nmeasures appropriate to address one harm may be an unwarranted response \nto another, lesser one.''\n  I am worried because, in extending section 5's preclearance \nrequirement for another 25 years, H.R. 9 does little to acknowledge the \ntremendous progress made over the past 40 years in Alabama and other \ncovered jurisdictions. Today is not 1965, and the situation with \nrespect to voting rights in Alabama and other covered jurisdictions is \ndramatically different from 1965. I would have expected Congress to \nrecognize this tremendous progress in covered jurisdictions by \nmodernizing section 5 to reflect present-day progress and remaining \nproblems.\n  For example, Congress ought to update the coverage trigger in section \n4(b) of the act. It is simply illogical--in 2006--to base coverage \nsolely on registration and voter turnout data from the Presidential \nelections in 1964, 1968, 1972. What about the Presidential elections of \n1996, 2000, and 2004? What about the 14 noncovered jurisdictions that \nFederal courts have found guilty of constitutional or section 2 \nviolations in recent years? Those years and those jurisdictions could \neasily be added to the coverage formula in section 4(b), but H.R. 9 \ndoes not update the coverage formula to include them. Given the dearth \nof preclearance objections, it seems that some minor or de minimis \nvoting changes ought to be removed from the preclearance requirement, \nas well.\n  Congress also needs to make changes to improve the ``bailout'' \nprocess in section 4(a) of the act. According to the Department of \nJustice, out of 914 covered States and political subdivisions, only 11 \ncovered jurisdictions, all in Virginia, have bailed out from coverage, \nand thus preclearance, under section 4(a). It is obvious that bailout \nis not working properly, but H.R. 9 does not correct that problem. For \nexample, even if a town in Alabama has a perfect record on voting \nrights and meets every one of the requirements for bailout, it cannot \nseek bailout because section 4(a) only allows a ``political \nsubdivision'' to bail out, and section 14(c)(2) defines ``political \nsubdivision'' to mean ``any county or parish'' but not any city or \ntown. That should be changed, but this bill does not address it. I also \nthink we should have given serious consideration to Professor Hasen's \n``proactive bailout'' proposal to improve the bailout process.\n  I am also concerned that the Supreme Court will think that a 25-year \nreauthorization is simply too long to pass constitutional muster. In \n1965, Congress only authorized the temporary provisions of the Voting \nRights Act for 5 years. They have now been in effect for 41 years. I am \nworried that the Supreme Court will conclude that it is not ``congruent \nand proportional'' to require some States to preclear every single \nvoting change, no matter how minor or insignificant, until the year \n2031 based on data regarding voter turnout and registration from 1964--\n67 years earlier.\n  Finally, I am concerned about H.R. 9's language adding new \nsubsections (b), (c), and (d) to section 5 of the Voting Rights Act to \nalter the Supreme Court's decisions in Georgia v. Ashcroft and Reno v. \nBossier Parish School Board, Bossier Parish II. In its decision in \nBossier Parish II, in particular, the Court warned that the \ninterpretation of section 5 rejected in that case ``would also \nexacerbate the `substantial' federalism costs that the preclearance \nprocedure already exacts perhaps to the extent of raising concerns \nabout Sec. 5's constitutionality.'' Altering these decisions adds to \nthe risks taken in failing to modernize and modify the provisions of \nthe Voting Rights Act to address the voting rights problems of the 21st \ncentury. It is particularly important therefore, that these new \nprovisions be strictly interpreted.\n  The ``ability . . . to elect their preferred candidates of choice'' \nlanguage in new subsections 5(b) and 5(d) prevents the elimination of \nwhat the Supreme Court called ``majority-minority districts'' in \nGeorgia v. Ashcroft, in exchange for the creation of what it called \n``influence districts.'' Neither the language of new subsections 5(b) \nand 5(d) nor the ``any discriminatory purpose'' language of new \nsubsection 5(c) requires the creation of or locks into place \n``influence'' or ``coalitional'' districts, however. The concept of \n``influence'' or ``coalitional'' districts is far too amorphous to \nimpose as a requirement of Federal law. Imposing such new restrictions \non the redistricting process would prove both unworkable and \nunconstitutional.\n  I agree with the comments made earlier this afternoon by Senator \nMcConnell, Senator Hatch, Senator Kyl, and Senator Cornyn. We must \nremember that we are reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act not creating a \n``gerrymandering rights act.'' The bipartisan support for this bill \nindicates that both Republicans and Democrats do not expect or intend \nit to be interpreted to advantage one party or the other.\n  Although the Voting Rights Act is now 40 years old, many of my \nconstituents have vivid recollections of discrimination at the ballot \nbox, and they have strong memories of the civil rights movement that \nled to the most historic changes that were encapsulated in the Voting \nRights Act. These are wonderful people. They love America and are proud \nof the changes in Alabama and our Nation. They have a strong attachment \nto the Voting Rights Act. All Alabamians want to see the progress \ncontinue. In light of the wrongs that have occurred in the past and out \nof respect for those who placed their very lives at risk for change, I \nwill vote in favor of H.R. 9.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of reauthorizing the \nVoting Rights Act.\n  The democratic process of citizens electing those who will govern \nthem is a cornerstone of America. It is this design which has \ncontributed greatly to making our Nation stable, resilient, and a \nleader in the world. Every citizen over the age of 18 who can legally \nvote has a constitutional right to do so.\n  The 15th amendment of the Constitution states, ``The right of \ncitizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged \nby the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or \nprevious condition of servitude.''\n  To enforce the 15th amendment, President Lyndon Johnson signed the \nVoting Rights Act into law on August 6, 1965. This legislation \nprevented States from suppressing or denying African Americans and \nothers the opportunity to participate in the electoral process, and it \ncontinues to do so today.\n  Most of the Voting Rights Act is permanent law. However, certain \nsections of the law are set to expire in 2007 if not reauthorized by \nthis Congress. These sections, including requirements for Federal \nreview of State and local election laws, the placement of Federal \nelection observers, and voting assistance programs for bilingual \nAmerican citizens, were established so that Congress could periodically \nreevaluate and amend them if needed.\n  I stand here today representing a State, portions of which have been \nclassified by this act as having a troubled past, and I support \nreauthorization of the Voting Rights Act.\n  North Carolina is proud of the progress it has made over the last \nseveral decades. North Carolinians continue to learn from history and \nwill continue to strive to serve as a model for the rest of the Nation \nin equality and fairness.\n  I must emphasize that regardless of the outcome of this \nreauthorization vote, which I will support and I am confident will pass \nthis Chamber unanimously, no citizen will lose the right to vote in \n2007 as a result of any expiring provisions. As Members of Congress, we \nhave the responsibility to preserve the constitutional rights of all \nindividuals but also to make sure that the law of the land is evenly \nand fairly applied and enforced.\n  Voting rights for African Americans or any other citizen group are \ngranted by the 15th amendment. Voting rights for all American citizens \nare permanent.\n  We must ensure public confidence in our electoral system.\n\n[[Page S7988]]\n\n  As I have said on the floor of the Senate before, ``as our country \nplants the seeds of democracy across the world, we have the essential \nobligation to continue to operate as the model.''\n  I urge my colleagues to support this reauthorization.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nreauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. Let me first commend everyone \nwho has been involved with getting this bill to where it is today, \nincluding the chairman of the Judiciary Committee here in the Senate, \nChairman Specter. Chairman Specter has attempted to ensure that \neveryone involved in this process received the opportunity to explore \nthe issues about which they had further questions, while still moving \nthe bill through expeditiously. Thanks to all these efforts, we will \nsee final passage of the Voting Rights Act reauthorization today, \nnearly a year ahead of the expiration of any of the temporary \nprovisions.\n  I have long been a supporter of the Voting Rights Act. I had the \nopportunity to work with Senators Dole and Kennedy and others in 1982 \nto continue the VRA's vital protections, to ensure that all Americans \ntruly have the right to vote.\n  As I explained during the reauthorization of the VRA in 1982, the \nright to vote is fundamental. Only through voting can we guarantee \npreservation of all our other rights. The right to vote is the very \ncornerstone of democracy and merits the highest protection of law.\n  People of all races have been guaranteed the right to vote since \npassage of the 15th amendment in 1870. For far too long, though, this \nwas a right only in theory. Many minorities were discriminated against \nin the days before the Voting Rights Act was introduced. Since this Act \nwas passed, we have seen the voting proportions of these populations \nincrease dramatically. The Voting Rights Act has had very significant \nsuccess in fighting racial discrimination, probably more than anything \nelse that Congress has done since the adoption of the Civil War \namendments.\n  Next year, important provisions of the Voting Rights Act will expire. \nThe right of every American to have a voice and vote is the essence of \nAmerica's strength and greatness. As was the case in 1982, conditions \nhave improved since the original Voting Rights Act was passed. It is \nour duty as the ultimate custodians of the public trust, however, to \nensure that we never return to a world in which some of our citizens do \nnot truly have the right to vote.\n  For this reason, I stand with Chairman Specter as an original \ncosponsor of the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King \nVoting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006. Many \npeople, including the bill's authors, members of the Judiciary \nCommittees in both Houses, and thousands of civil rights activists, \nhave worked incredibly hard to see this reauthorization become a \nreality.\n  I will repeat what I said on this floor 15 years ago: It is our duty \nto guarantee that all citizens have the same opportunity to participate \nin the political process and to elect representatives of their choice. \nAll of us here today recognize that it is our duty, as elected \nrepresentatives of the people, as guardians of democracy, to protect \nthe right to vote. I remain confident, as I was in 1982, that the \nVoting Rights Act is a key tool--perhaps the key tool--in eradicating \nany remaining vestiges of racial discrimination.\n  I support reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act and encourage my \ncolleagues to do the same. As it was in 1965 and in 1982 and for all \nthe other extensions along the way, this vote today is among the most \nimportant civil rights votes on the floor of this body. We have the \nopportunity today to show that we are, indeed, one Nation, under God, \nindivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Please join me in voting \naye.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is without hesitation that I support \nthe Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights \nAct Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006, which ensures that the \nright of all citizens to vote, including the right to register to vote \nand cast meaningful votes, is preserved and protected as guaranteed by \nthe Constitution.\n  Reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 may be a foregone \nconclusion; however, I believe that today's debate and vote are of \ngreat consequence because we are protecting each citizen's right to \nvote and preserving the integrity of our Nation's voting process. \nPassage of this measure is not merely symbolic; it is an essential \nreaffirmation that we the people are securing the blessings of liberty \nto ourselves and our posterity. I firmly believe that the right of \ncitizens of the United States to vote should not be denied or abridged \nby the United States or any State on account of race.\n  The right to cast a vote is fundamental in our system of government, \nand the importance of each person's voting rights is reflected by the \nfact that they are protected by the 14th, 15th, 19th, 24th, and 26th \namendments to the Constitution. President Ronald Reagan described the \nright to vote as the crown jewel of American liberties. Like President \nReagan, I also believe that the right to vote is a great privilege \nworth protecting.\n  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was initially passed in response to \npost-Civil War Reconstruction efforts to disenfranchise Black voters. \nThe voting Rights Act of 1965 was amended in 1970, 1975, 1982, and \n1992. It remains one of the most significant pieces of civil rights \nlegislation in American history. This legislation amends and \nreauthorizes the Voting Rights Act for an additional 25 years, several \nprovisions of which will expire on August 6, 2007, unless Congress acts \nto renew them. Reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act will ensure \nmany privileges including bilingual election assistance for certain \nlanguage minority citizens in certain States and subdivisions.\n  I cast my vote to ensure that no law abridges the privileges or \nimmunities of any citizen of the United States or denies any citizen \nequal protection of the laws.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak in support of the \nVoting Rights reauthorization legislation, of which I am a cosponsor. \nCongress enacted the Voting Rights Act in 1965 to protect the voting \nrights of all Americans, and I am pleased that the Congress is \nreauthorizing this important legislation.\n  The right to vote is the foundation of our democracy and a \nfundamental right to our citizenry. Before the Voting Rights Act was \npassed, however, a great percentage of American citizens were denied \nthat right. The Voting Rights Act rectified that wrong by prohibiting \nthe enactment of any election law that would deny or abridge voting \nrights based on race or color and provided the right to challenge \ndiscriminatory voting practices and procedures.\n  This legislation has been extended and amended four times since its \npassage and has resulted in a tremendous growth in the ability of \nminority citizens to fully participate in the American political \nsystem, both as voters and candidates. At the time the act was first \nadopted, only one-third of all African Americans of voting age were on \nthe registration rolls in the specially covered States compared with \ntwo-thirds of White voters. Now African Americans' voter registration \nrates are approaching parity with that of Whites in many areas, and \nHispanic voters in jurisdictions added to the list of those specially \ncovered by the act in 1975 are not far behind. Enforcement of the act \nhas also increased the opportunity of African Americans and Latino \nvoters to elect representatives of their choice. Virtually excluded \nfrom all public offices in the South in 1965, African Americans and \nHispanic voters are now substantially represented in the State \nlegislatures and local governing bodies throughout the region.\n  Mr. President, this is a piece of legislation that literally changed \nthe landscape of the American political system, and I am extremely \npleased to cast a vote in favor of its extension.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. I support this \nlaw and recognize its valuable contributions to our society.\n  Since its inception in 1965, the Voting Rights Act has successfully \nhelped protect the right to vote for millions of U.S. citizens. This \nright, as outlined in the 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution, \nis fundamental to our\n\n[[Page S7989]]\n\nCountry's foundation. It is the lifeblood of our democracy. The very \nlegitimacy of our government is dependent on the access all Americans \nhave to the electoral process.\n  We must ensure that when citizens choose to go to the polls that they \ndo not face obstacles created to disenfranchise them. Every U.S. \ncitizen, regardless of race or gender, should have opportunity to cast \ntheir vote without fear of discrimination.\n  This has not always been the case. Our Nation's history can provide \nexamples where the person's right to vote has been impeded whether it \nbe through literacy tests or poll taxes. This is unacceptable and is a \npowerful reminder of the hardships this Nation has experienced. The \nVoting Rights Act has provided protection to minority communities that \nmay fall victim to some of those impediments, or even worse, to threats \nor intimidation during the electoral process.\n  I believe the Voting Rights Act was a good idea and necessary in \n1965. I also believe we have come a long way since 1965 and would like \nto recognize the many changes and progress made all across the Country. \nI firmly believe this progress will only continue to grow.\n  I come from a State that is committed to civil rights, and I believe \nthat our Forefathers said it best that we are one Nation, undivided, \nwith liberty and justice for all. I look forward to seeing this \ncommitment to justice renewed today as we reauthorize the Voting Rights \nAct of 1965.\n  Mr. President, I am confident that the Voting Rights Act will be \nreauthorized today and urge my colleagues to support this important \npiece of legislation.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nthis very important piece of legislation, the Voting Rights \nReauthorization Act of 2006.\n  As we all know, Congress first passed the Voting Rights Act back in \n1965, when many jurisdictions had numerous laws and regulations aimed \nat denying the right to vote to many of our citizens--in direct \nviolation of the 15th amendment to the Constitution. The Voting Rights \nAct made it clear that our society would no longer tolerate such \nabuses. It also made clear that all citizens should have the \nopportunity to exercise this critical right freely and easily, without \nharassment, intimidation, or other barriers to voting. Its passage was \none of the proudest moments of the civil rights movement.\n  The Voting Rights Act has been an extraordinary success, and we can \nsee its results in towns, counties, and States across the country, as \nwell as in the House of Representatives and in the U.S. Senate. \nMinority voters have had their voices heard and their votes counted, \nand have helped elect a wide range of officials who reflect the \ndiversity of our great Nation. Unfortunately, despite the great \nadvances we have made as a country, we still have more work to do. Both \nthe House and the Senate have investigated this issue thoroughly, and \nafter numerous hearings and thousands of pages of evidence being \naccepted into the record, it is clear that we need to reauthorize the \nexpiring provisions of the act. More time and effort is needed to \ncompletely fulfill the promise of the Voting Rights Act and to assure \nevery citizen that his or her 15th amendment rights are fully \navailable, and this bill will allow us the time we need.\n  The House of Representatives has already passed the Voting Rights \nRenewal Act, and I am glad we are going to move it forward today. We \ncan then quickly put this critical legislation in front of the \nPresident, who supports the bill and is waiting to sign it into law. I \nam hopeful that at the end of this 25-year reauthorization, we will all \nbe able to agree that no further legislative action is necessary--that \nwe have accomplished the critical goal of assuring every American \ncitizen the equal right to vote.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the 15th amendment of the United States \nConstitution provides ``[t]he right of citizens of the United States to \nvote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any \nState on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. \nThe Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by \nappropriate legislation.'' In 1965, with the passage of the Voting \nRights Act, Congress finally began to enforce the Nation's promise \nembodied in the 15th amendment. The Voting Rights Act was designed to \n``foster our transformation to a society that is no longer fixated on \nrace,'' to an ``all-inclusive community, where we would be able to \nforget about race and color and see people as people, as human beings, \njust as citizens.'' The mere mention of this act conjures up profound \nimages of the civil rights movement, a fight by many courageous men and \nwomen for equality and justice.\n  In 1965, Congress wisely decided to make the most significant \nsections of the bill permanent. The permanent provisions apply to all \nStates equally. One section of the original act suspended all ``tests \nor devices'' that States used to disfranchise racial minorities. \nSection 2, which is also permanent, codifies the 15th amendment, \nconfirming by statute that no political subdivision may deny or abridge \nvoting rights on account of race or color and that all individuals have \nrecourse to discriminatory election procedures in Federal court.\n  That same Congress passed temporary remedial measures to address \nvoting practices and districting in seven Southern States, where \nregistration rates for Black voters averaged only 29.3 percent. Section \n5 was crafted to remedy the low voter registration and turnout among \nthe minority communities caused by discriminatory registration \npractices and intimidation at the polls. Indeed, the Voting Rights Act \nhas succeeded tremendously. Statistician Keith Gaddie reported that the \nregistration and turnout rate of Black citizens is higher in covered \njurisdictions than throughout the rest of the Nation. He additionally \nrevealed that registration of Black citizens in Alabama during the 2004 \nelections was 72.9 percent of the voting age population; in Georgia, \n64.2 percent; in Louisiana, 71.1 percent; in Mississippi, 76.1 percent; \nin South Carolina, 71.1 percent; and in Virginia, 57.4 percent of the \nvoting age population. Voter turnout rates were equally improved. For \nexample in 2004 Alabama had a 63.9 percent turnout rate of registered \nBlack voters, Georgia had a 54.4 percent turnout rate, Louisiana had a \n62.1 percent turnout rate, Mississippi had a 66.8 percent turnout rate, \nSouth Carolina had a 59.5 percent turnout rate, and Virginia had a 49.6 \npercent turnout rate.\n  If we applied registration and turnout data from our most recent \nPresidential elections to the trigger formula for coverage, many \ncovered States would no longer require coverage. This is important \nbecause the Supreme Court requires that any laws that we write must be \n``congruent and proportional'' to the problems we seek to remedy. While \nthese provisions were necessary because State practices and the \nprejudices of individuals kept eligible citizens from being able to \ncast a ballot free from the threat of intimidation or harassment, it is \nimportant that we ensure that the correct jurisdictions are covered in \norder to preserve the constitutionality of the act.\n  We held nine hearings, and many individuals from diverse backgrounds \nand different races have both praised and criticized the temporary \nprovisions of the VRA set to expire 1 year from now. At each hearing, \nmultiple witnesses suggested ways to amend and improve this Act. Yet I \nwas the only Senator on the committee prepared to offer substantive \namendments to improve the act so that it addresses the problems it \nseeks to remedy today.\n  I was prepared to offer three amendments. The first would define the \nterm ``limited English proficient,'' the second would reauthorize the \namended provisions for 7 years instead of 25 years, and the third would \nrequire a photo identification in all Federal elections. Yet I only \noffered one amendment in committee yesterday because it was clearly \ncommunicated that we should pass the exact bill that the House passed \nregardless of the merits of certain amendments. In fact, even though \nthe committee did pass a nonsubstantive amendment to amend the title of \nthe bill, Senate leadership brought the House bill H.R. 9 to the floor \nwithout the title change accepted in committee. Political expediency \nclearly trumped the will of individual Senators.\n\n  There are other amendments that should have received consideration. \nDuring hearings, some Senators discussed possible amendments that they\n\n[[Page S7990]]\n\nappeared to support with witnesses. Yet I believe that political fear \nand perceived intimidation prevented them from offering any amendments. \nFor example, there was discussion based on the testimony of numerous \nwitnesses that someone should offer an amendment to create more \nreasonable bailout procedure. States and counties wishing to bail out \nare only permitted to make their case here in Washington rather than at \na Federal court closer to their home. Another amendment that received \nsome support among witnesses would have included more recent data to \ndetermine coverage of areas with a recent history of discrimination \nrather than relying on data only from the 1964, 1968, and 1972 \nelections.\n  Even if no amendments offered were accepted, this bill is \ndramatically different from reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act as \nrenewed in 1982. This bill rewrites the Voting Rights Act, section 5 to \ninclude in section (b) that ``[t]he purpose of [section 5] is to \nprotect the ability of such citizens to elect their preferred \ncandidates of choice.'' Such language has never before been inserted \ninto section 5 preclearance requirements where there is no judicial \nreview of determinations made by Department of Justice, DOJ employees. \nAdditionally, section 5(c) of the bill rewrites the Voting Rights Act \nto require that DOJ refuse to preclear a plan that employs ``any \ndiscriminatory purpose.'' These are very serious changes that were \nnever debated and that witnesses suggested we amend. Those suggestions \nwere never even discussed or considered. I am at a loss as to why we \nare inserting new standards for 25 years without knowing the potential \nconsequences and clarifying congressional intent in the language of the \nact.\n  Some Senators have said that we have carefully considered this bill \nand the effects it will have on our Nation based on the number of \nhearings we had. Yet Member attendance at these hearings was incredibly \nlow. At the first two hearings on section 5, only one Senator attended. \nAt the third, five Senators attended. Five Senators did not attend any \nof the committee's hearings. Five Senators attended only portions of \none hearing. This is not meant as criticism because I only attended \npart of two hearings.\n  My point is that it is unfortunate that we insisted on doing this on \nan expedited basis when the act does not expire for a year. The \ncommittee conducted eight hearings in 9 workweeks--and during times \nwhen it was clear most Senators would be absent. We held four hearings \nduring the immigration debate on the floor and held two hearings during \nrollcall votes on the floor. Because of the political nature of this \nbill and the fear of being improperly classified as ``racist,'' the \nbill was crafted and virtually passed before any Senator properly \nunderstood any of the major changes. For example, the bill that passed \nout of committee included a finding section before any hearings were \nheld. No changes to those findings were made.\n  Furthermore, it was nearly impossible to prepare for the hearings. \nOur rules require that witnesses submit their testimony 24 hours prior \nto the hearing so Senators can formulate thoughtful questions. Over \nhalf of the witnesses--21 out of 41--flouted the committee's rules by \nturning in their testimony less than 24 hours before the hearing. \nIndeed, one witness submitted his testimony at 12:03 a.m. the morning \nof a hearing scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Another witness submitted her \ntestimony at 10:21 p.m. the night before a 9:30 a.m. hearing. Other \nwitnesses submitted their testimony literally hours before the hearing. \nClearly, the only way Senators could ask thoughtful questions of these \nwitnesses was through written questions. And many tried to do so. But \nthat process has been unsuccessful. We voted the bill out of committee \nfor discussion on the floor before 107 written questions to 10 \nwitnesses were answered and returned. We did not even have the \nopportunity to submit questions to the witnesses on the panel of the \nfinal hearing.\n  We had plenty of time to do this right--to fully consider the \ntestimony and answers submitted by witnesses--and still vote to extend \nthe temporary provisions before they expire in the summer of next year. \nWe still have time to do this right. Congress has until the summer of \n2007 to consider this bill, and yet we are moving ahead without \nreceiving all answers to questions and fully considering the testimony \nof our witnesses. As a result, none of us can realistically say that we \nknow the full implications of what we are voting on today. And the \nconsequences of our rush, forced by politics, may have unintended \nconsequences for our Nation.\n  Nonetheless, I am voting for the Voting Rights Act because of its \nunparalleled success in the past at securing the opportunity to vote. I \nurge my colleagues not to forget that we all share the fundamental \nAmerican belief that our society should be color-blind and that \neveryone should be treated equally. There should be no political \nadvantage or disadvantage because of the color of a person's skin and \nwe should be able to put aside politics to protect and openly discuss \nthose values. Most Americans would like to move away from considering \nrace when drawing congressional districts. In fact, a Washington Post/\nKaiser poll found that 70 percent of Blacks, 83 percent of Hispanics, \nand 90 percent of Whites said race should not figure into map-drawing.\n  While America has a long history of negative race relations, we must \nstrive for the dream taught by Martin Luther King--that one day society \nwill judge people based on the content of their character and not the \ncolor of their skin. For this, as Justice O'Connor stated in 1993, is \nthe goal toward which our Nation continues to aspire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, often when the Senate passes something \nunanimously, it means that the matter is not so important. That is not \nthe case today. The Voting Rights Act is about as important as it gets. \nSenators of both political parties deserve great credit for bringing \nthis vitally needed legislation to the floor of the Senate today. I \nhave come to salute those inside and outside the Senate for their work \nto bring this extraordinarily important issue before the country and \nbefore the Senate and to make an appeal to Senators and those outside \nthe Chamber to work for more.\n  In the past three successive elections--2000, 2002, and 2004--there \nwere scores of accusations of voter intimidation, rigged voting \nmachines, conflicts of interest among elected officials, and other \nserious electoral abuses. Many newspaper articles, State and Federal \ngovernmental investigations, private studies and scores of lawsuits \nhave described in considerable detail the toll that election abuses now \ntake on our democracy. As much as it is an accomplishment that the \nSenate will be voting to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act today, that \nlaw cannot cure many of the problems that we have seen in the last \nthree election cycles. But there is a proven system that can reduce \nmany of these abuses, and I hope in the days ahead the U.S. Congress \nwill take steps to promote it. It is known as vote by mail.\n  My State of Oregon adopted this election system back in 1998, with \nnearly 70 percent support of our State's voters. It has been a \nresounding success any way one looks at it, and it has not been seen in \nany way as a kind of partisan tool that advantages one particular party \nor one particular philosophy.\n  What I want to do this afternoon is describe briefly how Oregon's \nvote by mail system works and then talk about why the Senate ought to \nbe taking steps to promote it nationally as a way to deal with some of \nthese problems that have swept across our land over the last three \nelection cycles.\n  In Oregon the system works in this way. At least 2 weeks before \nelection day, election officials mail ballots to all registered voters. \nThe voters mark their ballots, seal and sign those ballots, and return \nthem by mail or by placing them in a secure drop box. Election \nofficials count the votes using optical scanning machines that confirm \nthe signature on the return envelope matches the signature of the voter \non file. Each county also provides optional onsite voting booths for \nindividuals who need special accommodations or prefer to vote onsite.\n  The bottom line is that vote by mail can address many of the problems \nthat plague this country's elections. For example, with vote by mail, \nthere is no waiting in line in the polls for hours. All through our \ncountry over the last election we heard complaints about\n\n[[Page S7991]]\n\npeople having to wait in line, often for hours and hours on end. It \ndoesn't happen with vote by mail. Each voter receives a ballot in the \nmail. They can complete it at home, at work, or wherever is convenient \nfor them. And you don't have the problem of people waiting in line for \nhours and hours to exercise their franchise.\n  With vote by mail, no one would get the run-around about which \npolling place they are supposed to vote at. The ballots are mailed to \nthe citizen's home. If, for some reason, a voter's ballot does not \narrive 2 weeks before the election as it is supposed to, the voter has \nenough time to correct the problem, get their ballot, and then cast it. \nAmericans who face the toughest time getting to the polls, such as \ncitizens with disabilities and the elderly, report that they vote more \noften using vote by mail. Women, younger voters, stay-at-home moms also \nreport that they vote more often using vote by mail. Once again, it is \nan opportunity on a bipartisan basis to deal with a very serious \nproblem that we have seen over the last few election cycles.\n  Citizens wouldn't get the run-around at the polling place when they \nshow up on election day to vote and are told: ``You really shouldn't be \nhere; you ought to be there.'' ``We can't really tell you where you \nought to be.'' ``We have all these people in line, and we will try to \nhelp you later.'' All of that is eliminated through vote by mail \nbecause folks get their ballot at their home.\n  Third, with vote by mail there is less risk of voter intimidation. A \n2003 study of voters in my home State showed that the groups that would \nbe most vulnerable to coercion now favor vote by mail. Over the last \nfew elections, we saw again and again our citizens saying that they \nfeared coercion. They were concerned about intimidation in the exercise \nof their franchise.\n  We have documentary proof in our home State, a specific study that I \nhave cited, that citizens who are most vulnerable to intimidation and \ncoercion feel more comfortable voting by mail.\n  Next, with vote by mail, malfunctioning voting equipment is a thing \nof the past. Everyone heard the stories in 2004 of citizens who said \nthey voted for one candidate only to see the electronic voting machine \nindicate that the voter had cast a ballot for somebody else. \nIrregularities such as this cannot occur in vote by mail. Each voter \nmarks the ballot, reviews it, and submits it, the ballot is counted, \nand it becomes a paper record--a paper record that is used in the event \nof a recount.\n  I happen to believe that we must have a paper trail for every ballot \nthat is cast in our country. It is wrong that there is at present no \nsuch paper trail. Every time I have a community meeting, people bring \nup: why can this not be done? It is just common sense. My home State \nhas led the way to ensure that through our vote-by-mail system there is \na paper trail.\n  With vote by mail, the risk of fraud is minimized. When an Oregon \ncounty receives a voter's marked ballot, the ballot is then sent to \nelections workers trained in signature verification who compare the \nsignature on each ballot against the person's signature on their voter \nregistration card. This can be done quickly and easily because each \nvoter's registration card has been electronically scanned into the \nsystem. No ballot is processed or counted until the county is satisfied \nthat the signature on the ballot matches the voter's signature on file. \nIf someone tries to commit fraud, they can be convicted of a Class C \nfelony, spend up to five years in prison, and pay $100,000 in fines.\n  Vote by mail can help make the problems of recent elections a thing \nof the past. In doing so, it will make our elections fairer and help \nreinstill a confidence in our democracy, which frankly, has been \nlacking.\n  There are a number of other reasons why I think our country ought to \nbe doing everything possible to encourage citizens to adopt vote by \nmail. This approach increases election participation. For example, vote \nby mail helps make voter turnout in Oregon considerably higher than the \naverage national voter turnout. Oregon experienced a record turnout of \nmore than 70 percent in the 2004 Presidential election, compared to 58 \npercent nationally.\n  Vote by mail, we find, gets more citizens involved in the issues \nbecause folks get their ballots weeks before the final day when their \nballot is due, and they have the time to quiz candidates, examine \nissues that are important to them, and do it in a deliberate fashion \nthat gives them more time.\n  Next, vote by mail has produced huge savings at the local level for \nelection costs. Vote by mail reduces those election costs by \neliminating the need to transport equipment to polling stations and to \nhire and train poll workers. My home State has reduced its election-\nrelated costs by 30 percent since implementing vote by mail. So we have \nthe results. We have the results to show the rest of the country why we \nought to be encouraging across the land vote by mail.\n  In a survey taken 5 years after we implemented this system, more than \n8 out of 10 Oregon voters said they preferred voting by mail to \ntraditional voting. I am confident that the rest of our country would \nembrace it the very same way.\n  What this is all about, and why I have taken time to discuss our \napproach, is that I think it is very much in line with both the spirit \nand the text of the Voting Rights Act. America needs to make sure that \nno eligible voter, based on color, creed or any other reason, would be \ndisenfranchised. What we are doing in the Senate today by reauthorizing \nthe Voting Rights Act is the right thing. It is clearly a step in the \nright direction for these difficult times. But I do think much more can \nbe done to improve the election process. I intend to press at every \npossible opportunity for a way to encourage an approach that has \nempowered people in my home State in a manner that has far exceeded the \nexpectations of even the biggest boosters. It has been totally \nnonpartisan.\n  In Oregon, we were amused in the beginning of our discussion about \nvote by mail. At the beginning of the discussion, it seemed that a fair \nnumber of Republicans were for vote by mail, but a number of Democrats \nwere skeptical. Then, after I won the Senate special election in 1996--\nand Senator Smith and I have laughed about this often over the years--\nthere was an about face, and it seemed then that Democrats liked vote \nby mail and Republicans were a little cautious. Our State's citizens \nsaid enough of all this nonsense and overwhelmingly voted, on a \nbipartisan basis, to say this is just plain good government, and this \nis the way we want to go.\n  I think the Oregon story can be copied across the country, and I am \ngoing to do everything I can to encourage it. The Supreme Court \ndeclared in the Reynolds v. Sims case:\n\n       [i]t has been repeatedly recognized that all qualified \n     voters have a constitutionally protected right to vote . . . \n     and to have their vote counted.\n\n  Promoting vote by mail across our land will help make this \nconstitutional right a reality. I encourage my colleagues to look and \nstudy the approach we have used in our State, an approach that will \nadvance the spirit of the Voting Rights Act. Support the Voting Rights \nAct today and work with us to build on its incredible importance in the \ndays ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto proceed for 10 minutes and, following me, Senator Boxer be permitted \nto proceed for 15 minutes, and following her, Senator Schumer for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for his \ndiscussion of an important way of having accountability in voting. I \nmust say that I saw how that works out in Oregon. It works well. It \nworks brilliantly, as a matter of fact. People have a lot of time to be \nable to vote. They don't have to struggle with work issues or being \nsick or other things. They have plenty of time to be able to have the \nkind of transparency and accountability that makes the system work. \nThere are other States where you are allowed to start voting early--in \nNew Mexico and elsewhere.\n  It is amazing that in the United States we have this patchwork of the \nway our citizens work in Federal elections. It is different almost \neverywhere. I had the privilege of giving the\n\n[[Page S7992]]\n\ngraduation address this year at Kenyan College in Ohio, and there the \nkids at Kenyan College wound up being the last people to vote in \nAmerica in the Presidential race in 2004 in Gambier, at 4:30 in the \nmorning. We had to go to court to get permission for them to keep the \npolls open so they could vote at 4:30 in the morning.\n  Why did it take until 4:30 in the morning for people to be able to \nvote? They didn't have enough voting machines in America. These people \nwere lined up not just there but in all of Ohio and in other parts of \nthe country. An honest appraisal requires one to point out that where \nthere were Republican secretaries of state, the lines were invariably \nlonger in Democratic precincts, sometimes with as many as one machine \nonly in the Democratic precinct and several in the Republican precinct; \nso it would take 5 or 10 minutes for someone of the other party to be \nable to vote, and it would take literally hours for the people in the \nlonger lines. If that is not a form of intimidation and suppression, I \ndon't know what is.\n  So I thank the Senator from Oregon for talking about the larger issue \nhere. He is absolutely correct. The example of his State is one that \nthe rest of the country ought to take serious and think seriously about \nembracing.\n  This is part of a larger issue, obviously, Mr. President. All over \nthe world, our country has always stood out as the great exporter of \ndemocratic values. In the years that I have been privileged to serve in \nthe Senate, I have had some extraordinary opportunities to see that \nhappen in a firsthand way.\n  Back in 1986, I was part of a delegation that went to the \nPhilippines. We took part in the peaceful revolution that took place at \nthe ballot box when the dictator, President Marcos, was kicked out and \n``Cory'' Aquino became President. I will never forget flying in on a \nhelicopter to the island of Mindanao and landing where some people have \nliterally not seen a helicopter before, and 5,000 people would surround \nit as you swooped out of the sky, to go to a polling place where the \nentire community turned out waiting in the hot sun in long lines to \nhave their thumbs stamped in ink and to walk out having exercised their \nright to vote.\n  I could not help but think how much more energy and commitment people \nwere showing for the privilege of voting in this far-off place than a \nlot of Americans show on too many occasions. The fact is that in South \nAfrica we fought for years--we did--through the boycotts and other \nefforts, in order to break the back of apartheid and empower all \ncitizens to vote. Most recently, obviously, in Afghanistan and Iraq, \nnotwithstanding the disagreement of many of us about the management of \nthe war and the evidence and other issues that we have all debated \nhere. This has never been debated about the desire for democracy and \nthe thrill that everyone in the Senate felt in watching citizens be \nable to exercise those rights.\n  In the Ukraine, the world turned to the United States to monitor \nelections and ensure that the right to vote was protected. All of us \nhave been proud of what President Carter has done in traveling the \nworld to guarantee that fair elections take place. But the truth is, \nall of our attempts to spread freedom around the world will be hollow \nand lose impact over the years in the future if we don't deliver at \nhome.\n  The fact is that we are having this debate today in the Senate about \nthe bedrock right to vote, with the understanding that this is not a \nright that was afforded to everyone in our country automatically or at \nthe very beginning. For a long time, a century or more, women were not \nallowed to vote in America. We all know the record with respect to \nAfrican Americans. The fact is that the right to vote in our country \nwas earned in blood in many cases and in civic sweat in a whole bunch \nof cases. Courageous citizens literally risked their lives. I remember \nin the course of the campaign 2 years ago, traveling to Alabama--\nMontgomery--and visiting the Southern Poverty Law Center, the memorial \nto Martin Luther King, and the fountain. There is a round stone \nfountain with water spilling out over the sides. From the center of the \nfountain there is a compass rose coming back and it marks the full \ncircle. At the end of every one of those lines is the name of an \nAmerican with the description, ``killed trying to register to vote,'' \nor ``murdered trying to register.'' Time after time, that entire \ncompass rose is filled with people who lost their lives in order to \nexercise a fundamental right in our country.\n  None of us will forget the courage of people who marched and faced \nBull Connor's police dogs and faced the threat of lynchings, some being \ndragged out of their homes in the dark of night to be hung. The fact is \nthat we are having this debate today because their work and that effort \nis not over yet. Too many Americans in too many parts of our country \nstill face serious obstacles when they are trying to vote in our own \ncountry.\n  By reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act, we are taking an important \nstep, but, Mr. President, it is only a step. Nobody should pretend that \nreauthorizing the Voting Rights Act solves the problems of being able \nto vote in our own country. It doesn't. In recent elections, we have \nseen too many times how outcomes change when votes that have been cast \nare not counted or when voters themselves are prevented from voting or \nintimidated from even registering or when they register, as we found in \na couple of States, their registration forms are put in the wastebasket \ninstead of into the computers.\n  This has to end. Every eligible voter in the United States ought to \nbe able to cast his or her ballot without fear, without intimidation, \nand with the knowledge that their voice will be heard. These are the \nfoundations of our democracy, and we have to pay more attention to it.\n  For a lot of folks in the Congress, this is a very personal fight. \nSome of our colleagues in the House and Senate were here when this \nfight first took place or they took part in this fight out in the \nstreets. Without the courage of someone such as Congressman John Lewis \nwho almost lost his life marching across that bridge in Selma, whose \nactions are seared in our minds, who remembers what it was like to \nmarch to move a nation to a better place, who knows what it meant to \nput his life on the line for voting rights, this is personal.\n  For somebody like my colleague, Senator Ted Kennedy, the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts, who was here in the great fight on this \nSenate floor in 1965 when they broke the back of resistance, this is \npersonal.\n  We wouldn't even have this landmark legislation today if it weren't \nfor their efforts to try to make certain that it passed.\n  But despite the great strides we have taken since this bill was \noriginally enacted, we have a lot of work to do.\n  Mr. President, I ask for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, on this particular component of the bill, \nthere is agreement. Republicans and Democrats can agree. I was really \npleased that every attempt in the House of Representatives to weaken \nthe Voting Rights Act was rejected.\n  We need to reauthorize these three critical components especially: \nThe section 5 preclearance provisions that get the Justice Department \nto oversee an area that has a historical pattern of discrimination that \nthey can't change how people vote without clearance. That seems \nreasonable.\n  There are bilingual assistance requirements. Why? Because people need \nit and it makes sense. They are American citizens, but they still may \nhave difficulties in understanding the ballot, and we ought to provide \nthat assistance so they have a fully informed vote. This is supposed to \nbe an informed democracy, a democracy based on the real consent of the \nAmerican people.\n  And finally, authorization for poll watching. Regrettably, we have \nseen in place after place in America why we need to have poll watching.\n  A simple question could be asked: Where would the citizens of Georgia \nbe, particularly low-income and minority citizens, if they were \nrequired to produce a government-issued identification or pay $20 every \n5 years in order to vote? That is what would have happened without \nsection 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Georgia would have successfully \nimposed what the judge in the case called ``a Jim Crow-era like poll \ntax.'' I don't think anybody here\n\n[[Page S7993]]\n\nwants to go back and flirt with the possibility of returning to a time \nwhen States charged people money to exercise their right to vote. That \nis not our America.\n  This morning, President Bush addressed the 97th Annual Convention of \nthe NAACP after a 5-year absence. I am pleased that the President, as \nwe all are, ended his boycott of the NAACP and announced his intention \nto sign the Voting Rights Act into law.\n  But we need to complete the job. There are too many stories all \nacross this country of people who say they registered duly, they \nreported to vote, and they were made to stand in one line or another \nline and get an excuse why, when they get to the end of the line, they \ncan't vote. So they take out a provisional ballot, and then there are \nfights over provisional ballots.\n  There are ways for us to avoid that. Some States allow same-day \nregistration. In some parts of America, you can just walk up the day of \nan election, register, and vote, as long as you can prove your \nresidence.\n  We have this incredible patchwork of laws and rules, and in the \nprocess, it is even more confusing for Americans. We need to fully fund \nthe Help America Vote Act so that we have the machines in place, so \nthat people are informed, so that there is no one in America who waits \nan undue amount of time in order to be able to cast a vote.\n  We have to pass the Count Every Vote Act that Senator Clinton, \nSenator Boxer, and I have introduced which ensures exactly what the \nSenator from Oregon was talking about: that every voter in America has \na verifiable paper trail for their vote. How can we have a system where \nyou can touch a screen and even after you touch the name of one \ncandidate on the screen, the other candidate's name comes up, and if \nyou are not attentive to what you have done and you just go in, touch \nthe screen, push ``select,'' you voted for someone else and didn't \nintend to? How can we have a system like that?\n  How can we have a system where the voting machines are proprietary to \na private business so that the public sector has no way of verifying \nwhat the computer code is and whether or not it is accountable and \nfair? Just accounting for it.\n  Congress has to ensure that every vote cast in America is counted, \nthat every precinct in America has a fair distribution of voting \nmachines, that voter suppression and intimidation are un-American and \nmust cease.\n  We had examples in the last election of people who were sent \nnotices--obviously fake, but they were sent them and they confused them \nenough. They were told that if you have an outstanding parking ticket, \nyou can't vote. They were told: Democrats vote on Wednesday and \nRepublicans vote on Tuesday and various different things.\n  It is important for us to guarantee that in the United States of \nAmerica, this right that was fought for so hard through so much of the \ndifficult history of our country, we finally make real the full measure \nof that right.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Chair and I thank my colleague for her \nforbearance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before Senator Kerry leaves the floor, I \nwant to thank him. The issues he raised absolutely have to be a part of \nthis debate. I will address them after he leaves. The reason I stood up \nand objected to the Ohio count is because I knew firsthand from the \npeople of Ohio who came and talked with me through Stephanie Tubbs \nJones that they were waiting in lines for 6, 7 hours. That is not the \nright to vote. I think Senator Kerry's remarks and the remarks of the \nSenator from Oregon are very important.\n  So let a message go out from this Senate floor today that we are not \nstopping our efforts to make sure people can vote with the very \nimportant passage of this very important legislation. I am very pleased \nto follow him in this debate.\n  I rise to cast my vote in support of a very historic bill named after \nthree amazing women whom I truly admire--Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, \nand Coretta Scott King. These three legendary women were part of the \nheart and soul of the civil rights movement in this country, and those \nwomen helped move the conscience of this Nation in the 1960s and, \nfrankly, inspired me to serve in public service.\n  In 1950, I was a little girl and I was in Florida with my mother. I \nwent on a bus. It was a crowded time of day. A woman came on the bus. \nHer hands were filled with packages. To me she looked really old. I \nguess she was my age. I jumped up because I was taught to do that. I \njumped up and I said: Please, please, take my seat. My mother kind of \npulled at my sleeve, and the woman put her head down and she walked to \nthe back of the bus.\n  I was perplexed by this. I said to my mother: Why was she rude to me? \nWhy didn't she say thank you and take the seat?\n  My mother explained to me the laws in those days that sent African \nAmericans to the back of the bus. I at 10 years old was astounded, \nshocked, angry. My mother said to me: Why don't we just stand up. And \nthat is what we did. We walked to the back, and we stood.\n  That was an America that is no more, but that is an America we cannot \nforget. That was an overt law to hurt people, to make America ``we and \nthem.'' That is why the law we are passing today is so important--\nbecause it says that we all recognize that even though that America is \nno more, we have more work to do.\n  And then came the sixties. Of course, we know it was Rosa Parks who \nchanged the world with that one act of defiance of hers, where she just \nwent on that bus and she wasn't going to the back.\n  When I met her, when President Clinton invited her to the White House \nand I went there, I stood in awe because it said to me how one person \ncan make a difference in this, the greatest nation in the world. We get \nso frustrated sometimes; we feel we can't make a difference. Here is \none woman saying, No, I won't do that; that's wrong; I'm one of God's \nchildren. And that act of defiance changed our country. I am so happy \nthis bill is named after her and Fannie Lou Hamer who helped organize \nFreedom Summer in 1965 which helped lead to passage of this landmark \nbill we will vote on today. She had a very simple phrase that she used: \n``Nobody's free until everybody's free.'' ``Nobody's free until \neverybody's free.'' That reminds us of the work that we certainly have \nto do today.\n  So Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King, who worked \nwith her great husband during the civil rights movement in the sixties \nand carried on his work after his horrific assassination, working for \njustice, worked for equality not only in this country but around the \nworld.\n  In the late eighties, she worked tirelessly to help bring an end to \napartheid in South Africa. I often quote Martin Luther King, almost in \nevery speech I give, because he is one of my heroes. One of the lines \nhe said, which isn't really one that gets quoted all the time, is that \n``Our lives begin to end when we stop talking about things that \nmatter.'' ``Our lives begin to end when we stop talking about things \nthat matter.'' That touched me and reached me.\n  I think his words, of course, reached every American, regardless of \npolitical party. Don't stop talking about things that matter, even \nthough it might be easier to do so, even though it might be easier when \nyou are at a friend's house and somebody says something that is bigoted \ntoward somebody else. It is sometimes easier for us to make believe we \ndidn't hear it. No, that matters, you matter, your view matters, your \nvalues matter. Speak up.\n  That is what we are doing, and I am proud to be in the Senate today \nbecause we are doing something good today. It is a privilege and an \nhonor to vote for this reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act.\n  I had a number of people visit me from my State yesterday--old and \nyoung, children, grandmothers, great grandmothers, granddads, lawyers, \nworkers, doctors. They just jammed into my conference room and they \nsaid: Senator Boxer, we know you are with us. We know you have been on \nthis bill. We know where you are. We have listened to you all these \nyears. We wanted to come here and say thank you.\n\n  I said: You don't need to thank me. What you need to do is join with \nme so that after this vote, we truly get equal voting rights in this \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S7994]]\n\n  That was touched on by Senator Kerry, and it was touched on by \nSenator Wyden. The right to vote--without it we are nothing. Without \nit, we are not standing up for the principles upon which this Nation \nwas founded: a government of, by, and for the people.\n  How do you have a government of, by, and for the people, if the \npeople turn away from the voting booth? I hear every excuse in the \nworld: Oh, you are all the same. What is the difference. I can't make a \ndifference. It is just false. It is just an excuse.\n  Show me two candidates running against each other at a local level, \nat a State level, at a Federal level, and I will show you the \ndifferences. If you pay attention, you will find out the differences, \nand you will cast your vote for the candidate that most represents you. \nYou are not going to agree with them 100 percent of the time. That is \nanother issue: Oh, I used to agree with him, but he did three things, \nand I don't agree with him anymore. Look at the totality. Look at the \ntotality of the voting record. Look at the totality of the opposition \nand make a decision. Don't just walk away. Don't pull the covers over \nyour head with excuses: They are all alike. I can't make a difference. \nWhat is one vote?\n  We all know the election of John Kennedy was decided by a couple of \nvotes per precinct. It could have been one vote per precinct. That is \nhow close that election was.\n  In the voting booth, we are all equal. In the voting booth, we are \nall equal. Your vote and my vote, whether you are 18 years old or you \nare my age and a Senator, we are all equal in the voting booth. We have \none vote. We should cherish it. The CEO of a giant company who earns \nmultimillions of dollars a year is equal to a minimum wage worker. And \nif that minimum wage worker thinks it is time he got a raise or she got \na raise after almost 10 years of not getting a raise, he or she ought \nto vote, and vote for the candidate who supports your right to join the \nmiddle class.\n  Every citizen of this country who is eligible to vote should be \nguaranteed that their vote is counted and that their vote matters. That \nis why it is so important that we maintain the protections of this \nhistoric Voting Rights Act, such as requiring certain localities with a \nhistory of discrimination to get approval from the Federal Government \nbefore they make changes to voting procedures. Why is this important? \nIt is important because it is a check and balance on an area that has \nin the past not shown--not shown--the willingness to fight for every \nvoter. And, requiring certain jurisdictions to provide language \nassistance to voters with limited English proficiency, and authorizing \nthe Federal Government to send election monitors to jurisdictions where \nthere is a history of attempts to intimidate minority voters at the \npolls, we just want to make sure these elections are fair, wherever \nthey are held.\n  The Federal Government must work hard to guarantee that the \ninequities we have seen in the past never resurface again. And won't \nthat be the day, when we have a system that we believe we can be proud \nof again.\n  I am proud to stand here today with an opportunity to cast a vote to \nreauthorize provisions of the Voting Rights Act. But today didn't come \nwithout struggle. Why did my people have to come all the way from \nCalifornia, spend their hard-earned dollars to get on a plane? I will \ntell you why: Because this was a hard bill to get before this body. \nPeople objected. People complained. It was a hard bill to get before \nthe House. But many people worked hard, and House Members listened to \nthe people, and Senators listened to the people.\n  I want to thank my friends at the NAACP who were finally able to \nconvince enough that, yes, this was something we had to do. We have to \nbe honest. There were attempts to weaken this bill, but we succeeded in \nnot allowing that to happen.\n  In my closing moments, I want to say that our work does not stop \ntoday, as Senator Kerry said and as Senator Wyden said. For example, \nseveral of us have introduced the Count Every Vote Act, a comprehensive \nvoting reform bill that will ensure that every American indeed can \nvote, and every vote is counted.\n  Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones, who lived through a harrowing \nexperience during the last election, with her constituents being given \nthe runaround and standing in line for 6 and 7 hours. Is that the right \nto vote, standing in line for 6 and 7 hours, people who have to work, \npeople who had health problems, people who couldn't stand up, people \nwhose legs were weakening beneath them? Is that the right to vote? I \nsay it is not the right to vote. I say it is harassment.\n  Senators Clinton, Kerry, Lautenberg, Mikulski, and I have introduced \nthe Count Every Vote Act, and I want to highlight the two key \nprovisions that are in this bill. The first is the bill would require \nelectronic voting machines provide a paper record which will allow \nvoters to verify their votes, and it will serve as a record if a manual \nrecount is needed. We go to a restaurant, we get a receipt. We go to \nthe store, we get a receipt. We save it in case there is a problem. \nWhen we vote, we should get a receipt. We should look at it, we should \ncheck it, just as we add up the bill from the restaurant. We should \ngive it back and then it is stored. In case there is a problem, we have \na paper trail.\n  The second provision: We say election day should be a Federal \nholiday. We all give speeches. We stand up and we stand behind the red, \nwhite, and blue. What a great, free country this is, and indeed it is. \nWhy shouldn't we make election day a holiday so that we can celebrate \non every election day our freedoms, our history, our rights, our \nprotections as citizens to choose our own leaders?\n  Let me say, we cannot even get to page 1 in terms of moving this bill \nforward. There is resistance to this bill. There are those in this body \nwho don't want a paper trail. They don't want to make it easier to \nvote, and let's call it what it is. That resistance exists, and that is \nwrong. So I call on the leadership of this body: Let's do something \nmore for people. Let's not have another situation where a Senator has \nto go over and protest a vote count because people said they had to \nstand in line for hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Then we have the people of Washington, DC. They are not \nrepresented with a vote. That is wrong. Over 500,000 people live in \nthis great city, the heart and soul of our democracy. Eighty percent \nare voting age. They can't cast their ballots in national elections for \ncongressional representatives. They don't have Senators or \nRepresentatives here. That is why I have joined Senator Joe Lieberman \non his bill that calls for full voting rights for DC residents.\n  So, again, I say what a privilege and honor it is for me to be here, \nto stand here, thinking back to my days as a child when African \nAmericans had to go to the back of the bus in some parts of the South, \nfeeling the pain of that myself for those who had to live in that way. \nSo this bill is a fitting tribute to Rosa Parks and Fannie Lou Hamer \nand Coretta Scott King.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his indulgence. This is a starting \nplace for a lot of us, and we are going to make sure that, in fact, the \nright to vote is a reality for every single one of our citizens.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I salute my colleague on her wonderful \nand heart-felt words.\n  Mr. President, this is a hallowed moment on the floor of this Senate. \nWe don't have too many of these hallowed moments these days, but \npassing, working for, voting for the renewal of the Voting Rights Act \nis just one of those. I rise in proud and full-hearted support of H.R. \n9, which is a bicameral and bipartisan bill, thank God, to reauthorize \nthe Voting Rights Act.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is this: Without the right to vote in \na democracy, people have no power. And while I do believe that race and \nracism have been a poison that has afflicted America for a long time, \nand there are many ways to solve that, probably the best is the full \nand unrequited power to vote. For so long, that power was denied to \npeople of color: Blacks, Hispanics, and others. Now it is not being.\n\n[[Page S7995]]\n\n  I can tell by my own history, even here in the Congress, the progress \nwe have made. When I got to the Congress in 1980, there were only 17 \nAfrican Americans in the House. Today, there are 42. That is very close \nto the percentage of African Americans in American society. That shows \nyou the progress we have made. Without the Voting Rights Act, it \nclearly would not have happened.\n  However, we sit in the Senate, and only last year did we again have \nan African American come to the Senate. There is only one. So while we \nsee the progress in the House of Representatives, we also look in the \nSenate and see how much longer we have to go.\n  I am glad that final passage is now imminent, as leaders from both \nparties are supporting this bill. Let me say this act has been hailed \nas the single most effective piece of civil rights legislation we have \never passed. The reason is it does not just simply guarantee the right \nto vote in name, but it ensures the effective exercise of that \nfundamental right.\n  Today, when we see the Governor of Georgia and the legislators of \nGeorgia impeding the right to vote, we know that we need a strong and \nfull-throated Voting Rights Act. And, thank God, the attempts to dilute \nit--mainly, I am sorry to say--coming from the other body, did not \nsucceed.\n  Our Founding Fathers said it best when they penned these words in the \nDeclaration of Independence: Government derives its just powers from \nthe consent of the governed. Simply put, in our Nation there can be no \nconsent without unfettered access to the voting booth. A renewed and \nreenergized Voting Rights Act is exactly the right formula to ensuring \nequality in the political process for all Americans.\n  In 1965, when President Johnson signed the bill into law, there were \nonly 300 minorities elected to State, local, or Federal office. North, \nSouth, East, and West, people of color were not represented. Today, \nfour decades later, in large part because of this Voting Rights Act, \n10,000 minorities serve as elected officials.\n  I have seen the Voting Rights Act have an effect on my city. New York \nis one of the most diverse cities in the country. And in our city, the \nVoting Rights Act has been extremely effective in ensuring that all our \ncitizens are able to participate equally in the political process. \nHowever, many of the act's successes in New York--we think we are a \nmodern country and, of course, a modern city--but they have only come \nsince the last time we renewed its provisions. The first and only \nAfrican-American mayor of New York wasn't elected until May of 1989. \nThe first and only African American wasn't elected to statewide office \nuntil 1994. In 2002, the first and only Asian American was elected to \nthe city council. Finally, just last year, a mayoral candidate became \nthe first and only Latino to win his party's nomination.\n  So while these strides are important, they are too few and too recent \nto declare that the promise of the Voting Rights Act has been realized. \nThe bottom line is that the Voting Rights Act has worked to remove \nbarriers from countless men and women from all backgrounds to \nparticipate in the political process, to run for office, to enter and \nthrive in the political process, but there is still a lot of work to \ndo. We cannot and thankfully will not let the act expire.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to casting my vote in favor of H.R. 9 \nlater today, and urge all of my colleagues to do so. I am hopeful that \nwe can have a unanimous vote on the floor of this Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor and \nstrong supporter of the Voting Rights Act reauthorization.\n  One of the most fundamental of American values is the right to cast a \nmeaningful vote in a free and fair election. As the Supreme Court \nstated in 1964, ``Other rights, even the most basic, are illusory if \nthe right to vote is undermined.''\n  However, just over 40 years ago, in many parts of the American South, \nit was almost impossible for people of color to even register to vote.\n  People were turned away from the courthouse when they attempted to \nregister, while others were jailed. We sometimes talk romantically \nabout the Civil Rights era, as if it were 200 or even 100 years ago. \nBut the flagrant injustices that we see captured in black and white \nvideo reels were during a time not too long ago.\n  On March 7, 1965, about 600 people attempted to peacefully march from \nSelma, AL, to Montgomery, the State capital, to dramatize to the world \ntheir desire to register to vote. And the world watched in horror as \nthese peaceful demonstrators, including my good friend and former \ncolleague, Representative John Lewis, were beaten bloody. That day \nmarked a sad, sad chapter in the history of our Nation.\n  For some, the tragedy in Selma is simply a footnote in a speech or a \ntimely anecdote during Black History Month. But we must not lose sight \nof what those brave Americans were fighting for. And we must never \nforget the price they--and others--paid for their successes: \nAmericans--Black, White, young, old, northern and southern--shed blood \nand, in some cases, gave the ultimate sacrifice so all Americans could \nenjoy the basic right to vote.\n  Five months after what is now known as ``Bloody Sunday,'' the Voting \nRights Act of 1965 was signed into law. It granted all American \ncitizens the right to vote in any Federal, State, or local election and \nin doing so ensured that they had access to the American political \nprocess and a voice in determining their future.\n  The passage of the Voting Rights Act helped expand and open our \ndemocracy to let in millions of our citizens.\n  The Voting Rights Act has empowered thousands of communities to elect \ncandidates of their choice and has ensured that a full spectrum of \nvoices is heard in our national dialogue.\n  In stark contrast to the days prior to the Voting Rights Act, today \nit is the Voting Rights Act that ensures that the elections of people \nlike Senators Barack Obama, Dan Inouye, Mel Martinez, Daniel Akaka, and \nKen Salazar are no longer electoral anomalies, but reflections of the \nwill of the communities and States they represent.\n  Today, there are 81 Members of Congress of African American, \nHispanic, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and Native American \ndescent, and thousands of minorities in elected offices around the \ncountry.\n  If it were not for the Voting Rights Act and its provisions, I very \nwell may not be standing before you today.\n  In the 21st century, at a time when we are working to bring democracy \nto both Iraq and Afghanistan, we must ensure that democracy is \nprotected here at home in every circumstance. One citizen unfairly \ndiscouraged from voting is one too many. When people are denied the \nright to vote, they are denied a say in their Government, they are \ndenied a say in the laws they are required to obey, and they are denied \na say in the policies their tax dollars support.\n  It has been said that those who fail to understand history are doomed \nto repeat it. That is why the annual walk that Congressman Lewis leads \nacross the Edmund Pettus Bridge in commemoration of the anniversary of \nthe voting rights march is so vitally important.\n  I was fortunate to visit Selma with him and the Faith and Politics \nInstitute. Nothing brings one closer to a sense of what those young men \nand women experienced--the hatred and bigotry--than standing on and \nwalking across the Pettus Bridge with Representative Lewis and learning \nwhat happened that day over 41 years ago.\n  As I listened to John Lewis and the other heroes of the movement, I \nwas reminded how average citizens committed to an ideal can effect \nchange. I was reminded through this pilgrimage that the journey is \nstill not finished and that our goal must be social justice--not simply \nsocial service. I was also touched by those who suffered so much having \nso much love in their heart. It is a lesson still timely for us today \nand tomorrow.\n  The need for the Voting Rights Act has not gone away. In my State of \nNew Jersey, a consent decree was reached after violations of the Voting \nRights Act by the Republican National Committee and the New Jersey \nRepublican\n\n[[Page S7996]]\n\nState Committee that deterred minorities from voting occurred during \nthe 1981 gubernatorial election. This just illustrates voting rights \nviolations can happen anywhere and at anytime, and are unfortunately a \npart of the historic fabric of our election process. Such violations \nwere so widespread in the 2000 elections that Congress enacted the Help \nAmerica Vote Act. If anything, need to strengthen and update the Voting \nRights Act is demonstrated in new ways every year.\n  The Voting Rights Act has been effective in eliminating barriers to \nthe ballot box. Yet, several key provisions of the act regarding \npreclearance, observers, and language assistance are scheduled to \nexpire in 2007. H.R. 9 will reauthorize these important and temporary \nprovisions for an additional 25 years. Personally, I support making \nthese provisions permanent.\n  H.R. 9 is the product of a thoughtful, thorough, bipartisan, and \nbicameral effort that carefully weighed the competing concerns and \nconsiderations that have been a part of the Voting Rights Act debate \nsince its original passage. As my colleagues well know, the act has \nbeen extended on four other occasions, very possibly making it the most \ncarefully reviewed civil rights measure in our Nation's long history.\n  This legislation we have before us today would renew the Voting \nRights Act's temporary provisions for 25 years; restore the ability of \nthe Attorney General, under section 5 of the act, to block \nimplementation of voting changes motivated by a discriminatory purpose; \nclarify that section 5 is intended to protect the ability of minority \ncitizens to elect their candidates of choice; and authorize recovery of \nexpert witness fees in lawsuits brought to enforce the Voting Rights \nAct.\n  The right to vote is so fundamental to our citizenship, so vital, \nthat we as Members of Congress must make every effort to ensure that \nthis right is a reality across the length and breadth of this great \nNation. The Voting Rights Act ensures that all American citizens have \naccess to both the ballot box and the American political process, and a \nvoice in determining their future. That is why the Voting Rights Act \nremains so desperately needed and why Congress must reauthorize the \nspecial provisions that are set to expire.\n  In addressing a joint session of Congress on the very legislation we \nare debating today, President Lyndon Baines Johnson said:\n\n       In our time we have come to live with the moments of great \n     crisis. Our lives have been marked with debate about great \n     issues--issues of war and peace, issues of prosperity and \n     depression.\n       But rarely in any time does an issue lay bare the secret \n     heart of America itself. Rarely are we met with a challenge, \n     not to our growth or abundance, or our welfare or our \n     security, but rather to the values, and the purposes, and the \n     meaning of our beloved nation.\n\n  We must heed President Johnson's admonition and take inventory of our \nNation's values, purposes and meaning. Some members of the House \nrecently argued that the Voting Rights Act is somehow outdated, has \noutlived its intended usefulness, and that it unfairly punishes those \ncovered jurisdictions for past actions and sins. I have nothing but \nrespect and esteem for that body, and look fondly upon my years of \nservice in that Chamber; but, I wholeheartedly disagree with some of my \nformer colleagues.\n  In enacting the original Voting Rights Act and its four \nreauthorizations, past Congresses have declared to the world that \nAmerica stands for freedom and democracy. But our rhetoric of equality \nand freedom must be ratified by an authentic pursuit of true freedom, \ntrue equality, and true democratic ideals. If we are to be a beacon of \ndemocracy and freedom to Baghdad, Beirut and Beijing--then we must \nfirst be a beacon of freedom and democracy to Bloomfield, Buffalo, and \nBirmingham.\n  Over 40 years ago, Senators stood on the floor of this Chamber to \nright a monumental wrong inflicted upon millions of Americans. Inspired \nby the quiet strength and principled courage of John Lewis and others \nlike him, this body acted out of courage, conviction, and conscience.\n  I don't know what senators will say 40 years from now. But, if \nnothing else, it is my prayer that they will say this Senate kept faith \nwith the highest ideals and promises of this great Nation. And that \nSenators from all corners of America, and of all political stripes, \nstood up in defense of democracy and freedom here at home.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to strongly support \nthis legislation and in doing so protect the voting rights of all \nAmericans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, in the years before the Voting \nRights Act was signed into law by President Johnson, discrimination and \nbrutal force were used to deny African Americans the right to vote as \nguaranteed by the 15th amendment.\n  There are stories of local election officials requiring Black \nresidents to pass arbitrary tests, like correctly guessing the number \nof bubbles that a bar of soap would produce, before being allowed to \nregister to vote. And, of course, there were the more insidious forms \nof intimidation, which is a very sad chapter in the history of this \ncountry, with African Americans being lynched and murdered for \nattempting to vote or registering others to vote.\n  In the 41 years since the enactment of the Voting Rights Act, America \nhas inched closer to its promise of an inclusive society, where \neveryone, regardless of race, regardless of religion, regardless of \neconomic class or regardless of gender, has an equal opportunity to \nsucceed. We are not there yet.\n  Sadly, I can point to modern day attempts to deny the right to vote \nto citizens in my own State. During the 2004 election, the Florida \nDepartment of Law Enforcement created a list of 48,000 convicted \nfelons. This list was then sent to the 67 supervisors of election in \nFlorida, who were given the instructions to strike those 48,000 \nconvicted felons from the rolls. The public was denied meaningful \naccess to the lists to verify its accuracy because of a law passed by \nthe legislature in the previous few years.\n  CNN challenged the constitutionality of the law under the Florida \nConstitution. This Senator participated in that challenge by filing \nwhat is called an amicus curiae brief, or a friend of the court brief. \nA courageous Florida circuit judge declared the law unconstitutional.\n  When the Miami Herald got their hands on the list of 48,000 names of \nconvicted felons, guess what they found. First of all, they found the \nlist was overwhelmingly minority; second, they found that the list was \noverwhelmingly minority African American; and third, they found about \n3,000 legitimate registered voters on that list who were not convicted \nfelons.\n  If not for that lawsuit 3,000 legitimate registered voters with names \nthat were similar to the names of convicted felons would have gone to \nthe polls on Election Day in November of 2004 and been told they were \nnot a registered voter and they could not vote.\n  It is 41 years since the Voting Rights Act. This just happened 2 \nyears ago. We're getting closer to the ideal, we're just not there yet.\n  Reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act is going to move us further down \nthe road and, most importantly, it will ensure that we never turn back.\n  Today, as I cast a vote in favor of reauthorizing the Voting Rights \nAct, I hope and pray that 25 years from now, at the end of the \nauthorization of this act, our country will have progressed so that we \ndo not have to continue this particular debate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues today to speak in \nsupport of reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act of 1965. No act has done \nmore to change the course of our Nation's history than this. I am \npleased to see both sides of the aisle set aside their differences to \nensure its passage today.\n  I first offer my thanks to Senators Leahy and Specter for their work \nin getting this legislation to the Senate. I also thank Senators Reid \nand Frist for their efforts in bringing all sides together to renew \nthis historic law.\n\n[[Page S7997]]\n\n  This act protects and preserves our democracy by ensuring that every \ncitizen is given the same opportunity to participate in the political \nprocess. The strength of our democracy, as well as its existence, \ndepends on the fact that the Government is created to perform, to \nexist, and to excel only when those who are governed participate in it. \nWithout this assurance, this opportunity to participate in that \npolitical process, our democracy could not exist. Without the right to \nparticipate freely in elections, a citizen's ability to effect change \nin his or her community is highly limited.\n  We are given, each of us, many God-given gifts, but our \nresponsibility with those gifts is to give of those gifts to those \naround us, to our community and to our country, to our fellow man. \nWithout being able to participate in this community, we are not able to \nfully give back.\n  I think it is important to remember what we are voting for today. Men \nand women not much older than I am made great sacrifices to be able to \nperform that most basic right of free men and free women--the right to \nvote. It is easy to take for granted. We often do. But we cannot forget \nthat this document represents the pain and hope of millions of \nAmericans. It represents their efforts and their prayers.\n  The things that we do without giving them much thought, were not so \nfor many of our fellow Americans. When we go to eat lunch, we sit \nwherever we would like. When we go to the movies, we sit wherever we \nwould like as well. When we ride the bus, we sit wherever we like, and \nwhen we get to the polls, we take our ballot and we cast it without \nthinking about it.\n  It is easy for us to forget that it has not always been so. By way of \nexample, the mother of one of my staff members became deeply involved \nin voter registration as a young college student in the early 1960s. \nShe was determined to secure the right to vote for herself and for her \ncommunity. It was a life-or-death decision. She and her fellow students \nwere told if they tried to encourage African Americans in the community \nto register, that they would be killed. They had every reason to take \nthat threat seriously, but it didn't matter to them. They knew that \nthis right, the right to vote, was worth the cost, and they continue to \nencourage people to register and to vote. By the grace of God, no one \nwas killed, but we know that others around the Nation were not so \nlucky.\n  These are the stories we must remember. We must ensure that no future \ngeneration of Americans will ever have to endure second-class \ncitizenship again. As elected officials, we are charged with \nrepresenting and protecting the interests of our States and our \ndistricts. It is of utmost importance that we are elected by a fair \nrepresentation of our constituents.\n  The Voting Rights Act has played an enormous role in making sure that \nhappens. Since becoming law in 1965, the number of African Americans \nand other minority voters who are registered and able to vote has \nincreased dramatically. As an example, my home State of Arkansas saw an \nincrease of more than 33,000 African-American registrants immediately \nafter the act was passed. Extending the provisions of this legislation \nwill ensure that we continue to build on the gains we have made since \nit first passed.\n  We have men and women spread across the globe, fighting for democracy \nand freedom. They are fighting for the right of citizens to hold free \nelections in which all, regardless of race, gender or creed, can \nparticipate. In many cases, this cannot be achieved without violence, \nunfortunately. Truth be told, we are not so far removed from our own \nviolent past.\n  But by the mercy of God, we today will extend the blessings of \nliberty to all Americans with the recording of a vote and the swipe of \na pen. That is a miracle that we dare not forget. Because of what we do \ntomorrow, the men and women who marched and stood still and sat down \nand stood up and rejoiced and cried and ultimately overcame, can be \nproud, proud that their legacy will be carried on.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, briefly, I want to propound a unanimous \nconsent request which has been agreed to by the leadership on the other \nside. And then people will know the scheduling for today and tonight.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the pending \nbill, H.R. 9, occur at 4:30 today, with Senator Reid recognized from 4 \nto 4:15 and Senator Frist in control of the time from 4:15 to 4:30; \nprovided further that the remaining time be under the control of the \nminority.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the vote on passage of H.R. 9, \nthe Voting Rights Act, the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 379, H.R. 4472. I further ask consent \nthat the Hatch amendment at the desk be agreed to, and there then be 2 \nhours of debate equally divided between the leaders or their designees, \nand that following the use or yielding back of time, the bill, as \namended, be read a third time, and the bill be temporarily set aside \nwith the vote on passage occurring after consideration of the judges in \nexecutive session. I further ask unanimous consent that following \npassage of the bill, the title amendment be agreed to; provided further \nthat following the debate on H.R. 4472, the Senate proceed to executive \nsession for consideration of the following executive calendar numbers \nen bloc, under the designated times: Calendar No. 762, Neil Gorsuch, 5 \nminutes each for Senators Specter, Leahy, Allard, and Salazar; Calendar \nNo. 763, Bobby Shepherd, 5 minutes each for Senators Specter and Leahy, \nand 10 minutes each for Senators Pryor and Lincoln; Calendar No. 765, \nDaniel Jordan III, 5 minutes each for Senators Specter, Leahy, Cochran, \nand Lott; Calendar No. 766, Gustavo Gelpi, 5 minutes each for Senators \nSpecter and Leahy.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the use or yielding \nback of the debate times above, the Senate proceed to a vote on passage \nof H.R. 4472, to be followed by consecutive votes on the confirmation \nof the above-listed nominations in the order specified, without \nintervening action or debate, and that following those votes, the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the \nSenate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, again, very briefly, what that means is \nthat we will be voting at approximately 4:30. We will then move to the \nJohn Walsh child predator bill, have debate on that, and have debate on \nthe judges, and then we will have stacked rollcall votes beginning at \napproximately 7:15 or 7:30 tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is with a great sense of pride and \nprivilege that I rise today in strong, strong support of H.R. 9, the \nFannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act \nReauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006.\n  In my view, of all the values which underpin a democracy, none--\nnone--is more essential than the right of a citizen to participate in \nthe election of those who will govern and represent them.\n  Voting is the participatory voice of our form of democracy. It is \nimperative, in my view, that we reaffirm this fundamental principle by \nexpeditiously reauthorizing this fundamental voting rights legislation. \nIt is for this reason that I will vote in favor of the Voting Rights \nAct extension. America must overcome its legacy of discrimination in \nvoting.\n  Let me, first of all, applaud our colleagues, if I may, the leaders \nof the Judiciary Committee, Senator Specter, Senator Leahy, and Senator \nKennedy for their extraordinary efforts to develop a truly bipartisan \npiece of legislation that has been brought to the floor here today. I \nfeel very strongly about the need to reauthorize this law, and I \ncommend our colleagues for the leadership they have shown in marking up \na bill that I gather passed unanimously out of the Judiciary Committee \nand is before us today.\n\n[[Page S7998]]\n\n  It was about 40 years ago when I was sitting up in these Galleries, \nwatching the U.S. Senate as it engaged in an impassioned debate among \nour predecessors in this Chamber about whether to extend to all \nAmericans equal rights at the polling place. I was a college student at \nthe time. I listened to one U.S. Senator say:\n\n       Freedom and the right to vote are indivisible.\n\n  That U.S. Senator was my father, Thomas Dodd of Connecticut, speaking \nabout the Voting Rights Act in that year. As I watched my father and \nhis colleagues engage in a very heated debate, I was proud of how many \nMembers of this body, on both sides of the aisle, worked to end \ndiscriminatory voting practices, Republicans and Democrats alike coming \ntogether.\n  It was following this debate, in 1965, that Congress took up and \npassed the Voting Rights Act--the first being the Civil Rights Act--as \na response to the pervasive and explicit evidence of disenfranchisement \nof African-American and other voters in several States in our country.\n  The Voting Rights Act was designed, of course, as we all know, to \nprotect and preserve the voting rights of all Americans. Since 1965, \nthis act has been the cornerstone of voting rights in our country, and \nits success is a tribute to those who have labored to create it.\n  I would be remiss if I did not pay tribute to those that this act is \nnamed for: Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King. Many \nmay recall, it was Fannie Lou Hamer who once commented that she was \n``sick and tired of being sick and tired.'' In 1962, Mrs. Hamer, the \nyoungest of 19 children, daughter of sharecroppers, and granddaughter \nof slaves, attended a voting registration drive held by the Student \nNonviolent Coordinating Committee. There she learned that African \nAmericans indeed had the constitutional right to vote.\n  She was the first to volunteer for a dangerous mission to the \nIndianola, MS, courthouse to register to vote. Courageously, she \ndeclared:\n\n       [T]he only thing they could do to me was to kill me, and it \n     seemed like they'd been trying to do that a little bit at a \n     time ever since I could remember.\n\n  When Mrs. Hamer reached the courthouse, she and her companions were \nbeaten and jailed. But she was not deterred. She went on to travel the \ncountry to encourage others to vote and later founded the Mississippi \nFreedom Democratic Party to challenge the all-white Mississippi \ndelegation at the Democratic Convention--not in the 19th century, not \nin the early part of the 20th century--but in 1964.\n  The Voting Rights Act was signed into law a year later. In my view, \nif Mrs. Hamer had not risked her life and limb in order to register to \nvote, the plight of minority voters shut out of their own democracy may \nhave continued, unfortunately.\n  Rosa Parks was another pioneer of the civil rights movement. As a \nseamstress in Montgomery, AL, she famously challenged the Jim Crow laws \nof segregation in 1955. Mrs. Parks once recalled that as a young child:\n\n       I'd see the bus pass every day. . . . But to me, that was a \n     way of life; we had no choice but to accept what was the \n     custom. The bus was among the first ways I realized there was \n     a black world and a white world.\n\n  Her historic refusal to give up her bus seat to a white passenger led \nto her arrest, and sparked a citywide boycott of the bus system, which \ntriggered two Supreme Court decisions outlawing segregation on city \nbuses. In my view, her silent protest launched the modernday civil \nrights movement. And we owe her a great deal of debt for her courage.\n  In describing this incident, Mrs. Parks later recalled:\n\n       People always say that I didn't give up my seat because I \n     was tired, but that isn't true. I was not tired physically, \n     or no more tired than I usually was at the end of a working \n     day. No, the only tired I was, was tired of giving in.\n\n  For more than four decades, Mrs. Parks dedicated herself to the fight \nfor racial equality. I strongly believe that if Mrs. Parks had not \nrefused to give up her seat and had gone to the back of the bus that \nday we would not be here today considering this historic legislation.\n  Let me mention the third individual for whom this act is being named \ntoday.\n  Coretta Scott King, of course, the wife of Dr. Martin Luther King, \njoined her husband and thousands of others to march from Selma to \nMontgomery, AL, on Sunday, March 7, 1965. That march, of course, \ngalvanized the core political will behind the civil rights movement and \nserved as a catalyst for the Voting Rights Act.\n  These three women worked for a better life and an inclusive society \nfor not only themselves and their children, but also for future \ngenerations of Americans.\n  They selflessly and nonviolently challenged the laws and customs they \nbelieved were wrong. And they were right. Their ability to speak \n``truth to power'' became their legacy. All three are iconic in the \nfight for the right to vote and a better life for all Americans.\n  Let me go on to point out here--I will not go into the specific \nsections of this bill. I know others have talked about that, why these \nsections are necessary to be continued for another 25 years. Let me, if \nI can, address some of the concerns that were raised in the other body \nin objections to the Voting Rights Act, if I may--those who question \nwhy divisions of a 41-year-old law deserve to be reauthorized. And \nwhile I agree, progress has certainly been made--and we are all \ngrateful for that--we still have many obstacles to overcome in the \nconduct of our elections.\n  Progress cannot be left to just serendipity. It must be guided by the \nrule of law. A little more than 5 years ago, we had an election in this \ncountry that forced us to confront the harsh reality that millions of \nAmericans continue to be systematically denied their constitutional \nright to vote.\n  Every citizen deserves, of course, to have his or her vote counted as \nwell. There are legal barriers, administrative irregularities, and \naccess impediments to the right to vote which adversely and \ndisproportionately impact voters according to their color, economic \nclass, age, gender, disability, language, party, and precinct. That is \nwrong. It is unacceptable. It is un-American. And it needs to be \nchanged.\n  It was unacceptable in 1965, and it is reprehensible in the year \n2006. Congress must now reauthorize the expiring portions of the Voting \nRights Act to continue to protect and preserve the voting rights of all \nAmericans.\n  I have been closely following the reauthorization process in both \nChambers. I was apprehensive when House Republicans attempted to amend \nthe Voting Rights Act to undermine some of its very key provisions--\nessentially weakening this very important and fundamental law. They \ntried to repeal the current formula of section 5 in order to exempt \nStates with historically discriminatory voting practices from continued \ncoverage. They wanted to expedite the ``bailout'' process overriding \nthe sensible framework for jurisdictions to demonstrate that they \nshould not be subject to continuing section 5 coverage. They wanted to \nrequire us to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act in only 10 short years. \nFinally, in what I think is the most alarming attempt to weaken this \nvital law, House Republicans wanted to strike section 203 which ensures \nthat all American citizens, regardless of language ability, are able to \nparticipate on a fair and equal basis in elections.\n\n  I believe all Americans who are voting should learn to speak the \nEnglish language. It should be our goal that all American citizens who \nvote should be able to understand an English language ballot. That is \nsomething we are wrestling with all the time. But we also recognize \nthere are many here who are in the process of transition. Many of our \ncitizens speak only one language as they are learning English. That \nmakes them no less deserving, if they are citizens, of the basic rights \nand liberties which all Americans should expect and are entitled to. \nSection 203 must be retained or its unique ability to remove barriers \nto this fundamental right to vote and to help promote meaningful \nparticipation among all segments of our society will be in jeopardy.\n  I am grateful that the civil rights groups, the Leadership Conference \non Civil Rights, the NAACP, the National Council of La Raza, the AFL-\nCIO and others, have worked so closely with Democratic Members of the \nHouse of Representatives to prevail over this adversity and were able \nto defeat every single one of these amendments.\n\n[[Page S7999]]\n\n  Central to the foundation of our democratic form of government is, of \ncourse, the right to vote. The Voting Rights Act today facilitates and \nensures that right. In a representative democracy, voting is the best \navenue, of course, by which voters can gain access and influence \nlawmakers in Federal, State, and local governments. Voting gives the \npeople a voice. We must protect their ability to be heard and to speak.\n  Yesterday, I had the great privilege of meeting with 40 \nrepresentatives from the Connecticut chapter of the NAACP about this \nimportant reauthorization.\n  Their message was clear: the critical protections offered by the \nVoting Rights Act must be extended. We are not on the Floor today to \nreauthorize the right to vote. That right is guaranteed by the \nConstitution of the United States. Instead, we are here to provide \ntools to enforce that right for all Americans.\n  While it is critical that the Senate act to reauthorize these \nexpiring sections of the Voting Rights Act today, it is important to \nrecognize that this action alone will not secure the franchise for all \nAmericans. Much more is needed to be done to ensure that every eligible \nAmerican voter has an equal opportunity to vote and have their vote \ncounted.\n  In addition to the obstacles that the Voting Rights Act is designed \nto address, too many Americans still face impediments to voting. The \nPresidential elections of 2000 and 2004 are replete with examples of \nsuch obstacles, including: too few polling places or too few voting \nmachines to serve the turnout; eligible voters' names not on the \nregistration list; errors in the registration lists; malfunctioning \nmachines and machines that produce no audit trail; eligible voters \nturned away at the polls; disabled voters unable to cast a secret \nballot; voters unable to correct mistakes on ballots or even receive a \nnew ballot if their ballot was spoiled, to name only a few.\n  Congress addressed some of these impediments in the landmark \nlegislation enacted following the debacle of the presidential election \nin 2002 in the Help America Vote Act, or HAVA, which I was pleased to \nauthor in the Senate. That legislation established Federal minimum \nrequirements that all States must have in place by the Federal \nelections this year. Those requirements include allowing any voter who \nis challenged at the polls to cast a provisional ballot, which is set \naside and counted after eligibility, is confirmed. States must also \nmeet new Federal minimum standards for voting systems, including \nproviding second-chance voting, ensuring disability access, and \nproviding for a permanent paper record for auditing purposes. And \nStates must implement a statewide, computerized registration list to \nserve as the official registration list for Federal elections.\n  Congress has not fully funded HAVA. The States are $724 million short \nin the promised Federal funds for requirements grants and an additional \n$74 million short in disability access grants. It is my intent to offer \nan amendment to the Treasury-Transportation-HUD Appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 2007 to fully fund the requirement grants to States under \nHAVA, when that bill comes to the Senate floor for debate. But even the \nHAVA minimum requirements are only a first step to addressing the \ncontinuing impediments faced by voters across this Nation.\n  To address additional election administration deficiencies, I \nintroduced legislation in January of last year, S. 17, the Voting \nOpportunity and Technology Enhancement Rights Act of 2005, or the VOTER \nAct. The Voting Opportunity and Technology Enhancement Rights Act of \n2005, or the VOTER Act, builds on the reforms begun by HAVA, and adds \nto those reforms, by including the following: providing every eligible \nAmerican, regardless of where they live in the world or where they find \nthemselves on election day, the right to cast a National Federal Write-\nIn Absentee Ballot in Federal elections: requiring States to \nprovide for election day registration; requiring States to provide a \nminimum required number of voting systems and poll workers for each \npolling place on election day and during early voting; requiring States \nto count a provisional ballot for Federal office cast within the State \nby an otherwise eligible voter, notwithstanding the polling place in \nwhich the ballot is cast; requiring that all States provide voters a \nvoter-verified ballot with a choice of at least 4 formats for recording \ntheir verification: a paper record; an audio record; a pictorial \nrecord; and an electronic record or other means which is fully \naccessible to the disabled, including the blind and visually impaired; \nrequiring States to provide public notice of any registration list \npurges not later than 45 days before a Federal election; allowing \nvoters to attest to their citizenship and age on voter registration \nforms; and providing additional Federal funds to States to implement \nthese new requirements.\n\n  Once Congress has completed its action on the Voting Rights Act, it \nis imperative that the Senate turn its attention to these further \nelection administration reforms. As the ranking member of the Senate \nCommittee on Rules and Administration, which has jurisdiction over \nelection reform issues, I look forward to that debate and the action of \nthe Senate to ensure that every eligible American voter has an equal \nopportunity to cast a ballot and have that ballot counted, regardless \nof color or class, gender or age, disability or native language, party \nor precinct, or the resources of the community in which they live.\n  I am very grateful to the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and \nthe NAACP. They were such strong supporters of the Help America Vote \nAct. That bill passed the Senate by a vote of 92 to 2 after a lengthy \ndebate. We authorized close to $4 billion to the States to allow them \nto improve voting systems.\n  It is not a perfect bill, but it is a major step forward. In the \ncoming weeks, when we will have appropriations matters before us, and \nas I said, I will be offering amendments to fully fund the HAVA bill \nand other such changes as I have offered in separate legislation to \nstrengthen that particular effort. But it was important on this bill \nthat we not complicate this important piece of legislation with \nmodifications to the HAVA bill or additional ideas to improve voting \naccess in this country. But we need to continue to work at it. It is \nunfortunate that in our country in too many of our elections the right \nto vote and have your vote counted depends upon the economic \ncircumstances of the county in which you reside. That must change when \nit comes to Federal elections. My hope is we made a major step forward \nwith the HAVA bill, and we continue to work at this on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  As was said many years ago by Thomas Paine, the right to vote is the \nright upon which all other rights depend. If we don't get this one \nright, then all the other rights we depend upon as American citizens \nare in jeopardy. The Voting Rights Act speaks to that claim more than \ntwo centuries ago, that the right to vote is the right upon which all \nother rights depend. What a great message that would be to the American \npublic that we still understand this Nation has yet to achieve the \nperfection that its Founders designed, but each generation strives to \nmake it a more perfect union. Passage of this bill today will be a step \nin that direction.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in achieving a unanimous vote to \nreauthorize the expiring provisions of the Voting Rights Act for \nanother 25 years. In 1965, a bipartisan coalition of Senators came \ntogether to pass this historic bill for the first time. Today, passage \nof this act is vital to bring about the day for America envisioned by \nthose for which it is named. Coretta Scott King, Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa \nParks, and countless others worked tirelessly to guarantee the ability \nof all Americans to exercise their right to vote. Mr. President, we \nhonor their work today by passing this important legislation. Thank \nyou. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I commend the very able Senator from \nConnecticut, not only for the very eloquent statement he made but for \nthe leadership which he has shown with respect to this critically \nimportant issue of the right to vote. The Senator from Connecticut has \nframed and crafted and brought to the floor of the Senate in recent \nyears extremely important legislation designed to assure all Americans \ntheir right to the ballot,\n\n[[Page S8000]]\n\nthereby strengthening the very fundamentals of our democracy. I would \nbe remiss if I did not take advantage of this opportunity to express \nthe gratitude we all feel to him for his leadership in this area.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Maryland for those kind words.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The legislation we have before us is as significant as \nany this Congress will consider. The Voting Rights Act was first signed \ninto law on August 6, 1965, by President Lyndon Baines Johnson. The \nfundamental importance of this law cannot be overstated. It is no \nexaggeration to say that it both changed the nature of American society \nand changed the course of American history. More than a quarter of a \ncentury before the Voting Rights Act was passed, the great scholar \nGunnar Myrdal had written in his landmark study ``An American \nDilemma,'' his study of race in this country, that ``the American Negro \nproblem,'' as it was then known, was by no means a problem only for \nAfrican Americans. Rather, he wrote, it is a problem ``in the heart of \nthe American.''\n  Myrdal set out what he called the American creed, the abiding \nprinciples on which this Nation is founded. The American creed, he \nsaid, ``is the cement in the structure of this great and disparate \nnation . . . encompassing our ideals of the essential dignity of the \nindividual human being, of the fundamental equality of all men [and \nwomen], and of certain inalienable rights to freedom, justice, and a \nfair opportunity.'' These ideals are ``written into the Declaration of \nIndependence, the Preamble to the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and \ninto the constitutions of the several states.''\n\n  Regrettably for much of our history, our Nation failed to live up to \nits most cherished principles. Our great challenge, as one observer has \nput it, has always been ``to live up to the ideals of the American \nCreed or face a deterioration of the values and visions that unite and \nmake it great.''\n  Myrdal's study was, in effect, the 20th century equivalent of Thomas \nJefferson's ``fire bell in the night.'' Yet more than a generation \npassed between the publication of Myrdal's study and the passage of the \nVoting Rights Act. As we debate this legislation and recall the \ntremendous sacrifices of Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta \nScott King, after whom the legislation is named, I also call to my \ncolleagues' attention the riveting autobiography of our House colleague \nCongressman John Lewis who for 20 years has represented Georgia's ninth \ndistrict with such great distinction.\n  On March 7, 1965, John Lewis was in Selma, AL, his home State, \npreparing with hundreds of others to march from Selma to Montgomery to \nassert the right to vote which at that time was granted or denied \nsolely at the discretion of the State governments. ``Many of the men \nand women gathered on that ballfield,'' remembers Congressman Lewis, \n``had come straight from church. They were still wearing their summer \noutfits. Some of the women had on high heels.'' Some 600 marchers set \nout, two abreast. All were prepared, quite literally, to die for the \nright to vote. And in the police assault that followed, many of them, \nincluding Congressman Lewis, nearly did.\n  President Johnson's response the following Saturday was very clear. \nHe said:\n\n       The events of last Sunday cannot and will not be repeated, \n     but the demonstrations in Selma have a much larger meaning. \n     They are a protest against a deep and very unjust flaw in \n     American democracy itself.\n       Ninety-five years ago our Constitution was amended to \n     require that no American be denied the right to vote because \n     of race or color. Almost a century later, many Americans are \n     kept from voting simply because they are Negroes.\n       Therefore, this Monday I will send to the Congress a \n     request for legislation to carry out the amendment of the \n     Constitution.\n\n  In signing the Voting Rights Act, President Johnson said:\n\n       The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by \n     man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible \n     walls which imprison men because they are different from \n     other men.\n\n  Indeed, the act marked a decisive turning point in the long and \narduous road we know as the civil rights movement. Since its enactment, \nthe Voting Rights Act has been extended and amended four times to \naddress problems of bigotry and discrimination that may take subtler \nforms than those confronting the Selma marchers in 1965, but that are \nno less insidious in undermining the constitutional principles by which \nwe aspire to live. As our able colleague, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Vermont, Mr. Leahy, the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, \nhas noted, in reauthorizing and extending the act, we are, in fact, \nrevitalizing it. We do so not only to honor the courageous men and \nwomen who, such as Congressman Lewis and Fannie Lou Hamer and Rosa \nParks and Coretta Scott King and so many others, risked and in some \ncases sacrificed their lives to uphold American principles, but to \nbuild a stronger foundation for the Nation we will leave to our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  The committee brought this bill to the Senate floor having \nconstructed a compelling record that shows we have made progress but \nthat entrenched discriminatory practices--some obvious and some \nhidden--remain. In uniting to support H.R. 9 and enacting this \nlegislation, we will be acting in a spirit true to our better selves, \nto our Nation, and to the generations yet to come.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I strongly and enthusiastically support the \nFannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act \nReauthorization of 2006, S. 2703. The right to vote is the foundation \nof our democracy, and the Voting Rights Act provides the legal basis to \nprotect this right. Ensuring that all citizens can vote and that every \nvote counts is surely one of our highest national priorities, and the \npassage of time has not diminished the need for such protections. \nHearings held in the Senate and in the House in 2005 and 2006 revealed \na new generation of tactics, including at-large elections, annexations, \nlast-minute poll place changes, and redistricting, which have had a \ndiscriminatory impact on voters, especially racial and ethnic minority \nAmerican voters.\n  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was enacted to insure that no Federal, \nState, or local government may in any way impede people from \nregistering to vote or voting because of their race or ethnicity. Most \nprovisions in the Voting Rights Act, and specifically the portions that \nguarantee that no one may be denied the right to vote because of his or \nher race or color, are permanent. There are, however, three \nenforcement-related provisions of the act that will expire in August \n2007. The first is section 5, which requires certain jurisdictions to \nobtain approval or ``preclearance'' from the U.S. Department of Justice \nor the U.S. District Court in Washington, DC, before they can make any \nchanges to voting practices or procedures. The second provision that \nwill expire is section 203, which requires certain jurisdictions to \nprovide bilingual language assistance to voters in communities where \nthere is a concentration of citizens who are limited to English \nproficient. The third are those provisions in sections 6 to 9 which \nauthorize the Federal Government to send Federal election examiners and \nobservers to certain jurisdictions covered by section 5 where there is \nevidence of attempts to intimidate minority voters at the polls. The \nlegislation before the Senate today reauthorizes the portions of the \nVoting Rights Act that will expire next year and will allow the Federal \nGovernment to address new challenges.\n  Today we are mindful of the fact that nearly 41 years ago, thousands \nof individuals risked their lives and some died in the challenge of \nsystems that prevented millions of Americans from exercising their \nright to vote. For a hundred years after the Civil War, millions of \nAfrican Americans were denied this fundamental right, despite the 15th \namendment to the Constitution that prohibited the denial of the right \nto vote on the basis of race. Poll taxes, literacy tests, and \ngrandfather c1auses--as well as violence--were used to deny African-\nAmerican citizens the right to vote in many Southern States. During the \n1960s, to secure this most basic right, the cost was high: church \nburnings, bombings, shootings, and beatings. It required the ultimate \nsacrifice of ordinary Americans: James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and \nMichael Schwerner, who simply sought to register voters in Mississippi; \nJimmie Lee Jackson, whose death precipitated the famous march from \nSelma to Montgomery; Viola Liuzzo, a White Detroit\n\n[[Page S8001]]\n\nhomemaker and mother of five who was killed by a Ku Klux Klansmen's \nbullet after she participated in the Selma to Montgomery march; and the \nfour little Black girls killed in the Birmingham church bombing--Denise \nMcNair, Carole Robertson, Addie Mae Collins, and Cynthia Wesley; Medgar \nEvers, who had organized voter registration in Mississippi for the \nNAACP and was gunned down in his driveway; the horrible beatings of \nJohn Lewis and of Fannie Lou Hamer and Aaron Henry of Mississippi. Like \nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Rosa Parks, their names are forever \netched in this Nation's history.\n  The impact of these tragic revelations and the subsequent enactment \nof the Voting Rights Act is stark. In Alabama, Black voter registration \nincreased from 0.4 percent in 1940 to 23 percent in 1964 and more than \ndoubled from 1954 to 1968, to 56.7 percent. Mississippi's Black voter \nregistration went from 6.7 percent in 1964 to 54.4 percent in 1968. And \nthe increase was reflected in many other cities and States nationwide.\n  Let us do what we must do. Our democracy depends on protecting the \nright of every American citizen to vote in every election. Let us \nresoundingly reauthorize the Voting Rights Act.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to give my strong support \nof the Voting Rights Reauthorization Act. I am a proud cosponsor of \nthis important and needed legislation.\n  In 2006, there are still places in America where voters are \nintimidated and turned away from the polls. Americans are being denied \nthe most basic and fundamental right as an American the right to vote. \nThat is why this bill is needed more than ever.\n  I am proud to be here to speak as the Senator from Maryland. From the \ndark days of slavery to the civil rights movement, Marylanders have led \nthe way to end discrimination. The brilliant Frederick Douglass, who \nwas the voice of the voiceless in the struggle against slavery; the \ncourageous Harriet Tubman, who delivered 300 slaves to freedom on her \nUnderground Railroad; and the great Thurgood Marshall, from arguing \nBrown v. Board of Education to serving as a Supreme Court Justice--all \nwere Marylanders.\n  Not just Marylanders but civil rights leaders and activists from all \nover this country fought hard to get the right to vote. Over 600 people \nmarched from Selma to Montgomery they were stopped, beaten, but not \ndefeated. These brave men and women continued to march, continued to \nfight until they got the right to vote.\n  They had to challenge the establishment and to say ``now'' when \nothers told them to ``wait.'' Holding dear to their hearts the words of \nFrederick Douglass:\n\n       If there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those who \n     profess to favor freedom, yet deprecate agitation are men who \n     don't want crops without plowing the ground. They want rain \n     without thunder and lightning. The struggle may be a moral \n     one, or it may be a physical one, but it must be a struggle. \n     Power concedes nothing without demand. It never did, and it \n     never will.\n\n  Their fight, their struggle resulted in the Voting Rights Act being \npassed. This legislation guarantees one of the most important civil \nrights that every citizen may vote. It is the very foundation of our \ndemocracy. It has eliminated discriminatory practices such as poll \ntaxes and literacy tests. It has made it possible for African Americans \nto vote and hold elective office.\n  We have come a long way since the original Voting Rights Act was \npassed in 1965. Yet we have a long way to go. As recent as 2004, we \nhave seen voters disenfranchised, broken election machines, and \nproblems with people casting their ballots on election day. We saw this \nin the 2000 Presidential elections, too.\n  In 2000, we all learned that many ballots, many peoples' votes, were \nthrown out, lost, misplaced or miscounted. We saw election officials \nwho did not know the rules and some who appeared to ignore the rules. \nAnd where did much of this happen? In minority neighborhoods, in \ncities, economically distressed areas across the Nation. I ask myself, \nis this just a coincidence? Those communities don't think so. It is \ncritical that we let them know we take their concerns seriously.\n  This legislation recognizes that election reform is still needed. \nVoters are scared to come forward and cast their vote in some parts of \nthis country. There are places where voters are not getting assistance \nat the polls whether it is language access or access to accurate \ninformation. This is unacceptable. It is un-American.\n  Reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act will help guarantee the right to \nvote for all Americans. The bill does four important things. First, it \nrequires States with a history of racial discrimination to have their \nvoting laws precleared by the Department of Justice. This extra layer \nof oversight is still necessary to protect minority voters. Second, it \nprohibits all States from imposing any requirements that would deny a \nU.S. citizen the right to vote based on race, color, or language \nability. Third, it requires language assistance at the polls if a U.S. \ncitizen has difficulty speaking or reading English. Finally, it \nauthorizes the Federal Government to send Federal election monitors to \nminority voter districts to prevent voter intimidation.\n  This is not a Republican or a Democratic issue. Ensuring that every \nregistered voter who wants to vote can vote is not a partisan issue. It \nis what America stands for.\n  We must stand up for what America stands for: opportunity, equality, \nand empowerment. We must make sure there is no discrimination of any \nkind, anywhere in America whether it is the old-fashioned kind or the \nnew-fashioned kind. I urge my colleagues to support reauthorizing the \nVoting Rights Act today.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nFannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act \nReauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006, VRA. The right to vote is \nthe cornerstone of our democracy, and it is central that every American \nhave the right to vote. I am a proud original cosponsor of this bill, \nand I hope that the reauthorization of the VRA will continue to protect \nour country's democratic promise.\n  The VRA is one of the most significant pieces of civil rights \nlegislation to ever become law. The act reaffirms the 15th amendment of \nthe Constitution, which promised that the ``right of citizens of the \nUnited States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United \nStates or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition \nof servitude.'' In 1965, Congress recognized that this promise remained \nunfulfilled, and that barriers such as literacy tests and poll taxes \nprevented many American citizens from exercising their right to vote. \nThe VRA has addressed these problems by prohibiting discrimination and \nproviding language assistance to those who needed it.\n  As an Asian American, this bill is of personal importance to me. I \nknow of many Asian Americans who have experienced difficulty in the \npolls over the years, particularly due to language barriers. According \nto the 2000 Census, 77 percent of Asian Americans speak a language \nother than English in their homes. Asian Americans who came as refugees \nare the most likely to face language barriers. For example, 67 percent \nof Vietnamese Americans over 18 are limited English proficient. They \nfollow the news closely, but often by accessing newspapers and other \nmedia in their native languages. Section 5 of the VRA will help provide \nAsian Americans with equal access to the polls, ensuring that they are \nable to participate in the political process and empowering them to \nmake a difference in their communities.\n  Over the years, our country has come a long way. But unfortunately, \nbarriers to equal political participation remain. Some minority voters \nstill face obstacles to making their political voice heard. There is \nevidence of attempts to mute the strength of minority voters via unfair \nredistricting. Further, the lack of bilingual ballots prevents some \nvoters from even casting their vote. This type of ongoing \ndiscrimination proves why we still need the VRA.\n  Over the years, Congress has reauthorized the VRA four times. The \nbill before us today would reauthorize three key enforcement provisions \nof the VRA which would otherwise expire in 2007: Section 5, which \nrequires jurisdictions with a history of discrimination to obtain \nFederal clearance before introducing new voting practices or \nprocedures; Section 203, which requires communities with large \npopulations of\n\n[[Page S8002]]\n\nnon-English speakers to provide language assistance; and Section 8, \nwhich authorizes the Attorney General to appoint Federal election \nobservers to ensure that minority citizens will have full access to the \nballot box.\n  There is no question that all of these provisions are important and \nnecessary, and I commend the members of the Judiciary Committee for \ntheir strong bipartisan work on this issue. I hope my colleagues will \njoin me in supporting this critical piece of legislation, and I look \nforward to the President signing it into law.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of the Senate bill, I am \npleased the Senate is considering the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and \nCoretta Scott King Voting Rights Reauthorization and Amendments Act, \nH.R. 9.\n  The Voting Rights Act was signed into law 41 years ago as a direct \nreaction to the vicious attacks against civil rights demonstrators \ncrossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, AL. After these attacks, \nPresident Johnson was able to end a long deadlock with certain Members \nof Congress attempting to weaken the legislation. The act passed in \nAugust 1965 and successfully prohibited measures that localities had \ndeveloped to disenfranchise racial and ethnic minorities, such as \nliteracy tests, ``grandfather clauses,'' character assessments, poll \ntaxes, and intimidation techniques, often violent. It was also drafted \nto prevent the racial gerrymandering, at-large election systems, \nstaggered terms, and runoff requirements certain jurisdictions were \nusing to dilute the effect of the minority vote.\n  Since then, sections 2 and 4 of the law, prohibiting the use of tests \nand devices intended to dissuade minority voting, have made obvious \nattempts to disenfranchise minorities a thing of the past. By requiring \ndistrict court or attorney general determination of whether a proposed \nelection change would abridge voting rights, section 5 has deterred \nmeasures frequently used before 1965 to weaken minority votes.\n  Thanks to the original law and the reauthorizations that followed, an \nincreasing number of African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans \nhave been voting, decreasing the gap between white and minority \nturnout. Minorities report fewer attempts to curtail their rights and \nminority districts have allowed a greater number of African Americans, \nAsian Americans, and Hispanic Americans to be elected to office. The \nVoting Rights Act, then, has been successful in helping to carry out \nthe promise of the 15th amendment.\n  Since 1965, Congress has responded to continuing or new evidence of \ndisenfranchisement and vote dilution through the Voting Rights Act \nreauthorization process. And this reauthorization is no different.\n  The nonpartisan Lawyer's Committee for Civil Rights, which President \nJohn F. Kennedy created to promote voting equality, established a \ncommission to conduct an investigation into vote discrimination in \npreparation for this most recent reauthorization proposal. The \nconclusions of the Commission, echoed in the many congressional \nhearings held on the law, was that, while the Voting Rights Act has \nsuccessfully eliminated systematic efforts to disenfranchise voters, \nrestrictions to ballot access and weakening of the minority vote are \nstill occurring. In fact, the Commission reported that attempts to \nrepress the minority vote, ``are still encountered in every election \ncycle across the country,'' citing deterrents against English-language \nminorities, unduly burdensome requirements for registration and voting, \nand election laws that result in vote dilution. Unfortunately, the 41 \nyears this law has been in effect have not yet overcome centuries of \ndiscriminatory practice.\n  Since the last reauthorization, the Supreme Court, in Reno v. Bossier \nParish II and Georgia v. Ashcroft, has also curtailed the intent of \nsection 5 of the Voting Rights Act, deciding that the act does not \nprohibit redistricting with the purpose or effect of weakening minority \nvotes. Many of the changes in the bill before us were drafted as a \ndirect response to these cases. This act not only renews the expiring \nprovisions, it restores the original intent of section 5 by prohibiting \nthe approval of any proposed election law change having the effect of \ndiluting a minority voting population.\n  As my courageous colleague, John Lewis, has said, ``The sad truth is \ndiscrimination still exists. We must not go back to the dark past.''\n  This reauthorization will provide the tools we need to honor our \nconstitutional commitment to allow all of our citizens to vote. It \nreinvigorates the guarantee that is the foundation of our democracy the \nright to vote and it is a pledge not to return to a time when, as \nMartin Luther King said, ``The denial of this sacred right [was] a \ntragic betrayal of the highest mandates of our democratic tradition.''\n  I am honored to support this bill and would like to thank my \ncolleagues, Senators Specter and Leahy, for their work and leadership \nin bringing it to the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today the Senate will debate and consider \nthe Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006. We \ncan all agree that the Voting Rights Act was one of the most \nsignificant civil rights laws ever enacted in this country. Yesterday, \nthe Judiciary Committee unanimously supported this bill, and today we \nhope the full Senate will pass it as soon as possible.\n  This landmark law reversed nearly 100 years of African-American \ndisenfranchisement. It took years for Congress to devise a law that \ncould not be circumvented or ignored through lengthy litigation or \ncreative interpretation. After numerous failures, a stronger remedy \nfree of litigation was needed to break the 95-year-old obstacle to \nBlack voter participation.\n  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 provided the solution. That law was and \nremains unique by enforcing the law before a new State voting statute \ngoes into effect rather than fighting it out after the fact for years \nin court. The section 5 ``pre-clearance'' procedure--along with the \nbanning of literacy texts, poll taxes, and the like--finally worked. \nSoon, African-American voters did not face an unequal burden to simply \nexercise their constitutional right to vote.\n  Yet our work was far from over in 1965. Arguably, the great successes \nof the act we speak of today would not have been realized had Congress \nnot amended and extended the act in 1970, 1975, 1982 and 1992. \nImportant improvements were made to the Act during that time, including \nthe addition of bilingual voter assistance in certain jurisdictions \nwith a substantial number of non-native English speakers. Accordingly, \nour bill includes amendments which address recent Supreme Court \ndecisions that have made enforcement of some parts of the act unclear.\n  As we all know, key provisions of the Voting Rights Act are set to \nexpire next year. We have made enormous gains for voting rights since \n1965, but we should not assume that the vigorous protections of the act \nhave outlived their use. To the contrary, extending the act for another \n25 years will ensure that these hard-fought rights will remain in \nplace.\n  Evidence supports this sentiment when one considers that the \nDepartment of Justice deemed 626 proposed election law changes \ndiscriminatory since the last extension of the act in 1982. Past \nexperience teaches us that we cannot rely upon the courts alone to \nprotect the constitutional right to vote. Quite simply, the Voting \nRights Act, and specifically section 5, has worked. The record \ndemonstrates that it continues to be needed to enforce the guarantees \nof the 14th and 15th Amendments.\n  We commend Chairman Specter for holding this series of hearings on \nthe Voting Rights Act. Furthermore, we note the House passed its \nreauthorization of the Voting Rights Act last week without amendment, \nand I trust we can and will do the same here in the Senate. Most of us \nbelieve the record demonstrates that the act should remain in force, \nand I strongly urge my colleagues to support is extension.\n  MS. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was \nwritten to prevent both direct and indirect assaults on the right to \nvote. It outlawed the poll taxes and literacy tests and established a \nsystem of Federal marshals to help African Americans in the South vote. \nIt also required covered jurisdictions to get Federal preapproval \nbefore changing their election laws or any other voting procedure.\n  These changes have made our political system more representative and\n\n[[Page S8003]]\n\nmore just. The Voting Rights Act protects basic constitutional rights. \nMillions of African Americans have been added to the voting rolls since \nthe act was passed. In 1965, there were only 300 African American \nelected officials in our country. Today, there are more than 9,100 \nAfrican Americans who serve in elected public offices and nearly 6,000 \nLatino elected officials.\n  There are those who say that, while this act may have once been \nneeded, it is no longer required today. I understand their argument but \ndo not agree with it. I do believe, however, that their argument is \nentitled to an answer.\n  My answer is this: Renewing expiring provisions of the Voting Rights \nAct will ensure that the battle for fairness in our political system is \ncarried on with the full force of law behind it. We certainly still \nneed these protections today. While many of the more obvious and \nwidespread abuses have been eliminated, isolated cases of voting \ndiscrimination and intimidation remain. They may be subtle, but they \nare nonetheless unfair and intolerable, and they extend to not only \nAfrican Americans but to others as well. A recent court case described \nnearly two decades of voting rights abuses against Native Americans in \nSouth Dakota. We have heard about people videotaping the license plates \nof Mexican Americans as they went to vote in Dona Ana County, NM, in \n2004. As recently as 2001, local officials in Kilmichael, MS, canceled \nelections out of fear that an African-American mayor might be elected. \nThe Voting Rights Act allowed the Justice Department to intervene, \nensuring that the right to vote was protected, and 2 years late \nKilmichael elected its first African-American mayor.\n  Mr. President, history tells us that the justification for the \ncontinuance of this law is compellingf. It also tells us that full and \nfair enforcement of this law is essential, too. That is why I cast my \nvote for justice. That is why I cast my vote for the Fannie Lou Hamer, \nRosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Reauthorization Act.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nvital need to reauthorize key provisions of the Voting Rights Act of \n1965, among the most significant pieces of civil rights legislation \nCongress has ever passed.\n  As we are approaching the 41st anniversary of the act, perhaps it is \nimportant to remember the words of President Lyndon Johnson who signed \nthis bill into law on August 6, 1965, as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. \nlooked on.\n  Johnson's words spoke to all Americans--then and now--about the \nimportance of the right to vote. He said:\n\n       The central fact of American civilization--one so hard for \n     others to understand--is that freedom and justice and the \n     dignity of man are not just words to us. We believe in them.\n       . . . Every family across this great, entire, searching \n     land will live stronger in liberty, will live more splendid \n     in expectation, and will be prouder to be American because of \n     the Act you have passed and that I will sign today.\n\n  Now is the time to renew that pledge for freedom by reauthorizing the \nVoting Rights Act, and I am proud to cosponsor this legislation.\n  I thank Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Leahy for their efforts \nto report this legislation out of their committee with unanimous \nsupport yesterday. I hope the full Senate will show the same level of \nsupport when the bill is voted on this afternoon.\n  The importance of renewing this act was driven home to me yesterday \nwhen, like many of my colleagues, I met with a delegation from my \nState's chapter of the NAACP--here for the annual NAACP meeting and to \nvisit with their congressional delegation.\n  The meeting was not only a wonderful opportunity to see about 40 old \nfriends, it was a demonstration of the fundamental constitutional \nprinciple that powers our Republic--the right to petition the \ngovernment about the issues that matter most.\n  Of course, it strikes me that 40 years ago, while Senators on the \nfloor of this very Chamber debated the original Voting Rights Act, some \nof those constituents' own parents and grandparents could not even cast \na vote without fear for their own lives. And that was for one reason--\nbecause they were Black. Those were tragic times for America.\n  I remember my own trip to Mississippi in 1963, as a senior in college \nwhen I joined with friends on a trip to Mississippi to draw attention \nto the cause of enfranchising African-American voters. Our goal, like \nothers who made similar journeys, was to support the fight of the young \nheroes of the civil rights movement--Black men and women who. sat at \nlunch counters, who refused to move to the back of the buses, who \npeacefully but powerfully demanded the most basic rights every American \ndeserves--including the right to cast a vote.\n  I like to believe our trip to Mississippi was a small step in the \nmarch toward equality that Dr. King and other civil rights leaders, \nlike Representative John Lewis from Georgia, who sat at those lunch \ncounters, pressed upon the American conscience in those heavy days.\n  But my meeting with the Connecticut chapter of the NAACP reminded me \nthe march toward equal rights is not over.\n  In my meeting, one woman asked, ``Why does Congress even have to \nextend the Voting Rights Act? Why is the law not permanent?''\n  I explained that Congress passes legislation that automatically \nexpires because it is important to assess whether a law is working as \nintended, whether it needs changing to address new concerns, or whether \nit is needed at all.\n  Thanks to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, every American now has the \nopportunity to vote and any American can come to Washington to meet \nwith his or her Senators, and I am grateful so many people do. Across \nthe country, the number of African-American elected officials has \nincreased from just 300 in 1964 to more than 9,000 today, including 43 \nMembers of Congress.\n  But with some regret, we must conclude that the Voting Rights Act is \nas necessary today as it has ever been. For as long as the law \ncontinues to be violated, we still need that law.\n  Since 1982, when the act was last extended, there have been more than \n1,000 complaints of violations of the Voting Rights Act all across the \ncountry. Just last month, the Supreme Court struck down parts of the \nredistricting plan in Texas because the court ruled that the plan \ndisenfranchised large numbers of Hispanic voters.\n  As long as there are efforts to dilute the votes of some or to make \nit more difficult for any of our fellow citizens to vote, we need the \nVoting Rights Act and the provisions that are set to expire next year.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation today because the march \ntoward equality must continue. But I look forward to the day when it is \nno longer needed because we have achieved the ideal where each and \nevery vote cast in this great democracy of ours has the same voice and \ncarries the same weight and that everyone who wants to vote can do so \nwith ease and without fear of discrimination.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation today because the civil \nrights march must continue because we cannot confuse progress with \nvictory.\n  As Martin Luther King said on the front steps of the Lincoln \nMemorial, a speech I heard in person, we can never be satisfied until \nevery citizen can vote and every citizen has something to vote for.\n  And when that day comes, when we have achieved full voting rights and \ncivil rights for all Americans, Dr. King can look down from Heaven, his \nmission finally fulfilled, and call out:\n  ``Free at last! Free at last! Thank God almighty, they are free at \nlast.''\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to spend just a few minutes \ntalking about why I support this Voting Rights Act reauthorization.\n  The Supreme Court has said voting rights are so important because \nthey are ``preservative of all rights'' (Yick Wo v. Hopkins (1886)). I \ncouldn't agree more, and that is why the Voting Rights Act was and is \nso centrally important to our country.\n  Martin Luther King, Jr., called President Johnson's support of the \nVoting Rights Act ``a shining moment in the conscience of man.'' That \nmoment must continue.\n  The act began a true transformation of our country. In 1964, there \nwere only 300 African Americans in public office, including just three \nin Congress. There were exceptionally few anywhere in the South. Today, \nthere are more than 9,100 Black elected officials, including\n\n[[Page S8004]]\n\n43 Members of Congress, the largest number ever.\n  The act helped open the way for the 6,000 Latino public officials \nelected and appointed nationwide, including 263 at the State or Federal \nlevel, 27 of whom serve in Congress.\n  One of the leaders of the civil rights movement, Congressman John \nLewis, has characterized the impact of the Voting Rights Act this way: \n``It not only transformed Southern politics, it transformed the \nnation.'' I couldn't agree more.\n  But we shouldn't just rest on the successes of the recent past. We \nmust remain vigilant. For hundreds of years, our country struggled with \nslavery and the fact that nothing more than a person's skin color could \ndetermine his or her prospects in life. Even after we enacted the 15th \namendment, our country struggled with Jim Crow laws and persistent \ndiscrimination.\n  We have now had the Voting Rights Act for 40 years, which may seem \nlike a long time, but compared against our long and shameful history of \nrace discrimination, 40 years seems pretty short.\n  Thankfully, we have come a long way since signs emblazoned windows \nread: ``colored need not apply'' and ``Whites only.'' But let's not be \nlulled into a false sense of security: racism--though much more \nsubtle--still exists. African Americans can apply for a job all right \nbut they might not get it because ``they're not the right type,'' or \n``they just wouldn't fit in.'' New words for old sins.\n  Our recent history still finds sophisticated discrimination occurring \nwhen it comes to voting; and we must be especially vigilant here \nbecause voting is such a cornerstone of our democracy. We must continue \nto ensure diversity in our democracy and protect the rights of all \nAmericans irrespective of race, gender, or national origin.\n  That is why I strongly support this reauthorization of the Voting \nRights Act and am a cosponsor.\n  Authorizing the Voting Rights Act will be one of the most important \nthings we can do this year, and I look forward to helping in any way \nthat I can.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I grew up in Danville, VA. The town of \nDanville, a town of about 30,000 people right on the North Carolina \nborder, was famous for three things when I was growing up there. It was \nthe home of the Dan River cotton mills, it was famous for being the \nworld's biggest tobacco market, and it was famous for being the last \ncapital of the Confederacy. I remember as a child riding back and forth \nto Danville, VA from our home outside of town and riding in the front \nof the bus, knowing that other people of color would ride in the back \nof the bus. I remember visiting downtown and going to restaurants, \nknowing if you were white you could eat there, and if you were not \nwhite, you could not. I remember seeing the water fountains, whites \nonly, colored only.\n  I remember going to the Rialto theater with my sister, watching three \nmovies on a Saturday afternoon for 25 cents. If you were white, you got \nto sit on the first floor. If you were not, you sat up in the balcony. \nI remember going to catch the bus across the street from my house and \ngoing about 10 miles on a bus to high school and knowing that the kids \nof color, about 100 yards further away from us, would get on their bus \nand head out to go to their school, driving by mine and going another \n10 miles to their own school.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order that was agreed to by \nunanimous consent, the Democratic leader has the floor at 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Delaware indicate how much more time \nhe needs?\n  Mr. CARPER. If I could have 3 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the Senator 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. In addition to not being able to drink water at fountains \nwith us, eat in the same restaurants, go to movies, ride on the bus or \ngo to school with the rest of us, the other thing that folks of color \ncouldn't do in my hometown was vote. They couldn't vote because they \ndidn't pay a poll tax. They couldn't vote because they weren't smart \nenough allegedly to pass the test they had to take in order to become \nvoters.\n  I came here in 1965, barely out of high school, 18 years old. I went \nto the Rayburn Building and happened to walk into a hearing in 1965 by \nthe House Judiciary Committee on this legislation, the Voting Rights \nAct of 1965. The enactment of that legislation did more to change \nthings in my town of Danville, VA, and a lot of towns in this country, \nespecially in the South, than any one thing I can think of.\n  Yesterday, as several of us in the Senate rolled out something we \ncalled the Restoring the American Dream Initiative, we started off by \ntrying to make sure that everybody who wanted to go to college had the \nability to get to college. If we are going to be successful as a nation \nin the 21st century, we need a world class workforce. We can't have \nthat unless we have well-educated, college-educated people. In order to \nhave those kinds of opportunities, before we ever get to college we \nhave to make sure kids have a decent chance to go to good elementary, \nmiddle, and high schools. And in order for anybody to have the American \ndream, it is important to have a chance to get a decent job, have a \nchance to be a home owner, raise a family, work hard, and live in a \ncommunity and practice your faith.\n  The one best way to ensure that people of all walks of life have \nthose opportunities is to make sure that they have the opportunity \nevery November, or whenever, to go into the voting booth, be registered \nto vote, and exercise their constitutional right. By the passage of \nthis legislation today, we reaffirm our commitment to that sacred \nright.\n  As one who came here 41 years ago, when my very first experience in \nthe Capitol as an 18-year-old teenager was the debate on this \nlegislation, to be back here today as a Member of the Senate, something \nI never thought possible, is an uplifting experience for me. I hope it \nserves as an inspiration to young men and women of whatever race or \nbackground they might be. I thank the leader.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time did the Senator from Delaware \nuse?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Vermont, Mr. \nLeahy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this afternoon when I was not on \nthe Senate floor, a few Republican Senators gave statements that \nreflected their individual views of what the legislation we are \nconsidering today will do to address the Supreme Court's interpretation \nof legislative intent in the Georgia v. Ashcroft and Reno v. Bossier \nParish cases. While I am not fully informed of their positions, I \ncertainly disagree with what I heard.\n  In the Senate Judiciary Committee we received extensive testimony \nabout these two provisions over the course of several hearings that \ninformed our Committee vote yesterday. I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a full explanation of the testimony we received \nthat informed our vote yesterday and my understanding of the purpose \nand scope of these two provisions as an original and lead sponsor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Georgia v. Ashcroft Fix\n\n       The first of these provisions is commonly referred to as \n     the ``Georgia vs. Ashcroft fix.''\n       In the Judiciary Committee we received evidence that the \n     Voting Rights Act had been significantly weakened by the \n     Supreme Court's decision in Georgia v. Ashcroft because it \n     narrowed the protections afforded by Section 5. Prior to the \n     Ashcroft decision, an objection would be raised by the \n     Department of Justice if the voting change made the position \n     of minority voters worse off in terms of their ability to \n     elect candidates of their choice. In Ashcroft, the Supreme \n     Court replaced the clear and administrable ``ability to \n     elect'' standard with an unworkable ``totality of the \n     circumstances'' standard that appears to permit the trading \n     away of districts in which minority voters have the \n     opportunity to elect candidates of their choice for districts \n     in which minority voters may (or may not) have an \n     ``influence'' over who is elected.\n       It is my understanding that the bill we are considering \n     here today clarifies congressional intent after the Georgia \n     v. Ashcroft\n\n[[Page S8005]]\n\n     decision by re-establishing that Section 5 requires that \n     there be no retrogression of minority voters' ability to \n     elect the candidate of their choice--the standard described \n     in Beer v. United States that governed Section 5 preclearance \n     decisions prior to the Supreme Court's decision in Ashcroft.\n       The drafters of this legislation concluded that ``ability \n     to elect'' was the proper standard because it preserves the \n     gains made in minority voting power and provides a more \n     manageable standard to guide covered jurisdictions, the \n     Department of Justice, and the federal courts as they review \n     voting changes pursuant to Section 5.\n       The bill we are considering today re-establishes the \n     ``ability to elect'' standard because the ``totality of the \n     circumstances'' test articulated in the Ashcroft decision \n     undermines Section 5's ability to protect against \n     discrimination and maintain the progress made in minority \n     political participation, and it creates an amorphous standard \n     that will be difficult for covered jurisdictions to follow \n     and for the Justice Department to administer.\n       We in Congress who are supporting this bill determined that \n     we must address this standard for the same reasons as the \n     dissent in Ashcroft noted, that is because the ``totality of \n     the circumstances'' test adopted by the Supreme Court \n     majority ``unmoors Sec. 5 from any practical and \n     administrable conception of minority influence'' by \n     abandoning the ``anchoring reference to electing a candidate \n     of choice'' that had previously guided Section 5 \n     preclearance.\n       In the Judiciary Committee we received extensive testimony \n     about the harm that the Ashcroft decision has had on the \n     power of Section 5 to protect minority voters. Political \n     science professor Theodore Arrington, who has served as an \n     expert witness in over 30 voting rights cases, testified at \n     the Committee's hearings that the Ashcroft case created an \n     ``unworkable standard'' because there is ``no way to know how \n     to comply with the Court's mandate.'' The legislation we are \n     considering today would add needed clarity.\n       The difficulty of measuring minority ``influence'' was \n     well-illustrated by the results in Georgia v. Ashcroft \n     itself, as was pointed out in the Committee by Professor \n     Pamela Karlan. The Supreme Court noted that most of the \n     districts in which African-Americans make up more than 20% of \n     the electorate are majority-Democrat, which the Court \n     concluded ``make it more likely as a matter of fact that \n     African-American voters will constitute an effective voting \n     bloc, even if they cannot always elect the candidate of their \n     choice.'' However, in the three districts where African-\n     American voters supposedly retained an ``influence'' on their \n     elected representatives, the elected white representatives \n     switched from the Democratic to the Republican party in the \n     two-week period between their election and the inauguration, \n     which resulted in the Democrats losing control of the Georgia \n     State Senate. This result undermined the Supreme Court's view \n     that representatives elected in a minority ``influence \n     district'' would listen and respond to their sizable minority \n     constituents despite not being these voters' preferred \n     candidates.\n       The aftermath of Georgia's elections supports the \n     dissenting justices' views that it is impossible for a court \n     to measure minority influence, and thus a state should not be \n     granted preclearance for redistricting plans that trade away \n     districts in which minority voters have the ability to elect \n     their preferred candidates for ones in which they might have \n     the ability to influence candidates elected by others. As \n     Ashcroft itself demonstrated, the appearance of influence \n     might far exceed the reality.\n       The impact of ``influence districts'' is particularly \n     ephemeral where the existence of racially polarized voting \n     means that elected officials do not need minority voters to \n     retain their seats. As Laughlin McDonald, Director of ACLU's \n     Voting Rights Project, testified, racially polarized voting \n     means that African-Americans may have little or no influence \n     in majority white districts. In the 1970s and 1980s, only \n     about 1% of majority white districts in the South elected an \n     African-American to a state legislature. As late as 1988, no \n     African-American had been elected from a majority white \n     district in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, or \n     South Carolina. The ACLU's Voting Rights Project Report \n     described the pervasiveness of racial bloc voting in covered \n     jurisdictions. For example, in Smith v. Beasley, decided in \n     1992, a three-judge court found that ``[i]n South Carolina, \n     voting has been, and still is, polarized by race. This voting \n     pattern is general throughout the state.'' Ten years later, \n     in 2002, another three-judge court made a similar finding: \n     ``Voting in South Carolina continues to be racially polarized \n     to a very high degree in all regions of the state and in both \n     primary and general elections.'' As recently as 2004, the \n     Fourth Circuit affirmed the findings of a South Carolina \n     district court that ``voting in Charleston County Council \n     elections is severely and characteristically polarized along \n     racial lines.''\n       After Ashcroft, states can redistrict in ways that diminish \n     minority voters' political power. As Professor Nathaniel \n     Persily testified, the ``danger that Ashcroft seemed to \n     invite and that this legislation intends to fix is the \n     possibility that under the cloak of `influence districts' a \n     jurisdiction might dilute the minority vote by splitting \n     large minority communities among several districts in which \n     they really have no influence at all.'' Professor Persily \n     explained that under the Ashcroft precedent, the Department \n     of Justice could preclear a state redistricting plan that \n     split a 60% minority district into two 30% minority \n     influence districts, even though such a plan would \n     severely diminish minority voters' ability to elect their \n     preferred candidates. Moreover, combined with the Supreme \n     Court's holding in Bossier II, a state legislature could \n     enact these kinds of voting changes for the express \n     purpose of discriminating against minority voters, and yet \n     they nonetheless might be precleared under Section 5.\n       The VRARA restores Section 5 to its original intended \n     meaning so that it prohibits voting changes that undermine \n     racial minorities' ability to elect candidates of their \n     choice. The VRARA provides that ``[t]he purpose of subsection \n     (b) of this section is to protect the ability of such \n     [minority] citizens to elect their preferred candidates of \n     choice.'' This change to Section 5 makes clear that Congress \n     rejects the Supreme Court's Ashcroft decision and \n     reestablishes that a covered state's redistricting plan \n     cannot eliminate ``ability to elect'' districts and replace \n     them with ``influence districts.''\n       The amendment to Section 5 does not, however, freeze into \n     place the current minority voter percentages in any given \n     district. As stated by the dissenters in Georgia v. Ashcroft, \n     as well as by Professor Arrington and Professor Persily at \n     the Committee hearings, reducing the number of minorities in \n     a district is perfectly consistent with the pre-Ashcroft \n     understanding of Section 5 as long as other factors \n     demonstrate that minorities retain their ability to elect \n     their preferred candidates. The amendment is intended to make \n     clear that the addition of districts in which minorities \n     might have an influence on the political process cannot \n     compensate for the elimination of districts in which \n     minorities have the ability to elect a preferred candidate. \n     But there is no ``magic number'' that every district must \n     maintain to satisfy the ``ability to elect'' standard; the \n     percentages will vary depending on such variables as the \n     extent of racially polarized voting and white crossover \n     voting, registration rates, citizenship variables, and the \n     degree of voter turnout. As both Professor Arrington and \n     Professor Persily stated in their testimony, all of these \n     considerations should come into play, making the ``ability to \n     elect'' standard one that turns on the context of the \n     districts at issue, as was the case under the Beer standard.\n       The ``ability to elect'' standard does not lock in \n     districts that meet any particular threshold. Determinations \n     about whether a district provides the minority community the \n     ability to elect must be made on a case-by-case basis. \n     Indeed, prior to Georgia v. Ashcroft, the Department of \n     Justice utilized case-by-case analysis to determine whether a \n     voting change impacted the minority community's ``ability to \n     elect.'' Specifically, DOJ performed an intensely \n     jurisdiction-specific review of election results, demographic \n     data, maps and other information in order to compare the \n     minority community's ability to elect under benchmark and \n     proposed plans. Other information considered by DOJ, outlined \n     in the Procedures for the Administration of Section 5 of the \n     Voting Rights Act,'' 28 C.F.R., Part 51, include the extent \n     to which a reasonable and legitimate justification for the \n     change exists, the extent to which the jurisdiction followed \n     objective guidelines and fair and conventional procedures in \n     adopting the change, the extent to which the jurisdiction \n     afforded members of racial and language minority groups an \n     opportunity to participate in the decision to make the \n     change, and the extent to which the jurisdiction took the \n     concerns of members of racial and language minority groups \n     into account in making the change. This analysis allows \n     jurisdictions a degree of flexibility in the adoption of \n     their voting changes.\n       In sum, to avoid violating Section 5's non-retrogression \n     standard, a covered state's redistricting must ensure that it \n     has not diminished minority voters' ability to elect their \n     candidates of choice. The ``ability to elect'' standard that \n     is being reestablished through the VRARA prevents all types \n     of retrogressive changes, whether they come from the \n     dispersion of a minority community among too many districts \n     (cracking) or the overconcentration of minorities among too \n     few (packing).\n\n                              Bossier Fix\n\n       The second of these provisions is usually referred to as \n     the ``Bossier Fix.''\n       We have acted in this reauthorization to restore the VRA's \n     original standing and effectiveness. After hearing extensive \n     testimony and carefully reviewing the record created in the \n     Senate and in the House of Representatives, we concluded that \n     the Supreme Court's holding in a case called Reno v. Bossier \n     Parish (``Bossier II''), went against both the original \n     intent of Congress and established Department of Justice and \n     judicial precedent. Section 5 of the VRA requires that all \n     changes in covered jurisdictions ``not have the purpose and . \n     . . not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to \n     vote on account of race or color.'' Accordingly, the process \n     for preclearing changes consists of two prongs. First, it \n     consists of an inquiry as to the purpose of the change in \n     question. Then, it requires a separate examination into the \n     effect of the change. A plan may not receive preclearance \n     without satisfying requirements under both prongs. \n     Traditionally, the purpose prong has been a common basis for \n     Department of Justice objections to plans submitted by \n     covered jurisdictions. However, since ``Bossier II'' the \n     scope\n\n[[Page S8006]]\n\n     and effectiveness of the purpose prong has been dramatically \n     limited.\n       That is why we are amending the VRA to make clear that a \n     covered jurisdiction does not have to disprove the existence \n     of any Section 2 violation to obtain Section 5 preclearance. \n     Rather, contrary to the suggestions of a handful of my \n     colleagues who wish to undermine what we accomplish today, \n     this bill amends the VRA to make clear that it prohibits all \n     voting changes enacted with a discriminatory purpose.\n\n                       The Holding in Bossier II\n\n       The controversy in Bossier II arose when the school board \n     (``the Board'') of Bossier Parish, Louisiana sought to redraw \n     the districts that elected its members. At the time of the \n     1990s redistricting, African-Americans made up approximately \n     20% of the parish's population. They did not, however, \n     comprise a majority in any of the twelve school board \n     districts in the parish. In 1992, the Board adopted a new \n     redistricting plan that did not create any new majority-\n     African-American districts, rejecting an alternate plan that \n     would have created two majority-African-American districts.\n       In January of the following year, the Board submitted its \n     redistricting plan for preclearance to the Department of \n     Justice; upon objection by the Attorney General, the Board \n     filed suit for a declaratory judgment in the federal district \n     court to obtain preclearance. At trial, the Attorney General \n     argued that the plan should not be approved under Section 5 \n     for two reasons. First, the plan diluted the voting strength \n     of African-American voters, in violation of a separate \n     provision of the VRA, Section 2. Second, the plan was enacted \n     with a discriminatory purpose.\n       At trial, DOJ presented extensive evidence that the plan \n     was, in fact, enacted with a discriminatory motive. The \n     Board's refusal to draw a single African-American majority \n     district stood in stark contrast to its own admission that \n     creation of a majority-African-American district was clearly \n     feasible, and in contrast to expert testimony that African-\n     Americans would only be able to elect their chosen candidate \n     in such a district. Moreover, the manner in which the \n     districts were drawn suggested--in the Board cartographer's \n     own opinion--that traditionally African-American populations \n     were purposefully divided into adjoining white districts, a \n     process known as ``fracturing.'' Most alarming, however, was \n     testimony suggesting that certain Board members were openly \n     hostile to African-American representation or African-\n     American-majority districts.\n       In spite of this evidence, the trial court precleared the \n     plan. The case twice reached the Supreme Court on separate \n     appeals. The first time, the Court agreed with the trial \n     court that a voting change cannot be denied preclearance \n     under Section 5 solely because the change violated Section 2. \n     The second time--Bossier II--the Court addressed a more \n     contentious question: whether Section 5 prohibited all voting \n     changes enacted with a discriminatory purpose. The Court \n     answered this question in the negative, holding that Section \n     5 does not bar electoral changes enacted with a \n     discriminatory purpose if those changes were designed only to \n     maintain, and not worsen, the current electoral strength of a \n     protected minority group.\n       Bossier II was premised on the holding in an earlier \n     Section 5 case, Beer v. United States. In Beer, the Supreme \n     Court interpreted the effects prong to prohibit only those \n     changes that had a ``retrogressive'' impact on the voting \n     strength of minorities in a covered jurisdiction. The \n     question of retrogression--whether or not a proposed plan \n     decreased voting strength as compared to the previous plan--\n     thus became the critical measure of success or failure under \n     the effects prong. In Bossier II, Justice Scalia argued that \n     since ``purpose'' and ``effect'' both modify the same object \n     in the text of the statute--``denying or abridging the right \n     to vote on account of race or color''--they must prohibit the \n     same activity. If Beer held that the effects prong only \n     prohibited ``retrogression,'' the Court's majority reasoned \n     that Section 5 would only prohibit retrogressive intent. The \n     end result of this argument was aptly summarized by Debo \n     Adegbile, who testified: ``Since [Bossier II], non-\n     retrogressive voting changes motivated by racial animus, no \n     matter how clearly demonstrated . . . are insulated from \n     Section 5 objection under the purpose prong.'' Justice \n     Souter, dissenting from the majority opinion, came to the \n     same conclusion: ``Now executive and judicial officers of the \n     United States will be forced to preclear illegal and \n     unconstitutional voting schemes patently intended to \n     perpetuate discrimination.''\n\n            Problems With the Purpose Prong Under Bossier II\n\n       The holding in Bossier II is at odds with congressional \n     intent and established judicial and Department of Justice \n     precedent. It effectively eviscerates the purpose prong of \n     Section 5 and compromises the overall ability of Section 5 to \n     combat innovative discriminatory practices, which it was \n     originally designed to prohibit. Committee reports from the \n     89th Congress uniformly suggest that the Senate and House of \n     Representatives designed Section 5 as a broad protection \n     against increasingly innovative discriminatory practices. \n     This is reflected in the fact that the language of the \n     provision closely parallels that of the 15th Amendment, which \n     prohibits intentional discrimination. This is not a \n     coincidence; members of both the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     and the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee \n     explicitly cited the VRA as a bill primarily intended to \n     enforce the 15th Amendment.\n       In 1966, when the Supreme Court heard the first \n     constitutional challenge to the VRA, it reaffirmed the broad \n     scope envisioned by Congress. In South Carolina v. \n     Katzenbach, the Court explained that the VRA was designed \n     ``to rid the country of racial discrimination in voting,'' \n     and described Section 5 as ``the heart of the Act.'' Six \n     years later, in Perkins v. Matthews, the Court stated that \n     there was ``little question'' that Congress intended Section \n     5 to ensure that covered jurisdictions ``not institute new \n     laws with respect to voting that might have a racially \n     discriminatory purpose or effect.'' In 1975, far from \n     repudiating earlier Committee reports or the statements in \n     Katzenbach and Perkins, this Committee further emphasized a \n     broad role for Section 5, one that went beyond the mere \n     preservation of minority voting strength.\n       The purpose prong established by Bossier II is far narrower \n     than Congress intended. While the retrogression standard \n     defines prohibited effects, the same standard limits the \n     purpose prong to the point of insignificance. After Bossier \n     II, the only occasion in which the purpose prong would be the \n     sole basis for a Department of Justice objection would be \n     when the covered jurisdiction intended to decrease minority \n     voting strength, but somehow failed in this effort.\n       More incongruously, however, as conceived by Bossier II, \n     the purpose prong would actually reward those covered \n     jurisdictions with the most extensive histories of minority \n     vote dilution; this is what Professor Anita Earls described \n     in hearings before the Judiciary Committee as the \n     ``discrimination dividend.'' Where a jurisdiction has \n     traditionally structured its election methods and voting \n     practices so that minority voters have no voting strength, \n     and no ability to elect candidates of their choice to begin \n     with, it is impossible for new voting practices to be \n     retrogressive. When no retrogression is possible, it is also \n     impossible to prove retrogressive intent. The Bossier II \n     interpretation of the purpose prong would freeze voter \n     discrimination at existing levels, to the benefit of the most \n     discriminatory of jurisdictions.\n       I find no evidence to suggest that the 94th Congress \n     enacted Section 5 with such a limited--and indeed, \n     paradoxical--scope in mind. To the contrary, Section 5 was \n     designed to target precisely those areas with the most \n     entrenched histories of discrimination. The Supreme Court \n     long recognized this. I agree with the findings of the \n     House Committee on the Judiciary, which concluded that the \n     purpose prong was designed to prevent all voting changes \n     with a discriminatory intent. We reported VRARA and will \n     pass it today to restore the original understanding of \n     that provision.\n       In addition to contravening congressional intent, Bossier \n     II is also in conflict with more than three decades of \n     judicial and Department of Justice precedent. Prior to \n     Bossier II, the Department of Justice interpreted the purpose \n     prong of Section 5 to block all changes enacted with a \n     discriminatory intent, regardless of retrogressive effect. \n     This was not a limited practice. Prior to Bossier II, a large \n     percentage of all Department objections were based on \n     discriminatory purpose alone.\n       The Supreme Court reached the same conclusion, consistently \n     construing Section 5 as barring implementation of electoral \n     changes if and when they were adopted with a discriminatory \n     purpose. In City of Richmond v. United States, for example, \n     the Court held that a proposed annexation had no \n     discriminatory effect under Section 5. However, the Court \n     nevertheless remanded the case to the District Court to \n     determine if the change was adopted for a discriminatory \n     purpose. As the Court stated in City of Richmond: ``An \n     official action, whether an annexation or otherwise, taken \n     for the purpose of discriminating against Negroes on account \n     of their race has no legitimacy at all under our Constitution \n     or under the statute.'' Likewise, in City of Pleasant Grove \n     v. United States, a covered jurisdiction was denied \n     preclearance for a proposed annexation, even though \n     retrogressive effect was impossible, because of clear \n     evidence that the annexation was enacted with a racially \n     discriminatory purpose. The Court explained that ``[t]o hold \n     otherwise would make appellant's extraordinary success in \n     resisting integration thus far a shield for further \n     resistance.'' Even in Beer, the purported foundation for \n     Bossier II, the Court provided that changes that actually \n     improved the voting strength of minorities could still be \n     denied preclearance if they were intentionally \n     discriminatory. The District Court for the District of \n     Columbia--the body charged with exclusive jurisdiction over \n     Section 5 suits--also consistently held (before Bossier II) \n     that Section 5 prohibits changes enacted with a \n     discriminatory intent.\n       For thirty-five years, Congress reviewed and renewed the \n     Voting Rights Act and amended Section 2 in response to \n     another Supreme Court precedent, Mobile v. Bolden, but \n     Congress did not change or raise any objection to the \n     judicial or Justice Department interpretations of the Section \n     5 purpose prong. Instead, Congress reauthorized Section 5 \n     unamended on three separate occasions. Until Bossier II, all \n     three branches of government--the courts, the executive, and \n     the legislature--appeared to be in agreement that the purpose \n     prong prohibited all\n\n[[Page S8007]]\n\n     changes enacted with a discriminatory intent.\n\n          Bossier II Undermines the Effectiveness of Section 5\n\n       Bossier II has had a striking impact on the Section 5 \n     purpose prong, minimizing the number of purpose-based \n     objections and undermining the overall ability of Section 5 \n     to block discriminatory electoral practices in covered \n     jurisdictions. The record of preclearance objections after \n     Bossier II suggests that the purpose prong under Bossier \n     II has become inconsequential and has no meaning apart \n     from retrogressive effect. After Bossier II, there was a \n     steep drop in the number of Department of Justice \n     objections based on purpose alone. In the 1980s, 25% of \n     DOJ objections--83 objections in total--were based on \n     intent alone; in the 1990s, this number increased to 43%, \n     with 151 objections solely based on discriminatory intent. \n     In the five years following Bossier II, only two out of a \n     total of forty-three objections (4%) have been interposed \n     because of retrogressive intent, the only purpose \n     prohibited by Bossier II. In the words of one House \n     Judiciary Committee witness, Mark Posner, the purpose \n     prong ``has effectively been read almost entirely out of \n     Section 5.''\n       According to Mr. Posner's testimony, the impact of Bossier \n     II on Section 5 enforcement is evident from the recent \n     history of decennial redistricting. After the 1980 Census, \n     the Department of Justice objected to 7% of redistricting \n     plans filed by covered jurisdictions; this rate increased to \n     8% after the 1990 Census. In contrast, DOJ objected to only \n     1% of redistricting plans filed after the 2000 Census. There \n     is strong evidence that the drop is significantly \n     attributable to the absence of purpose-based objections.\n       The inability of Section 5 to block changes enacted with a \n     discriminatory intent is highly troubling. At its core, the \n     Voting Rights Act was designed to fight discrimination in \n     American politics; the VRA is a vehicle to enforce the 14th \n     and 15th Amendments, which themselves prohibit intentional \n     discrimination in various settings. Section 5 was the \n     centerpiece of this effort, effectively shifting the burden \n     of fighting racial discrimination from the victims to the \n     state. Allowing expressly discriminatory plans to attain \n     preclearance solely because the voting strength of a minority \n     group is too weak to be further worsened undermines the \n     original impetus of the VRA in general, and Section 5 in \n     particular. Furthermore, it shifts the burden of fighting \n     voting discrimination back to its victims.\n\n                  Restoring Section 5 Purpose Inquiry\n\n       For the reasons I have described, we find it necessary to \n     amend Section 5 to restore the purpose prong to its original \n     scope, enabling the Attorney General and the District Court \n     of the District of Columbia to object to any voting changes \n     enacted with a discriminatory intent. The VRARA accomplishes \n     this by adding subsections (b) and (c) to Section 5, which \n     state that, ``(b) Any voting qualification or prerequisite to \n     voting, or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to \n     voting that has the purpose of or will have the effect of \n     diminishing the ability of any citizens of the United States \n     on account of race or color, or in contravention of the \n     guarantees set forth in section 4(f)(2), to elect their \n     preferred candidates of choice denies or abridges the right \n     to vote within the meaning of subsection (a) of this \n     section,'' and ``(c) The term ``purpose'' in subsections (a) \n     and (b) of this section shall include any discriminatory \n     purpose.''\n       These sections reject the holding in Bossier II and clarify \n     Congress' original intent that Section 5 prohibit all voting \n     changes enacted with a discriminatory purpose. This would \n     also realign the purpose prong with constitutional standards, \n     allowing Section 5 to prohibit intentional discrimination \n     that would otherwise be unconstitutional under the 15th \n     Amendment. I reject any reading of Section 5 that would allow \n     explicitly discriminatory voting changes to be precleared, \n     solely because the voting strength of the minority group in \n     question cannot be further diminished. I believe that the \n     VRARA remedies this problem and restores the purpose prong of \n     Section 5 to prevent purposeful discrimination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as the Senate stands poised to conclude \nthis debate and reauthorize the Voting Rights Act, we recall the words \nof Martin Luther King, Jr., in his famous ``I have a Dream'' speech, \nwhere he noted: ``When the architects of our republic wrote the \nmagnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of \nIndependence, they were signing a promissory note to which every \nAmerican was to fall heir.'' The Voting Rights Act is one of the most \nimportant methods of enforcing this promise and upholding the \nConstitution's guarantee of equal rights and equal protection of the \nlaw. We owe it those who struggled so long and hard to transform the \nlandscape and make America a place of political inclusion to \nreauthorize this important Act. We all enjoy these protections and take \nthem for granted. No Senator would ever be denied the right to vote, \nbut the same cannot be said about millions of others. We act so that \nall Americans can enjoy America's bounty, its blessings and its \npromise.\n  On May 2, our congressional leadership stood together on the steps of \nthe Capitol--an historic announcement in an era of intense \npartisanship. We came together in recognition that there are few things \nas critical to our Nation, and to American citizenship, as voting. In \nsharp contrast to the tremendous resistance and bitter politics which \nmet the initial enactment of the Voting Rights Act, our efforts this \nyear have overcome objections through discussions, the hearing process \nand by developing an overwhelming record of justification for extension \nof the expiring provisions. Last week, the House of Representatives, \nafter a month of delay, passed H.R. 9 by a vote of 390-33, rejecting \nall efforts to reduce the sweep and effect of the Voting Rights Act. \nYesterday in the Senate Judiciary Committee, we did the same after \nalmost as long a delay in considering the companion Senate bill. We \nacted unanimously to report the Senate bill. Now it is up to the full \nSenate to complete our work.\n  As Congressman John Lewis said, ``When historians pick up their pens \nand write about this period, let it be said that those of us in the \nCongress in 2006, we did the right thing. And our forefathers and our \nforemothers would be very proud of us. Let us pass a clean bill without \nany amendments.'' I am encouraged that we are so close to accomplishing \nthis today.\n  The path that my good friend John Lewis has taken from Selma, AL, to \nCongress, from ``Bloody Sunday'' in 1965 on the Edmund Pettis Bridge to \nleading the fight in 2006 to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act, is a \nlesson to us all. The events of Bloody Sunday, were caught on \ntelevision cameras, and those powerful images laid bare for all \nAmericans the violence encountered by many African Americans trying to \nexercise their civil rights. It was a crucial turning point in securing \nthe right to vote. A few days after the violence of Bloody Sunday, \nPresident Lyndon Johnson outlined the proposed Voting Rights Act of \n1965, before a joint session of Congress. Later that year, Congress \npassed it so that the Constitution's guarantees of equal access to the \nelectoral process, regardless of race, would not be undermined by \ndiscriminatory practices.\n\n  Like the rights guaranteed by the First Amendment, the right to vote \nis foundational because it secures the effective exercise of all other \nrights. As people are able to register, vote, and elect candidates of \ntheir choice, their interests and rights get attention. The very \nlegitimacy of our democratic Government is dependent on the access all \nAmericans have to the electoral process.\n  Today we are poised to reaffirm a cornerstone of our civil rights \nlaws. As we do, we recall the great historic struggle for civil rights \nled by American heroes of vision and strength, such as Fannie Lou \nHamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King, who passed away just months \nago. We honor their legacy by reaffirming our commitment to protect the \nright to vote for all Americans.\n  The pervasive discriminatory tactics that led to the original Voting \nRights Act were deeply rooted. As a Nation, this effort to ensure equal \nprotection dates back more than 135 years to the ratification of the \n15th Amendment in 1870, the last of the post-Civil War Reconstruction \namendments. It took the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 for \npeople of all races in many parts of our country to begin the effective \nexercise of rights granted 95 years earlier by the 15th Amendment. \nDespite the additional gains we have made in enabling racial minorities \nto participate in the political life of the Nation, the work of the \nVoting Rights Act is not yet done.\n  In fact, in the recent LULAC decision, the Supreme Court--finding \nthat 100,000 Latino Americans were illegally disenfranchised in Texas--\naffirmed that racial discrimination against our Nation's minorities \npersists today. It proves that the protections of the Voting Rights Act \nare still needed. We have this year undertaken an extensive process of \ncongressional fact-finding. What it establishes is that we are right to \nextend the protections of the Voting Rights Act.\n  In the Senate Judiciary Committee, we held nine hearings on the \nVoting Rights Act. We received thousands of pages of testimony, \nreports, articles,\n\n[[Page S8008]]\n\nletters, statistics, and other relevant material from a wide variety of \nsources to inform our consideration. The evidence gathered, together \nwith the record developed in a dozen hearings in the House provide us \nwith an adequate basis for Congress to determine that the protections \nof the Voting Rights Act are still needed both to maintain the gains \nalready achieved and to continue to enforce the guarantees of equality \nenshrined in the 14th and 15th Amendments.\n  Much of the testimony we received focused on the continuing need for \nSections 5 and 203 of the Voting Rights Act as essential safeguards to \nthe rights and interests of Americans of all races and our language \nminorities.\n  The record we have assembled and consider justifies the renewal of \nSection 5. This section requires certain jurisdictions with a history \nof discrimination to ``pre-clear'' all voting changes with either the \nJustice Department or the U.S. District Court for the District of \nColumbia. In doing so, Section 5 combats the practice of those \njurisdictions of shifting from one invalidated discriminatory tactic to \nanother, which had undermined earlier efforts to enforce the 15th \nAmendment. After ``enduring nearly a century of systematic resistance \nto the Fifteenth Amendment,'' Congress found, it was imperative to \n``shift the advantage of time and inertia from the perpetrators of the \nevil to its victims.''\n  Section 5 continues to be a tremendous tool for protecting minority \nvoting rights and a necessary one. For example, in 1992, the Attorney \nGeneral used Section 5 to stop Wrightsville, GA, from relocating its \npolling place from the county courthouse to a private all-white club \nwith a history of refusing membership to black applicants and a then-\ncurrent practice of hosting functions to which blacks were not welcome. \nEven more recently, in 2001, Kilmichael, Mississippi's white mayor and \nall-white Board of Aldermen abruptly cancelled an election after Census \ndata revealed that African Americans had become the majority in the \ntown and an unprecedented number of African-American candidates were \nrunning for office. The Justice Department objected under Section 5. \nOnly after the Justice Department forced Kilmichael to hold an election \nin 2003 did it elect its first African-American mayor, along with three \nAfrican-American aldermen.\n  These are just a couple of examples that are representative of the \nbarriers to political participation that all too many American citizens \nstill face today, in 2006. In addition to finding extensive evidence \nthat covered jurisdictions have continued to engage in discriminatory \ntactics, we also found that the Section 5 preclearance requirement has \nserved a vital prophylactic purpose in protecting against \ndiscriminatory voting practices before they go into place and securing \nthe gains made in minority political participation.\n  The record also supports renewal of Sections 203 and 4(f)(4), which \nrequire bilingual voting assistance for certain language minority \ngroups, to ensure that all Americans are able to exercise their \nfundamental right as citizens to vote. According to the most recent \ninformation from the Census, more than 70 percent of citizens who use \nlanguage assistance are native born, including Native Americans, Alaska \nnatives and Puerto Ricans. Many of those who benefit from Sections 203 \nand 4(f)(4) suffer from inadequate educational opportunities to learn \nEnglish.\n  These Americans are trying to vote but many of them are struggling \nwith the English language due to disparities in education and the \nincremental process of learning. We can and we must reauthorize these \nprovisions to make sure there is no literacy test at the polling place. \nWe endured a time in our Nation's history when such tests \ndisenfranchised many voters. Renewing the expiring language provisions \nwill help enable all Americans to participate fully in our Nation's \ndemocracy.\n  The record also supports the need to amend the VRA to restore its \noriginal purpose in response to two Supreme Court decisions that have \nlimited its effectiveness. The bill remedies the Supreme Court's \nholding in Reno v. Bossier Parish, by making clear that a voting rule \nchange motivated by any discriminatory purpose violates Section 5. \nUnder the holding in Reno v. Bossier Parish, certain voting rule \nchanges passed with the intent to discriminate against minorities could \npass Section 5 muster. Because such an interpretation is inconsistent \nwith congressional intent and the purpose of the Voting Rights Act to \neliminate discriminatory tactics that undermine the guarantees of the \n15th Amendment, our bill fixes this inconsistency by clarifying that a \nvoting rule change motivated by any discriminatory purpose also cannot \nbe pre-cleared.\n  The bill also remedies the Supreme Court's holding in Georgia v. \nAshcroft. In this case, the Supreme Court provided an unclear and \nunworkable test for assessing a jurisdiction's challenge to denial of \nSection 5 pre-clearance. Congressional intent was to protect the \nability of a minority community to elect a candidate of its choice. \nThis legislation clarifies our congressional intent by setting forth \ndefined factors to restore the original understanding of the Voting \nRights Act to protect the minority community's ability to elect their \npreferred candidates of choice.\n  It has often been said that those who cannot remember the past are \ncondemned to repeat it. We must make certain that the significant gains \nin voting rights over the past four decades do not suffer the same fate \nas the voting rights provided during Reconstruction. After the Civil \nWar, the Reconstruction Act promised that the guarantees of the 15th \nAmendment would be realized. Between 1870 and 1900, 22 African-\nAmericans served in the United States Congress. In 1868, Louisiana \nelected an African-American Lieutenant Governor, Oscar Dunn, and 87 \nAfrican Americans held seats in the South Carolina legislature. \nHowever, these Reconstruction-era gains in African-American voting and \nrepresentation proved to be short-lived. Following the end of \nReconstruction, the rights of African-Americans to vote and to hold \noffice were virtually eliminated in many areas through discriminatory \nlegal barriers, intimidation, and violence. The changes were swift, \nsystematic and severe. By 1896, Representative George White of North \nCarolina was the only African American remaining in the U.S. Congress, \nand it would take 72 years after Representative White left Congress for \nAfrican-American voters in the South to elect another candidate of \ntheir choice to Congress.\n  In Mississippi, the percentage of African-American voting-age men \nregistered to vote fell from over 90 percent during the Reconstruction \nperiod to less than 6 percent in 1892. Between 1896 and 1900, the \nnumber of African-American voters in Louisiana was reduced from 130,000 \nto a mere 5,000. Unlike the short-lived gains made by African-American \nvoters during Reconstruction, their exclusion from the ballot box was \npersistent. Only 3 percent of voting-age African-American men and women \nin the South were registered to vote in 1940, only 1 percent in \nMississippi. These numbers provide a lesson we cannot not ignore.\n\n  The passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965 was a turning point. We \nhave made progress toward a more inclusive democracy since then but I \nfear that if we fail to reauthorize the expiring provisions of the \nVoting Rights Act, we are likely to backslide. In his testimony before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, civil rights lawyer Robert McDuff \nwarned:\n\n       No place more than Mississippi has been torn by slavery, by \n     the lost promise of emancipation after the Reconstruction \n     period, by the resurgence of racist power in the latter part \n     of the 19th century and most of the 20th, and by the legacy \n     of poverty and racial separation that still exists. While \n     people's behavior and people's hearts can change over time, \n     vigilance is required to ensure that laws and structures \n     remain in place to prevent us as a society from turning back \n     to the worst impulses of the past. Occasional flashes of \n     those impulses illustrate the need for that vigilance. \n     Important changes have come to pass in Mississippi in the \n     last 40 years--changes due in large part to the mechanisms of \n     the Voting Rights Act, particularly the preclearance \n     provision of Section 5. But, like the gains that were washed \n     away after the nation abandoned the goals of Reconstruction \n     in 1876, the progress of the last 40 years is not assured for \n     the future.\n\n  When we have such legal protections that are proven effective when \nenforced, we should not abandon them prematurely simply in the hope \nequality will come. Reauthorizing and restoring the Voting Rights Act \nis the right thing to do, not only for those who came before--the brave \npeople who\n\n[[Page S8009]]\n\nfought for equality--but also for those who come after us, our children \nand our grandchildren. No one's right to vote should be abridged, \nsuppressed or denied in the United States of America.\n  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is one of the most important laws \nCongress has ever passed. It helped to usher the country out of a \nhistory of discrimination into the greater inclusion of more Americans \nin the decisions about our Nation's future. Our democracy and our \nNation are better and richer for it. We cannot relent in our fight for \nthe fundamental civil rights of all Americans. Congress has \nreauthorized and revitalized the Act four times pursuant to its \nconstitutional powers. This is no time for backsliding, this is the \ntime to move forward together.\n  As the Senate completes consideration of this important legislation--\nthe culmination of many months of legislative activity to reauthorize \nthe Voting Rights Act--I welcome the President's statement of support \ntoday. It was a long time in coming, and the long way round, but he got \nthere. The President is right to have spoken of racial discrimination \nas a wound not fully healed. We all want our revitalization of the \nVoting Rights Act we consider today to help in that healing process and \nin guaranteeing the fundamental right to vote.\n  I was reminded today of when the President spoke dramatically last \nSeptember from New Orleans' Jackson Square and pledged to confront \npoverty with bold action. I look forward to that bold action. He spoke \nthen of helping our people overcome what he called ``deep, persistent \npoverty,'' ``poverty with roots in a history of racial discrimination, \nwhich cut off generations from the opportunity of America.'' I agree \nwith him. We must, as the President said that night, ``rise above the \nlegacy of inequality.'' That is a shameful legacy that still exists and \nstill needs to be overcome. The President is right that ``the wounds'' \nof racial discrimination need to be fully healed.\n  In my judgment, based on the record before this Senate, the \nreauthorization of the Voting Rights Act is needed to ensure that \nhealing.\n  We heard so often during the civil rights movement ``we shall \novercome.'' But it is not just a case of we shall overcome, it is ``we \nmust overcome.''\n  I also welcome the support of others who have come recently to this \ncause and struggle. I welcome our Senate bill cosponsors who joined us \nafter the companion House bill had already won 390 votes and even those \nwho joined after the Senate bill was successfully voted out of our \nCommittee, 18-0. It is never too late to join a good cause, and \nprotecting the fundamental right to vote and have Americans' votes \ncount is just such a cause.\n  Someone who was not late to the struggle but who has been at its \nforefront since his election to the Senate in 1962 is the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts. He worked to pass the original landmark \nVoting Rights Act in 1965. On this issue he is the Senate's leader. It \nhas been an honor to work beside him in this important effort. And work \nhe did. To assemble the record required work. He came to our hearings, \nhelped organize them, helped assemble the witnesses, and when Senators \nfrom the majority were unavailable, he and I proceeded with the \npermission of our chairman to chair those hearings. We would not be \npassing this bill without the overwhelming support that it will have if \nit had not been for Senator Kennedy.\n  Of course, we also honor the senior Senator from Hawaii who likewise \nvoted for the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and each of its \nreauthorizations. His leadership in these matters is greatly \nappreciated by this Senator and, I believe, by the Senate.\n  I also thank the Democratic leader for his help. Senator Reid stayed \nfocused on making sure this essential legislative objective was \nachieved. He worked with us and the Republican leader throughout. He is \na lead sponsor of the legislation and was a key participant at our \nbicameral announcement on the steps of the Capitol on May 2.\n  Throughout the process of developing the bill, developing the \nlegislative record and considering the bill, he has never failed to go \nthe extra mile to ensure the success of this effort.\n  I thank our Chairman and lead Senate sponsor. As I pushed and cajoled \nand urged action he heard me out. Together with the other active \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee, we worked to assemble the necessary \nrecord and consider it so that our bill is on a solid factual, legal \nand constitutional foundation. I thank each of our cosponsors and, in \nparticular, those who joined us early on, those on the Judiciary \nCommittee, and the Republican leader.\n  There are too many others who deserve thanks. They include Senator \nSalazar for his contributions throughout and for his thoughtful \ninitiative to broaden those for whom this bill is named by including \nCesar Chavez. I look forward to working with him to make that a \nreality. To all who have supported this effort I say thank you and know \nthat your real thanks will be in the fulfillment of the promise of \nequality for all Americans in the years ahead.\n  I wholeheartedly thank the members of the civil rights community.\n  Led by Wade Henderson and Nancy Zirkin at the Leadership Conference \non Civil Rights and by Bruce Gordon and Hilary Shelton of the NAACP and \nby lawyers like Ted Shaw and Leslie Proll and all the voting rights \nattorneys who have made the cause of equal justice their lives' work, \nthey have been indispensable to this effort and relentless in their \ncommitment to what is best about America.\n  I thank my own staff, led by Bruce Cohen, backed by a wonderful staff \nof Kristine Lucius, Jeremy Paris, Kathryn Neal, Leila George-Wheeler, \nMargaret Edmonds, and our legal clerks Robynn Sturm, Arline Duffy and \nPeter Jewett.\n  I express my appreciation and admiration for all they do to make \nCongress and America measure up to the promise of our Constitution and \nthe vision that Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, Coretta Scott King and \nCesar Chavez had for America.\n  As I said earlier today, all 100 Senators have no problem voting. \nThey can walk into a voting booth in their home State, and nobody is \ngoing to say no. We have to make sure that everybody else is treated \nthe same as we 100 Senators are. This is for us, this is for our \nchildren, and on a personal level, this is also for our grandchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, Section 5 of the bill, which deals with \nGeorgia v. Ashcroft and the Bossier II case, is extremely important. As \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the \nConstitution, Civil Rights, and Property Rights, I concur with the \ndiscussion of this provision by the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six-and-a-half minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator from Massachusetts need time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just 2 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank our leader, Senator Reid, for his \nconstancy in support of this legislative effort and for his \nencouragement to all of us on the Judiciary Committee. I thank my \nfriend from Vermont for his kind words.\n  Earlier today, there have been comments by my friend--and he is my \nfriend--in the Judiciary Committee, Senator Cornyn, and also with \nregard to particular provisions in section 5, and later there were \ncomments from Senator Cornyn and Senator Kyl about an amendment offered \nby Congressman Norwood over in the House of Representatives. I think it \nis important that the Record reflect the results of the extensive \nhearings that we had on these different issues because it is extensive, \nexhaustive, and it is presented by the floor managers, Senators Specter \nand Leahy.\n  Senator Cornyn suggested in his remarks that he wishes we had taken \nmore time to debate fully some of the issues raised by the \nreauthorization. In particular, he said he wished more time had been \ntaken to consider the trigger formula for section 5. As an initial \nmatter, the Senate began its consideration of renewing the Voting \nRights Act with the very substantial record that had been assembled by \nthe House, which contained over 10,000 pages that were the result of by \nover 8 months of House Judiciary Committee hearings.\n  From our very first Senate hearing, Chairman Specter stressed the \nneed to\n\n[[Page S8010]]\n\nbuild a strong record in anticipation of challenges to the act's \nconstitutionality. That's exactly what we did. We heard from legal \nscholars and voting rights practitioners. We held 9 hearings, heard \nfrom 41 witnesses, and received well over ten thousand pages of \ndocumentary evidence. That evidence showed, unequivocally that \ndiscrimination, including intentional discrimination, persists in the \ncovered jurisdictions, and that the trigger is effective in identifying \njurisdictions for section 5 coverage. Senator Cornyn joined a unanimous \ncommittee in voting for the committee bill, which retains the act's \ntrigger formula.\n  Senator Cornyn also held up a map of the United States depicting \njurisdictions that would be covered if the amendment offered last week \nin the House by Representative Norwood had been adopted, which would \nbase coverage on voter registration and turnout during the last three \nPresidential elections. Representative Norwood had a full airing of his \nproposal and many rose in opposition, including Chairman Sensenbrenner. \nThe opponents of the amendment overwhelmingly carried the day.\n  Senator Cornyn said that the Norwood trigger would not appear to gut \nsection 5. However, under The Norwood formula, the State of Louisiana \nessentially wouldn't be covered. Yet, there is substantial evidence in \nour record of ongoing and recent voting discrimination in Louisiana. \nYet the so-called updated trigger formula would exclude this sort of \njurisdiction from coverage.\n  Finally, Senator Cornyn and Senator Kyl discussed the provision of \nthe bill known as the Georgia v. Ashcroft fix, which clarifies the \nretrogression standard in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in \nGeorgia v. Ashcroft. The bill restores section 5's ``ability-to-elect \nstandard,'' which was set forth in the Beer case. Under the Beer \nstandard, ``ability-to-elect'' districts include majority-minority \ndistricts where minority voters demonstrate an ability to elect the \ncandidates of their choice. Contrary to the suggestions of Senator \nCornyn and Senator Kyl on the floor, while the standard rejects the \nnotion that ``ability-to-elect'' districts can be traded for \n``influence'' districts, it also recognizes that minority voters may be \nable to elect candidates of their choice with reliable crossover \nsupport and, thus, does not mandate the creation and maintenance of \nmajority-minority districts in all circumstances. The test is fact-\nspecific, and turns on the particular circumstances of each case. As \nboth Senator Cornyn and Senator Kyl noted, the Voting Rights Act is not \nabout electing candidates of particular parties. It's about enabling \nminority voters to participate effectively and equally in the political \nprocess.\n  I thank the Senator and yield back whatever time remains.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to elaborate upon \nviews expressed earlier today by several of my colleagues. Senators \nMcConnell, Hatch, Kyl, and Cornyn engaged in a colloquy regarding the \nmeaning of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act reauthorization bill \npresently before this body. I wish to express my agreement with those \ncomments and add a few thoughts of my own.\n  Section 5 of the proposed bill overturns two Supreme Court cases: \nReno v. Bossier Parish, or Bossier Parish II, and Georgia v. Ashcroft. \nThe goal of the bill is to protect districts that contain a majority of \nminority voters. We are well aware of efforts in the past to \ndisenfranchise minority voters. As a consequence, this language \nprohibits legislators from acting purposely, with the intention of \nharming minority voters, to ``unpack'' majority-minority districts and \nto disperse those minority voters to other districts.\n  First, the bill overturns Bossier Parish II by prohibiting voting \nchanges enacted with ``any discriminatory purpose.'' This language bans \na government official from discriminating against minority voters. If a \ngovernment official could create a district that would benefit \nminorities, but purposely chooses not to do so because it will be \nmajority-minority then that government official will have violated this \nbill.\n  Although this is an important requirement, I have heard concerns that \nthe Justice Department may abuse the new language designed to overturn \nBossier Parish II and require States to maximize the number of \nmajority-minority districts--or to create so-called coalition or \ninfluence districts. In cases such as Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, \n921, 1995; Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952, 1996; and Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 \nU.S. 541, 1999, however, the Supreme Court has held that the Justice \nDepartment's one time policy of requiring States to maximize majority-\nminority districts violated the Constitution. I want to make it clear \nthat this bill does not allow such behavior, much less require it.\n  As I understand it, the new language we are adding allows the Justice \nDepartment to stop purposeful, unconstitutional behavior. It does not \ngrant the Justice Department license to violate the Constitution. It \ndoes not authorize the Justice Department to define for itself what is \na ``discriminatory purpose.'' And it does not give the Justice \nDepartment a blank check to require States to maximize influence or \ncoalition districts.\n  Second, the bill overturns Georgia v. Ashcroft by protecting the \nability of minorities to ``elect their preferred candidates of \nchoice.'' Some commentators have read Georgia v. Ashcroft as allowing \nStates to break up naturally occurring majority-minority districts to \ncreate other districts where minorities have less voting power but \nstill exercise important influence in elections. The bill's new \nlanguage protects districts in which minority citizens select their \n``preferred candidate of choice'' with their own voting power. In \nshort, it provides additional protection for naturally occurring \nmajority-minority districts. The bill does not demand that such \ndistricts be disbanded to create influence districts.\n  I hope this language is now clear. I also thank my colleagues--\nSenators McConnell, Hatch, Kyl, and Cornyn--for their lucid \nexplanations earlier.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. There is a definitive set of books written about this time \nperiod by Taylor Branch. When I read the first volume, I went over to \nthe office of Congressman John Lewis because his name was mentioned in \nthat book so often that a number years ago when the book was published, \nI talked to John Lewis about his valiant efforts to allow us to be in \nthe place we are today. I mention that because after having read the \nthird volume of Taylor Branch's book, ``At Canaan's Edge,'' which I \ncompleted a week ago, I was stunned by many references to Senator Ted \nKennedy.\n  One full page talks about a time that Senator Kennedy made his first \ntrip to Mississippi. His brother had been assassinated. He went with \nDr. King to Mississippi for the first time. There were 150 pounds of \nnails, an inch and three-quarters long, dumped in the pathway, three \npolice cars with nails in their tires and were unable to continue. \nThere were threats made on Senator Kennedy's life. I was so stunned by \nreading that that I called Senator Kennedy and read that to him and \nasked if this brought back memories of his first trip to Mississippi.\n  I mention John Lewis and Senator Kennedy because they are only two of \nthe many who made significant sacrifices to get us to the point where \nwe are today. On March 15, 1965, Lyndon Johnson came to the Capitol to \naddress a joint session of Congress. He spoke to a House, a Senate, and \na nation that had been rocked by recent violence, especially in Selma, \nAL. President Johnson's purpose that night was to spur Congress to \nfinally move forward on the Voting Rights Act, the legislation whose \nauthorization we are going to vote on today. That Congress, in 1965, \nlike this Congress in 2006, was slow to pass voting rights legislation. \nSo President Johnson came to the Hill to remind everybody what was at \nstake. Here is what he said:\n\n       This time, on this issue, there must be no delay, no \n     hesitation, and no compromise with our purpose. We cannot and \n     we must not refuse to protect the right of every American to \n     vote in every election that he may desire to participate in. \n     And we ought not, and we cannot, and we must not wait another \n     8 months before we get a bill. We have already waited a \n     hundred years or more, and the time for waiting is gone.\n\n  Mr. President, once again, in our country, at this time, the time for \nwaiting is gone. The Senate cannot and we must not go another day \nwithout sending the Voting Rights Act to the\n\n[[Page S8011]]\n\nPresident. We have already waited too long. I, like many others, \nexpected this legislation to be passed months ago. I remember months \nago standing on the Capitol steps with Senator Frist, House leaders, \nchairmen and ranking members of the Judiciary Committees from both \nbodies, and civil rights leaders, to announce the bipartisan-bicameral \nintroduction of this bill. It seemed that this act would move forward \nin swift bipartisan fashion. But it has not.\n  How long must we wait? How wrong that perception proved to be. In the \nHouse, consideration was delayed for weeks and weeks. It was only \nrecently passed over the objections of conservative opponents. In the \nSenate, we saw similar delay. In fact, as recently as last week, the \nmajority leader was not sure he would even bring this bill to the floor \nbefore the August recess.\n  In the House, consideration was delayed for weeks. It recently passed \nover the objections of conservative opponents.\n  Thankfully, he listened to Democrats. Thankfully, everyone listened \nto what we had to say, including our distinguished majority leader. \nObviously, from last Friday to today, he had a change of heart and \nbrought this bill before the Senate.\n  The Voting Rights Act is too important to fall by the wayside like so \nmany other issues that have fallen by the wayside, I am sorry to say, \nin this Republican Senate. Remember, the Voting Rights Act isn't just \nanother bill. It is paramount to the preservation of our democracy, \nliterally. As we have seen in recent elections, we remain a nation far \nfrom perfect. The fact is, we still have a lot of work to do, but in \nthe last 40 years, thanks to the Voting Rights Act, we have come a long \nway.\n  Before this Voting Rights Act became law, African-Americans who tried \nto register to vote were subject to beatings, literacy tests, poll \ntaxes, and death.\n  Before the Voting Rights Act, over 90 percent of eligible African-\nAmerican voters in Mississippi didn't and couldn't register to vote, \nnot because they didn't want to, they simply were unable to, they were \nnot permitted to.\n  Before the Voting Rights Act, it would have been unheard of to have \n43 African-American Members of Congress as we have today.\n  In the Senate, we cast a lot of votes, but not all of them are for \ncauses for which Americans just a few decades ago were willing to risk \ntheir lives. It is a sad fact of American history that blood was \nspilled and violence erupted before the Nation opened its eyes to \njustice and the need to guarantee in law everyone's right to vote.\n  It is important that all of us remember the sacrifice of those \nAmericans, and to make sure we do, after this bill becomes law, I will \nseek to add the name of John Lewis to this bill. I already talked about \nhis being one of my personal heroes. I understand Senators Leahy and \nSalazar are doing something similar with Cesar Chavez. I support that. \nHeroic actions of men such as John Lewis and Cesar Chavez are shining \nexamples of the heroic actions of so many during the fight for equal \nrights.\n  Congressman Lewis is a civil rights icon. He has given his entire \nlife to the causes of justice and liberty. As I have said, he was a key \norganizer of so many things, not the least of which was the 1963 march \nin Washington. I was here. I saw it. He was in Selma when the billy \nclubs, police dogs, and fire hoses were used on that bloody Sunday, and \nhe had his body beaten on many occasions. But he hasn't given up the \nfight, even to this day.\n  Similarly, during his life, Cesar Chavez was a champion of the \nAmerican principles of justice, equality, and freedom. He fearlessly \nfought to right the wrongs literally of those injustices inflicted on \nAmerican farm workers and brought national attention to the causes of \nlabor and injustice.\n  America is a better place because of John Lewis and Cesar Chavez. By \nplacing their names on this landmark legislation, we can be sure \nAmericans will always remember the sacrifices made in the name of \nequality.\n  I began by quoting Lyndon Johnson's speech in 1965. There is another \nexcerpt from that speech which I will read, and it is as follows:\n\n       In our time we have come to live with moments of great \n     crisis. Our lives have been marked with debate about great \n     issues; issues of war and peace, issues of prosperity and \n     depression. But rarely in any time does an issue lay bear the \n     secret heart of America itself. Rarely are we met with a \n     challenge, not to our growth or abundance, our welfare or our \n     security, but rather to the values and the purposes and the \n     meaning of our beloved Nation.\n\n  This same challenge--a challenge to the values and the purposes and \nthe meaning of our Nation--is now before the Senate. In just a few \nminutes, we are going to pass overwhelmingly the Voting Rights Act of \n2006. It is a challenge which this body has met. We have done it \npurposefully and rightfully, and history books will indicate that we \nhave made a significant step forward. There is more to do, but this is \na big step forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). They have not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the majority leader should be here \nmomentarily. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator will withhold.\n  Mr. REID. I withhold, of course.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to make sure--I was not trying to \nforce it to a vote. I know the distinguished Republican leader will \nspeak next, but many of us spent a lot of time on this, and we want to \nmake sure it will be--as one of the managers of the bill--we want to \nmake absolutely sure there will be a rollcall vote.\n  If nobody is seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, 41 years--that is how long it has been \nsince the Voting Rights Act was first enacted in 1965, and we have come \na long way in those 41 years. That much was made clear to me on a \nrecent visit to the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, TN, just \nabout 3 weeks ago with President Bush and Dr. Ben Hooks, a renowned \ncivil rights leader, a former executive director of the NAACP for 14 or \n15 years a personal friend of myself and my distinguished colleague \nfrom Tennessee who is with me on the floor, Lamar Alexander.\n  Together we visited the site of the assassination of Martin Luther \nKing, Jr., at the Lorraine Motel, which over the past several decades \nhas developed into a wonderful, inspiring civil rights museum. As we \nwalked through that museum with Dr. Hooks, in his voice could one \ncapture that sensitivity, that inspiration, some sadness as we walked \nthrough, and he recounted the events surrounding that time, but history \ncame alive.\n  It was an ugly moment in our collective history and certainly not \nAmerica's finest hour, but the museum reinforced the impressions I had. \nIt strikes your conscience. It reminds you of the lessons learned, \nlessons I saw once again on a pilgrimage I took with Congressman John \nLewis and about 10 of our colleagues a little over 2 years ago when we \nvisited the civil rights sites in Tennessee and Alabama, and together \nwe crossed Selma's Edmund Pettus Bridge where, over four decades ago \nnow, Congressman Lewis led those peaceful marchers in the name of \nvoting rights for all.\n  What struck me most during that pilgrimage a couple of years ago and \nthen 3 weeks ago during that museum visit with Dr. Hooks is how we as a \nnation pushed through that time, as we persevered to correct injustice, \njust as we have at other points in American history. It reminded me of \nour ability to change; that when our laws become destructive to our \nunalienable rights, such as liberty and pursuit of happiness, it is the \nright of the people to alter or abolish them. And it reminded me of the \nimportance, the absolute necessity of ensuring the permanence of\n\n[[Page S8012]]\n\nthe changes we made, the permanence of correction to injustice.\n  So I am very pleased that in just a few minutes, we will act as a \nbody to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act. We owe it to the memories of \nthose who fought before us--and we owe it to our future, a future when \nequality is a reality in our hearts and minds and not just the law--to \nreauthorize the Voting Rights Act.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in voting for this critical \nlegislation because in the 41 years since it became law, we have seen \ntremendous progress, and now it is time to ensure that the progress \ncontinues, that we protect the civil liberties of each and every \nAmerican.\n  Mr. President, I yield back all our time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, is there still time available on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the third reading of the \nbill.\n  The bill (H.R. 9) was ordered to a third reading and was read the \nthird time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass? On this question, the yeas and nays \nhave been ordered.

Under the previous order, the \nHatch amendment at the desk is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4686) was agreed to, as follows:\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments\")\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for granting \nunanimous consent to pass the most comprehensive child crimes and \nprotection bill in our Nation's history--H.R. 4472, the Adam Walsh \nChild Protection and Safety Act of 2006.\n  This bill started in the House of Representatives by a courageous and \nambitious Congressman from Florida, Mark Foley. Mark is with us in the \nSenate Chamber today, and I want to thank him, again, for getting this \nball rolling and for fighting like a champion on behalf of our \nchildren. I appreciate his tenacity and enthusiasm--we would not be \nhere without his devotion and hard work.\n  I also thank Senator Biden, who joined me in sponsoring the original \nSenate version of this bill. Senator Biden and I have worked together \non so many bills, none more important than what we are accomplishing \ntoday for our children. Senators Frist, Specter, and Reid thank you for \nmaking this bill priority and for getting this bill through.\n  The bill we are about to pass, the Adam Walsh Child Safety and \nProtection Act, represents a collaboration between the House and Senate \nto include the strong provisions of S. 1086, the Sex Offender \nRegistration and Notification Act, and H.R. 4472, The Child Safety Act. \nIt creates a National Sex Offender Registry with uniform standards for \nthe registration of sex offenders, including a lifetime registration \nrequirement for the most serious offenders. This is critical to sew \ntogether the patch-work quilt of 50 different State attempts to \nidentity and keep track of sex offenders.\n  The Adam Walsh Act establishes strong Federal penalties for sex \noffenders who fail to register, or fail to update their information, \nincluding up to 10 years in prison for non-compliance.\n  The Adam Walsh Act imposes tough penalties for the most serious \ncrimes against children, including a 30 year mandatory penalty for \nraping a child and no less than 10 years in prison for a sex \ntrafficking offense. In fact, this bill creates a series of assured \npenalties for crimes of violence against children, including penalties \nfor murder, kidnapping, maiming, and using a dangerous weapon against a \nchild. And the bill allows for the death penalty in the most serious \ncases of child abuse, including the murder of a child in sexual \nexploitation and kidnapping offenses.\n  The bottom line here is that sex offenders have run rampant in this \ncountry and now Congress and the people are ready to respond with \nlegislation that will curtail the ability of sex offenders to operate \nfreely. It is our hope that programs like NBC Dateline's ``To Catch a \nPredator'' series will no longer have enough material to fill an hour \nor even a minute. Now, it seems, they can go to any city in this \ncountry and catch dozens of predators willing to go on-line to hunt \nchildren.\n\n[[Page S8013]]\n\n  Laws regarding registration for sex offenders have not been \nconsistent from State to State now all States will lock arms and \npresent a unified front in the battle to protect children. Web sites \nthat have been weak in the past, due to weak laws and haphazard \nupdating and based on inaccurate information, will now be accurate, \nupdated and useful for finding sex offenders.\n  There are more than a half-million registered sex offenders in the \nUnited States. Those are the ones we know. Undoubtedly there are more. \nThat number is going to go up. Over 100,000 of those sex offenders are \nregistered but missing. That number is going to go down. We are going \nto get tough on these people. Some estimate it is as high as 150,000 \nsex offenders who are not complying. That is killing our children.\n  Another important part of this bill will help prevent the sexual \nexploitation of children through the production of sexually explicit \nmaterial. Every day we hear new stories about how pornographers and \npredators take advantage of new technology to exploit children in new \nways. It is very difficult for legislatures even to keep up, and when \nwe do pass new legislation, it is often stymied in the courts.\n  Federal law requires producers of some sexually explicit material to \nkeep records regarding the identity and age of performers and to make \nthose records available for inspection. The current statute, however, \nwas enacted before the Internet existed and covers only some sexually \nexplicit material. The provisions in the act before us brings key \ndefinitions in the law up to date, extends the record keeping \nrequirement to more sexually explicit material, and makes refusal to \npermit inspection of these records a crime.\n  I want to thank John Walsh, host of ``America's Most Wanted,'' and \nhis wife, Reve--who have waited nearly 25 years for this day. Next \nThursday, July 27, 2006, marks 25 years since the abduction and \nsubsequent murder of their son Adam--for whom this bill is named. And \non that 25th anniversary the President will sign into law legislation \nthat will help law enforcement do what John has been doing all along--\nhunt down predators and criminals. I want to thank the National Center \nfor Missing and Exploited Children for their tireless work and for \ntheir assistance with crafting this legislation.\n  This is smart legislation and I am very proud of the Adam Walsh Act. \nI am determined that Congress will play its part in protecting the \nchildren of my home state of Utah and America. I have never been more \nexcited to see a bill signed into law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I begin speaking to this legislation by \nthanking my buddy. And I know that is a colloquial expression in this \nformal place we work when I say ``my buddy,'' but Senator Hatch and I \nhave worked together for a long time. It is hard for me to believe we \nhave been here as long as we have. I have actually been here a couple \nyears longer than he has. We have our differences in philosophy. We \nhave never had any differences personally. We have never had any \ndifferences in terms of our relationship.\n  The two things I am proudest of that we have both done is we have \nboth--and I say this somewhat self-serving, I acknowledge--we both \nalways hired staff that is respected. I do not think there has ever \nbeen a time that Orrin has not had a staff and staff members who my \nstaff completely, totally trusted. I think it is fair to say that is \nthe case on Orrin's side as well.\n  That makes a gigantic difference because I think the work that Ken \nValentine, the fellow sitting to Orrin's right, did--a loner, Secret \nService guy from the administration, from the executive branch--and a \nfellow I am very proud of, whom I will mention in a moment--the work \nthey did with John Walsh and others, to overcome the hurdles that get \nthrown in the way of good legislation because everybody has their own \nagenda.\n  Everybody knows that for Orrin and me--and I would add my friend from \nNorth Dakota--that some of us have had this as sort of a--I have been \naccused of this being a hobbyhorse for me, this, all the work we have \ndone for so long on dealing with child predators and abused women and \nabused children. But what happens sometimes is that good legislation \ngets stuck because other Senators, who do not have that as the same \npriority--although they are for it--attach a lot of extraneous things \nbecause there is something they feel is even more critical than the \nlegislation, and they see it, to use the Senate jargon, as a vehicle to \nget their views heard and their legislation passed.\n  Well, as to the work that Dave Turk of my staff did and Ken Valentine \ndid in order to sort of clear the way for this, I think everyone who \nhas worked on this, including John Walsh, would acknowledge is \nextraordinary.\n  So I want to personally--there are others, I am sure. There are \nothers. I do not mean, by mentioning these two individuals, to in any \nway denigrate the incredible work done by so many others. But I think \nsometimes the public wonders why we pay staff members--all of whom can \nmake a lot more money if they did something else--the kind of salaries \nthey get paid, in relative terms. It is because they are so good. They \nare so dedicated. They are so talented.\n  In my experience of being here 33 years, I have found that when a \nstaff member, no less than a Senator, has an intellectual as well as an \nemotional commitment to what they are doing, it is even more effective.\n  I know for my friend and staff member, Dave Turk, who is a father, \nand for Ken Valentine, whom I have only gotten to know personally \nrecently, this is more than legislation, this is more than passing this \npiece of legislation. This is the stuff of which your life's work is \nviewed as being worthwhile.\n  I remember Jerry Brown, when he used to be the Governor of \nCalifornia, once said when he was cutting pay--I am not making a \njudgment of whether he should have or should not have--when cutting the \npay of State employees, he made a statement only Jerry Brown could \nmake, 20 years ago: Well, they have the psychic remuneration of living \nin California. I do not know about that. But I can tell you that the \npsychic remuneration for Orrin Hatch and Joe Biden and Ken Valentine \nand Dave Turk, and many others who worked on this, makes this job \nworthwhile.\n  The two things of which I am most proud that I have done in 33 years \nare dealing with this issue in particular and culminating in this \nlegislation, the Adam Walsh Child Protection Safety Act, and the \nViolence Against Women Act--which, I might add, one of only seven guys \nwho jumped out front in 1994 to get that done was also Orrin Hatch.\n  So, Senator Hatch, I thank you. We have been in the minority, the \nmajority, the minority; we have switched places back and forth, but it \nhas never changed our relationship, never changed how we have worked \nwith each other, and never changed the good work I think we and many \nothers can say we are proud to have participated in.\n  Mr. President, I wish to talk a few minutes about the actual act. \nCongress has done a good deal over the last 25 years--and I might add, \nstarting with, God love him, our old and deceased friend, Senator \nThurmond from South Carolina--to protect kids. We created the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children in 1984. We enacted the crime \nbill in 1994. We enacted the Amber Alert system in 2003.\n  But every time we have done something significant, the bad guys have \nfigured out a way to take advantage of it, to find a loophole, to find \nan opening. And that is what this is about--and I wish he had floor \nprivileges because he could speak to it better than any of us--but this \nis about, to paraphrase John Walsh, with whom I had dinner the other \nnight--this is about closing the door. This is about uniting 50 States \nin common purpose and in league with one another to prevent these \nlowlifes from slipping through the cracks. So we recognize that what we \nhave done in the past did not do all we wanted to do.\n  I might add one more thing. Joe Biden and Orrin Hatch come from \ndifferent sides of the political spectrum on a lot of things. But I can \nassure you, not only is this tough, but the civil liberties of \nAmericans are not in jeopardy with this. This is not--this is not--a \ncase where in order to get bad guys we have had to in any way lessen \nthe constitutional protections made available\n\n[[Page S8014]]\n\nto good guys. So I think it is a proud piece of work.\n  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, as Senator \nHatch has indicated, estimates there are over 550,000 sex offenders \nnationwide, and more than 20 percent of them are unaccounted for. I \nwould argue that there are a whole lot more than 550,000, who never get \ncaught up in the criminal web for a thousand different reasons that I \ndo not have time to explain. But at a minimum, this means there are as \nmany as 150,000 of these dangerous sex offenders out there, individuals \nwho have already committed crimes and may, unless we do something, \ncontinue to jeopardize the most vulnerable among us.\n  The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act takes direct aim at \nthis problem. Plain and simple, this legislation, I can say with \ncertainty, will save children's lives.\n  Sexual predators must be tracked, and our cops and our parents have a \nright to know when these criminals are in their neighborhoods. That is \nwhat we do here.\n  First--an important point--let's start at the beginning. This \nlegislation requires sex offenders to register prior to their release \nfrom prison, to make sure we give them absolutely no opportunity to do \nwhat happens now: fall through the cracks between the moment the prison \ndoor opens and before they set up a residence.\n  We also make sure we are keeping tabs on everyone who poses a threat \nto our kids. Advances in technology are a great thing, but many times \nthere is a dark side. The Internet, for example, puts the knowledge of \nthe world at a child's fingertips, but it can also be and is abused by \nsexual predators causing kids harm. To steal a phrase from my son, who \nis a Federal prosecutor, he told me: Dad, it used to be you could lock \nyour door or hold your child's hand at the mall and keep them out of \nharm's way.\n  But today, in my son's words, with a click of a mouse, a predator can \nenter your child's bedroom in a locked home and begin the pernicious \nroad to violating that child. That is why this legislation adds the \n``use of the Internet to facilitate or commit a crime against a minor'' \nas an offense that could trigger registration.\n  And once someone is on a sex offender registry, we make sure they \ncan't go back into hiding in the shadows. Under this bill, child \npredators would be required to periodically and in person check in with \nthe authorities.\n  They also would be required to update their photographs so law \nenforcement and parents will know where these folks are and what they \nlook like now and not solely what they looked like years ago that is \nunrecognizable now.\n  And if a registered offender fails to comply with any of these \nrequirements, he or she faces a felony of up to 10 years in prison. If \nan unregistered sex offender commits a crime of violence, the offender \nwill face a 5-year mandatory prison sentence in addition to any other \nsentence imposed.\n  A noncompliant sex offender will also face U.S. Marshals who have \nbeen brought in under this bill to lend their expertise and manpower to \nhelp track down these dangerous individuals.\n  John and I were talking about it at dinner. These guys saddle up, to \nuse his phrase. They are the most underrated, underestimated part of \nAmerican law enforcement. They do the job incredibly well. They want to \nget in on this, and they are now part of this. We now have designated \ntheir expertise and manpower to track down these individuals.\n  One of the biggest problems in our current sex offender registry \nsystem happens when registered sex offenders travel from one State to \nanother.\n  Delaware has worked hard to keep track of the 3,123 sex offenders \nregistered to my State. But there are other States that are not so \nadvanced and whose systems are not so sophisticated.\n  This bill fully integrates and expands the State systems so that \ncommunities nationwide will be warned when high-risk offenders come to \nlive among them. And we target resources under this bill at the worst \nof the worst and provide Federal dollars to make sure States aren't \nleft holding the bag.\n  We also require the U.S. Department of Justice to create software to \nshare with States in order to allow for information to be shared \ninstantly and seamlessly among them. When a sex offender moves from New \nJersey to Delaware, for example, we have to be absolutely sure that \nDelaware authorities know about it.\n  This bill also mandates a national sex offender Web site so that \nparents can find out who is living in their neighborhoods. Parents will \nnow be able to search for information on sex offenders by geographic \nradius and ZIP Code.\n  Do we have a silver bullet, a foolproof system here? I have been \naround too long to know the answer to that question is no. What we do \nhave is a slew of commonsense ways for fixing our current problem.\n  As I mentioned earlier, it has taken us months and years to get to \nthe point of enacting this important bill into law. Again, I give \ncredit where credit is due, as has already been mentioned, to John and \nReve Walsh. I know we are not supposed to--and I will not--violate \nSenate rules by pointing out who is where. But the fact is, if I were \nsitting next to them in the gallery now, I suspect if I put my hand on \nhis arm, I would feel the tension in his arm.\n  This has to be a very bittersweet moment for John Walsh. For what are \nwe doing here today? We are naming a bill that will save the lives of \nhopefully thousands of other young people after a beautiful young boy \nwho was victimized and killed.\n  The thing I find most amazing about John and Reve is, I don't know \nhow anybody who has lost a child can have the courage to do what they \nhave done. I know from my own experience, which I will not speak to, \nthere are certain circumstances I cannot walk into because it reminds \nme of one of my children I lost.\n  I could never do what John and Reve did. I could never do what they \ndid. And we could have never done today what we are doing without them. \nThat is not hyperbole; that is the God's truth. We could never have \ngotten this done without John and Reve Walsh.\n  It has to be one god-awful bitter moment, for the 27th of this month, \nif I am not mistaken, will be the 25th anniversary.\n  A lot of people on this floor, including one of my colleagues I am \nsitting with, have lost children. It doesn't matter whether it is 2 \nyears past, 10 years, 25 years, or 50 years past. That part never \npasses. I thank John and Reve for their courage, courage way beyond \nanything I could possess.\n  I have known John for many years. We go way back to 1984, working \ntogether to create the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren along with Senator Hatch. He has been at it year after year, \npushing the Congress to do more.\n  John, you have been an inspiration. You continue to be. Don't \nunderestimate it. You have been doing it so long, don't underestimate \nhow many thousands of people take solace from what you do and what you \nhave done.\n  It has not been my style in 33 years to take the floor to speak in \nsuch personal terms, but this is ultimately personal. It is the \nultimate, ultimate personal thing, your child.\n  Earlier this week I had a chance to sit down with Ed Smart whose \ndaughter Elizabeth--what a magnificently beautiful, poised, gracious \nyoung woman--then 14 years, was abducted at gunpoint from her family in \nSalt Lake City while her parents and four brothers slept. She was found \n9 months later. The strength of that family's character, its resilience \nis remarkable.\n  I have taken too much of the Senate's time. Let me again thank my \ncolleague from Utah. I also thank our committee chairman and all the \nmembers of our committee. They also deserve a great deal of credit.\n  Other Senators, including my colleague on the floor, who has been \nrelentless, absolutely relentless, Senator Dorgan; he added a major, \nimportant piece to this legislation. I thank him for that. Senator Bill \nNelson, Chuck Grassley, all contributed important parts to this bill. \nThey each took tragedies that happened in their States and used them as \na call to action.\n  Senators Frist and Reid--our majority and minority leaders--also \ndeserve all our thanks by ensuring that this important bill was treated \nwith the priority it deserved.\n  Congressman Foley has worked tirelessly on this bill in the House for\n\n[[Page S8015]]\n\nyears, and Congressman Pomeroy was by his side. And Chairman \nSensenbrenner guided this bill through the House of Representatives.\n  I don't think there is one of us on this floor who wouldn't trade \naway this bill for being able to bring back to life all those innocent \nlives that were lost that allowed us, in a bizarre way, to produce this \nlegislation.\n  We cannot redeem the dead, but we can, in fact, protect the living. I \nthink this bill, with the many parts I didn't mention, including DNA \ntesting and a whole range of other things, is fair, decent, and \nhonorable. Most important, there is not a single thing we can do that \nis more worthy of our effort than protecting our children. That is what \nall of us on this floor--and many who are not--today are playing a part \nin doing.\n  Again, I close by thanking John Walsh.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Is there an order of speaking this evening, if I might \ninquire of the manager.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we go back and \nforth so long as we have people on both sides. So the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota will be allowed to speak next and then the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I will pick up where the Senator from \nDelaware left off and the Senator from Utah, also thanking John Walsh \nand his wife Reve for their tremendous contribution to our society but \nin particular for this piece of legislation. We all have to deal in \nlife with tragedies, struggles. It is the measure of a person to see \nhow that individual responds.\n  Given the nature of the tragedy they experience, it could have easily \ndestroyed them. They took this horrific incident and turned it into a \ntremendous good. As Senator Biden says, who knows personally, I can't \nthink of anything worse than losing a child. Losing a child in such an \nincredibly tragic situation has to be more than you can possibly bear. \nTo take that emotion and channel it into a positive course for the \nbenefit of other children is an incredible legacy for Adam. I know John \nand Reve do it for that reason, to build this incredible legacy. This \nlegacy is added to today by naming this bill the Adam Walsh Child \nProtection and Safety Act.\n  Not only is this a great thing they are doing for society, they are a \ngreat model for so many who experience tragedies every single day. \nPeople can look at them and see how something that I am sure brought \nthem to their knees can be turned around to do so much good for so \nmany. So they are not only helping the children, helping those who are \nvictims of crime, but they are helping those who are victims of life's \ntragedies that befall us all and giving them an inspiration to move \nforward and turn tragedy into triumph. This is another triumph. It may \nnot even be the biggest triumph they have experienced, but it is \ncertainly a triumph and a positive thing to add to that legacy.\n  I rise to talk about two pieces of this bill I have been working on \nand of which I am the author. One is called Project Safe Childhood. The \nsecond is called the Schools SAFE Act. I introduced Project Safe \nChildhood a couple months ago after learning of a program at the \nJustice Department called Project Safe Childhood.\n  The Justice Department, in reviewing and seeing the incredible \nproliferation of child exploitation crimes, basically being \nproliferated through the Internet, took on a new program within the \nDepartment. This new program was in response to what we see of sexual \npredators on the Internet and with other types of sexual trafficking, \nagain, as a result of the Internet and other places. They developed a \nprogram which is a very good program. It has five main purposes:\n  First, it seeks to integrate Federal, State, and local efforts and \ninvestigate and prosecute child exploitation cases.\n  Second, the project allows major case coordination between the \nDepartment of Justice and other appropriate Federal agencies.\n  Third, it increases Federal involvement in child exploitation cases \nby providing additional investigative tools and additional penalties \nthat are available under Federal law that State and local governments \nmay not have.\n  Four, the project provides increased training for Federal, State, and \nlocal law enforcement regarding the investigation and prosecution of \ncomputer-facilitated crimes against children.\n  Finally, it promotes community and educational programs to raise \nnational awareness about the threat of online sexual predators and to \nprovide information to families on how to report violations.\n  As the father of six children, I can tell you that what Senator Biden \nsaid about what parents used to feel they could do to protect \nchildren--locking doors and being with them--has gotten a lot more \ncomplex, with that fiber optic tube that runs into your house that \nallows the entire world to come crashing into your home and allows sick \npeople to be able to prey on members of your family. We need to do more \nto educate parents. This is like pointing a loaded gun at your child, \nin many cases, and asking them to get on and play. This is a dangerous \ntool.\n  Yes, there are wonderful things on the Internet. There is a \ntremendous world of knowledge and adventure on the Internet. But as we \nknow, too often the major traffic on the Internet is not those \nwonderful and informative sites. They are sites that prey on our \nfailings and weaknesses, prey on the unsuspecting, on the innocent, in \nmany cases. We as parents have to be better armed to deal with these \npeople who want to reach into our homes and corrupt members of our \nfamilies, corrupt everything that we are trying to teach them not to do \nand, worse yet, potentially could opt them into behavior that could \nrisk, ultimately, their lives.\n  So this program is very important that the Justice Department is \nengaged in. I contacted the Department and worked with them to develop \nan authorization bill so we could provide a stable stream of funding \nfor Project Safe Childhood and expand the program in a way that the \nDepartment on its own could not do.\n  For example, increasing penalties for registered sex offenders, child \nsex trafficking and sexual abuse, and other child exploitation crimes, \nwhich this does. It creates a children's safety online awareness \ncampaign and authorizes grants for child safety programs. So in \naddition to what the Justice Department program does, we add those \nprovisions to help with better coordination between State, local, and \nFederal prosecutors and investigators.\n  I had a meeting in the western district of Pennsylvania with our U.S. \nattorney, Mary Beth Buchanan, and State and local officials. They were \ntalking about it--just the practical difficulties of assigning police \nand investigators and detectives and prosecutors on a local level and \nthe support they need and the overlapping jurisdictional issues. So \nthis will help them be able to create seamless teams of people to go \nafter these child abusers, as well as to project into the community \ninformation that is important to prevent these crimes from happening.\n  So I am grateful that Senators Specter, Hatch, and Leahy have worked \nto include that provision in the bill. I think it will take us a step \nforward in protecting our children from these predators and from \nexploitation.\n  The second piece of legislation is called the Schools SAFE Act. We \nspend a lot of time on the Senate floor talking about how we can \nimprove the quality of education. But it almost goes without saying \nthat when you drop your child off at school, at a bare minimum, you \nexpect that the people who interact with them at school will not harm \nthem. You would think that would be almost a given. But, unfortunately, \nin our country today we actually have a very poor system of checking as \nto whether people who are hired in schools are, in fact, safe for the \nchildren with whom they interact.\n  Obviously, the vast majority of teachers and people who work in \nschools are good and decent people and are there because they want to \nhelp children, not because they want to harm children. But like \nanything else, if you are someone who is a sexual predator, and you are \nlooking to harm children, what better place to go than a place where \nthere are children every single day you could possibly exploit.\n\n[[Page S8016]]\n\nSo it is important that we have sufficient checks in place to make sure \nthat these predators are not in educational settings where they can \nharm and corrupt our children.\n  The current state of play is basically a mishmash of different State \nlaws and different participation in a system created to help schools \naccess information about criminal background checks. Some States \nrequire, for example, only a State background check, while other States \nrequire an FBI background check. With these disparities, individuals \ncontinue to find opportunities to evade safeguards that have been put \ninto place.\n  In Pennsylvania, an FBI background check is only required for \nindividuals applying to schools for work and have lived in the \nCommonwealth for less than 2 years. So if you lived in the Commonwealth \nfor several years and you committed a crime someplace else, \nPennsylvania would not have the ability to check that out.\n  Beginning in 2007, Pennsylvania will require applicants who have \nlived in the Commonwealth for more than 2 years to also undergo FBI \nbackground checks.\n  So we are addressing that issue in Pennsylvania.\n  I think it just goes to show you that there is no good system out \nthere. What we need to do is allow States to access a database that was \nestablished by Congress in 1998 in the National Crime Prevention and \nPrivacy Compact. This compact allows States to share background \ninformation on individuals seeking employment in a school district. \nThis is an important thing to have all the States participating in. I \nwill not go through all of the problems, but there are all sorts of \nmemoranda and agreements and data-sharing information. As a result of \nthat, only roughly half of the States--26 States--participate in the \ncompact. Even States that have joined the compact don't always get \naccess to the information they need. This is a problem.\n  You could have a man from Pennsylvania who committed sex crimes in \nPennsylvania and moved to Nevada. Nevada is a compact State. Nevada \ncould do the compact based check of whether this person has committed \ncrimes against children and find nothing, because Pennsylvania does not \nparticipate in the compact. So they could be hired in Nevada schools \nwithout any knowledge of the individual's problems in Pennsylvania.\n  This is obviously a great threat to our children. So what this bill \ndoes is give schools across our Nation an essential resource when \nmaking hiring decisions. They will be able to access this database and \nconduct fingerprint-based background checks on individuals who are \nseeking work with or around children in schools. So this is another \nimportant step in protecting our children, in addition to all of the \nother provisions in this bill--protecting our children in this case in \nour schools.\n  I thank, again, the chairman and ranking member for their tremendous \nassistance to me in getting this legislation in the final package. \nAgain, I congratulate all who have been involved in this very important \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 3 minutes be \nyielded to the Senator from Georgia, and then we go back to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, and then to Senator Allen, and that would be it for \nnow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senators for their courtesy. \nI thank Senator Hatch from Utah and his committee for incorporating in \nthis very important bill provisions known as Masha's law. I was \nprivileged to join, as an original cosponsor, with Senator Kerry on \nMasha's law.\n  Masha is a young lady who, at an early age in Russia, was adopted by \nan American citizen who became her custodian. He brought her to the \nUnited States and, systematically and over a protracted period of time, \nabused her and put her photographs over the Internet in enormous \nnumbers. Masha, fortunately, after a sustained period of time, was able \nto escape his custody. A case was filed against him. He was indicted \nand convicted and today is incarcerated in Massachusetts.\n  Masha is, fortunately, now living in a loving home in Georgia and has \na wonderful mother who is truly an angel of adoption in every way.\n  In researching this case, we found that young Masha, and many others \nlike her who have been abused in their lives, could not even recover \nunder the laws as they existed. What Masha's law does, and what is \nincorporated in here, is it changes ``any minor'' to ``any person,'' so \nthat if a minor is depicted in photographs pornographically that are \ndistributed over the Internet, but by the time the abuser is caught, \nthe minor is an adult, they can still recover. They cannot now, and \nthat is ridiculous. It makes sure that recovery on the part of a minor \ncan take place when they become an adult, whether or not the guilty \nperson is incarcerated. It raises from $50,000 to $150,000 the penalty \nfor which that individual can be recompensated if, in fact, someone who \ndepicts that picture and puts it on the Internet and uses them is \ncaught and convicted. That compensation is to be paid to the \nindividual.\n  Although I don't think there is any price too high to cost an \nindividual who would take advantage of a minor, I think it is only \nappropriate to triple that penalty and make sure that reaching the age \nof adulthood does not exempt someone from recovery. It is a tribute to \ncontinuing to do what this bill does, and that is look after the \nprotection of minors and ensure that those who violate them are caught \nand punished and have to pay to the maximum extent.\n  I thank the Senator from Utah for allowing me the time, and I thank \nthe Senators from North Dakota and Virginia as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. First, let me say to the Senator from Utah, as well as to \nmy colleague, the Senator from Delaware, that their leadership has been \nvery important on this legislation. They will not know the names of \nthose whose lives are saved, but lives will be saved because this \nlegislation has passed. I very much appreciate their diligence and hard \nwork.\n  This is a piece of legislation about protecting children. I don't \nknow what is second place in the lives of many people, but I know what \nis in first place, and that is the protection of children. They cannot \nprotect themselves. It is our responsibility as parents; it is our \nresponsibility in this country to do the things necessary to protect \nour children. There are so many stories that it is almost hard to \nbegin, and you don't know where to stop.\n  My interest in this goes back some long ways. My colleagues have \ndescribed John Walsh and the tragic loss of his son Adam Walsh. Those \nof us who have lost children understand that pain, but it must be \nenormously compounded by the pain of someone who loses a child who has \nbeen abducted.\n  My experience, especially with respect to North Dakota, a couple of \nyears ago was to learn one day that a wonderful young woman had been \nabducted in a parking lot of a shopping center in Grand Forks, ND, a \nyoung woman named Dru Sjodin, and, we later found, murdered.\n  There is a trial underway for someone charged with murder in that \ncase, but that case is like so many cases, it seems to me. It is the \ncase of Adam Walsh, it is the case of 9-year-old Jessica Lunsford, it \nis the case of a 12-year-old girl named Polly Klaas. It is the case of \nSarah Michelle Lunde, age 13.\n  Pull back the curtain and then ask the question: Who is it abducting \nthese children? Who are the sexual predators killing these children?\n  This is not some mystery. We know the answer to this. The answer is, \nin most cases, that these murders and these abductions are done by \nthose who have been in our criminal justice system and who have \nabducted and murdered before.\n  I held a meeting in Fargo, ND, following the abduction of Dru Sjodin \nand the introduction of legislation I call Dru's law. What brings me to \nthe floor of the Senate today is the components of Dru's law have been \nincluded in this legislation. So, finally, it will become law.\n  The Senate has passed Dru's law twice on its own. We have not gotten \nit\n\n[[Page S8017]]\n\nthrough the U.S. House. Now it will be through the U.S. House and \nSenate as a part of this Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, \nand it will become law.\n  A meeting I held in Fargo, ND, to discuss Dru's law is a meeting at \nwhich I showed this poster. This meeting was just over a year and a \nquarter ago now. I held the meeting at the city hall in Fargo, ND.\n  Prior to the meeting, I searched the computer for a registry of sex \noffenders to find out who was living within 1 mile of where we were \nmeeting at city hall in Fargo, ND, who had previously been convicted as \na sexual predator--who were they? I would share the names with the \nfolks who came to that meeting to say: Here is a registry in North \nDakota of sexual predators. There is no national registry; this is \nNorth Dakota's registry.\n  This is a poster that I showed the folks who came to Fargo that day \nas an example of someone who lived within a mile of where we were \nhaving the meeting. His name is Joseph Duncan, first-degree rape. He \nraped a 14-year-old boy at gunpoint, burned the victim with a \ncigarette, made the victim believe he was going to be killed by firing \nthe gun twice on empty chambers; terminated from treatment; served a \nlengthy prison sentence; paroled, then absconded; had a long history of \nsexual aggression as a youth.\n  That is his sheet from the registry in North Dakota.\n  What I didn't know that day was that 1 month before the meeting I was \nhaving in Fargo, this same man had been charged with molesting a 6-\nyear-old boy at a playground in Detroit Lakes, MN, just across the \nborder. Someone in Minnesota checking the registry of sexual predators \nwould not have found his name. He was just miles away living in Fargo, \nND, but, in fact, he went over to Detroit Lakes, MN, and was charged \nwith molesting a 6-year-old boy.\n  That is why we need a national registry. Strangely enough, in April \nof last year, he appeared on those charges, and a county judge set the \nbail at $15,000, and he was released after posting cash, promising to \nstay in touch, and he absconded and that is it. The judge said he \ndidn't know he had this record.\n  Then 2 months later, this man we know now from intense media coverage \nwas arrested in Idaho for kidnaping 8-year-old Shasta Groene and her \nbrother, 9-year-old Dylan. The children had been missing for well over \na month--2 months actually--when the bound and bludgeoned bodies of \ntheir mother, their older brother and their mother's boyfriend were \nfound at their rural home. This man is now charged with three \nadditional murders and the kidnaping of two children that he held and \nsexually abused for a number of months.\n  Dylan's remains were later located, and Shasta Groene, the young \ngirl, was spotted in a Denny's restaurant by a sharp-eyed waitress who \ncalled the police, and she was saved.\n  This case is an example of why there must be a national registry.\n  Dru's law, which I introduced, has three components. One is the \ncreation of a national registry of sex offenders. The underlying \nlegislation improves on that by not only requiring the national \nregistry but also standardizing the information that will be in the \nnational registry.\n  Second, Dru's law requires that when a violent, high-risk sex \noffender is about to be released from incarceration, the local \nauthorities must be notified, the local States attorney must be \nnotified. There is such a high risk to the population of this high-risk \noffender being released that perhaps there is cause to seek additional \ncivil incarceration, civil commitment, but they can't do that if they \ndon't know about the impending release.\n\n  In fact, when a high-risk offender is released from prison, they \ncan't just say: So long, good luck. That is exactly what happens in too \nmany cases.\n  Martha Stewart is thrown in jail. They put Martha in jail for 6 \nmonths, and when she gets out of Federal prison, she gets out of \nFederal prison wearing an ankle bracelet, an electronic bracelet that \nallows law enforcement to track her whereabouts.\n  I can give you an example of a very violent sex offender let out of \nprison with no maintenance, no monitoring, no electronic bracelet, \njust: So long, see you later; you served your time. Yes, we will see \nthem again when they create another violent crime, another rape, \nanother murder, another abduction. That is why I support passing this \nkind of legislation.\n  This legislation is going to save lives. Again I ask the question, \nand it is so fundamental: If we send Martha Stewart home with an \nelectronic bracelet on her ankle, we can't do that to violent sex \noffenders when the psychiatrists at the institute of incarceration have \nsaid, ``We believe this person to be at high risk for real offending''?\n  Nearly three-quarters of the violent sex offenders are going to \nrepeat that offense when released from prison. We know that from \nstatistics. Do we have an obligation to protect children? The answer \nis, you bet we do, and it is long past the time. That is why this \nlegislation is so very important.\n  As I said when I started, there is so much here that is partisan in \nthis Chamber and the other Chamber, and there is so much that swirls \naround all of us in politics that we don't like very much about today. \nBut there are times when we do things that will make a difference, and \nwe do things working together, Republicans and Democrats. This is one \nof those moments of which we can be proud.\n  Senator Hatch and Senator Biden did a wonderful job. They mentioned \ntheir staffs, and that is important. It is always the case that \npoliticians take the bows, but it is important to understand that staff \nplays a very significant role in helping us write legislation, do the \nresearch to get it correct and get it passed.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I especially say to the parents of Dru \nSjodin: I believe that in honor of her memory we have, in this \nlegislation, done something significant. Section 120 is the Dru Sjodin \nnational sex offender public Web site. We create the three elements in \nDru's law in this legislation, and I believe, in her memory, we will \nsave other lives.\n  There are many parents out there today who have lost children, some \nto the horror of abduction by sexual predators. If this legislation \nwill--and I believe it will--prevent others from experiencing that \nhorror, and if this legislation will--and I believe it will--save \nchildren, then we will have done significant work here tonight. It is \nperhaps little noticed by some. We don't have on legislation of this \ntype perhaps filled Chambers and substantial attention to it, but while \nit is perhaps little known publicly, what transpires here in the Senate \ntonight will have a significant influence on the future of children in \nthis country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia speak next, but also after him, the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas and then the distinguished Senator \nfrom Washington, Ms. Cantwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise this evening in strong support of \nthe Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006. I commend \nSenator Hatch for his steadfast leadership, his wisdom, and \nperseverance in finally getting this measure to the floor for a vote. \nIt is long overdue.\n  I have always believed that one of the very top, most important \nresponsibilities of government at the Federal, State, or, for that \nmatter, the local level is the safety and security of our people, \nparticularly the most vulnerable people in our society--our children.\n  When I was Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, I made the \nprotection of the people of Virginia, including our children, our top \npriority. We worked with the legislature to abolish the lenient, \ndishonest parole system in Virginia that was releasing criminals after \nserving as little as one-fifth of their sentence. We instituted truth \nin sentencing in Virginia, and by doing that, when you read in the \nnewspaper or see in the news that a felon has gotten a 20-year \nsentence, he is serving 20 years, not 4 or 5 years to come back out and \nprey upon innocent law-abiding citizens again.\n  Clearly, the abolition of parole, truth in sentencing, and longer \nsentences for\n\n[[Page S8018]]\n\nfelons has made Virginia safer. The crime rates are down, and there are \ntens of thousands of people who will not be victims of crime.\n  I am going to talk about Adam Walsh, but there are a lot of other \nvictims of crimes. I remember when we were trying to get the \nlegislature and people behind the abolition of parole and truth in \nsentencing, listening to the stories of loved ones, of parents who \nwould tell their stories, of people released early and where they have \npreyed upon, killed, or raped again.\n  I will always remember a lady talking about being raped, and then \nright after her, another woman was talking about being raped again, a \nsecond time, by that same person. That rapist was released early.\n  I remember talking about a police officer with young children. The \npolice officer was killed on Father's Day in Richmond by someone \nreleased early. The story of a young person working in the bakery in \nRichmond who was killed by someone released early. The story of a \nmother talking about a violent assault and then the smothering with a \npillow of her daughter, and then having to go back to the parole board \nto recount why that criminal, that murderer, should not be released \nonce again.\n\n  Before I became Governor in Virginia, pedophiles were serving an \naverage of 3\\1/2\\ years in prison. Now, with the abolition of parole, \nand truth in sentencing, their sentences are 26 years rather than 3\\1/\n2\\ years. Not surprisingly, there are now fewer victims of crime in the \nCommonwealth of Virginia. However, there continue to be child predators \nwho lurk in the shadows of our society.\n  Studies show that there are more than 550,000 registered sex \noffenders in the United States, and there are an estimated 100,000 sex \noffenders who are missing from the system. Loopholes in this current \nsystem have allowed some sexual predators to evade law enforcement and \nplace our children at risk. That is why the national registry aspect of \nthis bill is so important.\n  Some may wonder, why is there such a focus on sex offenders? Why is \nthere such a focus on pedophiles and sex offenders and rapists? The \nreason is, if you look at the statistics--and it is not unique to \nVirginia; it is the way it is across this country--the highest \nrecidivist rate, or the highest repeat offender rate of any crime--even \nhigher than murderers, even higher than armed robbers--is sex \noffenders. That is why it is so important we have the registry. When \nsomeone is caught, first, they are getting a long sentence, and the \nbest way to protect people is having these sex offenders behind bars \nrather than lurking in a parking garage or trying to lure young \nchildren. That is why the focus on sexual predators is so important, in \nthat they have the highest repeat offender rate.\n  Now, these days, child predators have increased their ability to \ninflict harm on our children by exploiting new communications \ntechnologies, including the Internet. Please understand: I believe the \nInternet is the greatest invention since the Gutenberg press for the \ndissemination of information and ideas. It is a wonderful tool. And \never since I have been in the Senate, I have been working to make sure \nthat avaricious State and local tax commissars don't impose 18-percent \ntaxes on the Internet in monthly charges. We don't want the Internet \nmonthly bills to look like a telephone bill. Ron Wyden from Oregon has \nbeen a good ally on this.\n  But the Internet also can create new opportunities for criminals, \nespecially child predators. It is vitally important that we as parents \nand as elected leaders take the necessary steps to make the Internet as \nsafe as possible for our children, as safe as possible for our children \nwhen they are at home, as safe as possible for them at schools, as well \nas in libraries.\n  I recently introduced a bill called the Internet Tax \nNondiscrimination Act. This bill makes permanent the Internet tax \nmoratorium, which is scheduled to expire next year. This measure also \nincreases the ability of parents to protect their children from \nInternet predators. In fact, this is still law today. We want to keep \nthis going.\n  In our bill, we impose a responsibility on Internet service providers \nto offer customers filtering technology. The ISPs, or Internet service \nproviders, need to limit access to material that would be harmful to \nminors. This feature will create a powerful, and does create a \npowerful, financial incentive for ISPs to provide the filtering \ntechnology that parents need. Once parents are empowered with this \ntechnology, I guarantee you they will use it to protect their young \nsons and daughters. I am pleased the Senate Commerce Committee approved \nthis bill as part of the telecom reform bill on a vote of 19 to 3.\n  However, we as a legislative body have much more work to do, \nespecially when it comes to increasing penalties on Internet predators, \nby giving law enforcement officials the tools they need to catch \nInternet predators and convict them. This is a key reason I have signed \non as a cosponsor of the Adam Walsh Act. This legislation is vitally \nneeded. As I said, it should have been passed many years ago. This \nlegislation honors the memory of a 6-year-old boy named Adam Walsh who \nwas kidnapped and murdered nearly 25 years ago. This bill also \nrecognizes the tireless efforts of his parents, John and Reve Walsh, \nwho have been outstanding advocates for children all across America, in \nmaking sure we have some common sense when we are combating violent \ncriminals.\n  The Adam Walsh Act--and I want to focus on one title--this bill in \ntitle 7 includes what is called the Internet Safety Act, sets out \nseveral provisions that will dramatically increase Internet safety, \nincluding tough new penalties for child exploitation enterprises and \nrepeat sex offenders. This title also creates a new crime--and this is \nimportant--a new crime for embedding words or digital images on to the \nsource code of a Web site with the intent to deceive a person into \nviewing this obscenity. This is vitally important for all people. I \ntell you, it is important for families and children. This section is \ngoing to help stop pornographers from tricking children into visiting \ntheir sites with words that are designed to attract innocent young \npeople.\n  The Internet safety provisions in this measure also fund Federal \nprosecution resources, including 200 new Assistant U.S. Attorney \npositions to help prosecute persons for offenses related to sexual \nexploitation of children, and 45 more computer forensic examiners. \nThese are the experts who will be helpful within the regional computer \nforensic laboratories in the Department of Justice. They include 10 \nmore Internet Crimes Against Children task forces. These are also \nimportant. There is some good work being done in Bedford County, \nVirginia, in between Lynchburg and Roanoke. The sheriff, Mike Brown, in \nBedford County has instituted Operation Blue Ridge Thunder which works \non this, but the State and local folks can certainly use the assistance \nand help of the forensic experts and U.S. attorneys. After all, a lot \nof this is across State lines. All of these resources are absolutely \nnecessary for the investigation and the prosecution of child sex \noffenses.\n  The Internet safety provisions in this bill also expand the civil \nremedy available to children who have been sexually abused and \nexploited.\n  This is vitally important, commonsense legislation that is going to \nprotect and, indeed, it is going to save lives. It is perfect that we \npass a bill named after Adam Walsh, a child who lost his life at age 6 \nto a child predator. It can be Adam Walsh, but to all the parents who \nare out there who lost a young child to a sexual predator, it can be \ntheir name put in here as well. The parents of Adam Walsh have \ndedicated their lives to making sure there are not other parents \ngrieving with the loss of their son or their daughter. Adam's spirit \nlives on and the inspiration for action is in this measure, action that \nwill save lives. More children will be able to grow up with the \ninnocence they deserve and the safety they deserve, thanks to the \nefforts of Adam Walsh's parents and also the wisdom, on a bipartisan \nbasis, of the Senate not to dawdle, but to act. I commend the Senate \nfor acting, particularly those in the committee. I am honored to be a \ncosponsor, and I look forward to the passage of this act, the signing \nby the President, and the protection of children all across America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I too rise to support the Adam Walsh Child\n\n[[Page S8019]]\n\nProtection and Safety Act of 2006. This act represents landmark, \nbipartisan legislation to protect the most vulnerable among us: our \nchildren. Over the last several months, the House and the Senate met, \nnegotiated, and finally reached agreement on this important measure.\n  I want to note and, in doing so, commend the tremendous leadership \nChairman Specter and Senator Hatch, our immediate past chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, and their respective staffs, as well as the \nHouse Judiciary Committee chairman, Jim Sensenbrenner and his staff, \nfor all their tireless dedication to this legislation. Many people have \ndevoted time and effort to see this bill through, ensuring that we do \neverything within our power to protect our children.\n  The crimes of child abuse and child exploitation are astounding but, \nunfortunately, all too prevalent. The recent wave of child abductions \nin this country demonstrates the need for this type of response from \nthe Congress. There is only one way to deal with those who prey on \nchildren: They must be caught sooner, punished longer, and watched \ncloser than they are today.\n  Before I came to the Senate, I was honored to serve as the chief law \nenforcement officer of the State of Texas as Texas attorney general. \nThere, I instituted a new specialized unit known as the Texas Internet \nBureau which was designed to coordinate and direct efforts to fight \nInternet crimes such as fraud, child pornography, and address privacy \nconcerns, among others. As others here have noted, the Internet is a \nremarkable tool which has revolutionized the way we live, the way we \ncommunicate, and the way we receive information. The problem is, \nthough, there is a dark underbelly to the Internet, and the Texas \nInternet Bureau was designed to specifically identify Internet \npredators who were then caught, prosecuted, convicted, and taken off \nthe streets. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work with my \ncolleagues in the Senate to help continue on this important initiative \nand to make it available to more and more of our children and, thus, to \nmake America a safer place for our children to grow up.\n  I want to take a moment to highlight another very important \nparticipant in these negotiations who has been noted and praised for \nhis efforts, but I think we can't say enough to recognize his \ncontribution. John Walsh has a long-standing commitment to fighting for \nchild victims and measures to protect children across this country. As \nhas been recounted, his son Adam Walsh was kidnapped from a mall in \nFlorida and murdered in 1981. Since that day, John Walsh has dedicated \nhis life to helping victims of crime, and he has been enormously \nsuccessful and influential in doing so. It is only appropriate that \nthis bill honors the inspiration he has given to us all in the life of \nhis son Adam Walsh in the process.\n  As many of you know, John Walsh is the host of ``America's Most \nWanted'' and has spent a lot of time and effort working on this bill. \nThis is not the first time he has invested his efforts and expertise in \nhelping Congress address child crime legislation. In the previous \nCongress, we passed legislation that included the Code Adam Act, which \nrequired Federal buildings to establish procedures for locating a child \nwho is missing in Federal buildings.\n  The title of this current bill appropriately honors Mr. Walsh's \nefforts, and I am told the President will sign the bill, if we pass it, \non July 27, marking the 25th year since the day Adam was abducted.\n  I do not pretend to understand the pain and trauma the Walsh family \nor others have had to endure as a result of these terrible crimes \nagainst children. But I am eternally grateful for the way John Walsh \nhas used this pain and this trauma to improve the lives of other people \nand to ensure we take every step within our power to protect our \nchildren against like crimes committed against Adam Walsh.\n  I wish to take a second to highlight other important measures \ncontained in the bill which will enhance existing laws, enhance \ninvestigative tools, criminal penalties, and child crime resources in a \nvariety of ways. This bill requires sex offenders to register and, in \nthe case of the most serious offenders, to do so for up to the length \nof their entire lives. It requires them to report in person at least \nonce each year to update personal information and to take a new \nphotograph. It requires public posting for public access on the \nInternet of information about sex offenders so it is widely available, \nand so parents can take steps necessary to protect their children. It \nforces States to comply with this program or, I should say, persuades \nthem to comply with the program by linking participation to Byrne grant \nfunding, and it punishes with imprisonment up to 10 years those who \nfail to register, and if they commit a violent crime while \nunregistered, they can be punished for up to 30 years consecutive to \nany underlying conviction. It requires the Attorney General of the \nUnited States to create Project Safe Childhood, which will integrate \nFederal, State, and local efforts to prosecute the crime of child \nexploitation. It increases punishments for any crime of violence \nagainst a child, and authorizes grants to States to implement these \nimportant programs, and provides them grants to do so.\n  It also includes many of the provisions of the Internet Safety Act \nwhich I cosponsored with Senator Jon Kyl and others which, among other \nthings, creates a new crime outlawing child exploitation enterprises, \nand would imprison for a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years those \nwho act in concert to commit at least three separate violations of \nFederal child pornography, sex trafficking, or sexual abuse laws \nagainst multiple child victims. It also enacts various other important \nprovisions, including making the failure to register as a sex offender \na deportable offense for aliens and preventing sex offenders from \ntaking advantage of our immigration laws.\n\n  This is one of those fine times in the U.S. Congress where we have \ncome together on a bipartisan basis to do something that rises above \npartisanship and is enormously significant in terms of improving our \nquality of life and protecting those who are most vulnerable among us. \nThis Congress continues to act on measures that benefit our Nation and \nprotect our children. It has long been said that societies are \nultimately judged on how they treat their elderly and their young. This \nbill is an important step toward improving the safety of those who are \nour youngest and most vulnerable.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to specifically express my \ngratitude to the many dedicated staff who worked tirelessly on this \nbill for some time, including Matthew Johnson and Lynden Melmed from my \nown staff. Additionally, I would like to thank the following staff:\n\n       Allen Hicks, Mike O'Neill, Matt Miner, Todd Braunstein, \n     Brett Tolman, Lisa Owings, Bruce Artim, Ken Valentine, Tom \n     Jipping, Dave Turk, Bradley Hayes, Joe Matal, Nicole \n     Gustafson, James Galyean, Amy Blankenship, Jane Treat, Sharon \n     Beth Kristal, Julie Katzman, Noah Bookbinder, Christine \n     Leonard, Lara Flint, Marianne Upton, Preet Baharara, Melanie \n     Looney, Anna Mitchell, Gabriel Adler, Alea Brown, Bradley \n     Schreiber, Mike Volkov, Sean McLaughlin, Bobby Vassar, and \n     Greg Barnes.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Adam Walsh \nChild Protection and Safety Act. I thank the Senator from Utah for his \nleadership on this legislation over the last several years, and I thank \nhis staff for their hard work and perseverance in pushing this \nlegislation to the Senate floor tonight.\n  Last June, the entire Nation was horrified by the kidnapping and \nmurders of the Groene family and the tragic crimes upon little Shasta \nGroene.\n  Joseph Duncan was a convicted sex offender who beat Brenda Groene; \nher 13-year-old son, Slade; and her boyfriend, Mark McKenzie to death. \nTheir bodies were found in their home in Idaho on May 16, 2005. The \nkillings captured the national headlines and prompted a massive search \nfor the two Groene children, 8-year-old Shasta and her 9-year-old \nbrother, Dylan.\n  Six weeks later, on July 2, restaurant workers in Idaho recognized \nShasta and called the police. Dylan's remains were found later in \nwestern Montana.\n  This did not have to happen.\n  In 1980, Duncan was convicted of rape in Washington State. He was \nsentenced to 20 years in prison and began his sentence in a treatment \nprogram. After he was terminated from the program, he\n\n[[Page S8020]]\n\nserved his sentence in prison until he was released on parole in 1994.\n  In 2000, he moved to Fargo, where he registered with the North Dakota \nSex Offender Registry, but before long he had moved again and both the \nNorth Dakota and Washington State registries lost track of him.\n  In April of 2005, a Minnesota judge released Duncan on bail after he \nhad been charged with child molestation.\n  Duncan promptly skipped town.\n  Minnesota issued a warrant for his arrest that May because he had not \nregistered as a sex offender in that State, but by that time it was too \nlate.\n  On May 16, the Groene family was found dead and it wasn't until July \n2 that Shasta was recovered.\n  Joseph Duncan was essentially lost by three States. He moved from \nState to State to avoid capture.\n  No one knew where he was nor even how to look for him.\n  I say again, this did not have to happen.\n  There is no worse crime than a crime against a child, and one crime \nagainst a child is too many. That is why I have cosponsored the Child \nProtection Safety Act, because we need better information. We need a \nbetter system to keep that information accurate, and we need better \nstandards to keep that system from breaking down when we need it most. \nThe Senate must pass this bipartisan legislation to improve the \nnational sex offender database, to link State tracking systems, and to \nprevent sex offenders from escaping and moving to other States.\n  Today there is far too much disparity among State registration \nrequirements and notification obligations for sex offenders. Yes, there \nis already a National Registry, but it is based on often outdated \nlistings from all 50 States. Worse, there are currently no incentives \nfor offenders to provide accurate information, which helps to undermine \nthe system.\n  Child sex offenders have exploited this stunning lack of uniformity, \nand the consequences have been tragic. Twenty percent of the Nation's \n560,000 sex offenders are ``lost'' because State offender registry \nprograms are not coordinated well enough.\n  We take these numbers very seriously in Washington State. In \nWashington State we have over 19,000 registered sex offenders and \nkidnaping offenders; more than 2,900 Washingtonians are currently \nincarcerated for these sex crimes. But we must be tough on these \ncriminals because the national statistics are staggering.\n  One in five girls is estimated to be a victim of sexual assault. One \nin ten boys is estimated to be a victim. Only 35 percent of these cases \nare ever reported to the police. That is why this spring, Washington \nState passed a tough law that is new in mandating that sex offenders \nfrom other States must register with authorities within 3 days upon \nmoving to Washington State. The previous law had been 30 days.\n  We also established a minimum sentence for certain sex crimes and \ntougher registration rules. Back in 1990 we were the first State to \nenact a sexual predator involuntary commitment law that ensures \npredators who are about to be released after serving their time can be \nprevented from being released if mental health officials believe that \nthey will endanger the community.\n  This law has become a national model for other States to follow. \nToday, these sexual predators are housed on McNeil Island where they \ncannot hurt our children.\n  Here is what I know. Local law enforcement needs the tools and \ninformation that this legislation will give them to defend our \nchildren. It will help us close the gap between Federal and State sex \noffender registration and notification programs. Every State needs to \nupdate one another and the national registry in real time, and we need \nto recognize that tough punishment today will prevent terrible costs \ntomorrow.\n  We must keep our communities safe, and I know that is why the Senate \nis going to act on this legislation tonight. The Adam Walsh Protection \nand Safety Act creates this registry on a national level that is so \nlong overdue. It provides strong, practical tools for law enforcement \nThe new registry will expand the scope and duration of sex offender \nregistration and notification requirements. It will keep track of all \nsex offender information--addresses, employment, vehicle, and other \nrelated information. And, as my colleague from North Dakota talked \nabout, with his hard work, it also has a national sex offender Web site \nregistry, the new Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Web site, so that \nevery American can stay informed.\n  Now the public will be able to search for sex offender information by \ngeographic radius and zip code, and the bill also, as my colleague from \nTexas just mentioned, increases the penalties for violent sex crimes \nagainst America's children.\n  It requires that the sex offenders register prior to their release \nfrom prison or supervised programs.\n  America needs this legislation. I am so proud of my colleagues in \njoining in a bipartisan effort to give law enforcement the tools they \nneed to protect our families and our communities. Let's give them the \ninformation and the resources they need to get tough with sex \noffenders. Let's pass the Adam Walsh Child Protection Safety Act to not \nonly honor John Walsh and his family, but also for all those who have \nbeen victims of this hideous crime, and to show that we are willing to \nwork together to be aggressive in taking action and helping to make \nAmerica safe for our children.\n  I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Adam Walsh \nChild Protection Safety Act of 2006, H.R. 4472. I say that as an \nArkansan because I know people in Arkansas want to protect our \nchildren. I say that as a former attorney general because I know we \nworked with John Walsh and other people who dealt with missing and \nexploited children all over the country. We tried to be as active as \npossible in the attorney general's office in Arkansas. Thirdly, and \nmost important, I say it as a father because I want my children \nprotected like everybody else here and everybody around the country who \nwants their children protected.\n  Senator Frist made a statement a few moments ago about child \npredators on the Internet. It is a real problem. It is something we in \nthe Congress are trying to deal with in this legislation. It is \nsomething we need to keep focused on even though we passed this \nlegislation. We need to keep focused on it so we can make sure that \nwhat we have on the books works. I am very proud of the Senate tonight \nfor considering this. I am very proud of the Congress for the way they \nhave handled this and moved this through the process.\n  I also wish to say another word. There is a program around the \ncountry called Code Adam. Actually, an Arkansas company started this--\nWal-Mart--several years ago, where they have a little blue sticker on \nthe door of every Wal-Mart. They do a Code Adam procedure in the store \nif a child is reported missing in the store. I cannot tell you how many \nchildren have been saved in Wal-Marts but also in other retail stores \nthat use Code Adam. Wal-Mart has given this idea to anybody who wants \nto do it. It has worked and it has probably saved dozens, if not \nhundreds, of children. It is named after Adam Walsh because he was \nabducted and murdered several years ago.\n  Lastly, my friend, Colleen Nick, whom I met through my time in the \nattorney general's office in Arkansas--her daughter Morgan Nick was \nabducted from a ballfield in Alma, AR, several years ago when Morgan \nwas about 5 years old. Colleen has devoted her life to missing children \nissues. So I am proud that this passed tonight for Morgan and Colleen \nand the Nick family because I have talked to them and spent a lot of \ntime with the Nicks. I know the void it creates in a parent's life and \nin a family's life when one of their children is missing and never \nfound.\n  Mr. President, I am very proud to support this legislation. I believe \nit makes America better, stronger, and it puts some teeth in the law \nthat we need. It is something of which we can all be proud.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nAdam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of this bill and am even prouder that we have been able to \nwork across party lines and in both Houses to come up with a bill that \nwe all can support and that will genuinely help protect our children \nfrom sexual predators.\n\n[[Page S8021]]\n\n  My commendations and heartfelt sympathy go out to John and Reve \nWalsh, Mark Lunsford, and all the other parents and loved ones of \nchildren who were taken so violently from those who loved them so \ndearly. Without the tireless efforts of these folks, this bill might \nnot be on the floor here today, as we near the 25-year mark of the \ndisappearance and murder of Adam Walsh.\n  The urgency of passing this legislation is clear. The murders of \nJessica Lunsford, Sara Lunde, Tiffany Souers, and Jetseta Gage, who was \nfrom my home State of Iowa, have been thoroughly covered in the news in \nrecent times. Each of these murders was committed by a repeat sex \noffender. These cases should open our eyes to the necessity of passing \na bill that will protect children from monsters who commit these crimes \nand ensure that those who do commit the crimes will receive tougher \npenalties.\n  As I mentioned, Jetseta Marrie Gage was from my home State of Iowa. I \nwould like to take a moment to talk about the beautiful 10-year-old \ngirl who was sexually assaulted and murdered last year.\n  On March 24, 2005, Jetseta went missing from her home. Within 12 \nhours of her disappearance, even before a body had been found, law \nenforcement officials took Roger Bentley into custody.\n  Bentley had been previously convicted for committing lascivious acts \nwith a minor. Unfortunately, this man only served a little over 1 year \nin prison for his previous sex crime conviction. Two days later, due to \na tip received by a woman responding to the Amber Alert, Jetseta's body \nwas found stuffed in a cabinet in an abandoned mobile home. She had \nbeen sexually molested and suffocated with a plastic bag. I can't help \nbut wonder whether Jetseta would still be alive today had her killer \nreceived stricter penalties for his first offense. It breaks my heart \nto hear about cases like this, but it is even more disheartening when \nyou know that it might have been prevented with adequate sentencing and \nthat hers is just one tragic story in a long list of horrific crimes \ncommitted every year.\n  Child sex offenders are the most heinous of all criminals. I can \nhonestly tell you that I would just as soon lock up all the child \nmolesters and child pornography makers and murderers in this country \nand throw away the key. As it should all of us, the thought of what \nthese predators do to our innocent children literally makes me sick to \nmy stomach. The thought that we might not do what we could to deter \nthem but also to prevent the same people from committing the same \ncrimes against other children is unacceptable. According to a study \nfunded by the Department of Justice, 5.3 percent of sex offenders were \nrearrested within 3 years following their release for another sex \ncrime. Also, compared to non-sex offenders released from State prisons, \nreleased sex offenders were four times more likely to be rearrested for \na sex crime. Even more troubling, according to several federally funded \nstudies, child molesters have an even higher rate of rearrest than \nrapists.\n  Three years ago, we passed the PROTECT Act, a bill I worked on with \nmy colleagues to provide the judiciary with the necessary tools to \nensure that our children and grandchildren grow up in a safe community, \nfree from child predators. This bill complements the process we started \nwith the PROTECT Act, and adds much needed additional protections for \nchildren and for our communities.\n  The bill before us today includes parts of the Jetseta Gage \nPrevention and Deterrence of Crimes Against Children Act, a bill that I \nintroduced last year to strengthen penalties for criminals who commit \nsex offenses against children. It ensures that those who commit heinous \ncrimes against our children are appropriately punished and that anyone \nthinking of committing similar crimes will think twice about the \nrepercussions. The bill increases penalties for sexual offenses against \nchildren, including sexual abuse, murder, kidnapping, sex trafficking, \nand various activities relating to the production and dissemination of \nchild pornography.\n  This bill goes far beyond these penalty increases, however. It \nestablishes sex offender registration and notification requirements, \nessential to aid parents in monitoring their children's environments. \nIt strengthens child pornography prevention laws and sets up grants, \nstudies, and other programs for the safety of children and communities. \nIt delves into Internet crimes, an area that is becoming increasingly \nimportant in light of the dangers posed to children and the lack of \nknowledge on the part of parents, which hampers their ability to \nprotect their children. My good friend from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, \nintroduced the bill this section is based on and which I cosponsored.\n  As the elected representatives of the American people, our foremost \nduty is to protect those who cannot protect themselves. Child rapes and \nmurders are now being reported on our news programs on a regular basis. \nWe have the power to prevent so many of these crimes by creating \nstronger deterrents and letting parents know where these sex offenders \nlurk after they are released. When crimes are committed, the least we \ncan do is ensure that the rapists and murderers won't get the \nopportunity to hurt another child.\n  It is a tragedy that it took so many stories like those of Adam \nWalsh, Jetseta Gage, and Jessica Lunsford for a law of this nature to \nbe proposed. I strongly believe that a vote for this bill can save the \nlives of children in the future. We have an obligation as legislators \nto protect our citizenry. We have an obligation as adults to protect \nour youth. We have an obligation as parents to protect our children. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in doing just that by voting in favor of \nthis bill.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the Congress will soon pass \nimportant legislation that will better protect children around the \ncountry from those who seek them harm. The Adam Walsh Child Protection \nand Safety Act, H.R. 4472, named after the son of John and Reve Walsh \nwho was killed in Florida almost 25 years ago, is the toughest and most \ncomprehensive sex offender bill in recent years.\n  This legislation includes a number of changes to safeguard children, \nincluding tougher sentences for crimes committed against children, a \npublicly accessible national database of sex offenders, and a Federal \nrequirement for convicted sex offenders to register their locations \nwith law enforcement officials. The bill also includes a provision, \nwhich I authored, to track released sex offenders.\n  Sadly, events of the recent past highlight the need for us to know \nthe location of convicted sexual offenders if they are released back \ninto our communities.\n  In my State of Florida, two young girls, Jessica Lunsford and Sarah \nLunde, were both murdered by convicted sex offenders within weeks of \neach other in 2005.\n  Jessica Lunsford of Homosassa, FL, was a 9-year-old girl who was \nabducted from her home, raped, and then buried alive by a convicted sex \noffender who lived 150 feet from her home. Law enforcement had lost \ntrack of him and they did not know that he worked at the school that \nJessica attended, despite his being a registered sex offender. A few \nweeks later, 13-year-old Sarah Lunde of Ruskin, FL, was murdered by her \nmother's ex-boyfriend. He is also a convicted sex offender.\n  In response to these tragic events, Florida enacted a law that \nprovides tougher sentences for child sex offenders and aids law \nenforcement in effectively monitoring those sex offenders. The law \nrequires sex offenders, released back into our communities, to wear a \ndevice to allow authorities to track them via a global positioning \nsystem.\n  My provision in the Adam Walsh Act provides Jessica Lunsford and \nSarah Lunde grants to aid States and local government in purchasing \nelectronic monitoring systems, such as global positioning systems, that \nwill provide law enforcement with real time information on the \nwhereabouts of sex offenders released from prison to within 10 feet of \ntheir location. Law enforcement will be able to restrict the movements \nof sex offenders by programming these systems to alert authorities if a \nsex offender goes to a park, amusement park, elementary school or other \nareas determined to be off limits. The ankle bracelets used to monitor \ntheir movements are tamperproof and will alert law enforcement in the \nevent that an offender has removed it so law enforcement can \nimmediately act to apprehend the offender.\n\n[[Page S8022]]\n\n  The grants will provide a total of $15 million to State and local \ngovernment to help implement laws in order to get tougher on sex \noffenders released back into their communities with electronic \nmonitoring technology. The bill will provide for $5 million in grants \nfor fiscal years 2007 through 2009. The bill then directs the Attorney \nGeneral to provide a report to Congress assessing the effectiveness of \nthe program and making recommendations as to future funding levels.\n  In the United States, there are an estimated 380,000 registered sex \noffenders, although thousands have disappeared, according to \nauthorities. We have over 30,000 of these sex offenders in the State of \nFlorida. Laws, such as the one in Florida, and the Adam Walsh Act, \nwhich will be passed by Congress, are necessary to protect our \nchildren. I believe it is important that the Federal Government be \nappropriately supportive of State and local governments that are \naddressing this problem. To be effective, tough laws on sexual \npredators of children must be properly funded, and I believe these \ntough laws being passed by Federal and State legislatures are worth \nproperly funding when they will protect our children.\n  Children are our most important treasure and protecting them is one \nof our most sacred responsibilities. I hope this bill will serve as a \nliving memorial to all the children and serve as some comfort to their \nfamilies. I hope the Jessica Lunsford and Sarah Lunde grants provided \nin this bill will allow law enforcement to help prevent other families \nfrom suffering similar tragedies.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today the Senate passed the Adam Walsh \nChild Protection and Safety Act of 2006, which will help prevent the \nchild exploitation by, among other things, creating a national system \nfor the registration of sex offenders. Included in this legislation is \na very important provision that I authored with Senator Isakson called \nMasha's Law. Masha's Law is named after a very brave 13-year-old girl--\na Russian orphan who was adopted by a Pennsylvania man at the age of 5 \nand sexually exploited from the moment she was placed in his care. \nMasha suffered unspeakable atrocities in the hands of her abusive \nfather, a man with a history of child exploitation. She continues to \nsuffer as photographs of this abuse, taken by her father and posted on \nthe Internet, are downloaded every day. Yet Masha does not cower in \nfear. She is taking a stand. She is using her experiences to \ndemonstrate why the law must change. And it is because of her that we \nare now closing unacceptable loopholes in our child exploitation laws.\n  Masha's photographs are among the most commonly downloaded images of \nchild pornography. Law enforcement estimates that 80 percent of child \npornography collections contain at least one of her photographs. In \nfact, it was the high volume of images being distributed by this one \nindividual that raised suspicions and led law enforcement officials to \nthe home of Masha's adopted father. While he is currently in jail \naccused of sexual abuse and facing Federal charges, the damage to Masha \ncontinues every day as her pictures continue to be downloaded. Masha \nhas sought compensation through a little used provision in the Child \nAbuse Victims' Rights Act of 1986 that provides statutory damages for \nthe victims of sexual exploitation. Nothing will ever compensate Masha \nfor the horrific experiences she has had, but the penalties provided in \ncurrent law are embarrassingly low--they are one-third of the penalty \nfor downloading music illegally.\n  According to the Center for Missing and Exploited Children, child \npornography has become a multibillion dollar Internet business. With \nthe increasingly sophisticated technology of digital media, child \npornography has become easier to produce, transfer, and purchase. We \nare not doing enough to deter those who post and download child \npornography.\n  Masha's Law would do two things; first it would increase the civil \nstatutory damages available to a victim of child exploitation; and \nsecond, it would ensure that victims of child pornography whose images \nremain in circulation after they have turned 18 can still recover when \nthose images are downloaded. The injuries do not cease to exist simply \nbecause the victim has turned 18. They continue and so should the \npenalties.\n  These changes are long overdue. I am proud that the Senate has passed \nthis important legislation, and I am grateful to Masha for having the \ncourage to stand up and make her voice heard.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Adam \nWalsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, which provides law \nenforcement officers with several important tools to protect our \nchildren. In the past three decades, we have all seen and heard about \nthe many tragic cases of children being assaulted and killed by sex \noffenders. These are absolutely horrifying events, and as legislators, \nwe have an obligation to do all we can to prevent such crimes in the \nfuture. We need to improve and enhance sex offender registration and \ntracking laws and increase penalties for those who violate them, which \nthis act will accomplish.\n  There are several prongs to this act, which is what will make it \nsuccessful. The core of this bill establishes a national sex offender \nregistry. Although each State has a registry, there are no uniform \nstandards. There is no easy way to access information from different \njurisdictions. This act creates a uniform Federal standard which \ndivides offenders into tiers, depending upon the offense for which they \nwere convicted. It establishes registration guidelines for each tier, \nincluding how long a person would need to be registered and how often \nhe or she must come in for a personal verification of the registration \ninformation. The act also creates community notification requirements \nand will make it a felony for sex offenders to fail to register and \nupdate their information on a regular basis. The Dru Sjodin National \nSex Offender Public Web site will allow the public to search for \ninformation on sex offenders by ZIP Code and geographic radius.\n  All of these changes will help make our tracking laws more effective \nand will allow parents and members of the local community to be \nvigilant about the potential dangers of sex offenders in their \nneighborhoods.\n  But before we can put a predator can appear on the registry, he needs \nto be caught and prosecuted. The Adam Walsh Act includes urgently \nneeded resources to assist law enforcement in these endeavors. This act \nestablishes 10 new task forces dealing with Internet crimes against \nchildren, 45 new computer forensic examiners to deal exclusively with \nchild sexual exploitation, and 200 new Federal prosecutors--all \ndesignated to combat child sexual exploitation.\n  This act also tries to protect children from being victimized in the \nfirst place. It provides grant money for educating parents and children \nabout those who use the Internet to prey upon children. It funds Big \nBrothers and Big Sisters and includes my bill for the reauthorization \nof the Police Athletic Leagues. These two programs provide kids with \nsupervision and role models and mentors who can help protect them from \npredators. In addition, it mandates that potential foster and adoptive \nparents go through a thorough criminal background check before a child \ncan be placed with them.\n  Also incorporated in this bill are aspects of the Internet Safety Act \nwhich I proudly cosponsored. These include establishing new criminal \npenalties to keep up with the constantly increasing level of depravity \namong pedophiles--for example, the child exploitation enterprises \nprovision to prosecute the ``molestation on demand'' child pornographic \nindustry that has sprung up in recent years. Sexual predators of \nchildren are among the worst kind of offenders, and it is only right \nthat there are sentencing enhancements for registered sex offenders who \nreoffend.\n  This is a good piece of legislation. I am pleased so many of my \ncolleagues support it, and I look forward to its pending passage.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in May, the Senate passed the Sex \nOffender Registration and Notification Act to standardize and \nstrengthen registration and monitoring of sex offenders nationwide. \nSince its passage, the House and Senate have worked closely to resolve \ntheir differences and to improve the overall quality of the \nlegislation. The bill before us today contains difficult compromises, \nbut it has achieved that goal.\n\n[[Page S8023]]\n\n  This legislation is critically important to safeguard victims of \nsexual abuse from harm. It will help protect innocent people from \nviolent offenses. It recognizes the victims and all the suffering both \nthey and their families have endured.\n  With this legislation, we are recognizing the loss of Molly Bish from \nWarren, MA. At 16, Molly was abducted from her position as a lifeguard, \nand her family endured terrible uncertainty until her remains were \nfound 3 years later. Molly was a typical teenager who took great joy \nfrom life. Her nickname was Tigger, because she was always on the move. \nShe is survived by her parents, John and Magi Bish; her sister, \nHeather; and her brother, John, Jr., who work every day to keep \nchildren safe, honoring her life and her legacy.\n  With this bill, we also remember with sadness another Massachusetts \nresident, Alexandra Zapp. Ally was 30 years old when she was attacked \nand murdered in a public restroom by a repeat sex offender in \nBridgewater, MA, in 2002. Ally's friends described her as a strong, \nsmart, and independent woman. She had worked at the USA Sailing \nAssociation of Portsmouth, RI, where she was a keelboat training \ncoordinator. Ally is survived by her mother and sister, Andrea and \nCaroline, and her father and stepmother, Ray and Linda. This \nlegislation is dedicated to her memory, along with the memories of \nMolly Bish and the many other victims of terrible crimes.\n  Several changes have been made to this legislation as a result of our \nwork with the House. It is important to make sure that information on \noffenders who pose a potential threat is available to the public at \nlarge, and this bill provides for Internet listing and community \nnotification about such individuals.\n  At the same time, in order for the registry to be effective, it \nshould be targeted toward those who present the highest risk to our \ncommunities. The current version takes a more sweeping approach toward \njuvenile offenders by expanding their registration requirements. The \nSenate bill allowed each State to determine whether a juvenile should \nbe included on the registry. This compromise allows some offenders over \n14 to be included on registries, but only if they have been convicted \nof very serious offenses. For juveniles, the public notification \nprovision in this bill is harsh given their low rate of recidivism, \nwhich is less than 8 percent according to the most recent studies. For \nthis reason, it is especially important that the bill includes funding \nfor treatment of juvenile offenders. These provisions recognize that \njuvenile offenders, who have much lower rates of recidivism and have \nbeen shown to be much more amenable to treatment than their adult \ncounterparts, shouldn't be lumped together with adult offenders.\n  The bill also provides increased funding for programs to prevent \nthese offenses before they occur. It also authorizes funding for sex \noffender treatment and management within the Federal prison system. \nThese provisions will be helpful in reducing the future risks to \nsociety by convicted sex offenders. If Congress is serious about \naddressing this problem, it must commit itself to fully funding the \nlegislation.\n  All States currently have registration requirements for sex \noffenders, but this bill will create a system of national tracking and \naccountability that preserves the ability of individual States to \nprovide additional procedures to assure the accuracy and usefulness of \nthe registries.\n  Massachusetts has a system that works. We are already doing most of \nwhat this bill requires, but our system goes beyond these basic \nrequirements by providing individualized risk assessments of each sex \noffender who goes on the registry. These individual assessments, \ncombined with hearings allowing offenders to challenge their \nclassification, help ensure that States like Massachusetts can provide \nthe highest quality of information on potential threats to the \ncommunity while respecting the tremendous impact that community \nnotification can have on offenders' lives. I am pleased that this \nlegislation respects the right of individual States to innovate in this \narea and does not penalize States who go the extra mile to improve \ntheir registries.\n  For this reason, section 125 of the compromise is very important. \nEach State will face challenges in the implementation of these new \nFederal requirements, and States should not be penalized if exact \ncompliance with the act's requirements would place the State in \nviolation of its constitution or an interpretation of the State's \nconstitution by its highest court.\n  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has concluded that offenders \nare entitled to procedural due process before being classified at a \nparticular risk level and before personal information about them is \ndisseminated to the public. Massachusetts has been vigilant in \nimplementing a comprehensive and effective sex offender registry, and \nit should not lose much needed Federal funding where there is a \ndemonstrated inability to comply with certain provisions of this new \nFederal law.\n  No State should be penalized and lose critical Federal funding for \nlaw enforcement programs as long as reasonable efforts are under way to \nimplement procedures consistent with the purposes of the act. It is \nessential that the Federal Government continue to collaborate and to \nprovide support for State and local governments, including the \nprevention, intervention, and enforcement of antigang and antidrug \nactivities as a result of this bill.\n  At the same time, the new mandatory minimum sentences in the act \naren't justified by any empirical data or sound policy. Mandatory \nminimums prevent prosecutors and judges from doing what they do best--\nmaking individual determinations on sentencing, based on the \ncircumstances of individual cases. With more than 2 million Americans \nin prison or jail--including 12 percent of all African-American men \nbetween the ages of 20 and 34--no one can seriously argue that there is \nan epidemic of leniency in Federal sentencing. This latest batch of \nmandatory minimums undermines more than two decades of legislative work \ndevoted to striking a sensible balance between consistent sentencing \nand the need to provide judges with the discretion to make sure each \nsentence fits the crime.\n  Although it is important to have strong penalties for crimes against \nchildren, I have major reservations about the broad expansion of the \ndeath penalty in this compromised legislation. It is clear that \ncontinued imposition of the death penalty will inevitably lead to the \nwrongful execution of more and more people. Justice Marshall, in \nparticular, wrote powerfully on this issue. He believed that if our \ncitizens knew the truth about the death penalty, ``its disproportionate \nimposition on racial minorities and the poor, its utter failure to \ndeter crime, and the continuing likelihood of executing the innocent,'' \nit would be rejected as morally reprehensible.\n  Last year, the Supreme Court struck down the death penalty for \njuveniles--persons 17 years old or younger. The Court's ruling was \nsignificant. It was long past time to erase that stain from our human \nrights record. The basic injustice of the death penalty is obvious. \nExperience shows that imposition of the death penalty inevitably leads \nto wrongful executions. Many of us are concerned about the racial \ndisparities in the imposition of capital punishment and the wide \ndisparities in the State in its application. The unequal, unfair, \narbitray, and discriminatory use of the death penalty is completely \ncontrary to our Nation's commitment to fairness and equal justice for \nall, and we need to do all we can to correct this fundamental flaw.\n  Finally, the national registry of substantiated cases of child abuse \nin this bill should not be implemented until Congress has a full \nunderstanding of its scope and effectiveness. The proposed registry \nraises serious implementation challenges and could create an additional \nand unnecessary burden for States. Not all States maintain the same \nregistry information, and most States maintain different rules on \ndisclosure. Tribal entities, which are included in this proposed \nregistry, currently maintain no registries at all.\n  I am concerned that this registry raises serious privacy concerns by \nincluding information on cases without the opportunity for due process. \nFor this reason, it is important that the study on establishing data \ncollection standards be completed before such a\n\n[[Page S8024]]\n\nregistry is established. Current standards for inclusion in child abuse \nregistries vary greatly, with some requiring credible evidence and \nothers requiring no standard other than the judgment of the case \nworker.\n  During the most recent reauthorization of the Child Abuse Prevention \nand Treatment Act, we improved current child abuse systems to ensure \nthat law enforcement has the information it needs to pursue and \nprosecute cases.\n  A new provision was added to require States to ``disclose \nconfidential information to any Federal, State, or local government \nentity, or any agent of such entity, which has a need for such \ninformation in order to carry out its responsibilities under law to \nprotect children from abuse and neglect.'' Rather than developing \nadditional registries and reporting requirements, States need Federal \nassistance to effectively carry out their roles and responsibilities \nunder CAPTA. I am concerned that this new registry will have limited \nvalue in improving or standardizing State recordkeeping for child abuse \nand neglect cases.\n  Despite these provisions, I commend the work that has been done on \nthis bill. Without further delay, it is important that we get this bill \nto the President so that it can be signed on July 27th, the 25th \nanniversary of the abduction of Adam Walsh, and to honor all of the \nwork his parents have done in his memory to protect children in \ncommunities across the country.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the foundation of democracy lies in a \ngovernment that reflects the voice of its citizens. The Constitution, \nthe beloved document that chartered our system of government, makes \nthis clear. ``We the people'', are the very first words of our \nConstitution: ``We the people.'' This is no mistake, for our Founders \nsought to create a government that would reflect the will of those who \nsend us here.\n  Voting is the underpinning of our democratic process. In an address \nto Congress, President Lyndon B. Johnson said that, ``In a free land \nwhere men move freely and act freely, the right to vote freely must \nnever be obstructed.'' With the act of casting one's ballot, each \ncitizen has ensured a place in the democratic process, fulfilling the \ncivic responsibility that each and every one of us must safeguard and \ncherish. All citizens deserve this right, and all should utilize it.\n  Like so many worthwhile initiatives, safeguarding the freedoms of \ndemocracy can sometimes exact a heavy toll. Wars have been fought on \nour own soil to ensure these freedoms, and our country's history has \nbeen blemished with the events of a less enlightened time. But even \nthrough strife and toil, our democracy emerged intact, our Republic \nstrengthened by the sacrifices made by the citizens who fought for \nequality and the right to vote.\n  I met yesterday with Mr. James Tolbert, President of the West \nVirginia NAACP, and other members of the West Virginia NAACP \ndelegation. They were here in Washington D.C. as part of a national \neffort to spearhead the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. I was \nproud to assure them of both my cosponsorship of the measure and my \nsupport for the reauthorization.\n  While the various reauthorizations of the Voting Rights Act have \nforged the pathway to the polls for all Americans, the ability to vote \nis but half of the process. Democracy works best when the people are \nvigilant in protecting of their rights, and engage in the electoral \nprocess. Our democracy is strongest when there is free and open access \nto the polls for everyone, and when the people embrace the vote as both \na right and a responsibility.\n  Indeed, the decades that have followed the initial passage of the \nVoting Rights Act have witnessed the progress of our Nation. To \ncontinue in our efforts, we have only to look to past successes for \ninspiration. To be ardent in the defense of our democracy is to \npreserve it for the generations to come.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of \nthe Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006. This bill will \nstrengthen our power to keep America's children safe from sexual \npredators and creates the National Sex Offender Registry, which will \nkeep track of all sex offender information nationwide. It will also \ncreate the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Web site, so that \nevery American will have the ability to search for information on \npotential sexual predators in their own community.\n  I have had a personal interest in children's welfare and child-safety \nissues for many years, predating my time in the Senate, in fact. Before \nbeing elected to this Chamber, I served as judge-executive of Jefferson \nCounty, KY, from 1977 to 1984. Jefferson County contains Louisville, my \nhometown, and the judge-executive position was the county's chief \nexecutive.\n  In 1981, we hosted in Louisville the first-ever national conference \non rescuing missing and exploited children. Ernie Allen, who was on my \nstaff at the time and organized the conference, is today the head of \nthe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. And that \nconference was keynoted by John Walsh. At the time, Mr. Walsh was not \nyet the television fixture and hero to millions of parents he is today \nbut a private citizen whose 6-year-old son, Adam, had been tragically \nkidnapped and murdered earlier that same year.\n  That event began a decades-long friendship between John and me, \ncentered around this issue. Together, we lobbied Congress--and I remind \nyou, I was not yet a Senator at this time--for legislation that would \ncreate a nationwide organization to track missing kids. In 1984, our \nefforts bore fruit, and President Ronald Reagan signed the bill \ncreating the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children as a \npublic-private partnership.\n  I believe government must do all it can to support groups such as the \nNCMEC and others and our law enforcement agencies in their efforts to \nfind missing children, return them to their families, and shield them \nfrom sexual predators. The work these groups do is vital to protecting \nfamilies, and I applaud their dedication and compassion.\n  Passage of this bill will further the mission of comforting parents \neverywhere and protecting our children. The National Sex Offender \nRegistry will contain up-to-date data on all sex offenders nationwide, \nand there are harsh penalties for any offender who does not register.\n  The bill imposes tougher penalties for sex offenses and violent \ncrimes against children. It also allows for civil commitment procedures \nfor any sex offenders who demonstrate while incarcerated that they \ncannot be trusted to be unleashed on society.\n  The bill addresses child exploitation over the Internet with \nstringent Internet safety provisions. It also contains several worthy \nprograms, grants, and studies to address child and community safety.\n  I would especially like to note that the bill strengthens the \npornography recordkeeping and labeling requirements passed by Congress \nin 1988 to protect children from exploitation by pornographers. These \nprovisions were originally part of S. 2140, the Protecting Children \nfrom Sexual Exploitation Act of 2005, sponsored by my good friend from \nUtah, Senator Hatch.\n  I was pleased to join him as a cosponsor of that bill and am doubly \npleased now to see these provisions included in this bill, which I feel \nconfident in saying will soon reach the President's desk and receive \nhis signature.\n  Finally, the portion of this legislation that parents may find the \nmost comforting is the creation of the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender \nPublic Web site. Parents will now have the power to search for sex \noffenders in their own community. The good that can come from this \npower to arm parents with the right information cannot be measured.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in commending John Walsh for his \ncommitment to this important issue. His drive to see that the tragedy \nthat befell his own family does not fall on another has not diminished \nin the 25 years I have known him. I am glad that we can honor John by \nnaming this important legislation after his beloved son.\n  Those who would prey on the weakest among us--our children deserve to \nfeel the full weight of the law brought down on them. It is hard to \nimagine a crime that does more to destroy families or dreams of a \nbright future. This legislation will ensure that kids, parents, and law \nenforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight child predators \nand sexual criminals. For that reason, I am proud to support its \npassage.\n\n[[Page S8025]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on the Adam Walsh \nChild Protection and Safety Act. This legislation will create a \nnational sex offender registry that will make it possible for law \nenforcement and concerned citizens to track sexual predators. The bill \nalso includes tough penalties that will ensure that these individuals \nwill actually register. There currently are over 100,000 sex offenders \nin this country who are required to register but are ``off the \nsystem.'' They are not registered. The penalties in this bill should be \nadequate to ensure that these individuals register. In addition to \nallowing up to 10 years in prison for an offender who fails to \nregister, the bill also imposes a mandatory 5 years in prison for an \noffender who has neglected his obligation to register and commits a \ncrime of violence.\n  I would like to focus my remarks on legislation that I have \nintroduced that has been incorporated in this final bill. I am \nparticularly pleased to see that the bill maintains the ChildHelp \nNational Registry of Cases of Child Abuse and Neglect. Section 663 of \nthe bill instructs the Department of Health and Human Services to \ncreate a national registry of persons who have been found to have \nabused or neglected a child. The information will be gathered from \nState databases of child abuse or neglect. It will be made available to \nState child-protective-services and law-enforcement agencies ``for \npurposes of carrying out their responsibilities under the law to \nprotect children from abuse and neglect.'' The national database will \nallow States to track the past history of parents and guardians who are \nsuspected of abusing their children. When child-abusing parents come to \nthe attention of authorities--when teachers begin to ask about bruises, \nfor example--these parents often will move to a different jurisdiction. \nA national database would allow the State to which these parents move \nto know the parents' history. It will let a child-protective-services \nworker know, for example, whether he should prioritize investigation of \na particular case because the parent has been found to have committed \nsubstantiated cases of abuse in the past in other States. Such a \ndatabase also would allow a State that is evaluating a prospective \nfoster parent or adoptive parent to learn about past incidents of child \nabuse that the person has committed in other States.\n  I am also proud to see that the Internet SAFETY Act, which I \nintroduced with several colleagues earlier this year, has been \nincorporated as title VII of this bill. This title includes the \nfollowing important provisions:\n  Section 701 makes it a criminal offense to operate a child \nexploitation enterprise, which is defined as four or more persons who \nact in concern to commit at least three separate violations of Federal \nchild pornography, sex trafficking, or sexual abuse laws against \nmultiple child victims. This offense is punished by imprisonment for 20 \nyears up to life.\n  Section 702 provides that if an individual who is required to \nregister as a sex offender under Federal or State law commits specified \nFederal offenses involving child pornography, sex trafficking, or \nsexual abuse against a minor victim, the offender shall be imprisoned \nfor 10 years in addition to any penalty imposed for the current \noffense.\n  Section 703 makes it a criminal offense to embed words or digital \nimages into the source code of a Web site in order to deceive people \ninto viewing obscenity on the Internet. Offenses targeting adults are \nsubject to up to 10 years imprisonment; offenses targeted at child \nvictims are subject to up to 20 years imprisonment.\n\n  Section 704 authorizes appropriations for the U.S. Attorney General \nto hire 200 additional Assistant United States Attorneys across the \ncountry to prosecute child pornography, sex trafficking, and sexual \nabuse offenses targeted at children.\n  Section 705 authorizes appropriations for the hiring of 30 additional \ncomputer forensic examiners within the Justice Department's Regional \nComputer Forensic Laboratories, and 15 additional computer forensic \nexaminers within the Department of Homeland Security's Cyber Crimes \nCenter. The additional computer forensic examiners will be dedicated to \ninvestigating crimes involving the sexual exploitation of children and \nrelated offenses.\n  Section 706 authorizes the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \nPrevention to create 10 additional Internet Crimes Against Children, \nICAC, Task Forces.\n  Finally, section 707 of the Internet SAFETY title expands the civil \nremedies for sexual offenses by allowing the parents of a minor victim \nto seek damages, and by allowing a minor victim to seek damages as an \nadult.\n  Title II of today's bill also includes a number of penalty increases \nand other improvements to Federal criminal sex offenses. Many of these \nprovisions appeared in the Internet SAFETY Act, as well as in the \nJetseta Gage Act, which was introduced by Senator Grassley in 2005 and \nof which I was an original cosponsor. Section 211 suspends the statute \nof limitations for all Federal felony offenses of sexual abuse, sex \ntrafficking, or child pornography. Other provisions of title II \nincrease penalties for coercion and enticement by sex offenders, \nconduct relating to child prostitution, aggravated sexual abuse, sexual \nabuse, abusive sexual contact, sexual abuse of children resulting in \ndeath, and sex trafficking of children. Title II also makes sexual \nabuse offenses resulting in death eligible for the capital punishment, \nand expands the predicate offenses justifying mandatory repeat-offender \npenalties for offenses involving child pornography and depictions of \nthe sexual exploitation of children. Finally, title II adds sex \ntrafficking of children to the set of repeat offenses that are subject \nto mandatory life imprisonment.\n  Another provision that I have pursued during this Congress and that \nis included in this final bill is section 212, which extends several of \nthe guarantees of the 2004 Crime Victims' Rights Act to Federal habeas \ncorpus review of State criminal convictions. Because such cases involve \nFederal courts but State prosecutors, this extension is limited to \nthose provisions of CVRA that are enforced by a court--Congress cannot \ncompel State prosecutors to enforce a Federal statute. The victims' \nrights extended by section 212 to Federal habeas proceedings are the \nright to be present at proceedings, the right to be heard at \nproceedings involving release, plea, sentencing, or parole, the right \nto proceedings free from unreasonable delay, and the right to be \ntreated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and \nprivacy.\n  The bill also makes some technical improvements to the DNA \nFingerprint Act, which Senator Cornyn and I introduced last year and \nwhich was enacted into law as an amendment to the reauthorization of \nthe Violence Against Women Act at the beginning of this year. Section \n155 of today's bill modifies the authority granted to the Federal \nGovernment by the DNA Fingerprint Act to collect DNA samples from \nFederal arrestees. Under current law, the Federal Government may \ncollect a DNA sample from any person arrested for a Federal offense, \nbut the authority to collect DNA from persons convicted of a Federal \noffense is limited to felonies and certain misdemeanors. Section 155 \ncorrects this anomaly by including convictions in the Federal sample-\ncollection regulatory authority, thus allowing the Federal Government \nto collect DNA from all persons convicted of a Federal crime. The 2006 \nAct also allows DNA to be collected from all arrestees, but in the case \nof persons detained under Federal authority this authority is limited \nto non-U.S. persons--i.e., foreign visitors who are neither U.S. \ncitizens nor permanent residents. Problems might arise in the case of \nU.S. persons who are detained and facing Federal criminal charges, but \nwho were not arrested by Federal authorities. Examples include persons \nwho are being prosecuted federally but were arrested by the State \nofficers participating in a joint Federal-State task force, and persons \nwho turn themselves in to Federal authorities without being formally \narrested. Arguably, the 2006 act's arrest authority should extend to \nsuch individuals--they are constructively arrested. Section 155 \neliminates any ambiguity and possibility of litigation over these \nmatters by expressly granting the Federal Government the authority to \ncollect DNA samples from individuals facing Federal charges.\n  Finally, I would like to take a moment to recognize all of the staff \nwho worked so hard to see this bill through to completion. Please allow \nme to\n\n[[Page S8026]]\n\nthank Ken Valentine and Tom Jipping of Senator Hatch's staff, Dave Turk \nof Senator Biden's staff, Julie Katzman and Noah Bookbinder of Senator \nLeahy's staff, Nicole Gustafson of Senator Grassley's staff, as well as \nChad Groover, who has since left Senator Grassley's office but who \nplayed a critical role in developing many of the penalty enhancements \nincluded in title II, Christine Leonard of Senator Kennedy's staff, \nLara Flint of Senator Feingold's staff, Nate Jones of Senator Kohl's \nstaff, Sharon Beth Kristal of Senator DeWine's staff, Reed O'Connor of \nSenator Cornyn's staff, Jane Treat of Senator Coburn's staff, Greg \nSmith of Senator Feinstein's staff, Marianne Upton of Senator Durbin's \nstaff, Bradley Hayes of Senator Sessions's staff, Bradley Schreiber of \nMr. Foley's staff, and last but not least in this group, Brooke Bacak \nof my Republican Policy Committee staff.\n  I would especially like to thank Allen Hicks and Brandi White of \nSenator Frist's staff, who were very helpful in securing the inclusion \nof the Child-Abuse Registry in this bill, Matt Miner of Senator \nSpecter's staff, who played a critical role in negotiating the final \nbill, and Mike Volkov, Sean McLaughlin, and Phil Kiko of Mr. \nSensenbrenner's staff. The bill that we have today would not exist were \nit not for the professionalism, expertise, and dedication of the \nSensenbrenner staff. Often it is easy in Congress simply to pass any \nbill dealing with a subject so that we can say that we have addressed \nthe problem. This is not such a bill. This is a strong, tough bill that \nwill make a difference in the safety and security of our Nation's \nchildren. It is a bill of which we can all be proud, and Mr. \nSensenbrenner's staff deserves recognition for their contribution to \nthat result.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, back in May 2005, with the leadership of \nSenator Specter, Senator Biden, Senator Kennedy, and others, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee approved an important child safety bill, S. 1086. \nThe committee worked tirelessly to craft a prudent, bipartisan bill \nthat would assist States in their ongoing efforts to protect children \nthrough tighter monitoring of known sex offenders. It was a good bill, \nand it passed the full Senate in May of this year by unanimous consent.\n  Now, extensive bipartisan discussions with the House have produced a \nrevised version of the bill, which the Senate is voting on today. The \nnew bill is better in a few ways than the Senate-passed bill that we \nproduced and also, regrettably, takes some steps backward. While this \nnew bill is not the bill I would have written, I intend to support it \nand expect that it will pass.\n  As a former prosecutor, and as a father and grandfather, I know that \nthere is no higher duty than to protect our society's children, to take \nevery step possible to prevent them from coming to harm, and to punish \nthose who attempt to or succeed in harming them. We have never debated \nwhether children should be protected. Of course they should. The only \ndebate is about how they should be protected, and how best to deploy \nand utilize limited resources to deter and punish those who would prey \non them.\n  Over the last 30 years, I have worked closely with others to write \nand enact legislation aimed specifically at protecting children and \nassisting victims. In the last Congress, Senator Hatch and I joined to \nintroduce the PROTECT Act, which provided prosecutors and law \nenforcement with tools necessary to combat child pornography and human \ntrafficking. The final legislation passed by Congress included a number \nof provisions that I had either authored or supported, such as the \nNational AMBER Alert Network Act; the Protecting Our Children First \nAct, which reauthorized funding for the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children; and legislation to amend the Violence Against Women \nAct to provide transitional housing assistance grants for child victims \nof domestic violence.\n  In addition, I am pleased that the Senate has acted on other \nlegislation for children and crime victims that I have sponsored. These \ninclude the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations \nAuthorization Act, which among other things included important grant \nfunds for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, and established the \nViolence Against Women Office in the Justice Department. In 2004, the \nPresident signed into law the Justice For All Act, a package of \ncriminal justice reforms that, among other things, authorized funds to \nreduce rape kit backlogs and enumerated crime victims' rights.\n  I am glad that this new consensus legislation to protect children \nhonors the efforts of John and Reve Walsh, who have worked so hard to \nensure that other families would not experience the tragedy that befell \ntheir family. It has been my privilege to work for many years with the \nWalshes and with the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren, in which they have played such an instrumental role, to take \nmany important steps to keep children and families safe. I commend and \nthank John Walsh once again for his passionate advocacy on behalf of \nthe Nation's children over many, many years.\n  I am also glad that members of both parties in both bodies ultimately \nagreed with me and with the distinguished Senate Republican and \nDemocratic leaders that we should prioritize finishing and passing \nlegislation to protect children from sexual predators, without tying \nthis crucial legislation to other more difficult issues. The Senate has \npassed court security legislation, for which I was a principal \ncosponsor, as part of S. 2766, and we have been working to settle \ndifferences between our legislation and the other body's court security \nproposals. Court security legislation should pass this year, but it \nwould not have been right to endanger either the court security bills \nor this crucial child protection legislation by tying them together.\n  Gang legislation is on a separate track entirely. It is just getting \nstarted in the Senate. Passing legislation to protect children from \nsexual predators has been my first priority. Seeking simultaneously to \nresolve extensive differences over provisions in the gang bill and \nother crime legislation could have caused us to miss this chance. It is \ncommendable that, in the end, both bodies chose to focus on passing sex \noffender legislation and not to jeopardize this by tying this bill to \nmore controversial measures.\n  The gang bill is just now before the Judiciary Committee, which is \nthe appropriate place to start work on a complex and important piece of \ncriminal justice legislation. It is a new and very different version of \nthis bill. It will be important to hold a hearing on this bill to \nlisten to the Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers who \nare combating gang violence on a regular basis, and from the \norganizations that are working to keep kids out of gangs. Gang violence \nis a disturbing and difficult menace in our communities, and as we \ncraft solutions to help address these issues we should strive to get it \nright. We have done the right thing by finalizing this important child \nprotection legislation first, before turning to that and other \ndifficult tasks.\n  When S. 1086 was first introduced in May 2005, serious concerns were \nraised by members of the Judiciary Committee, State attorneys general, \nthe Department of Justice, and others. Through an impressive, \nbipartisan effort these concerns were largely addressed. I appreciate \nthat Senators, and now House Members, of both parties took these \nconcerns to heart and revised this bill in ways that will increase the \nprotection of children from the most dangerous sex offenders, while not \noverwhelming the States with requirements that could hinder their own \nefforts. I believe that this new bill takes a few unfortunate steps \nback from the well thought out Senate version, but it still achieves \nmany of the crucial goals we identified. The resulting bill ensures \nthat each State will have an effective sex offender registry and that \nall States will share registry information--all of which will help keep \nour children safer.\n  I am glad that this bill addresses my concerns and that of many \nothers of both parties in the Senate in giving significant discretion \nto the States in the handling of juvenile offenders. Juvenile justice \nhas always been a province of the States, and State legislatures, \nprosecutors, and judges have developed significant expertise in \ndistinguishing which juvenile offenders represent a continuing threat \nto society and which juveniles, with appropriate treatment and \nmonitoring, can turn\n\n[[Page S8027]]\n\nthemselves around and become contributing members of society.\n\n  This bill correctly allows the States, in many cases, to use their \nexpertise--and they know more about these issues than we do here in \nWashington--to decide which juveniles should be on sex offender \nregistries, to what extent, and for how long. It also appropriately \nrequires the States to include the most egregious juvenile offenders, \nwho do represent a threat to others, on their sex offender registries. \nI think the bill goes too far in a few cases in limiting States' \ndiscretion to determine which juveniles should be placed on registries \nand to allow those juvenile offenders who have lived cleanly and turned \ntheir lives around to get off of registries. But overall, this bill \nstrikes an acceptable balance on this issue, and I am glad that those \nof us who were concerned about appropriate deference to the expertise \nof the States spoke out and were heard to some extent.\n  This bill takes a good if small first step toward what should be one \nof our most important priorities in keeping our children safe from sex \noffenders: treatment. While the most dangerous sex offenders may be \npredisposed to re-offend and should be treated accordingly, many \nstudies have shown that people who commit less serious sex offenses \noften, with appropriate treatment, do not present a significant risk of \nrecidivism and can become responsible members of society. One of the \nbest ways to protect our children is to help as many low-risk offenders \nas possible turn their lives around, so that our scant law enforcement \nresources can be focused on those dangerous offenders who are a \ndemonstrable threat to our children. In addition to the Bureau of \nPrisons Program included in S. 1086, the current bill includes a new \nprogram directed specifically to the treatment of juvenile sex \noffenders, who have been proven to be especially responsive to \ntreatment. This is a welcome addition to the bill, and one we should \nbuild on in the future.\n  I want to direct the attention of my colleagues to title V of the \nbill, which makes substantial amendments to section 2257 of title 18. \nBy way of background, Congress passed the original version of section \n2257 in 1988, as a means to help ensure that minors were not being \nexploited by the adult, hard-core pornography industry in violation of \nthe child exploitation laws. In 1989, the District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia found that this original version violated the \nfirst amendment. In 1990, Congress responded to the District Court \ndecision by significantly narrowing the scope of section 2257.\n  The House bill proposed an expansion of section 2257 beyond what was \nheld unconstitutional before the 1990 amendments, and beyond the \npornography industry and those who exploit children. The proposed \nexpansion of section 2257 gave rise to legitimate concerns, expressed \nby groups as far-ranging as the Chamber of Commerce, the Motion Picture \nAssociation of America, the American Hotel and Lodging Association, the \nAmerican Library Association, and the American Conservative Union, that \nits record-keeping and labeling requirements, and associated criminal \nliability, might now affect an array of mainstream, legitimate, and \nfirst-amendment-protected activities and industries. These industries \nare leaders in protecting children employed in their industries and are \nfar removed from the problem that the legislation purportedly sought to \naddress. Subjecting them to the burdens of a recordkeeping and labeling \nstatute intended for the pornography industry would create substantial \nburdens of compliance without any added benefit in the wholly \nlegitimate and vital cause of actually safeguarding the security and \nwelfare of children.\n  Because the focus of these requirements is adult pornography and the \nprotection of children, not mainstream visual depictions and activities \nthat do not threaten children, the new bill includes provisions \nintended to limit the reach of these requirements to those who are \nactually exploiting children. Most notably, section 2257A(h) enables \nlaw-abiding, legitimate businesses, which create and commercially \ndistribute materials that are not, and do not appear to be, child \npornography, to certify to the Attorney General that, pursuant to \nexisting laws, labor agreements, or industry standards, they regularly \nand in the normal course of business collect the name, date of birth, \nand address of performers employed by them. This recognizes that such \nlegitimate, law-abiding industries in fact routinely collect the \ninformation necessary to demonstrate their compliance with the child \nprotection laws and that for this reason they were never intended to be \nthe focus of this more extensive recordkeeping and labeling statute. \nBusinesses that so certify and thus exhibit their good faith can avoid \nsome of the more onerous requirements, and associated criminal \nliability, rightfully placed on others whose compliance is more likely \nto further the interest of protecting children.\n  By way of illustration, the motion picture industry currently \noperates under a panoply of laws, both civil and criminal, as well as \nregulations and labor agreements governing the employment of children \nin any production. They check work permits, require parents or \nguardians to be present at all times during production, and in some \ncases even obtain court approval for the employment of the children in \nfilms and television shows. It is fair to say that the film and \ntelevision industries are a leader among industries in safeguarding the \ninterests of children in the workplace. Yet in the absence of the \ncertification provision in section 2257A(h), these studios would be \nsubjected to the same extensive recordkeeping and labeling requirements \nas a hard-core pornographer is under this bill, as would a host of \nother legitimate entities throughout the distribution chain for \nmainstream motion pictures and television shows.\n  The focus of the underlying statute should remain on helping \napprehend child predators and not on legitimate businesses that have no \nrole in harming children. Under section 2257A(h), motion picture \ncompanies that certify to the Department of Justice that they collect \nthe name, date of birth, and address of all the performers employed by \nthem, for purposes of compliance with existing laws, such as filling \nout an I-9 form or W-4s for tax purposes, or pursuant to labor \nagreements or their normal business practices, will not be subject to \nthe more burdensome requirements of this statute. Establishing this \nregime will have the additional benefit of allowing the Department of \nJustice to focus their limited resources in areas where they should be \nfocused--pursuing those who harm children. This provision has been in \neffect for 18 years and yet has not been used. It is my hope that the \nDepartment of Justice, having obtained the amendments they sought, will \nbegin to enforce the law and focus on those who harm children, and not \non those legitimate businesses that do not.\n\n  Other exemptions in the bill exclude from the recordkeeping \nrequirements and annual certification regime providers of Internet \naccess, telecommunications, and online search tools, as well as online \nhosting, storage, and transmission services, so long as the provider \ndoes not select or alter the content. It is ironic that the broadest \nexemptions are granted to the providers of various types of Internet \nand telecommunications services, even though the advent of the Internet \nis cited in the original version of this bill as greatly increasing the \nease of transporting, distributing, receiving, and advertising child \npornography in interstate commerce. Notwithstanding these exemptions, \nnothing in this bill can or should be construed to impair the \nenforcement of any other Federal criminal statute or to limit or expand \nany law pertaining to intellectual property against these entities.\n  Regrettably, the core, bipartisan bill to strengthen State sex \noffender registration programs was joined in both the House and the \nSenate to unrelated provisions aimed at creating additional mandatory \nminimum sentences. I agree with the U.S. Judicial Conference and the \nvast majority of Federal judges and practitioners that harsh, \ninflexible mandatory sentencing laws are a recipe for injustice. In its \nletter dated March 7, 2006, regarding the House bill, the Judicial \nConference, headed by Chief Justice John Roberts, wrote that mandatory \nminimum sentences undermine the sentencing guideline regime Congress \nestablished under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 by preventing the \nsystemic development of guidelines that reduce unwarranted disparity \nand provide proportionality and fairness in punishment.\n\n[[Page S8028]]\n\n  Mandatory sentences also tie prosecutors' hands in these cases where \nit is most important that they have the discretion to plea bargain, \nespecially considering how difficult it can be to prepare children \nemotionally and psychologically to testify against their abusers.\n  When addressing this issue in committee last year, Senators from both \nsides of the aisle agreed to limit the imposition of new mandatory \nminimum sentences to the most serious and violent crimes against \nchildren, rather than to myriad lesser crimes as was originally \nproposed. The new bill backslides from this agreement to an unfortunate \nextent. If we are going to establish mandatory minimum sentences, we \nshould at least proceed in a thoughtful and coherent way, with some \nunderstanding of the range of offense conduct that may be covered and \nthe sorts of sentences that are being imposed under current law. \nInstead, we simply pluck ever-higher numbers out of thin air. Congress \ngreatly increased the penalties for most sex offenses just 3 years ago, \nin the PROTECT Act. Nothing has changed since then to warrant this new \nround of arbitrary sentence inflation.\n  Another controversial measure included in the House-passed bill was a \nproposal to strip Federal courts of jurisdiction to review \nconstitutional errors in sentencing that a State court has deemed \nharmless. The Senate Judiciary Committee reviewed this jurisdiction-\nstripping provision last year, during its consideration of the so-\ncalled Streamlined Procedures Act, S. 1088. That bill--and this \nprovision in particular--was strongly opposed by a broad coalition of \norganizations, including the United States Judicial Conference. \nFollowing hearings, the committee specifically rejected this provision \nby adopting a substitute amendment that stripped it out in its \nentirety; the substitute then died in committee without further action. \nTo include such an extraneous and deeply flawed provision in the \ncurrent bill would have been wrong, and it is a credit to this bill \nthat it has been removed.\n  Another area of concern is a provision that was also included in the \nSenate's comprehensive immigration bill. The provision prohibits the \napproval of a visa application for the relative of a U.S. citizen or \nlegal resident based on the citizen or resident's conviction for any of \nthe sex offenses enumerated in the bill. This provision casts a wide \nnet, and in many cases will harshly and unnecessarily penalize people \nseeking entry to the United States who have a family member in the \ncountry, but where the citizen or resident poses no threat to the \nindividual seeking entry.\n  The bill gives the Secretary of DHS discretion to assess these \napplications on a case-by-case basis and waive the denial, and I hope \nthis will turn out to be more than just an empty gesture. Given that \nthis bill greatly expands the crimes sufficient to deny an application, \nI urge the Secretary to give thoughtful consideration to each case in \nwhich a waiver is sought. In a case of a citizen who is on the path to \nrehabilitation or whose crime was relatively minor, denial of a family \nmember's support would serve no rational purpose and would undermine \nthe goals of family unity. I hope the Secretary will actively use this \nwaiver authority to limit the broad reach of this provision to those \ncases where a citizen or legal resident genuinely poses a threat to a \nfamily member seeking entry.\n  This legislation requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto create a national registry of substantiated cases of child abuse and \nneglect which would, when fully implemented over time, serve the \npurpose of enabling child protective service agencies to identify an \nadult's past child maltreatment history in other States, without having \nto check every individual State child protective service central \nregistry. Improving the ability of child protective service agencies to \ncollect information on prior cases of child maltreatment by a named \nadult is a worthy objective. However, to rush into the creation of such \na national registry, without deliberate consideration and evaluation \nfirst of the wide variation in how State child abuse and neglect data \non substantiated cases identifies the perpetrator of the abuse or \nneglect and the specifics of their maltreatment--what the bill calls \nthe nature of the substantiated case--would be reckless.\n  For that reason, the legislation also mandates the HHS Secretary to \nconduct a study on the feasibility of establishing data collection \nstandards for a national child abuse and neglect registry. Clearly, \nsuch a study should be completed before the Federal Government begins \nto implement the creation of such a registry and to collect registry \ninformation from the States. We need to know what we are working with \nbefore we create a system which might give the public a false sense of \nsecurity or violate the due process rights of children and families \nalike. Caution is advised in moving forward on this matter in order to \ndevelop an information system which is both fair and reliable.\n\n  The legislation also requires the HHS Secretary to establish \nstandards for how, and to whom, this national registry information will \nbe disseminated. In view of the sensitivity of this registry, which is \nto include information historically maintained only at the state or \nlocal child protective service agency level, I urge the Secretary, in \nconsideration of these standards and before collecting any national \nregistry data, to be cognizant of past congressional concerns related \nto the protection of legal rights of families, as reflected in 42 \nU.S.C. 5106(b)(2)(A)(xix), and for a fair appellate process for \nindividuals who disagree with a substantiated finding of abuse or \nneglect, as reflected in 42 U.S.C. 5106(b)(2)(A)(xv)(2). Both of these \nare provisions of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act.\n  Significantly, the legislation does not provide any new financial or \ntechnical assistance to States to improve or standardize their child \nprotective services substantiated case recordkeeping systems, or to \nsupport States in the added burden of preparing for, and transferring \ndata to, a new national registry. Not all States maintain the same \nregistry information. Some States do not record registry entries by \nname of perpetrator but rather by name of child; some States no longer \nmaintain registries at all. Most tribes, which are included in the \nlegislation, maintain no registries at all. Without this important \nadditional technical and financial assistance to the States, the \nquality of the information collected would likely be uneven and at \ntimes unreliable. This is a serious deficiency in the legislative \nmandate for the creation of a national registry of child abuse and \nneglect cases, one that I hope will be corrected through a targeted \nappropriation that focuses on helping State child protective service \nagencies upgrade their central registries or comparable systems of \ncase-specific data.\n  I am pleased that the bill includes my proposal to authorize grants \nto Big Brothers and Big Sisters of America and the National Crime \nPrevention Council. Big Brothers and Big Sisters provides valuable \nmentoring services to young people across the country, and supporting \ntheir mission is a valuable investment that will reap measurable \nrewards. The National Crime Prevention Council helps communities across \nthe country understand and address the causes of crime. Grants to this \norganization help communities become active in crime prevention at the \ngrassroots level, and encouraging their continued efforts is something \nwe should all strongly support.\n  I am also pleased that the sponsors of this bill agreed to \nincorporate S. 2155, popularly known as Masha's Law. This legislation, \nnamed after a Russian orphan who was sexually exploited by her adoptive \nfather, will increase the civil statutory damages available to victims \nof child exploitation. It will also ensure that victims of child \npornography whose images remain in circulation after they have turned \n18 can still recover when those images are downloaded.\n  I am also pleased that the bill includes authorization of $12 million \nfor grants to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, known as \nRAINN, for operation of its National Sexual Assault Hotline and for the \nother important work RAINN does to assist victims of sexual assault and \nto help prevent and prosecute sexual assault. I want to congratulate \nRAINN for recently logging the one-millionth call to its 24-hour \ntelephone hotline.\n\n[[Page S8029]]\n\nRAINN, in helping a million crime victims, has not only made their \nlives better, but has also contributed greatly to the decrease in \nsexual violence in this country. I am honored that RAINN's founder and \npresident, Scott Berkowitz, thanked me in connection with this \nimportant milestone for having supported the establishment of the \nNational Sexual Assault Hotline.\n  Finally, I want to thank the Vermont Attorney General's Office and \nother concerned Vermont officials for prompt and constructive comments \non multiple drafts of this legislation. Vermonters have worked hard to \nproduce and improve our State's sex offender registry program in \nongoing efforts to make it useful to law enforcement agencies and the \ngeneral public in providing information regarding individuals who have \nproved a demonstrable threat to the public. In light of the mobility \ninherent in American society, cooperation and coordination among the \nvarious States improves the effectiveness of each State's registry, and \nthe Federal assistance this bill provides will enhance that cooperation \nand coordination.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will seek recognition in a moment, but \nfor the time being, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I support the pending legislation to pass \nthe Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006. This \nlegislation is named for Adam Walsh, a child who was abducted and \nmurdered. Adam's father, John Walsh, has diligently pursued efforts to \nsave other children from the fate which befell Adam by working to enact \nFederal legislation which will establish a national registry for sex \noffenders.\n  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children estimates that \nthere are at least 100,000 sex offenders who are not accounted for by \nlaw enforcement. John Walsh estimates the figure to be higher, \napproximating 150,000.\n  Statistics show that sex offenders prey most often on juveniles; that \ntwo-thirds of the sex offenders currently in State prisons are there \nbecause they have victimized a child. Compared with other criminals, \nsex offenders are four times more likely to be rearrested for a sex \ncrime. It is estimated that some 500,000 children are sexually abused \neach year. According to Department of Justice statistics, child \nmolesters have been known to re-offend as late as 20 years after their \nrelease from prisons.\n  There are currently State laws which require registration of sex \noffenders, but unfortunately they have proved to be relatively \nineffective, which requires the Federal Government to act on the \nnational level.\n\n  I first met John Walsh after the disappearance of his son, Adam, some \n25 years ago, when I was chairman of the Subcommittee on Juvenile \nJustice, a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee. At that \ntime, in conjunction with Senator Paula Hawkins of Florida, we took the \nlead in establishing the Missing Children's Act of 1982, which has been \nvery successful in locating children, where, in a variety of ways--on \nbillboards, on milk cartons, on posters--missing children were \nidentified and publicized. Many missing children were recovered.\n  In the intervening 25 years, John Walsh has undertaken a national \ncrusade. He has been instrumental in advocating and persuading both the \nHouse and the Senate to move ahead with this legislation. He has had \nvery strong support from the leadership of Senator Hatch, the former \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee. Senator Hatch has promoted this \nlegislation, has initiated meetings, organized a meeting with John \nWalsh in the last several days in the Office of the majority leader \nwhere we organized plans to get this bill enacted so that it will be \nready for signing by the President on July 27th, which is the \nanniversary of the abduction of Adam Walsh.\n  It has been a prodigious job to get this bill cleared on both sides, \nnot having anything added on to it, and many efforts were made so that \nit would be enacted in time to mark the anniversary of the abduction of \nAdam Walsh. For that timetable, Senator Hatch deserves a great deal of \ncredit.\n  As is well known, Senator Hatch chaired the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee for many years. His leadership is still a very key factor, \nespecially on this legislation.\n  I compliment my colleague, Senator Rick Santorum, as well as Senator \nKyl, Senator DeWine, Senator Talent, and others, for their support in \nproducing this bill, which will protect children with the assistance of \nsome 200 new Federal prosecutors, 45 new computer forensic experts to \nprevent child pornography, 20 new Internet Crimes Against Children Task \nForces, and the Department of Justice's Project Safe Childhood Program \nand new SMART Office, which are both dedicated to protecting children \nfrom sex offenders.\n  A special note of commendation is due to Senator Santorum for his \nwork on two important components of the bill: First, on Project Safe \nChildhood and second, on the Safe Schools Act. These provisions and \nothers will help stop sex offenders such as Brian McCutchen, who was \nsentenced last year to 35 to 70 years in a Pennsylvania prison for \nattempting to murder and rape an 8-year-old Philadelphia girl in a \npublic restroom. He was a repeat offender. He had been convicted of \nassaulting a 9-year-old girl in a similar public restroom attack in \nManayunk, PA, in 2001. Had the provisions of the law been in place 2 \nyears ago, the second crime might not have happened because the \ncommunity would have been on notice of McCutchen's first attack on a \nlittle girl.\n  I know from my work as district attorney of Philadelphia the impact \nof sex crimes on children. To be a victim of a crime is a horrible \nexperience for anyone, but to be a child and the victim of a sex crime \nleaves an indelible imprint--hard to shake, hard to forget, traumatic, \nand of gigantic importance in the balance of that child's life.\n  We are taking a very important step forward. I thank and commend John \nWalsh for his leadership and again thank and commend Senator Hatch for \nhis leadership in the Senate on this important issue. I thank Chairman \nSensenbrenner, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, for his \ncooperation and coordination, and also to the staffs.\n  I will single out especially Michael O'Neill, who is chief counsel \nand staff director for the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as far as I know, other than the few \nremarks I will make right now, I think Senator Frist is the only \nspeaker remaining on our sex offender bill.\n  I would feel bad if I did not mention a number of the staff people \nwho have helped us on this bill. My own staffer, Ken Valentine, who is \na Secret Service agent, has been serving as a detailee in my office and \nhas really carried the mail on this like few members of the Senate \nstaff I have ever known.\n  Tom Jipping, on my staff; Dave Turk, on Senator Biden's staff, had a \ngreat deal to do with this, as well. Bradley Schreiber, with Mr. \nFoley's staff; Mike O'Neill, of Senator Specter's staff; Mike Miners, \nSenator Specter's chief counsel, crime counsel; Todd Braunstein, with \nSenator Specter; Matt McPhillips, with Senator Specter; Julie Katzman, \nwith Senator Leahy; Bruce Cohen, Senator Leahy's chief of staff on the \nJudiciary Committee; Noah Bookbinder, with Senator Leahy; Christine \nLeonard, with Senator Kennedy. Senator Kennedy has played a significant \nrole here. He was willing to withdraw the hate crimes bill so that this \nbill would pass readily through both bodies. I am very grateful to him.\n  Reed O'Connor of Senator Cornyn's staff; Nicole Gustafson of Senator \nGrassley's staff; Sharon Beth Kristal, Senator DeWine's staff; Gabriel \nAdler, of Senator Dorgan's staff; Joe Matal, from Senator Kyl's \nstaff; Avery Mann, from America's Most Wanted, who played a significant \nrole here; Bradley Hayes, from Senator Sessions' staff; Lara Flint, \nfrom Senator Feingold's staff; Cindy Hayden, from Senator Sessions' \nstaff; Allen Hicks, of course, from Senator Frist's staff; and Brandi \nWhite, from Senator Frist's staff.\n\n[[Page S8030]]\n\n  Of course, I would like to mention Michelle Laxalt, who took a great \npersonal interest in this bill and from the outside helped us a great \ndeal. We want to thank the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren, especially Ernie Allen, John Libonati, Robbie Callaway, and \nCarolyn Atwell-Davis, who has carried so many balls for us here, and \nManus Cooney, who used to be chief of staff under me on the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  And then I would like to pay respect to just some of the victims who \nreally helped with this bill: Elizabeth and Ed and Lois Smart; Linda \nWalker, the mother of Dru Sjodin; Mark Lunsford; Erin Runnion; Marc \nKlass; Polly Franks, Patty Wetterling; and last but not least--really, \nreally, we can never thank them enough, John and Reve Walsh.\n  So with that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senate is about to take an important \nstep to improve the safety of our Nation's children. Very shortly, we \nwill pass the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, also known as \nthe Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of this significant legislation.\n  The Senate passed an earlier version of this bill by unanimous \nconsent on May 4, nearly 2 months ago. Since then, Senators Specter and \nLeahy have conducted bipartisan negotiations with the House, which had \npassed a different version.\n  Today, I am pleased to say that negotiations have resulted in a \nstrong bill that will soon pass both Chambers and become law. I \nappreciate the willingness of all Members to put aside unrelated \ncontroversial issues so that we could focus on the core purpose of this \nbill--protecting children.\n  Next Thursday, the 27th of July, is the 25th anniversary of the \nabduction and murder of 6-year-old Adam Walsh. Since then, the work of \nAdam's father, John Walsh, demonstrates that a single person can make a \ndifference in our country and our world.\n  Following the tragic event involving their son, John and Reve Walsh \nfounded the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. John \nWalsh's TV program, ``America's Most Wanted,'' has led to the \napprehension of thousands of criminals. And now John Walsh has been the \ndriving force behind this bill.\n  The legislation establishes a national sex offender registry which \nwill make it easier for local law enforcement to track sex offenders \nand prevent repeat offenses. The bill also authorizes much needed \ngrants to help local law enforcement agencies establish and integrate \nsex offender registry systems.\n  My home State of Nevada has been a leader in this movement. Our State \nrecently made changes to improve the accuracy and reliability of the \nNevada registry requirements. This Federal bill will strengthen those \nefforts.\n  Donna Coleman, past president of the Children's Advocacy Alliance \nbased in Henderson, NV, was instrumental in getting our State laws \nchanged. She is another example of how one person can make a \ndifference, and I applaud her work.\n  Not all States have been as vigilant as Nevada, and that is a problem \nwhen sex offenders cross State lines. The bill before us will establish \nuniform rules for the information sex offenders are required to report \nand when they are required to report it. It will also give law \nenforcement agencies the tools they need to enforce these requirements.\n  A number of Senators have been leaders in this legislative effort. In \naddition to Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Leahy, I appreciate the \nhard work of Senators Biden, Dorgan, Hatch, Kennedy, and others. I \nthank the majority leader for making this bill a priority. I hope the \nHouse will follow suit and send this bill to the President for his \nsignature without delay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, 25 years ago this month, Reve Walsh took \nher 6-year-old son Adam shopping with her. They were looking for lamps \nat a local department store--a short mile from their home--when Adam \nwas abducted. Sixteen days later, Adam's body was positively \nidentified. To date, no one has been indicted for this horrific crime.\n  As parents, John and Reve Walsh's worst nightmare had become a \nreality. As a father of three sons, I cannot imagine what pain this \ncaused the Walsh family.\n  Through their tears and grief, John and Reve Walsh transformed the \ntragedy of Adam's death into a lifelong commitment--a commitment to \nprotect children from abduction, abuse, and exploitation.\n  John and Reve have been on the forefront of most major child \nprotection legislation passed by this Congress over the last 25 years: \nthe Missing Children's Act of 1982; the Missing Children's Assistance \nAct of 1984, which founded the fantastic National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children; the Protect Act of 2003, which established a \nnationwide Amber Alert network to coordinate rapid emergency responses \nto missing child alerts--and, most recently, the Adam Walsh Child \nProtection and Safety Act of 2006, which is before us today.\n  This important legislation establishes a national sex offender \nregistry, publicly available and searchable by ZIP Code; creates a \nnational abuse registry; toughens penalties for crimes against \nchildren; and cracks down on the growing crisis of Internet predators \nand child pornography.\n  John's and Reve's tireless dedication is an inspiration to parents of \nchild victims and millions of American families. I am proud to have \nworked with John and the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren on this legislation. I am confident that the legislation will \nsave the lives of thousands of children.\n  I thank John Walsh, Ernie Allen, president of the National Center, \nand Carolyn Atwell-Davis, along with the rest of the dedicated staff at \nthe National Center, for the truly amazing work they do, on a daily \nbasis, to protect our Nation's children.\n  In March, John came by my office to talk about the importance of a \nnational sex offender registry. He told me that this was the most \nimportant piece of legislation he had seen in over two decades of \nadvocating for children's issues.\n  I promised John then that I would make passing this critical piece of \nlegislation a priority. And I am proud to tell John--to tell our \nNation's children, parents, and law enforcement--that the U.S. Senate \nhas not only heard your concerns, but we are acting tonight to address \nthem.\n  The Adam Walsh bill--so named to honor the upcoming 25th anniversary \nof his death and the memory of other child victims and their families--\nhas many components designed to protect our Nation's children.\n  First, the bill establishes a national sex offender registry. \nCurrently, there are more than 550,000 registered sex offenders in the \nUnited States, and at least 100,000 of them are missing.\n  Loopholes in the current system allow some sexual predators to evade \nlaw enforcement, placing our children at risk. While many States, \nincluding my own home State of Tennessee, have registries, this \ninformation is not always shared with other States. By creating a \nnational registry, we are closing the loopholes that allow offenders to \nslip through the cracks. And we are encouraging law enforcement at all \nlevels--local, State, and Federal--to collaborate and to share \ninformation.\n  The registry will make it easier for law enforcement to act on a tip, \nto identify and intercept offenders before they can strike again, \nbefore they can repeat their crimes and victimize more children.\n  The national registry will be publicly accessible via the Internet \nand searchable by ZIP Code. This empowers parents. It gives them the \ntools they need to learn whether a neighbor down the street has a \nhistory of sexual violence so they can protect their children from \nharm.\n  Further, the bill increases the penalty for failure to register from \na misdemeanor to a felony. It enhances registration requirements, by \nmandating that offenders register more often and in person, rather than \nby mail.\n  By strengthening these requirements, we are sending a message loudly \nand clearly to sex offenders: If you don't register, we will find you, \nand you will go to jail.\n  The bill also toughens penalties for violent crimes against children, \nincluding sex trafficking of children, coercion\n\n[[Page S8031]]\n\nor enticement of child prostitution, and sexual abuse.\n  Another aspect of this bill is the creation of a child abuse \nregistry. I want to thank Senators Kyl and Enzi for their hard work in \nhelping to get this provision included in the bill.\n  This legislation was recommended by Childhelp, a children's advocacy \norganization with whom my wife Karyn and many of our Senate spouses are \nproud to be associated.\n\n  Every day, four children die as a result of child abuse, and every \nday Childhelp is on the frontlines working to prevent child abuse and \ntreat victims of such abuse. They explained to me that while many \nStates have child abuse registries, this information is not shared with \nother States.\n  This is especially problematic with child abusers. They often \nrelocate when questions are raised by a teacher, a neighbor, or a \ndoctor about whether a child is being abused.\n  By creating a national child abuse registry, we will tear down the \ninformation barrier and enable Child Protective Services professionals \nin different States to share information critical to child abuse \ninvestigations.\n  The final component of this bill addresses the sexual exploitation of \nchildren over the Internet--and the growing crisis of child \npornography, an estimated $20 billion a year industry.\n  The Internet has become the anonymous gateway for child predators to \nmake contact with children, to win their confidence, and to victimize \nthem.\n  Current data show that of the 24 million child Internet users, 1 in 5 \nhas received unwanted sexual solicitations online--1 in 5. And as a \nrecent ``Dateline NBC'' series called ``To Catch A Predator'' vividly \ndemonstrated, many of these cyber-stalkers are more than eager to trap \ntheir young online victims in a real-world nightmare.\n  The bill provides additional resources to combat this growing problem \nby adding 200 new Federal prosecutors to prosecute crimes involving the \nsexual exploitation of minors; by creating 10 new Internet Crimes \nAgainst Children Task Forces, which bring local, State, and Federal law \nenforcement together to collaborate in solving these crimes; by adding \n45 new forensics examiners to accelerate processing of online evidence \nof child exploitation; and by providing grants for programs to educate \nchildren and parents on Internet safety.\n  We must continue to do more to protect our children. American \nfamilies should not have to live in fear of child predators lurking in \nthe shadows of our neighborhoods or enticing our children online.\n  I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their \nefforts, for giving life to this critical piece of legislation. This is \nclearly a bipartisan, bicameral bill that has overwhelming support. I \nam pleased we were able to unite, Democrats and Republicans, in this \nbody and, indeed, House with Senate.\n  In the Senate, I especially want to recognize my colleague, Senator \nHatch, for his tireless efforts on this bill--the champion, the leader, \nthe one with the bold vision, without whom simply this would not have \nhappened.\n  I want to thank Chairman Specter and Senators Santorum, Kyl, and \nDeWine, for all their hard work on bringing this legislation to \nfruition.\n  Also, I want to thank Speaker Hastert and Majority Leader Boehner and \nChairman Sensenbrenner and Congressman Foley for their commitment to \nthis issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this Adam Walsh bill, \nand look forward to a future that is safer for our children.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe there are any further speakers on the \nbill; therefore, I yield back all time and ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senate now proceed to third reading and a vote on H.R. 4472, with \nall of the provisions of the agreement remaining in place. I ask \nunanimous consent, after passage, that the title amendment be read and \nagreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak today about the Child \nCustody Protection Act. A bill the Senate will debate shortly. I \nbelieve, as a father of three children, including one daughter, it is a \nvery important piece of legislation.\n  Good people can disagree on issues even of profound moral \nconsequence. Most Americans, even those who consider themselves pro-\nchoice, believe there should be at least some restrictions on abortion.\n  I believe this is one of those situations where we should be able to \ncome together and find some common ground. The Child Custody Protection \nAct simply states that if an adult willfully takes a minor child across \nState lines to get an abortion, for the purpose of avoiding a State's \nparental consent or notification law that would be a Federal crime for \nthat adult.\n  Judicial bypass is an integral part of all effective parental consent \nlaws. So for those concerned about the cases of parental rape or incest \nand what a child does in that case?--there is a judicial review, a \njudicial bypass available. The Child Custody Protection Act would only \napply in those States parental consent or notification laws in place.\n  This is an important piece of legislation, especially for parents as \nmany of these cases involve a 20-something-year-old male who has \nimpregnated a young teenager, often a 13, 14, 15-year-old girl, which \nhas ended in a secret abortion.\n  Now because your little girl had become pregnant and this 20-\nsomething-year-old realized that is a crime of statutory rape, they \nwant to dispose of the evidence. So they decide to talk your little \ngirl into going across State lines for an abortion because your State \nlaw requires parental notification or parental consent for such a \nprocedure. They go to the State next door, take care of the abortion, \nand you, the parent, know nothing about it. How would you feel as a \nparent in a situation such as that?\n  Even further, abortion is a surgical procedure. Our kids are not even \nallowed to get an aspirin in school without parental consent. They are \nnot allowed to take a field trip without parental consent. They are not \nallowed to take sex education classes without parental consent. Yet, \nremarkably, it is not against the law evade parental consent or notice \nrequirements to take a child across State lines to get a surgical \nprocedure, a surgical abortion.\n  It is time for legislation such as the Child Custody Protection Act. \nI realize that emotions run high on both sides of the abortion issue. \nThey run deeply and have divided our country for some time. We need to \nlook for a place of common ground. A place where reasonable people \nshould be able to come together and agree to at least have this one \nrestriction on abortion, agree that parents should be involved in the \ndecisions, especially the medical decisions, involving their children. \nThe Child Custody Protection Act does just that.\n\n[[Page S8032]]\n\nThis is legislation where we preserve parent rights, we preserve State \nrights, and we do something that approximately 80 percent of the \nAmerican people support.\n  As we debate this bill over the next several days, I hope people will \ntake an honest look at the intent of this legislation. I hope people \nwill not automatically, because the word ``abortion'' is contained in \nthis legislation, say: I can't vote for such a measure because it \ncontains abortion language. I hope people will say: Let's find the \ncommon ground. Let's look for things that are reasonable and come \ntogether on an issue that should be agreed on to protect our children, \nour daughters.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/20/senate-section/article/S8032-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8032-S8036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF NEIL M.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. In my capacity as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I \nseek recognition to speak briefly on four judicial nominees currently \nbefore the Senate.\n  I begin with the nomination of Neil M. Gorsuch to be a judge for the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. Mr. Gorsuch has an \nexcellent academic background with a bachelor's with honors from \nColumbia University, 1988, a law degree with honors from Harvard Law \nSchool in 1991, a Doctorate of Philosophy from Oxford University in \n2004.\n  He clerked for Judge David Sentelle of the Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia. He was a law clerk for Supreme Court Justice \nByron White and Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n  He was a partner in the distinguished law firm of Kellogg, Huber, \nHansen, and principal deputy to the Associate Attorney General for the \nDepartment of Justice from 2005 to the present.\n  I also support the nomination of Bobby Ed Shepherd to be a judge for \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.\n  He is a candidate with an excellent academic record. He earned his \nbachelor's degree, magna cum laude, in 1973 from Ouachita Baptist \nUniversity, and law degree with high honors from the University of \nArkansas in 1976. He had a varied legal practice as a solo practitioner \nand as a partner with various law firms, most recently Landers & \nShepherd. In 1991, Judge Shepherd was elected a circuit-chancery judge \nfor the 13th judicial district for the State of Arkansas. Since 1993 he \nhas served as a United States Magistrate Judge for the United States \nDistrict Court for the Western District of Arkansas.\n  Judge Shepherd, like Mr. Gorsuch, has come to this position with \nunanimous approval. We expect their confirmation on a voice vote later \ntoday.\n  I also support the nomination of Daniel Porter Jordan III to be a \njudge for the United States District Court for the Southern District of \nMississippi.\n  He received a bachelor's degree from the University of Mississippi in \n1987 and a law degree from the University of Virginia Law School in \n1993. He was a legislative assistant to Senator Trent Lott. He was an \nassociate of the law firm of Butler, Snow from 1993 to 1999 and has \nbeen an equity member, equivalent of partner, since 2000.\n  Again, Mr. Jordan has, I believe, unanimous support. We expect him to \nbe confirmed later this evening on a voice vote.\n  I also support the nomination of Gustavo Antonio Gelpi to be U.S. \nDistrict Judge for the District of Puerto Rico. Mr. Gelpi has a \nbachelor's degree from Brandeis University and a law degree from \nSuffolk University Law School. He was a law clerk to Federal Judge Juan \nPerez-Gimenez and later served in the Office of the Federal Public \nDefender, before joining the Puerto Rican Department of Justice. At \nthat Department he served as an assistant to the Attorney General of \nPuerto Rico before becoming Deputy Attorney General for the Puerto \nRican Office of Legal Counsel.\n  I ask unanimous consent the complete resumes of these distinguished \nnominees be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Neil M.

Between 1993 and 1994, he served as a \n     law clerk to Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy. Mr. \n     Gorsuch's work with Justice White occurred just after the \n     justice retired from the Supreme Court, so he assisted the \n     former justice with his work on the Tenth Circuit, where he \n     sat by designation.\n       In 1995, Mr. Gorsuch joined the law firm of Kellogg, Huber, \n     Hansen, Todd, Evans & Figel, PLLC, where he served as an \n     associate until 1997 and as partner from 1998 to 2005. At \n     Kellogg, he handled a wide range of commercial matters, \n     including contracts, antitrust, RICO, and securities fraud.\n       Since June 2005, Mr. Gorsuch has served as Principal Deputy \n     to the Associate Attorney General, Robert McCallum. The \n     Associate Attorney General, of course, is the third ranking \n     officer in the Department of Justice. As his Principal \n     Deputy, Mr. Gorsuch assists in managing the Department's \n     civil litigation components which include the Antitrust, \n     Civil, Civil Rights, Environment, and Tax Divisions.\n       Mr. Gorsuch has received a unanimous ``Well Qualified'' \n     rating from the American Bar Association.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           Bobby Ed Shepherd\n\n\n         United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit\n\n       Birth: November 18, 1951, Arkadelphia, Arkansas.\n       Legal Residence: Arkansas.\n       Education: B.A., magna cum laude, 1973, Ouachita Baptist \n     University; J.D., with high honors, 1975, University of \n     Arkansas School of Law.\n       Employment: Associate, Spencer, Spencer & Shepherd, P.A., \n     1981-1984; Attorney, solo practice, 1984-1987; Partner, \n     Landers & Shepherd, 1987-1990; Circuit-Chancery Judge, 13th \n     Judicial District, State of Arkansas, 1991-1993; U.S. \n     Magistrate Judge, U.S. District Court for the Western \n     District of Arkansas, 1993-present.\n       Selected Activities: Director, Boys and Girls Club of El \n     Dorado, 1985-present; Member, Arkansas Bar Association; \n     Member,\n\n[[Page S8033]]\n\n     House of Delegates, 1985-1986; Member, Executive Council, \n     1985-1988; U.S. Army Reserve, 1973-1981--honorably discharged \n     as First Lieutenant.\n       President Bush nominated Magistrate Judge Bobby E.

Today the Senate will confirm four more lifetime \nappointments to our Federal courts, including two more nominees to \nimportant Federal circuit courts. Judge Bobby E. Shepherd, who has been \nnominated for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth \nCircuit, is a U.S. magistrate judge and former Arkansas State circuit-\nchancery judge who has the support of both home State Democratic \nSenators. We were pleased to be able to expedite his nomination through \nthe committee and bring him to the floor so quickly. Neil Gorsuch has \nbeen nominated to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. I know \nthat Senator Salazar is pleased that we were able to move his \nnomination quickly as well. Today we also consider two district court \nnominees, Daniel P. Jordan, III, who has been nominated to be a judge \non the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, \nand Gustavo A. Gelpi, who has been nominated to be a judge on the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Puerto Rico. I have heard plaudits \nfrom around the country for Judge Gelpi.\n  When they are confirmed, Judge Shepherd and Mr. Gorsuch will be the \nfifth and sixth circuit court nominees confirmed this year. Along with \nJudge Gelpi and Mr. Jordan, we will have confirmed 28 judges this year. \nThis far surpasses the total number of judges confirmed in the 1996 \ncongressional session, when Republicans controlled the Senate and \nstalled the nominations of President Clinton in an election year. In \nthe 1996 session, Republicans would not confirm a single appellate \ncourt judge, compared to six already this year. All 17 confirmations in \n1996 were district court nominees. That is the only session I can \nremember in which the Senate refused to consider a single appellate \ncourt nomination. That was part of their pocket filibuster strategy to \nstall and maintain vacancies in an election year with the hope that a \nRepublican President could pack the courts and tilt them decidedly to \nthe right. In the important DC Circuit, the confirmation of Brett \nKavanaugh was the culmination of the Republicans' decade-long attempt \nto pack the DC Circuit that began with the stalling of Merrick \nGarland's nomination in 1996 and continued with the blocking of \nPresident Clinton's other well-qualified nominees, Elena Kagan and \nAllen Snyder.\n  The 28 judicial nominations confirmed this year by the Republican-\ncontrolled Senate surpasses the number of judges confirmed last year, \n22. During the 17 months I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee and \nthe Senate was under Democratic control, we confirmed 100 of President \nBush's nominees. After today, in the last 2 years under Republican \ncontrol, the Senate will have confirmed 50. So the fact that the Senate \nhas now confirmed more nominees in the past 5\\1/2\\ years, 255, than in \nthe last 5\\1/2\\ years of the Clinton administration is due in no small \npart to the much faster pace of confirmations of this President's \nnominees when Democrats controlled the Senate.\n  I am pleased that the Republican leadership has scheduled debate and \nconsideration of these nominations and am glad that the Republican \nleadership is taking notice of the fact that we can cooperate on swift \nconsideration and\n\n[[Page S8034]]\n\nconfirmation of nominations. Working together, we can confirm four \njudges today. I commend the Republican Senate leadership for passing \nover the controversial nominations of William Gerry Myers III, Terrence \nW. Boyle, and Norman Randy Smith. The Republican leadership is right to \nhave avoided an unnecessarily divisive debate over these nominations \nthat were reported on a party-line vote.\n  The President and Senate Republican leadership have too often, \nthough, chosen to pick fights over judicial nominations rather than \nfocus on filling vacancies. Judicial vacancies have now grown to well \nover 40 from the lowest vacancy rate in decades. More than half these \nvacancies are without a nominee. The Congressional Research Service has \nrecently released a study showing that this President has been the \nslowest in decades to nominate and the Republican Senate among the \nslowest to act. If they would concentrate on the needs of the courts, \nour Federal justice system, and the needs of the American people, we \nwould be much further along.\n  I congratulate the nominees on their confirmations today and hope \nthat they prove to be the kind of judges who understand the central \nrole of the courts as a check and balance to protect the rights of all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to rise in support of \nNeil M. Gorsuch, President Bush's nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Tenth Circuit. Mr. Gorsuch is an extraordinarily well qualified \nnominee. I begin by thanking Chairman Specter for swiftly and \nunanimously reporting this nominee out of committee. I also thank \nMajority Leader Frist for bringing this nomination to the floor for \ntimely consideration.\n  As a fifth-generation Coloradan, I am pleased that President Bush \nchose a nominee with deep Colorado roots. Born in Denver, Mr. Gorsuch \nis a fourth-generation Coloradan who, if confirmed, would carry on his \nfamily history of public service to the State of Colorado. In fact, \nsome may recognize Mr. Gorsuch from his service as a Senate page in the \nearly 1980s. It was in the Senate he made his foray into public service \nand developed a passion for it that he exudes today.\n  If I were asked to succinctly characterize Mr. Gorsuch, I would have \nto say well rounded--well rounded educationally, professionally, and \npersonally.\n  Mr. Gorsuch pursued a rigorous and geographically diverse course of \nacademic study. He earned his undergraduate degree from Columbia \nUniversity, including a summer at the University of Colorado; his law \ndegree from Harvard; and a doctorate in legal philosophy from Oxford \nUniversity.\n  Mr. Gorsuch began his distinguished professional career as a law \nclerk to Judge David Sentelle on the U.S. Court of Appeals to the DC \nCircuit. He then went on to clerk for two Supreme Court Justices, \nJustice Kennedy and Colorado's own Byron White. Following his \nprestigious clerkships, Mr. Gorsuch entered private practice. While in \nprivate practice, Mr. Gorsuch litigated matters for clients large and \nsmall, ranging from individuals to nonprofits to corporations. \nMoreover, he litigated cases on a range of issues from simple contract \ndisputes to complex antitrust and securities fraud matters. He left \nprivate practice in 2005 to return to public service, this time at the \nU.S. Department of Justice where he currently serves as the principal \ndeputy to the Associate Attorney General.\n  Looking collectively at his career, the picture of an appellate judge \nin training emerges. Mr. Gorsuch has served in all three branches of \nGovernment, including the highest levels of the judicial and executive \nbranches. He has represented both plaintiffs and defendants. He has \nrepresented both individuals and corporations. He has litigated civil \ncases and criminal cases. He has litigated in both Federal and State \ncourts. In sum, the breadth and depth of Mr. Gorsuch's experience makes \nhim ideally suited to serve on the Federal appellate bench.\n  While Mr. Gorsuch is highly qualified, I also promised the people of \nColorado I would support judicial nominees who would rule on the law \nand the facts before them, not judges who would legislate from the \nbench. My support for Mr. Gorsuch today is consistent with that \npromise. From my conversations with Mr. Gorsuch, I am certain he \nrecognizes the proper role of the judiciary. The role of the judiciary \nis to interpret the law, not make the law. I believe Mr. Gorsuch is \ntemperamentally and intellectually inclined to stick to the facts and \nthe law in cases that would come before him and that he would refrain \nfrom legislating from the bench.\n  Moreover, Mr. Gorsuch's personal views would not determine the course \nof cases that come before him. Mr. Gorsuch himself says:\n\n       Personal politics or policy preferences have no useful role \n     in judging; regular and healthy doses of self-skepticism and \n     humility about one's only abilities and conclusions always \n     do.\n\n  I believe this statement also speaks to Mr. Gorsuch as a person. He \nis humble, unassuming, polite, and respectful. This sentiment is \nreflected in numerous letters pouring into my office from people of all \npolitical persuasions who have worked with him over the years. Mr. \nGorsuch possesses the temperament befitting an appellate judge.\n  In conclusion, Mr. Gorsuch is a topflight nominee whom I am proud to \nintroduce to my colleagues today. I urge my colleagues to support his \nconfirmation.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak today in support of \nthe nomination of Neal Gorsuch to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  At a time when too many judicial nominations are bogged down by \npartisan and ideological rancor, it is heartening to see a nominee on \nwhom Senators from both parties can agree.\n  While Mr. Gorsuch has spent the majority of his professional life in \nWashington DC, his roots in the state of Colorado are strong--going \nback four generations. Once confirmed, he will return to Colorado where \nI hope that he will live up to the standard set by a long line of \ndistinguished jurists from our State, including the late Justice Byron \nWhite.\n  At the young age of 38, Mr. Gorsuch has already had an impressive \nlegal career. After earning degrees from Columbia University, Harvard \nLaw School, and Oxford University, he went on to clerk on the DC \nCircuit and U.S. Supreme Courts.\n  Following his clerkships, he spent nearly 10 years in private \npractice before becoming Principal Deputy to the Associate Attorney \nGeneral of the United States--where he helps manage the Department's \ncivil litigation.\n  I have had the chance to visit with Mr. Gorsuch and learn about both \nhis personal background and his professional experience. I found him to \nbe intelligent, thoughtful, and appreciative of the great honor it is \nto be nominated to the Federal bench. It is no surprise, then, that the \nABA rated him unanimously well qualified.\n  Of course, it takes more than a great resume to be a great judge. In \naddition to professional excellence as a lawyer, a judicial nominee \nshould have a demonstrated dedication to fairness, impartiality, \nprecedent, and the avoidance of judicial activism--from both the left \nand the right.\n  I believe that Mr. Gorsuch meets this very high test--and I believe \nhe will make a fine addition to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise in support of a very fine person \nwhom President Bush has nominated to be on the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Eighth Circuit. His name is Bobby Shepherd. He will replace a \nvery outstanding circuit court judge named Morris Arnold who is taking \nsenior status. Judge Arnold has become a legal institution in the State \nof Arkansas and on the Eighth Circuit and in the Federal court system. \nHe has absolutely done a fantastic job during his legal career of \nserving his country. He has decided to take senior status.\n  I am thrilled President Bush has selected Bobby Shepherd to replace \nhim on the Eighth Circuit. Judge Shepherd has been a U.S. magistrate in \nthe District Court for the Western District of Arkansas for almost 13 \nyears. One thing I have noticed about Judge Shepherd is, even though I \npracticed law in Arkansas since 1988, I have never heard one person say \na bad word about Judge Bobby Shepherd.\n  He was an elected court judge before he was a magistrate. He prides \nhimself on being able to work out the litigation between or among the \nparties before the necessity of a trial. That is a\n\n[[Page S8035]]\n\ngreat quality for a trial court judge and a Federal magistrate to try \nto unclog the court system by finding a resolution before you have to \ngo to the expense and the time and the judicial resources of going to \ntrial.\n  Prior to his being a magistrate, he was an elected circuit court \njudge which is a trial court judge in Arkansas. He served there \nadmirably. He practiced law in private practice for 14 years. He is a \nUniversity of Arkansas School of Law graduate, and received high honors \nat the university. He went to college at Ouachita Baptist University, \nand served our Nation in the U.S. Army Reserve. He is a director of the \nBoys and Girls Club of El Dorado, AR, and has volunteered through the \nboys clubs and other organizations for over 20 years in that community. \nHe also happens to be a deacon and trustee of the First Baptist Church \nin his hometown of El Dorado.\n  I thank my colleagues, especially Senators Specter and Leahy, for \ntheir decision to move this nomination swiftly, and also Senator Hatch \nwho chaired the confirmation hearing and did an outstanding job through \nthat process. Senator Lincoln and I were able to be there to introduce \nhim.\n  President Bush made a rare find in nominating Judge Shepherd. He has \ntotally avoided controversy. But one thing about him is, when Judge \nArnold announced he was going to take senior status, very quickly a \nconsensus grew around this Federal magistrate down in El Dorado, AR. \nDemocrats and Republicans support him; Independents and Libertarians \nsupport him. People in his community, people outside his community, \nlawyers of all stripes, whether they are plaintiffs lawyers, defense \nlawyers, criminal defense lawyers, prosecutors, unanimously people \nthink he is the right person to be on the Eighth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  He has an outstanding reputation as a fair and studious judge. Around \nthe State I have heard nothing but praise from my colleagues in the \nlegal community of this decision by President Bush. In fact, the \nAmerican Bar Association rated him unanimously well qualified.\n  When I look at judges, whether they are from Arkansas or other \nplaces, I have three criteria: First, are they qualified; second, do \nthey have the proper judicial temperament; and third, do they have the \nability to be fair and impartial.\n  He passes all three tests with flying colors. He is eminently \nqualified. He has proven beyond any doubt that he has the right \ntemperament, and he has proven to all who have ever seen him in action \nor been before him that he is fair and impartial. I am confident that \nJudge Shepherd will bring these qualities and many more to the Eighth \nCircuit. I, as well as Senator Lincoln, heartily endorse this \nnomination and am proud to be part of this nomination process, and I am \ncertainly proud to give him my vote.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nJudge Bobby Shepherd to become the next member of the United States 8th \nCircuit Court of Appeals.\n  Based on my review of the record, my visits with Judge Shepherd, and \nfeedback I have received from members of the Arkansas legal community \nwho know Judge Shepherd well, I believe he is qualified to serve in \nthis position, and I support his nomination.\n  Judge Shepherd was born in Arkadelphia, AR. After high school, Bobby \ngraduated magna cum laude from Ouachita Baptist University in 1973. He \nthen continued his education by earning a law degree from the \nUniversity of Arkansas, graduating with high honors.\n  After law school, Judge Shepherd began his professional career as an \nattorney in private practice at Spencer & Spencer law firm in El \nDorado. From 1984 to 1987, he worked as a solo practitioner. In 1991, \nhe began his career as a jurist serving as a Circuit-Chancery judge for \nthe 13th District of Arkansas until his appointment as a Magistrate \nJudge for the Western District of Arkansas in 1993.\n  Throughout Judge Sheperd's nomination process numerous Arkansans from \nall walks of life have contacted me urging me to support Judge \nShepherd. Some of these people had been advocates in Judge Shepherd's \ncourtroom and others simply considered themselves his friends. To a \nperson, they all found Judge Shepherd to be a man of honor, respected \nby his peers and in his community.\n  In closing, I thank Chairman Specter and Senator Leahy for working \nwith Judge Shepherd and me in moving his nomination forward. I \nappreciate their consideration of this nominee and urge every Member of \nthe Senate to support his confirmation.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to recommend to the Senate \nthe confirmation of David P. Jordan as U.S. district judge for the \nSouthern District of Mississippi.\n  His education, experience, and good moral character equip him with \nthe qualifications to serve with distinction on the Federal bench. I \nhave known Dan Jordan's parents since we were classmates at the \nUniversity of Mississippi, and I have had the opportunity to follow \ntheir son's development and achievements over the years. He had \nremarkable success as a student and was a gifted athlete at his high \nschool in Richmond, VA, where his father was a professor of history and \nchief executive of the foundation that maintains Thomas Jefferson's \nfamous house and serves as a center for research as well as programs \nrelating to early American history and public service.\n  Dan Jordan has earned a reputation for integrity and excellence as a \nlawyer in my State. He is widely respected for his sense of fairness \nand his keen intelligence. He is highly regarded by the lawyers in our \nState and was elected chairman of the Young Lawyers' Section of the \nMississippi State bar. He is a partner in one of the largest and most \nprestigious law firms in Mississippi.\n  I am confident he will serve with distinction and reflect great \ncredit on the Federal judiciary. I urge the Senate to confirm him.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to speak in support of the \nnomination of Daniel Jordan. I am glad that the President agreed with \nmy high opinion of Dan and nominated him to the U.S. District Court for \nSouthern Mississippi. In Mississippi, Dan's nomination has received \nbroad bipartisan support and praise. He is a well-respected litigator, \nand even those who have sometimes opposed him in the courtroom feel he \nis an excellent choice to serve in the Federal judiciary.\n  Dan comes from a wonderful family that I have known for a long time. \nI know that they must be extremely proud of him and all that he has \naccomplished. I, too, have enjoyed watching him develop into an \noutstanding father, lawyer, and a respected Mississippian.\n  Dan is a cum laude graduate in economics from University of \nMississippi, where he was inducted into the University's Hall of Fame. \nIn 1993, he received his J.D. from the University of Virginia--where he \nwas on the editorial board of the Journal of Law and Politics. He is \ncurrently engaged in the general practice of law as a partner with \nButler, Snow, O'Mara, Stevens & Cannada--the largest law firm based in \nMississippi.\n  In his private practice, Dan has gained broad experience and \ndemonstrated the knowledge, professionalism, fairness, temperament, and \nskill that make him ideally suited for the Federal bench. Dan is a \nmember of the International Association of Defense Counsel. He serves \non the Executive Committee of the Mississippi Bar's General Litigation \npractice group. Dan is a past-president of the Jackson Young Lawyers \nAssociation. He served on the Hinds County Bar Association Board of \nDirectors, the Mississippi Young Lawyers Board of Directors, as liaison \nto the Bench and Bar Relations Committee of the Hinds County Bar \nAssociation and as special prosecutor for the Board of Bar Admissions.\n  With Federal judicial nominations, it is important that we recognize \nthe honorable service of those who choose to leave private practice to \nserve. However, Dan's service is not surprising. He has a history of \npublic service. Before attending law school, Dan gained experience \nwhile working for the U.S. Department of Interior and later as a \nlegislative aide on my Senate staff.\n  Since returning to Mississippi and entering private practice, he has \ncontinued to find time to serve his community and profession in many \nways. He has served as the coordinator for\n\n[[Page S8036]]\n\nthe Jackson, MS-based Stewpot Legal Clinic--an organization providing \nlegal assistance to the homeless. He has worked with Habitat for \nHumanity and served as a committee chairman for the Metropolitan Crime \nCommission. His tireless work has prompted leaders in the Jackson, MS, \nphilanthropic community to laud his efforts and impact.\n  He has been named one of Mississippi's Top 40 under 40 by the \nMississippi Business Journal and honored as Jackson's Finest by the \nMississippi M-S (Multiple Sclerosis) Foundation. He is an active member \nof Christ United Methodist Church in Jackson, MS, and is a loving \nhusband and father of two.\n  The President's nomination of Dan Jordan comes as no surprise, given \nhis education, experience, reputation, and temperament. I believe that \nwhen confirmed, Dan will excel as a fair, honest, measured, and capable \njudge. I am proud to have the opportunity to voice my full support for \nDan's nomination, and I look forward to his confirmation.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield back all time on the judge \nnominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nominations, en bloc?\n  The nominations were confirmed, en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The President shall be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/20/senate-section/article/S8036-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

I urge that that \ncontinue to happen as quickly as possible. We have many innocent people \nin harm's way. We need to remember that and do everything we possibly \ncan to protect them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/20/senate-section/article/S8036-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8036-S8037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MIDDLE EAST CRISIS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak \nbriefly about the situation with Hamas attacking Israel from the south, \nthe Hezbollah attacking Israel from the north, and the actions of \nIsrael in defending herself in accordance with international law under \narticle 51 of the United Nations charter.\n  The action against Israel from the south was provoked by Hamas and \nthe Palestinian Authority with the kidnapping of an Israeli soldier and \nthe firing of rockets into southern Israel. The action against Israel \nfrom the north was provoked by Hezbollah firing rockets into northern \nIsrael. Regrettably, the conflict has escalated but the parties \nresponsible for the conflict are Hamas to the south and Hezbollah to \nthe north.\n  The action of Hezbollah comes as a surrogate for Syria and from Iran. \nAn Israeli ship was struck by an Iranian missile in conjunction with \nother circumstantial evidence of Iran having so-called advisers in \nLebanon. There is strong reason to believe that the rocket was fired by \nIran--not conclusive, but strong reason to believe. If so, it is an act \nof war.\n  The United Nations ought to call Iran and Syria on the carpet to \nexplain their conduct in backing Hezbollah, in providing personnel to \ndo more than train Hezbollah, more than advisers being integral parts \nof the military offensive of Hezbollah.\n  The Israelis living in northern Israel have complained about \nHezbollah having a knife at their throat. With so many rockets poised \non the southern Lebanese border and with a provocation of Hezbollah, it \ncertainly warrants the action which has been taken by Israel on the \npremises.\n  It is regrettable that there have been civilian casualties, but I do \nbelieve that Israel has made every reasonable and realistic effort to \nminimize such casualties. There is inevitably collateral damage in war, \nbut this is an occasion when the international community ought to call \nIran and Syria to task for their provocative acts for using Hezbollah \nas a surrogate.\n  In the context of what has happened, I think President Bush was \nentirely correct in his statements that Israel had a right to defend \nitself against Hezbollah in the north and a right to defend against \nHamas in the south.\n  Mr. President, I speak today about the recent unprovoked and \ncoordinated attacks that have been launched on Israel by Hezbollah in \nLebanon and Hamas in Gaza. These provocative attacks are further \nhighlighting the role both Iran and Syria play in supporting Hezbollah. \nIsrael is now forced to fight a defensive war on two fronts as \nHezbollah terrorists and Palestinian militants are committing countless \nacts of aggression towards Israel.\n  Israel's response to Hamas's and Hezbollah's continuing bombardment \nof Israel, the murder of its soldiers, and the capture of three Israeli \nsoldiers is justified. Israel unilaterally evacuated settlements and \nmilitary bases in Gaza last September after an occupation since the \n1967 Middle East war. It has not returned with significant forces since \nthen, despite near-daily rocket fire from the Gaza strip into southern \nIsrael. As recognized by the U.N., Israel completely pulled out of \nLebanon in 2000, despite missile fire from Southern Lebanon into \nIsrael. The capture of Israeli soldiers was unprovoked by Israel. Were \nthe United States bombarded by Kassams and Katyusha and were its \nsoldiers kidnapped we would also respond with force--proportionate \nforce--the force necessary to cease the bombardments and kidnappings. \nYet again, the Middle East faces a crisis brought on by those opposed \nto the peace that is sought by so many.\n  On September 12, 2005, to the jubilation of the Palestinians living \nin Gaza, Israel unilaterally withdrew its military and civilian \npresence from every inch of Gaza as part of a bold and courageous \neffort to reduce the tensions with Palestinians and enable them to \nbetter build a strong society on their own territory. The Palestinians \nin Gaza wasted no time destroying all Jewish houses of worship that \nwere left behind in Gaza, but the world, including the Israelis, \nremained silent because they did not want anything to derail this \nsincere effort for peace. Just several months later, the Palestinians \nelected Hamas, a terrorist organization, to lead its government. During \nthis time, Kassam missles have been regularly launched from Gaza into \nIsrael and on June 25th, Palestinian gunmen within Hamas captured a 19-\nyear old Israeli soldier, Corporal Gilad Shalit, and killed two others, \nat an army post within Israel. Corporal Shalit is the first Israeli \nsoldier to be kidnapped by a Palestinian armed group since 1994. Israel \nimmediately demanded release of the soldier. Hamas responded by \noffering only to provide information about Corporal Shalit, not his \nrelease, in exchange for the release of over 400 Palestinians in \nIsraeli jails. Israel rightly refused an exchange, and hoped that \ninternational pressure would succeed. Having waited 3 days, on June \n28th, Israeli troops pushed into Gaza to find and free Corporal Shalit.\n  President Bush appealed to Palestinian Fatah leader, Abbas and our \nMiddle-East allies to exert pressure on Hamas to free Corporal Shalit. \nThe U.S. ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, called on the Syrian \npresident, Bashar Assad to arrest Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal, who is \nharbored in\n\n[[Page S8037]]\n\nthat country. Additionally, Egypt and Jordan urged Syria to use its \ninfluence with Hamas to win Shalit's release. With no soldier and no \nprospect of his release, Israel continued its offensive, arresting 60 \nPalestinian officials and launching air strikes on bridges to prevent \nmovement of Shalit, on weapon storage sites, and on Gaza's central \npower station. Hamas continued to launch Kassam missiles into Israel \ntargeting civilian population centers; and Palestinian militants, \nseeking cover among Palestinian civilians, used RPGs, grenades, mines, \nand assault rifles to impede Israel's actions. This is how the \nPalestinian leadership responds to Israel's genuine actions for peace. \nThe Israelis endured great political and emotional divisions when they \nforcibly removed their own people from Gaza, but they thought these \nsacrifices were necessary for a lasting peace. The Israelis \ndemonstrated remarkable restraint in the face of these attacks from \nGaza and in the initial days of the kidnapping of Corporal Shalit. But, \nwhen it became clear that Hamas did not share Israel's desire for \npeace, they had no choice to respond with force.\n  Then on July 12th, Hezbollah killed eight soldiers and captured two \nmore from within Israel, near the border with Lebanon. Hezbollah leader \nSheik Hassan Nasrallah said that this was not in response to Israel's \nrecent air strikes in Gaza, but was something they had wanted to do for \n``over a year''. Hezbollah's killing of eight Israeli soldiers and the \nkidnapping of two others represents an unprovoked act of war against \nIsrael. Israel fully withdrew from southern Lebanon in May 2000. This \npeaceful step by Israel was certified by the U.N. Security Council as \nhaving met the requirements of U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, \nwhich called for an Israeli withdrawal and for Lebanon to assert \ncontrol over the area vacated by Israel.\n  Israel rightfully opposes any prisoner exchange with Hamas or \nHezbollah. Israel cannot send the message that it will release hundreds \nof prisoners each time Hamas and Hezbollah capture an Israeli, soldier \nor civilian. That would only encourage more kidnappings, and increase \nthe power of Hamas and Hezbollah resulting in greater instability to \nthe region and undermining the peace process.\n\n  Following Hezbollah's kidnapping, its firing of Katyusha rockets into \nnorthern Israel and demand for a prisoner swap, Israel responded with \nmilitary force directed at Hezbollah's infrastructure in Lebanon, \naccurately calling Hezbollah's actions an act of war. Israel struck \nBeirut's airport to prevent the removal of the Israeli soldiers and to \ndisrupt military supplies, struck Hezbollah's television station, and \nstruck numerous roads, bridges and Hezbollah quarters to disrupt \ncommunication. Hezbollah responded with increased and deeper rocket \nattacks, which for the first time reached far enough into Israel to \nstrike Haifa, 20 miles over the border. These far reaching missiles \nappear to be built by the Iranians and pose an extreme threat that \nIsrael has not previously faced with Hezbollah. In 2004, the United \nNations passed a resolution calling for Hezbollah to be disarmed. Not \nonly has no serious effort been undertaken to disarm them, but rouge \nregimes continue to supply them with new weapons, training, and other \nsupport. The world should unite in its outrage at this behavior by \nHezbollah and its allies and unite behind Israel and the forces of \npeace to bring a swift end to this conflict and to press for the safe \nreturn of Israel's soldiers and the enforcement of the UN resolution.\n  It is worth noting that while Israel has responded with strong force \nin its attempts to rescue its soldiers and root out the terrorist \nnetworks on its borders, it has made great efforts to minimize civilian \ncasualties. Israel regularly drops pamphlets to warn civilians of \nupcoming actions and attempts to secure meaningful intelligence so that \nits strikes are targeted on the people and places involved in terrorist \nactivity. These are courtesies that the Hamas and Hezbollah do not \nextend.\n  As we all now know, these actions of Hezbollah and Hamas can be seen \nas an extension of aggression from Iran and Syria. Iranian president, \nMahmoud Ahmadinejad has publicly stated his desire to ``wipe Israel off \nthe face of the map.'' The Iranians have helped Hezbollah launch \nhundreds of missiles into Israel and have provided Hezbollah $100 \nmillion annually. Syria provides the home, safe haven and command \ncenter to Hamas leader, Khaled Mashaal, and it continues to sponsor \nacts of terrorism. The timing of these attacks served to destabilize \nnegotiations between the Hamas and Fattah Palestinian parties, \nderailing progress in the peace process. The events also distract the \ninternational community from Iran's nuclear ambitions at a time of \nheightened pressure on the Iranian government to curtail its program.\n  I support the President's statement that calls for an unconditional \nrelease of the captured soldiers, and holds Syria and Iran accountable \nfor Hezbollah's actions but I encourage him to do more. There is \nopportunity for hope in this crisis. Many Palestinians and Lebanese \ncitizens do not support the aggressive actions of Hezbollah or Hamas's \nmilitary wing. The international community must support the Lebanese \ngovernment and the Palestinian Authority in representing their many \nmoderate citizens who seek peace and security for their families and \ncommunities. Now is the time for the forces of peace and moderation in \nLebanon to not only aspire for peace but take action to stop Hamas and \nHezbollah from pulling their people into deeper conflict. If terrorist \nfactions continue to attack Israel and capture Israeli soldiers, Israel \nis left with no other choice but to defend its people and its borders.\n  I have made many trips to Israel and the Arab countries in the Middle \nEast and am deeply saddened by the recent events.

Mr. President, I wish to discuss a critical issue that I \nhave addressed in this Chamber numerous times in the last several \nyears, and that is the situation in Darfur. It is truly a shame that in \nJuly of 2006, the horrendous conditions and continued violence look \nvery similar to that which first caught our attention in 2003.\n  Despite the recent peace agreement that was reached in early May \nbetween the Government of National Unity and one faction of the largest \nrebel group, the violence on the ground has continued unabated. This \nhas led to a tenuous humanitarian situation.\n  According to the United Nations Children's Fund Darfur Nutrition \nUpdate for June 2006, malnutrition rates and admissions to therapeutic \nfeeding centers are rising across Darfur. Under difficult conditions, \nour Government has done a tremendous job in providing assistance to the \npeople of Darfur, including contributing over 80 percent of the food \ndelivered in Darfur by the World Food Program. Unfortunately, our \nGovernment's efforts are not enough. Other donors must increase their \ncontributions and fulfill the pledges they made.\n  To make these matters worse, the Government of Sudan blatantly \nrefuses a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Darfur, leaving the African \nUnion to try and enforce peace, which it has been unable to do thus \nfar.\n  For these reasons, I am encouraging President Bush to appoint a \nPresidential envoy for Sudan as soon as possible. The fiscal year 2006 \nemergency supplemental includes a provision offered by Senator Biden \nand myself to create a Presidential special envoy and an office in the \nState Department to support it. This envoy is charged with working to \nresolve the conflict in Darfur, facilitating implementation of the \nComprehensive Peace Agreement between the north and south Sudan, and \nresolving other internal and regional conflicts.\n  The timing of this appointment could not be more critical. Deputy \nSecretary of State Bob Zoellick is departing and other key \nadministration officials that have been working on Sudan are rotating \nto new positions. I want to personally thank Secretary Zoellick for his \ncommitment to peace in Sudan. His tireless efforts were at the \nforefront of this administration's clear commitment to this troubled \ncountry.\n  I urge the President to appoint a trusted leader who is committed to \nbringing about peace in Sudan once and for all.\n  The thought of making similar statements about Darfur in 2009 is \nunacceptable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/20/senate-section/article/S8039-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8039-S8041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, during yesterday's debate on the Water \nResources Development Act, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Jeffords, and I \nagreed to submit for the Record a colloquy clarifying the intent of a \nprovision authorizing the Poplar Island expansion project in Maryland. \nUnfortunately, this colloquy was inadvertently left out. I ask \nunanimous consent that the colloquy be printed in the Congressional \nRecord at this point and that the permanent Record be corrected so that \nthis colloquy appears with the rest of yesterday's debate on the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to engage the \n     distinguished chairman in a colloquy with respect to the \n     provisions in section 1001(a)(20), authorizing the Poplar \n     Island Expansion, Maryland.\n       Mr. INHOFE. I would be happy to respond to the Senator from \n     Maryland.\n       Mr. SARBANES. I would simply like to clarify that it is the \n     intent of the committee that this provision authorizes \n     construction of a 575-acre addition to the existing 1,140-\n     acre Poplar Island, MD, beneficial use of dredged material \n     project which is presently under construction and authorizes \n     an additional $256.1 million for that expansion.\n       Mr. INHOFE. The Senator from Maryland is correct. Section \n     1001(a)(20) authorizes the Secretary to construct the \n     expansion of the Poplar Island, MD, project in accordance \n     with the Report of the Chief of Engineers dated March 31, \n     2006, at an additional total cost of $256,100,000. This will \n     increase the overall environmental restoration project at \n     Poplar Island from 1,140 acres to approximately 1,715 acres \n     and bring the total cost of the existing project and the \n     expansion project to $643.4 million, with an estimated \n     Federal cost of $482.4 million and an estimated non-Federal \n     cost of $161 million.\n       Mr. JEFFORDS. I concur that this is the committee's intent.\n       Mr. SARBANES. I thank the chairman and ranking member for \n     this clarification and for including this provision which is \n     vitally important for the Port of Baltimore and the \n     Chesapeake Bay.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank you for having this important \ndebate\n\n[[Page S8040]]\n\nregarding our Nation's aging infrastructure and for allowing this body \nto discuss the merits of Corps of Engineers reform.\n  As you know, I supported allowing this bill to come to the Senate \nfloor for consideration. Congress has not passed a water resources \nauthorization bill since 2000, and particularly in the wake of \nHurricane Katrina, this debate is long overdue. While many attempted to \nderail consideration of this debate, I did not because I believed that \nwe must have this discussion in the open.\n  That being said, I have deep concerns regarding the legislation that \nis before us today. Specifically, I am concerned that we are missing a \nhistoric opportunity to incorporate the many lessons learned since the \nlast WRDA bill passed in 2000. Consider the following developments that \nhighlight the critical need for reform of the Corps of Engineers:\n\n       The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported in \n     March 2006 that ``the cost benefit analyses performed by the \n     Corps to support decisions on Civil Works projects . . . were \n     generally inadequate to provide a reasonable basis for \n     deciding whether to proceed with the project . . .'' GAO-06-\n     529T--Corps of Engineers: Observations on Planning and \n     Project Management Processes for the Civil Works Program \n     (March 15, 2006)\n       In remarking on the fact that the Corps reprogrammed over \n     $2.1 billion through 7,000 reprogramming actions in fiscal \n     years 2003 and 2004, the GAO noted that the Corps' practice \n     was often ``not necessary'' and is ``reflect[ive] of poor \n     planning and an absence of Corps-wide priorities for its \n     Civil Works priorities.'' GAO-06-529T--Corps of Engineers: \n     Observations on Planning and Project Management Processes for \n     the Civil Works Program (March 15, 2006)\n       In a report to Congress in 2003 regarding the Sacramento \n     flood protection project, the GAO found that the Corps used \n     ``an inappropriate methodology to calculate the value of \n     protected properties'' and failed to properly report expected \n     cost increases. Consider the projected costs for the three \n     primary Sacramento projects: the Common Features Project \n     increased from $57 million in 1996 to $370 million in 2002; \n     the American Features project increased from $44 million in \n     1996 to $143 million in 2002; and the Natomis Basin component \n     has ballooned from an early estimated cost of $13 million, to \n     $212 million in 2002. GAO-04-30--Corps of Engineers: Improved \n     Analysis of Costs & Benefits Needed for the Sacramento Flood \n     Control Project.\n       Thanks to a Corps whistleblower and a subsequent \n     investigation by the Army inspector general, we know that the \n     Corps: ``manipulated the economic analyses of the feasibility \n     study being conducted on the Upper Mississippi lock expansion \n     project in order to steer the study to a specific outcome.'' \n     Furthermore, the investigation revealed that a Corps official \n     knowingly directed that ``mathematically flawed'' data be \n     used to justify the project. High-ranking Corps officials \n     also were criticized for giving ``preferential treatment to \n     the barge industry . . .'' by allowing industry \n     representatives to become direct participants in the economic \n     analysis.'' U.S. Office of Special Counsel: Statement of \n     Elaine Kaplan. Special Counsel, U.S. Office of Special \n     Counsel (December 2000).\n\n  I could add several more examples, including the many lessons we have \nlearned in the wake of Katrina, but my point is clear: the processes \nused for project justification, for long-term planning, for cost \ncontainment, and for project accountability are fundamentally flawed \nand do not serve the best interests of American taxpayers. For too \nlong, we have allowed project costs to soar, routinely accepted \ninaccurate studies to justify large projects, and rarely, if ever, \nasked the tough questions of Corps officials.\n  Congress plays a central role in the oversight of all Federal \nagencies, and with respect to the Corps, we have failed taxpayers \nmiserably. Why? Perhaps a better question would be to ask who benefits \nmost from lax congressional oversight. I would argue that Members \nthemselves are the real winners. We get the projects we want, \nregardless of the cost or the overall impact on critical national \ninfrastructure, and the Corps is allowed to operate as it pleases. This \nenvironment--with every incentive for construction and little or no \nincentive for accountability--is a recipe for disasters of all sorts.\n  The only way to fix this problem in the long term is to bring fiscal \ntransparency and oversight to this process.\n  First and foremost, we have to develop our ability to prioritize \nauthorized Corps projects. The Corps currently faces a $58 billion \ndollar project backlog that will take many decades to resolve, and this \nbill will add over $10 billion more to that backlog. Many worthwhile \nprojects, already debated and authorized by previous Congresses, \nlanguish in the annual competition for appropriations. Taking their \nplace in line are politically popular projects that rarely address \nvital national infrastructure needs. Again, we are failing taxpayers.\n  I am pleased to see the amendment offered by my colleagues, Senators \nFeingold and McCain, that will squarely address this lack of \nprioritization. The tools that will be provided by this amendment will \nstrengthen the ability of Members of Congress to analyze the hundreds \nof authorized Corps projects and determine which are in the \nbest interests of our Nation. Congress maintains its discretion to fund \nwhichever projects it deems most appropriate, but we will do so with an \nabundance of new data that will highlight critical national \ninfrastructural needs. Funds are increasingly limited, and we have a \nresponsibility to prioritize projects based on their impact.\n\n  Second, in our efforts to improve this important process, Congress \nmust consider ways to bring greater oversight to the Corps. The many \ninstances of wrongdoing in the Corps project justification process make \nclear that we must do better. With billions of dollars at stake and \noften thousands of lives hanging in the balance, we simply cannot allow \nfor manipulation and undue influence in the justification study \nprocess.\n  Again, I am pleased to see the efforts of Senators McCain and \nFeingold in addressing this void. The Corps has proven itself incapable \nof mending these problems on its own, and nowhere is this more apparent \nthan in the project justification process. It is imperative that \noutside experts, with no stake in large-scale construction proposals, \nbe allowed to review these types of Corps studies. While I may have \ndesigned the amendment in a slightly different manner, I look forward \nto supporting the McCain-Feingold approach that will allow for a truly \nindependent and time-sensitive review by a panel of experts. At the end \nof the day, Congress still makes the final decision on which projects \nto fund, and in no way will this amendment impact our constitutional \nobligations or slow project construction. We can still fund wasteful \nand inefficient spending if we so desire. If we pass this amendment, at \nleast we will ensure that the studies we cite are accurate. We owe that \nto the American public.\n  I am grateful to my colleagues for the countless hours they have \nspent in putting this bill together. I know the road that led to this \ndebate today was not an easy one, and it has been a long and difficult \njourney. As we embark on this debate and in our legitimate desire to \npass this legislation, however, we must not overlook the critical need \nfor Corps reform. The many lessons we have learned since WRDA 2000 are \nas numerous as they are pressing. The Corps of Engineers is staffed by \nmany dedicated and hard-working Americans, many of whom are in my \nState. The agency itself, however, is ailing and demands our attention. \nIf the Corps is to continue to meet the mandate it has been given and \nserve the needs of the American taxpayer, we must not move forward \nwithout the incorporation of new oversight and transparency.\n  America's waterways and flood control projects have played an \nimportant role in protecting our communities and in spurring \nagricultural and industrial commerce. Unless we can reform the Corps, \nthough, their impact will increasingly diminish. As it stands today, \nthe Corps is not accountable to Congress, and ultimately, it is not \naccountable to the American taxpayer. We have a historic opportunity to \nchange this environment, and we must seize it.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of amendment \nNo. 4684, the McCain-Feingold-Prioritization amendment, to the Water \nResources Development Act.\n  The city of New Orleans has been under a constant threat of flooding \nfrom the ``big one'' ever since it was founded in 1718. Though the city \nhas survived, its flood control defenses have been tested and \noccasionally overwhelmed. There was the great flood of 1927 when the \nMississippi River spilled into the city, and there was Hurricane Betsy \nin 1965, which, according to Senator Russell Long of Louisiana, \n``picked up ... [Lake Pontchartrain]\n\n[[Page S8041]]\n\nand put it inside New Orleans and Jefferson Parish.''\n  In the same year that Betsy inundated the city, Congress authorized a \nhurricane protection project to protect the city. That project was \nsupposed to take 13 years, cost $85 million, and, according to the Army \nCorps, protect greater New Orleans from the equivalent of a fast-moving \ncategory 3 hurricane.\n  In the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee's \ninvestigation into the preparation for and response to Hurricane \nKatrina, our committee learned that that project was still a decade or \nmore away from completion--close to 50 years after this body authorized \nits construction--and the total cost of the project had ballooned to \nmore than $750 million. In addition, the project did not provide the \nlevel of protection for New Orleans and the region that it was expected \nto provide.\n  There were many reasons for the delay, including natural ones such as \nthe subsidence of the land in southeastern Louisiana. Building levees \nin this part of the country required the Army Corps to return time and \ntime again to add additional layers to the levees, known as lifts, to \naccommodate for the sinking soils.\n  But there were also manmade reasons for the delay, such as the \nabsence of Federal funding. In recent years, local Army Corps officials \nhave had to scramble to move these Louisiana hurricane protection \nprojects forward. Local Army Corps officials had to urge local levee \nboards to contact their congressional delegation to ask for financial \nhelp to restore levees to their original design height, and on two \nrecent occasions, the Army Corps had to rely on the local levee \ndistricts, which share in the cost of these projects, to advance them \nmoney so they could continue construction of segments of the hurricane \nprotection system.\n  As the Corps of Engineers' own Interagency Performance Evaluation \nTaskforce, or IPET, investigators observed, if one part of the levee \nsystem comes up short, it can compromise the entire protection system. \nYet this levee system, which was supposed to be protecting one of \nAmerica's most vulnerable cities, was never finished, and as a result, \nwhen Katrina hit last August, dire consequences ensued.\n  We learned from Katrina that there is a need to focus limited Federal \nresources on finishing flood control projects that are critical to our \nNation's health, safety, and welfare. The Army Corps' current process \nto do this is inadequate. As the GAO testified before the House in \nMarch, ``The Corps' planning and project management processes cannot \nensure that national priorities are appropriately established across \nthe hundreds of civil works projects that are competing for scarce \nfederal resources.''\n  The McCain-Feingold amendment on prioritization, which I am proud to \ncosponsor, will address this problem by requiring the Water Resources \nPlanning Coordinating Committee, which the underlying WRDA Bill already \nestablishes for other purposes to evaluate the importance of Corps \nprojects in three different categories--storm damage reduction \nprojects, navigation projects, and environmental restoration projects. \nThe amendment also requires the committee to rank projects in each \ncategory so that Congress, and the Corps itself, can determine what \nprojects are the most important to pursue and most worthy of funding. \nThe Coordinating Committee will then submit its report to Congress and \nmake the report available to the public.\n  With that information, Congress can make better decisions about how \nto spend scarce Federal resources on critical infrastructure projects \nacross the country. We have to learn from Katrina and we should never \nagain allow a project that is so critical to the very livelihood of so \nmany to languish because we did not give it the priority it deserved.\n  I know many of my colleagues are concerned that this amendment will \nremove authority from individual Members about how to spend Army Corps \ndollars. I understand that concern, but the reality is that the Corps \nhas more work to do than funding to do it. This WRDA bill will add \nanother $10 to $12 billion in Army Corps projects on top of the \nestimated $58 billion in backlogged Army Corps projects that are \nauthorized but not yet funded. Without some system of prioritizing \nprojects, as this amendment would require, we run the risk of another \nKatrina-like situation where critical projects are not given the \npriority they deserve. On the other hand, by requiring the Corps to \nprioritize projects in each category--flood control, navigation, and \nenvironmental restoration--we can ensure that there is a balance among \nthe types of projects that are funded and that the most important and \ncost-effective projects in each category get the attention they \ndeserve.\n  Water resources projects are important to each and every State, but \nwe need to heed the lessons of Katrina and make sure that we spend our \ntax dollars where they are most needed.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this critical amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/20/senate-section/article/S8041-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8041-S8042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             GLOBAL WARMING POLLUTION REDUCTION ACT OF 2006\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to my \ngood friend and colleague, Senator Jeffords, for his hard work and \nleadership in developing comprehensive legislation that will assist in \ndecreasing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. I am proud to join him, along \nwith my other colleagues Senators Bingaman, Boxer, Kennedy, Leahy, \nLautenberg, and Reed in introducing the Global Warming Pollution \nReduction Act of 2006, GWPRA. This bill sets the United States on a \npath to reducing emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 through a 2 percent \nannual reduction from 2010 through 2020, as well as achieving by 2050 \nemissions that are 80 percent below 1990 levels.\n  The global warming debate began in Hawaii over 30 years ago when the \nMauna Loa Climate Observatory first documented evidence of increased \ncarbon dioxide levels in the Earth's atmosphere. The international \nscientific community now concurs that human activities are altering the \nclimate system. The U.S., which is the world's largest emitter of \ngreenhouse gases, must be accountable as a leader in reducing emissions \nand combating the threats resulting from global warming.\n  My home State of Hawaii is disproportionately susceptible to \nincreases in sea level rise and ocean temperature, which jeopardize \npublic safety, economic development, cultural resources, and the health \nof our unique island ecosystems and wildlife. It is clear that coastal \nStates will also face similar challenges caused by sea level rise \nresulting in flooding of low-lying property, loss of coastal wetlands, \nbeach erosion, saltwater contamination of drinking water, and damage to \ncoastal roads and bridges. Climate models forecasting intense storms \nand severe weather further threaten Hawaii's capacity to respond to \nnatural disasters and acquire immediate relief from neighboring states. \nRemote and rural areas are likely to be confronted with similar issues \nof self-sufficiency and limited access to assistance.\n  I am very concerned about the impact of fossil fuel emissions on the \nhealth of our planet and believe that we must actively seek solutions \nto curb the buildup of greenhouse gases. This bill sets energy \nefficiency targets to assist both the industry and energy consumers in \nmeeting these standards. This legislation lays out ambitious goals to \nminimize U.S. emissions and assist in the stabilization of global \natmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.\n  We must invest in technology research to control greenhouse gas \nemissions. Encouraging renewable energy technologies will play a \ncrucial role in successfully meeting the objectives of this \nlegislation. Under the guidance provided by this bill, I firmly believe \nthe State of Hawaii, along with the rest of the United States, will be \npoised to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But Federal \nsupport is vital to accomplishing our goals to combat global warming.\n  I appreciate the technical assistance provided by the Hawaii Natural \nEnergy Institute and the Hawaii Department of Business, Economic \nDevelopment and Tourism. I remain committed to working with them, other \nstakeholders in Hawaii, and my colleagues, under the leadership of \nSenator Jeffords, to enact this legislation that will improve the \nhealth of our planet and the quality of life for all Americans. Senator\n\n[[Page S8042]]\n\nJeffords is a dedicated advocate for environmental protection. With the \nGWPRA, he leaves a legacy to guide and inspire future generations to \nactively address the issue of global warming. I encourage my colleagues \nto join Senator Jeffords in supporting this worthy initiative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/20/senate-section/article/S8042-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THIRTY-SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE TURKISH INVASION OF CYPRUS\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today, on behalf of the Greek Cypriot \npopulation of Rhode Island, and Greek Cypriots around the world, I \nrecognize the 32nd anniversary of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus.\n  Shortly before dawn 32 years ago today, heavily armed Turkish troops \nlanded on the northern coast of Cyprus launching the invasion and \nsubsequent occupation of Northern Cyprus. Over the next 2 months, over \n200,000 Greek Cypriots, an overwhelming 82 percent of the island's \npopulation, were forced to seek refuge in the southern Greek controlled \nportions of Cyprus. Turkey eventually called a ceasefire after seizing \n37 percent of the island. To this day Turkey is the only country that \nrecognizes the self-declared ``Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.''\n  Over the last 30 years, the United Nations Security Council and \nGeneral Assembly have striven to resolve this ongoing territorial \ndispute through multiple failed peace talks and resolutions. While many \nyears and much thought has gone into determining an equally agreeable \nsolution, talks between the Greek Cypriot south and the Turkish Cypriot \nnorth constantly end in a stalemate.\n  However, hope was renewed this month when the United Nations began \ndrafting recommendations on reviving stalled peace talks between this \nwar-divided island's Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. \nFurthermore, Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos and Turkish Cypriot \nleader Mehmet Ali Talat were hailed by the Cyprus Parliament Speaker \nDemetris Christofias as taking positive steps toward restarting the \nCyprus peace talks.\n  We must applaud the continued efforts of the United Nations and the \nrenewed focus of the Cypriot leaders to reunite a divided Cyprus and \nremain committed to ushering the settlement process forward. Cypriot, \nMediterranean, and U.S. interests will benefit from a settlement that \naddresses all legitimate concerns of both sides and promotes the \nstability of a hostile region.\n  Much like the Greek proverb, ``learn to walk before you run,'' \nCypriot leaders must take small steady steps forward and continue \nforward even when the road looks unpaved. There is a path that leads to \nthe reunification and peace between these two communities. Traversing \nthis path, however, will take patience and tolerance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/20/senate-section/article/S8042-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8042-S8043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      DM RAILROAD LOAN FROM THE FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I have arisen previously to talk about a \nproposal of the DM Railroad to reconstruct its rail line across \nsouthern Minnesota in order to run up to 36 unit coal trains, rail cars \ncontaining grain and other agricultural products, and possibly \nshipments of hazardous materials. The DM is presently seeking a $2.5 \nbillion low-interest loan from the Federal Railroad Administration for \nthis project, which the company initially said would be financed to the \nprivate capital markets.\n  Evidently unable to attract that necessary financing, DM has now \nturned to the American taxpayer to assume the enormous financial risk \nthat such a project entails. If the project were to be successful, the \nfinancial benefits would go to DM's executives and investors. If the \nproject were to fail, the losses would be paid by American taxpayers. \nIt is for that reason that I have urged the Administrator of the \nFederal Railroad Administration and the U.S. Secretary of \nTransportation, who have the ultimate decision-making authorities, to \nexercise all necessary due diligence before their decisions about this \nenormous financing.\n  Previously, I have also expressed the strongest possible concern \nabout DM's intention to run this rail line through downtown \nRochester, MN, and immediately adjacent to the world-renowned Mayo \nClinic. Mayo Clinic and Rochester City officials vehemently oppose \nDM's intended route and maintain that it would be catastrophic to \ntheir clinic and their city. I agree.\n  The Mayo Clinic is known and respected nationally and worldwide for \nits medical excellence. Last year, the Mayo Clinic saw over 1,700,000 \npatients who came from throughout Minnesota, our country, and the world \nto seek the best possible medical care. The Mayo Clinic is the largest \nprivate employer in Minnesota, employing over 28,000 people, including \n2,400 physicians.\n  In addition to the serious financial questions surrounding this \nproject and major environmental concerns across its intended route, new \ninformation has just come to light that demonstrates even more \nconclusively how unacceptable its proposed route through downtown \nRochester, MN, and adjacent to the Mayo Clinic would be. According to a \nreport released today by the Mayo Clinic, but using public, factual \ninformation, DM has one of the very worst safety records in the \nentire U.S. railroad industry. In fact, last summer, Mr. Kevin \nSheiffer, President and CEO of DM's parent company, told DM \nemployees, in their newsletter, ``We have a very poor safety record.''\n  The report discloses that from 2000 through 2005, the DM reported \ntrain accidents at a rate 7.5 times higher than the national average; \nduring 2005, the DM's rate of accidents at crossings was 2.3 times \nhigher than the national average; the DM had the highest rate of \nemployee casualties among regional freight railroads in 2004, and was a \nclose second in 2003 and 2005; during the past 10 years, DM had 107 \naccidents involving trains carrying hazardous materials, including a \nrecord 16 in 2005; and since 2003, when the Federal Railroad \nAdministration loaned DM $233 million, DM's main track accident \nrate has soared to eight times the national rate--a 175 percent \nincrease over its pre-loan rate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the the overview of this \nreport, ``The Sum of All Fears: Unsafe Railroad Plus Unsafe Plan Equals \nDisaster,'' and the forwarding letter from the Mayo Clinic to The \nHonorable Joseph H. Boardman, Administrator of the Federal Railroad \nAdministration, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, follows:\n\n                                                  July 20, 2006.  \n     Hon. Joseph H. Boardman,\n     Administrator, Federal Railroad Administration, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Administrator Boardman: On May 8, 2006, the County of \n     Olmsted, the City of Rochester, Mayo Clinic, and the \n     Rochester Area Chamber of Commerce submitted an independent \n     study by a prestigious accounting firm setting forth detailed \n     reasons why granting a $2.5 billion loan to the Dakota, \n     Minnesota and Eastern Railroad (DM) posed a substantial \n     risk to the American taxpayers that the loan will not be \n     repaid. We believe that documented risk to the taxpayers is \n     reason enough for the loan to be denied.\n       In addition to the substantial risk of default, the public \n     safety impact of any loan to the DM must be considered, \n     especially given the DM's abysmal safety record as outlined \n     in the enclosed analysis. In light of the DM's record as \n     the most unsafe regional railroad in America, granting a $2.5 \n     billion loan to the DM would clearly and dramatically \n     increase the public safety risk to the residents of Rochester \n     and the patients and physicians at Mayo Clinic. It would also \n     violate the statutory admonition that the Secretary of \n     Transportation shall give priority to projects that ``enhance \n     the public safety,'' and undermine the Federal Railroad \n     Administration's (FRA) statutory obligation to ``carry out \n     all railroad safety laws.''\n       The proposed loan would not enhance the public safety. To \n     the contrary, the proposed loan would fund a project that \n     could have terrible consequences for the residents of \n     Rochester, Minnesota, and the patients, doctors and \n     scientists at Mayo Clinic. Transporting hazardous materials, \n     at high speeds, on one of the country's most dangerous \n     railroads, is an ``accident'' waiting to happen. If that \n     accident were to occur in the City of Rochester near Mayo \n     Clinic, then the consequences could be catastrophic.\n       The safety problems at the DM are well documented by the \n     FRA itself. Last October, the FRA cited the DM for \n     ``numerous problems with management and implementation of \n     [its] safety program.'' The FRA should carefully consider the \n     safety consequences because granting the proposed loan would \n     simply reinforce the DM's attitude that safety does not \n     matter. We believe that denying the loan would make it clear \n     that safety comes first.\n\n[[Page S8043]]\n\n       For these reasons (and the reasons set forth in our May 8, \n     2006 submission), we respectfully submit that the DM's loan \n     request should be denied. We also reiterate our previous \n     request for the opportunity to meet with you to discuss the \n     merits of our submissions.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mayor Ardell Brede,\n       City of Rochester.\n     Glenn S. Forbes, M.D.\n       CEO, Mayo Clinic Rochester.\n     John Wade,\n       President, Rochester Area Chamber of Commerce.\n     Dennis L. Hanson,\n       President, Rochester City Council.\n     Kenneth D. Brown,\n       Chair, Olmsted County Commissioners.\n                                  ____\n\n\n The Sum of All Fears: Unsafe Railroad Plus Unsafe Plan Equals Disaster\n\n\n                                Overview\n\n       The Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad (DM), a \n     regional freight railroad, is seeking a $2.5 billion loan \n     from the United States government, backed by the American \n     taxpayers, for a major expansion that would allow trains to \n     carry coal and other freight, including hazardous materials, \n     through the heart of downtown Rochester--a few hundred feet \n     from Mayo Clinic--at speeds up to 50 miles per hour. The DM \n     refuses to limit the number of trains through Rochester and \n     refuses to restrict the type of cargo it carries through \n     Rochester near Mayo Clinic.\n       The Secretary of Transportation must consider the effects \n     of such a loan on the public safety and a loan should not be \n     granted to the DM because it would expose Rochester and \n     Mayo Clinic to the safety risks inherent in the \n     transportation of hazardous materials by a railroad with \n     long-standing safety problems.\n       The DM has one of the worst safety records of all U.S. \n     railroads:\n       1. From 2000 through 2005, the DM reported train \n     accidents at a rate 7.5 times higher than the national \n     average;\n       2. During 2005, the DM's rate of accidents at crossings \n     was 2.3 times higher than the national average;\n       3. The DM had the second-highest rate of employee \n     casualties among regional freight railroads in 2004 and 2005;\n       4. During the past 10 years, DM had 107 accidents \n     involving trains carrying hazardous materials, including a \n     record 16 in 2005; and\n       5. Since 2003, when the Federal Railroad Administration \n     (FRA) loaned DM $233 million, the DM's main track \n     accident rate has soared to eight times the national rate--a \n     75 percent increase over its pre-loan rate.\n       The U.S. government has repeatedly identified safety \n     problems at the DM In 2002, the DM signed an Expedited \n     Consent Agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency \n     (EPA) agreeing to pay a civil penalty and correct violations \n     of federal regulations. In 2005, the Occupational Safety & \n     Health Administration (OSHA) cited and fined the DM for \n     serious safety violations. The FRA placed the DM under a \n     Safety Compliance Agreement in October 2005.\n       The DM has claimed that its abysmal safety record is the \n     result of old track, but the FRA has rejected that excuse--\n     most recently in its October 2005 Safety Compliance \n     Agreement. During the past six years track defects caused \n     only about one-half of the DM's train accidents and track \n     defects had nothing to do with the company's high rate of \n     accidents at highway-rail crossings or its high rate of \n     employee casualties. New track will not change the company's \n     cavalier attitude toward safety.\n       In 2003, the FRA entered into a $233 million loan agreement \n     with the DM Since that time the DM's poor safety record \n     has gotten materially worse--not better. There is simply no \n     reason to believe that lending the DM another $2.5 billion \n     would change the result or the company's approach to safety.\n       Rochester, Minnesota, is home to 40 per cent of all the \n     people who live along the DM's proposed expansion route. \n     Rochester is also home to Mayo Clinic, one of the world's \n     leading medical centers. Many of Mayo's patient-care \n     facilities are within hundreds of feet of the DM's tracks--\n     at ground level. An accident involving the spill of hazardous \n     materials near Mayo Clinic, with its vulnerable patient \n     population, would be disastrous. The safety risks posed by an \n     unsafe railroad transporting hazardous materials at high \n     speeds near a world-renowned medical center should not be \n     subsidized by the U.S. government. It is wrong for a safety \n     organization like the FRA to reward a company for \n     disregarding the safety of the public and its own employees. \n     The American people would be shocked to learn that the U.S. \n     government is considering giving an unsafe railroad one of \n     the largest loans to a private company in the history of the \n     United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/20/senate-section/article/S8043-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             GLENDALE HIGH SCHOOL REACHING JUNIOR G8 SUMMIT\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

RUFFING\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I take a moment to recognize someone \nwho has provided invaluable assistance to the Budget Committee for many \nyears. After 25 years of service at the Congressional Budget Office, or \nCBO, as we call it, Kathy A. Ruffing will be retiring at the end of \nthis month.\n  During her tenure at CBO, Ms. Ruffing earned a well-deserved \nreputation for tirelessly producing high-quality analyses on a wide \nrange of topics including interest costs and the Federal debt, Federal \npay, immigration,\n\n[[Page S8044]]\n\nand Social Security. In particular, Members and their staffs came to \ndepend on Kathy's thorough knowledge of the Social Security Program as \nthey developed proposals for addressing the program's financial status \nand benefit structure. She also made major contributions to CBO's \nreports on the economic and budget outlook and the reestimates of the \nPresident's budget. Her analyses always displayed those characteristics \nof CBO's reports that we in the Congress most value--impartiality, \nclarity, and comprehensiveness. In fact, Kathy was a principal \narchitect of the formats of many tables on which the Budget Committee \nhas come to rely so heavily.\n  The Congress will feel the loss of a dedicated public servant who \nselflessly worked extraordinary hours in helping us advance the \nlegislative process. We will miss Kathy's expertise and counsel.\n  I know that I speak for all of the Members who have served on the \nBudget Committees of the House and Senate during the past 25 years and \nall of our staff when I express our gratitude to Kathy for all of her \ncontributions to the legislative process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/20/senate-section/article/S8044-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:48 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nhaving proceeded to reconsider the bill (H.R. 810) to amend the Public \nHealth Service Act to provide for human embryonic stem cell research, \nreturned by the President of the United States with his objections, to \nthe House of Representatives, in which it originated, it was resolved, \nthat the said bill do not pass, two-thirds of the House of \nRepresentatives not agreeing to pass the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/20/senate-section/article/S8044-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  The President pro tempore (Mr. Stevens) reported that he had signed \nthe following enrolled bill, which was previously signed by the Speaker \nof the House:\n\n       H.R. 5117.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Florida \n     relative to urging Congress to support a National Catastrophe\n\n[[Page S8045]]\n\n     Insurance Program; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n     Urban Affairs.\n\n                        House Memorials No. 541\n\n       Whereas, during the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons, the \n     State of Florida was devastated by eight hurricanes and four \n     tropical storms, causing approximately $35 billion in \n     estimated gross probable insurance losses, and\n       Whereas, the hurricanes from the 2004 and 2005 hurricane \n     seasons have produced high winds, coastal storm surges, \n     torrential rainfalls, and flooding resulting in significant \n     damage to Florida and the Gulf Coast states, which has \n     resulted in displacement of policyholders from their \n     dwellings, loss of personal belongings and contents, closing \n     of businesses and financial institutions, and temporary loss \n     of employment and has created numerous health and safety \n     issues within our local communities, and\n       Whereas, in 1992, Hurricane Andrew resulted in \n     approximately $20.8 billion in insured losses and was \n     previously the costliest catastrophe in the United States, \n     but Hurricane Katrina alone left the Gulf Coast states with \n     an estimated loss of approximately $35 billion, and\n       Whereas, natural disasters continually threaten communities \n     across the United States with extreme weather conditions that \n     pose an immediate danger to the lives, property, and security \n     of the residents of those communities, and\n       Whereas, the insurance industry, state officials, and \n     consumer groups have been striving to develop solutions to \n     insure mega-catastrophic risks, because hurricanes, \n     earthquakes, tornadoes, typhoons, floods, wildfires, ice \n     storms, and other natural catastrophes continue to affect \n     policyholders across the United States, and\n       Whereas, on November 16 and 17, 2005, insurance \n     commissioners from Florida, California, Illinois, and New \n     York convened a summit to devise a national catastrophe \n     insurance plan which would more effectively spread insurance \n     risks and help mitigate the tremendous financial damage \n     survivors contend with following such catastrophes: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Florida, That \n     the Congress of the United States is urged to support a \n     National Catastrophe Insurance Program. Policyholders require \n     a rational insurance mechanism for responding to the economic \n     losses resulting from catastrophic events. The risk of \n     catastrophes must be addressed through a public-private \n     partnership involving individuals, private industry, local \n     and state governments, and the Federal Government. A national \n     catastrophe insurance program is necessary to promote \n     personal responsibility among policyholders; support strong \n     building codes, development plans, and other mitigation \n     tools; maximize the risk-bearing capacity of the private \n     markets; and provide quantifiable risk management through the \n     Federal Government. The program should encompass:\n       (1) Providing consumers with a private market residential \n     insurance program that provides all-perils protection.\n       (2) Promoting personal responsibility through mitigation; \n     promoting the retrofitting of existing housing stock; and \n     providing individuals with the ability to manage their own \n     disaster savings accounts that, similar to health savings \n     accounts, accumulate on a tax-advantaged basis for the \n     purpose of paying for mitigation enhancements and \n     catastrophic losses.\n       (3) Creating tax-deferred insurance company catastrophe \n     reserves to benefit policyholders. These tax-deferred \n     reserves would build up over time and only be eligible to be \n     used to pay for future catastrophic losses.\n       (4) Enhancing local and state government's role in \n     establishing and maintaining effective building codes, \n     mitigation education, and land use management; promoting \n     state emergency management, preparedness, and response; and \n     creating state or multistate regional catastrophic risk \n     financing mechanisms such as the Florida Hurricane \n     Catastrophe Fund.\n       ( 5) Creating a national catastrophe financing mechanism \n     that would provide a quantifiable level of risk management \n     and financing for mega-catastrophes; maximizing the risk-\n     bearing capacity of the private markets; and allowing for \n     aggregate risk pooling of natural disasters funded through \n     sound risk-based premiums paid in correct proportion by all \n     policyholders in the United States. Be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this memorial be dispatched to the \n     President of the United States, to the President of the \n     United States Senate, to the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and to each member of the Florida \n     delegation to the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-394. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Massachusetts relative to \n     memorializing the Congress of the United States to provide \n     relief from growing energy costs; to the Committee on Energy \n     and Natural Resources.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, high fuel prices have a negative impact on the \n     standard of living of consumers and high fuel prices have a \n     negative impact on the productivity of businesses; and\n       Whereas, according to the United States Department of \n     Energy, Massachusetts citizens pay some of the highest energy \n     prices in the Nation, behind only Hawaii and Washington, DC; \n     and\n       Whereas, as of May 12, 2006, AAA reports the current \n     average price of a gallon of gasoline in Massachusetts to be \n     $2.93, up from $2.186 only a year ago; and\n       Whereas, as of May 2, 2006, the Massachusetts Division of \n     Energy Resources reported the average price of a gallon of \n     heating oil in Massachusetts to be $2.58, up from $1.91 and \n     $1.49 at this time of the year in 2005 and 2004 respectively; \n     and\n       Whereas, home heating and electricity expenditures for \n     Massachusetts residents are expected to be up by over one \n     third this year (October 2005-October 2006), this being an \n     average increase of $700 per family or 0.6 percent of \n     personal income; and\n       Whereas, high fuel prices impose an especially high burden \n     on low-income families and the United States Department of \n     Energy found that the average American spends 3.5 percent of \n     their income on energy bills, but low-income households \n     average 14 percent of their income; and\n       Whereas, the President's 2006 budget included cuts of some \n     $9.7 million over the next 4 years to the low-income home \n     energy assistance program, which benefits many Massachusetts \n     seniors; and\n       Whereas, according to a 2005 National Consumer Law Report, \n     as a result of 3 of the past 4 years having unprecedented \n     heating oil and natural gas prices, Massachusetts' \n     residential consumers have higher averages than they have \n     ever faced and community action agencies are reporting more \n     aggressive collection activities from some utilities as well \n     as encountering greater difficulty negotiating payment plans \n     for low-income customers; and\n       Whereas, poor road conditions exacerbate the impact of high \n     fuel costs by reducing fuel economy; and\n       Whereas, according to a 2005 United States Department of \n     Transportation report of road conditions reported in 2004, \n     only 1,659 miles of Massachusetts' roads were classified as \n     good to very good compared with 3,748 miles of roads \n     classified as mediocre to poor; and\n       Whereas, a report by the American Society of Civil \n     Engineers found that 71 percent of Massachusetts' major roads \n     are in poor or mediocre condition and driving on roads in \n     need of repair costs Massachusetts' motorists $2,300,000,000, \n     or $501 per motorist, annually in extra vehicle repairs and \n     operating costs; and\n       Whereas, this same report found that 51 percent of \n     Massachusetts' bridges are structurally deficient or \n     functionally obsolete; and\n       Whereas, oil companies have reported record quarterly \n     profits for the first quarter of 2006: Now therefore be it\n       Resolved, that the Massachusetts Senate memorializes the \n     Congress and the President of the United States to \n     immediately institute a windfall profits tax on energy \n     companies which have benefited from the current \n     circumstances, the proceeds of which shall be distributed to \n     the States for the purpose of providing relief to motorists, \n     homeowners and businesses through policies and programs that \n     provide direct subsidy to low and moderate income consumers \n     and small businesses, and some of the proceeds may also be \n     used for road and bridge work and programs which promote the \n     development and use of alternative energy and fuels; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, that a copy of these resolutions shall be \n     transmitted forthwith by the Clerk of the Senate to the \n     President of the United States, presiding Members of each \n     House of the Congress of the United States, and the Members \n     thereof from the Commonwealth.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-395. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to appropriating sufficient funds for the recovery \n     of the shrimp industry and voting against the repeal of the \n     ``Byrd Amendment''; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 117\n\n       Whereas, Louisiana is the nation's largest producer of \n     wild-caught shrimp and has the nation's only warm water \n     shrimp cannery; and\n       Whereas, before Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Louisiana \n     generated an estimated one hundred twenty million pounds of \n     wild-caught shrimp and sold approximately nine thousand \n     commercial shrimp gear licenses; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana shrimpers constitute the largest \n     community of shrimpers in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico \n     regions; and\n       Whereas, due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the shrimp \n     industry suffered devastating economic and infrastructure \n     losses; and\n       Whereas, due to the hurricanes, assessments estimate that \n     for the shrimp industry the total potential production lost \n     at the retail level is approximately nine hundred nineteen \n     million dollars; and\n       Whereas, the influx of foreign shrimp sold at below market \n     prices causes domestic prices to drop to levels at which \n     domestic producers are unable to survive in the industry; and\n       Whereas, the United States House Committee on Ways and \n     Means recommended a repeal of the provision of the Continued \n     Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act commonly known as the ``Byrd \n     Amendment''; and\n       Whereas, the ``Byrd Amendment'' required duties to be \n     collected under antidumping and countervailing duty orders \n     and required payment to eligible domestic producers who \n     initiated the petition which resulted in the imposition of \n     the duties; and\n\n[[Page S8046]]\n\n       Whereas, Louisiana was one of the original states to \n     initiate a petition against foreign shrimp producers; and\n       Whereas, taking into consideration the potential repeal of \n     the ``Byrd Amendment'' and the effects of Hurricanes Katrina \n     and Rita, the shrimp industry and the state of Louisiana \n     stand to suffer severe financial losses: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Legislature of Louisiana memorializes the Congress of the \n     United States to appropriate sufficient funds for the \n     recovery of the shrimp industry.

Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah \n     encourages each state entity to work in partnership with \n     private outreach campaigns to identify and utilize existing \n     communications mechanisms to inform Utahns about the \n     availability of the EITC and VITA programs, which may include \n     state publications, websites, human resource materials and \n     communications, correspondence and forms from the State Tax \n     Commission, targeted printed materials, caseworker and client \n     interactions, and application materials for state assistance \n     and state licenses. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah \n     encourages each state entity to utilize existing state \n     infrastructure, where appropriate, to support EITC outreach \n     and statewide availability of the VITA program, which may \n     include utilizing Department of Workforce Services Employment \n     Centers and other appropriate locations as VITA sites, \n     staffed by trained VITA volunteers, between January and \n     April, encouraging local school districts to integrate EITC \n     outreach and VITA services into their parent involvement and \n     community school efforts, and utilizing economic development \n     tools and negotiations to encourage and support EITC outreach \n     and employment-based VITA sites where appropriate. Be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be sent to each \n     department of Utah State Government.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-397.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Kansas relative to extending certain \n     provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965; to the Committee \n     on the Judiciary.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 5037\n\n       Whereas, on March 7, 1965, a group of civil rights marchers \n     gathered at the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama, and \n     their efforts to advance equal voting rights brought a brutal \n     and bloody response. Eight days later President Johnson \n     called for a comprehensive and effective voting rights bill \n     to guarantee to our citizens the rights contained in the 14th \n     and 15th amendments to the United States constitution. A \n     bipartisan congress approved landmark legislation, and on \n     August 6, 1965, President Johnson signed the Voting Rights \n     Act into law; and\n       Whereas, considered one of the most successful pieces of \n     civil rights legislation ever adopted, the act bans literacy \n     tests and poll taxes, outlaws intimidation during the \n     electoral process, authorizes federal election monitors and \n     observers and creates various means for protecting and \n     enforcing racial and language minority voting rights. The act \n     was amended in 1975 to facilitate equal political opportunity \n     for language minority citizens and in 1982 to protect the \n     rights of voters with disabilities; and\n       Whereas, despite noteworthy progress from 40 years of \n     enforcement of the act, voter inequities, disparities and \n     obstacles still remain for many minority voters; and\n       Whereas, Section 5 of the act is scheduled to expire in \n     2007. This section contains a special enforcement provision \n     targeted at those areas of the country where congress \n     believes the potential for discrimination to be high and \n     prohibits any change affecting voters until the attorney \n     general has determined that the change will not worsen the \n     ability of minority voters to vote. Sections 4(f) and 203 \n     will also expire in 2007. These sections require bilingual \n     voting assistance for language minority communities in \n     certain jurisdictions. The language minority provisions apply \n     to four language minority groups: American Indians, Asian \n     Americans, Alaskan natives and persons of Spanish heritage; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Voting Rights Act is a critical link in the \n     struggle to enfranchise the politically marginalized. Without \n     reauthorization of these special provisions of the act, \n     America risks a resurgence of voter discrimination: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, By the House of Representatives of the State of \n     Kansas, the Senate concurring therein, That the Kansas \n     legislature memorializes the Congress of the United States to \n     extend these critical provisions of the Voting Rights Act of \n     1965; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State provide an enrolled \n     copy of this resolution to the President of the United States \n     Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives and each member of the Kansas legislative \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-401.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nestablish Medicare Health Savings Accounts; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nestablish medicare health savings accounts, HSAs. This bill will make \nHSAs available under Medicare in lieu of Medicare medical savings \naccounts, MSAs. I have long been dedicated to quality health care and \nbelieve that seniors should have the ability to make their own \ndecisions regarding their health care, so they can receive the health \ncare they need and deserve. As a senior myself, I appreciate how \nimperative it is that we seniors be provided with a wide array of \nchoices.\n  My desire to see my fellow Oklahomans and all Americans receive the \nbest possible health care is evidenced by my involvement in various \nhealth-related issues. I have always been a champion of rural health \ncare providers. In 1997, I was one of the few Republicans to vote \nagainst the Balanced Budget Act because of its lack of support for \nrural hospitals. At that time, I made a commitment to not allow our \nrural hospitals to be closed and am pleased we finally addressed that \nimportant issue in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 by providing \ngreat benefits for rural health care providers as well as a voluntary \nprescription drug benefit to seniors. In 2003, I also co-sponsored the \nHealth Care Access and Rural Equity Act, to protect and preserve access \nof Medicare beneficiaries to health care in rural regions.\n  In order to assist my State and other States suffering from large \nreduction in their Federal medical assistance percentage, FMAP, for \nMedicaid, I introduced S.1754, a bill to apply a State's FMAP from \nfiscal year 2005 to fiscal years 2006 through 2014 on September 22, \n2005. The purpose of this legislation is to prevent drastic reductions \nin FMAP while revision of the formula itself is considered.\n\n[[Page S8051]]\n\n  I am a strong advocate of medical liability reform and am an original \ncosponsor of S. 22, the Medical Care Access Protection Act, and S. 23, \nthe Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act. These bills \nprotect patients' access to quality and affordable health care by \nreducing the effects of excessive liability costs. I am committed to \nthis vital reform that would alleviate the burden placed on physicians \nand patients by excessive medical malpractice lawsuits.\n  I have also worked with officials from the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, CMS, to expand access to life-saving implantable \ncardiac defibrillators and many other numerous regulations that would \naffect my rural State such as the 250-yard rule for critical access \nhospitals.\n  As a supporter of safety and medical research, I have cosponsored \nlegislation to increase the supply of pancreatic islet cells for \nresearch and a bill to take the abortion pill RU-486 off the market in \nthe United States.\n  I also introduced S. 96, the Flu Vaccine Incentive Act, to help \nprevent any future shortages in flu vaccines in both the 108th and \n109th Congresses. My bill removes suffocating price controls from \ngovernment purchasing of the flu vaccine while encouraging \nmore companies to enter the market. Also, my bill frees American \ncompanies to enter the flu vaccine industry by giving them an \ninvestment tax credit towards the construction of flu vaccine \nproduction facilities.\n\n  As a result of my sister's death from cancer and treatment we learned \nabout not accessible in the United States that might have saved her \nlife, Senator Sam Brownback and I introduced S. 1956, the Access, \nCompassion, Care and Ethics for Seriously-ill Patients Act--ACCESS--on \nNovember 3, 2005. This bill would offer a three-tiered approval system \nfor treatments showing efficacy during clinical trials, for use by the \nseriously ill patient population. Seriously ill patients, who have \nexhausted all alternatives and are seeking new treatment options, would \nbe offered access to these treatments with the consent of their \nphysician.\n  On April 4, 2006, my resolution to designate April 8, 2006, as \n``National Cushing's Syndrome Awareness Day'' passed by unanimous \nconsent. The intent of this resolution is to raise awareness of \nCushing's syndrome, a debilitating disorder that affects an estimated \n10 to 15 million people per million. It is an endocrine or hormonal \ndisorder caused by prolonged exposure of the body's tissue to high \nlevels of the hormone cortisol.\n  Additionally, I have consistently cosponsored yearly resolutions \ndesignating a day in October as ``National Mammography Day'' and a \nweek: in August as ``National Health Center Week'' to raise awareness \nregarding both these issues and have supported passage and enactment of \nnumerous health-care-related bills, such as the Rural Health Care \nCapital Access Act of 2006, which extends the exemption respecting \nrequired patient days for critical access hospitals under the Federal \nhospital mortgage insurance program.\n  As the Federal Government invests in improving hospitals and health \ncare initiatives I have fought hard to ensure that Oklahoma gets its \nfair share. Specifically, over the past 3 years, I have helped to \nsecure $5.2 million in funding for the Oklahoma Medical Research \nFoundation, the Oklahoma State Department of Health planning initiative \nfor a rural telemedicine system, the INTEGRIS Healthcare System, the \nUniversity of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, the Oklahoma Center for \nthe Advancement of Science and Technology, St. Anthony's Heart \nHospital, the Hillcrest Healthcare System, and the Morton Health \nCenter.\n  As a long supporter of HSAs, I believe all people should have access \nto them since they provide great flexibility in the health market and \nallow individuals to have control over their own health care. Medicare \nMSAs have existed since January 1, 1997, revised in December of 2003, \nbut they have not worked. No insurer whatsoever has yet offered any \nMedicare MSA under the current law.\n  To fix this problem, my legislation creates a new HSA program under \nMedicare that incorporates a high-deductible health plan and an HSA \naccount while dissolving the existing Medicare MSA.\n  In tandem with my efforts, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, CMS, are launching an HSA demonstration project that would \ntest allowing health insurance companies to offer Medicare \nbeneficiaries products similar to HSA. This activity points to the \nadministration's support of HSAs and desire to see all seniors receive \nthe best possible coverage.\n  As the July 13, 2006 edition of The Hill, explains, ``no legislation \nis pending that would integrate HSAs into the Medicare program . . .'' \nThus, my legislation is necessary because real Medicare HSA reform is \nneeded in order for seniors to have true flexibility and freedom of \nchoice in their health care.\n  Under my bill, beneficiaries who choose the HSA option will receive \nan annual amount that is equal to 95 percent of the annual Medicare \nAdvantage, MA, capitation rate with respect to the individual's MA \npayment area. These funds provided through the Medicare HSA program can \nonly be used by the beneficiary for the following purposes: as a \ncontribution into an HSA or for payment of high deductible health plan \npremiums. However, the individual also has the opportunity to deposit \npersonal funds in to the Medicare HSA.\n  My bill also guarantees that seniors be notified of the amount they \nwill receive 90 days before receipt to ensure they have time to \ndetermine the best and most appropriate HSA to accommodate needs. The \nbill also allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to deal \nwith fraud appropriately and requires providers to accept payment by \nindividuals enrolled in a Medicare HSA just as they would with an \nindividual enrolled in traditional Medicare.\n  Please join me in supporting this important legislation to give our \nseniors more choices regarding their health care.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Reed, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n        Sarbanes, and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 3698. A bill to mend the Clean Air Act to reduce emissions of \ncarbon dioxide, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Global Warming \nPollution Reduction Act of 2006.\n  One of the most important issues facing mankind is the problem of \nglobal warming. Global warming is real and it is already happening. Its \neffects are being felt across the globe and the longer we delay, the \nmore severe these effects will be. The broad consensus within the \nscientific community is that global warming has begun, is largely the \nresult of human activity, and is accelerating. Atmospheric greenhouse \ngas concentrations have risen to 378 parts per million, nearly one-\nthird above preindustrial levels and higher than at any time during the \npast 400,000 years. Projections indicate that stabilizing \nconcentrations at 450 parts per million would still mean a temperature \nincrease of 2 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit. Such warming will result in more \nextreme weather, increased flooding and drought, disruption of \nagricultural and water systems, threats to human health and loss of \nsensitive species and ecosystems.\n  In order to prevent and minimize these effects, we must take global \nactions to address this issue as soon as possible. We owe that to \nourselves and to future generations.\n  The overwhelming majority of Americans support taking some form of \naction on climate change. I am today introducing the Global Warming \nPollution Reduction Act, which I believe responds to that call. I \nbelieve this is the most far-reaching and forward-thinking climate \nchange bill ever introduced. It sets a goal of an 80 percent reduction \nin global warming pollutants by 2050. It provides a roadmap for actions \nthat we will need to take over the next few decades to combat global \nwarming. I believe that if this bill were passed, it would put us on \nthe path to potentially solving the global warming problem. If it were \npassed, we would reshape our economy to become more energy independent, \ncleaner, and more economically competitive. If it were passed, we would \nhave a chance of avoiding some of the worst and most\n\n[[Page S8052]]\n\ndangerous effects of global warming. If it were passed, we would be in \na position to negotiate with other countries as part of the global \nsolution.\n  Some will say that this bill imposes requirements that ask too much \nof industry. Some will say that this bill contains requirements that we \ncannot easily meet. I say first of all that the costs of inaction \nvastly outweigh the costs of action and that we have a responsibility \nto future generations not to leave the Earth far worse off than when we \nfound it--with a fundamentally altered climate system. Temperature \nchanges, sea level rise, hurricanes, floods, and droughts can affect \nfood production, national security, the spread of disease, and the \nsurvival of endangered species. These are not things to trifle with on \nthe basis of industry cost estimates, which have frequently been \noverstated.\n  But perhaps more importantly, we can act to reduce global warming. We \ncan reduce emissions to 1990 levels between now and 2020 through a \nreduction of just 2 percent per year. Energy efficiency alone could \nplay a major part in reaching reductions, and new technologies can help \nas well. Moreover, additional deployment of existing renewable energy \nsources, including biofuels, can also help substantially. If we were to \ntake the actions suggested in this bill, we would find that we would \nenhance our energy independence, and we would become a world leader in \nclean energy technologies. American innovation can position us as the \nworld leader in clean technologies.\n  In my final year in the Senate, I have often asked myself, What \nlasting actions can I take to make the world a better place? I hope \nthat by proposing real action on climate change, and passing the torch \nto a new generation of those committed to protecting the environment, \nthat I can help make a difference for us all. Global warming is upon us \nnow. The question is, Can we take action now, before it is too late?\n  We know what we need to do, we know how much we must reduce, and we \nhave the technology to do so. The question for this body is, Do we have \nthe political will? Can we overcome our fears and insecurity and act \ndecisively to combat global warming? That is the opportunity and \nchallenge of the coming years, which my bill on global warming seeks to \naddress. I urge my colleagues to join me in the quest for a better, \nsafer world that is free of the enormous threat posed by dangerous \nglobal warming. I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3698\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide private relief; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to introduce a \nbill to provide private relief to the survivors of Christopher Kangas \nof Brookhaven, PA. This is a final attempt to recognize the public \nservice of Christopher Kangas, a junior firefighter of the Brookhaven, \nPA, fire department, who, on May 4, 2002, was struck by a car and \nkilled while riding his bicycle to the site of a fire emergency.\n  I characterize the bill I introduce today as a ``final attempt'' to \nrecognize the public service of Christopher Kangas as a fallen \nfirefighter because previous legislative corrections have been blocked \nwhile the Kangas family languishes in the lengthy appeals process to \noverturn the U.S. Department of Justice's, DOJ, denial of public safety \nofficer benefits. During both the 108th and 109th Congresses, I \nintroduced the Christopher Kangas Fallen Firefighter Apprentice Act, S. \n2695 and S. 491, respectively, designed to correct a flaw in the \ncurrent definition of ``firefighter'' under the Public Safety Officer \nBenefits Act. That legislation would clarify that all firefighters will \nbe recognized as such ``regardless of age, status as an apprentice or \ntrainee, or duty restrictions imposed because of age or status as an \napprentice or trainee'' and applies retroactively to the date of \nChristopher Kangas' death in 2002. However, this legislation has been \nprevented from moving forward due to objections that expansion of \nbenefits under the program would result in a serious drain on the \nTreasury when, in fact, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated \nthat this bill would cost approximately $2 million in the first year of \nenactment and an average of less than $500,000 in each year thereafter.\n  In addition to a legislative remedy, Christopher Kangas' family has \nbeen pursuing the Federal benefit through the U.S. Federal Claims \nCourt. On March 27, 2006, the court ruled in favor of the Kangas family \nordering DOJ to pay $250,000. However, on May 26, 2006, DOJ filed a \nnotice of appeal to this decision, further delaying recognition of \nChristopher Kangas' public service and status as a fallen firefighter.\n  Under Pennsylvania law, 14- and 15-year-olds such as Christopher are \npermitted to serve as volunteer junior firefighters. While they are not \nallowed to operate heavy machinery or enter burning buildings, the law \npermits them to fill a number of important support roles, such as \nproviding first aid. In addition, the junior firefighter program is an \nimportant recruitment tool for fire stations throughout the \nCommonwealth. In fact, prior to his death Christopher had received 58 \nhours of training that would have served him well when he graduated \nfrom the junior program.\n  It is clear to me that Christopher Kangas was a firefighter killed in \nthe line of duty. Were it not for his status as a junior firefighter \nand his prompt response to a fire alarm, Christopher would still be \nalive today. Indeed, the Brookhaven Fire Department, Brookhaven \nBorough, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have all\n\n[[Page S8060]]\n\nrecognized Christopher's public service as a fallen public safety \nofficer and provided the appropriate death benefits to his family.\n  Yet while those closest to the tragedy have recognized Christopher as \na fallen firefighter, the Federal Government has not. The Department of \nJustice determined that Christopher Kangas was not eligible for \nbenefits based on a twofold interpretation of the law. First, because \nhe was deemed as not acting within a narrow range of duties at the time \nof his death that are the measured criteria to be considered a \n``firefighter,'' and therefore, was not a ``public safety officer'' for \npurposes of the Public Safety Officer Benefits Act. Second, that his \ndeath was deemed as not sustained in the ``line of duty'' because as a \njunior firefighter he was prohibited from operating a hose on a ladder \nor entering a burning building. As a result of this determination, \nChristopher's family cannot receive a Federal line-of-duty benefit. In \naddition, Christopher is barred from taking his rightful place on the \nNational Fallen Firefighters Memorial in Emmitsburg, MD. For a young \nman who dreamed of being a firefighter and gave his life rushing to a \nfire, keeping him off of the memorial is a grave injustice.\n  Any firefighter will tell you that there are many important roles to \nplay in fighting a fire beyond operating the hoses and ladders. \nFirefighting is a team effort, and everyone in the Brookhaven Fire \nDepartment viewed young Christopher as a full member of their team. As \nsuch, I support amending the Public Safety Officer Benefits Act to \nensure that the Federal Government will recognize Christopher Kangas \nand others like him as firefighters. However, considering the \nsignificant opposition to that solution, I am offering this private \nbill in honor of Christopher Kangas to provide his family with the \n$250,000 as ordered by the Federal Claims Court and to allow his name \nto be included on the National Fallen Firefighter's Memorial.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 3701. A bill to determine successful methods to provide protection \nfrom catastrophic health expenses for individuals who have exceeded \nhealth insurance coverage for uninsured individuals, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, every Congress and a number I have served \nin since 1997, nearly 10 years ago, Senator Wyden and I, my colleague \nfrom Oregon, have put forward a bipartisan agenda of things we could do \nas a Republican and Democrat to advance the interests of our Nation and \nspecifically the interests of our State. It has been a genuine pleasure \nto work with him in achieving much good for Oregon and trying to set a \nbetter example of how Republicans and Democrats can function first as \nAmericans and not as partisans.\n  Today as part of our agenda for the 109th Congress, we introduce what \nwas item No. 1 on our bipartisan agenda. We have entitled it the \nCatastrophic Health Coverage Promotion Act. It addresses one of the \nmost difficult challenges facing Congress, that of rising health care \ncosts. Getting to a solution on this is daunting. It is not easy to \nsolve. Health care is the ultimate turf battle. But for decades health \ncare costs have increased consistently and little has been done to slow \nthem.\n  While there are a number of factors driving this growth, the \nuninsured play a major role in driving those costs up. Last year 46 \nmillion Americans reported lacking health insurance coverage. In our \nState of Oregon, 600,000 individuals, 17 percent of the population, are \nuninsured. What some fail to realize is that the individuals without \nhealth insurance coverage nevertheless get health coverage. They do so \nthrough emergency rooms, even when they haven't the money to pay. The \nresult is billions of dollars of uncompensated care incurred by State \ngovernments, community providers, physicians, and hospitals.\n  In 2006 alone, Oregon's hospitals provided a total of $500 million in \nuncompensated care, a 262-percent increase since 1995. Americans absorb \nthe impact of uncompensated care by having to pay higher prices for \nhealth services overall. They are simply passed on in the cost of our \ninsurance policies. Small businesses have been hit hard by rising \nhealth care costs as well. Most report they would love to be able to \noffer health care, but most small businesses are trying to save their \neconomic lives, not cover the health care of their employees. But they \nwould like to.\n  If we do our work right, Senator Wyden and I may have come up with a \nproduct that may help them to provide some coverage. If a small \nbusiness had extra protection in the form of a catastrophic policy for \ntheir employees, it might be able to extend the most basic kind of \ncare, the kind that says: If you lose your health, you don't lose your \nhome; you don't penalize everyone else in the business.\n  I know something of this, Mr. President, because having provided \nhealth care for hundreds of employees, it was the inexpensive \ncomprehensive package that overlaid those that ultimately was tapped by \none or two employees every year that helped us, in a way, to keep \nhealth care costs more manageable.\n  The legislation Senator Wyden and I have developed will address the \nissue of catastrophic health costs on all fronts. The Catastrophic \nHealth Coverage Promotion Act creates at least four State-based pilot \nprojects that will provide basic coverage to uninsured, as well as \nadditional protection for individuals with significant out-of-pocket \nhealth costs. One of these projects, we hope, will be located in \nOregon. Certainly, it can be if it chooses.\n  Two of the pilots will target the uninsured. States will be given the \ntools they need to offer hybrid health insurance plans that combine a \nprimary and preventive health care benefit with high-deductible \ncatastrophic coverage. Private insurance providers will market these \nplans to uninsured individuals and small businesses.\n  Creating affordable basic coverage options for the uninsured is a \nmuch needed step to reduce the impact of uncompensated care on our \nhealth system. By doing this, we should be able to stabilize, if not \nreduce, overall health care costs. To help make this coverage more \naffordable for low-income workers and families, the bill provides a \ngraduated subsidy to reduce the costs of premiums. Individuals with \nincomes at or below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level would be \neligible for extra help with coverage costs.\n  Many have asked why Senator Wyden and I would decide to focus on \ncatastrophic health coverage, considering that similar policy options \nalready exist and are made widely available. While that may be true, \nthe Federal Government is often in a unique position to help to grow \nexisting markets. I believe the targeted funding included in our bill \nwill help make catastrophic coverage more affordable and more \nattractive to both individuals and small businesses. The solution in \nthis case does not necessarily have to be as big as the problem.\n  While our proposal may not seem to be the ``silver bullet,'' the kind \nof reform our system so desperately needs, it is nevertheless a step in \nthe right direction. As is the case with many difficult problems, \nchange is made incrementally. We are hopeful that the four pilot \nprojects created in this bill will provide policymakers with much \nneeded insight on how to better manage catastrophic health costs.\n  At the end of the day, individuals should not lose their homes just \nbecause they lose their health. Anyone--whether they are uninsured or \nhave generous comprehensive coverage--can fall victim to a serious \nhealth care problem.\n  I am pleased that my colleague and I were able to work together in a \nbipartisan fashion to develop a modest yet workable solution to this \nlongstanding and nagging problem. I urge my colleagues to support the \nlegislation, and I encourage the Senate's leadership to move it quickly \nthrough the process.\n  With that, I yield the floor to my colleague from Oregon, Senator Ron \nWyden.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, how much time remains under the Smith \nunanimous consent request for a half hour?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-two and a half minutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S8061]]\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to join my \ncolleague at this time to discuss the Catastrophic Health Coverage \nPromotion Act that Senator Smith and I are introducing today.\n  Mr. President, first, I want to say how much I appreciate Senator \nGordon Smith. At a time when our citizens all across the land and in \nour home State of Oregon believe there needs to be more bipartisanship, \nSenator Smith doesn't just talk about it, he is consistently willing to \nmeet me more than halfway on critical issues, and he does that with \nother colleagues in the Senate.\n  As we begin our time discussing this legislation, I want to let him \nknow how much I appreciate the chance to cooperate with him once again. \nAs he stated, we did put the issue of catastrophic health coverage at \nthe top of our bipartisan agenda for the Senate session.\n  What it comes down to, Mr. President, is that Senator Smith and I \nbelieve it is a moral blot on our Nation for a country as good and rich \nas ours to send millions of its citizens to bed at night fearing they \nwill be wiped out if a serious medical illness hits them. That is the \nreality. It is the reality for families who have no coverage at all, \nand it is the reality for families who have some measure of coverage, \nsay, through an employer, but it doesn't stretch far enough.\n  Senator Smith and I want, in a bipartisan way, to tackle both of \nthose kinds of concerns. That is why we have put forward the \nlegislation we introduced today. I think now is an ideal time for \nbipartisanship on the catastrophic health coverage issue.\n  If you look back over the last few years, Senator Kerry, in the 2004 \nPresidential campaign, had an excellent proposal with respect to \ncatastrophic coverage, and I said so in the course of that campaign. \nBut I also said at the time that I thought our distinguished majority \nleader, Senator Frist, also had a good catastrophic coverage proposal. \nYou could debate the various merits of the Kerry proposal and the Frist \nproposal--which approach involved a little more government, which \napproach involved the private sector--but at the end of the day, for \nthe purposes of government work, they were pretty darn similar.\n  So when Senator Smith and I sat down after the 2004 election, we said \nlet's finally get this done. Democrats and Republicans have been \ntalking for years about how to make sure that all our citizens have a \nsafety net under them so that they will not get wiped out from medical \nillness. We settled on this approach, which we thought would give us \nthe opportunity to try some fresh, creative ideas for protecting our \ncitizens.\n  Let me give an example of what happens in, for example, South \nCarolina, Oregon, or anywhere else in this country. If you have a small \nbusiness with six people working there, and one of them gets sick, that \nessentially blows up the whole health premium structure for all six of \nthe employees.\n  What we ought to look at is something called reinsurance. Under \nreinsurance, that employee who gets sick could get a bit of help for \ntheir high bills through a modest role for government, and if \ngovernment steps in, in that kind of instance, you have an opportunity \nto hold down all of the costs for the entire six-person firm. So we \nshould have been looking at reinsurance years ago, but because Senator \nSmith, who chairs the Senate Aging Committee, has been examining these \nquestions and has worked with me, now we are going to have a chance to \ntackle it in a way that I think is going to give us the opportunity to \nget the job done.\n  We are also very concerned about people who have no coverage at all. \nSo what happens if you have no coverage at all is folks walk into a \nhospital in Oregon or in South Carolina, usually they show up in the \nemergency room, and the hospital has to absorb those costs. What we \nwould do is give that person who now has no coverage at all the \npossibility of actually buying some private coverage in the marketplace \nwith a bit of a subsidy in order to be able to have coverage that would \npick up at least a portion of those bills that the hospital is now \nabsorbing.\n  At the end of the day, those are the two principal kinds of instances \nwe are facing--folks who have some coverage through a private employer, \nbut it doesn't stretch far enough, and folks who don't have any \ncoverage at all. Under that approach, we would like to make it possible \nfor them to get into the private insurance market, protect them from \ncatastrophic illness. We think we can do it with a modest subsidy \ncoming from government.\n  My sense is that we are now looking at health care on two tracks in \nour country. The first track is a track that suggests we can take steps \nright now in areas like catastrophic coverage to protect our citizens. \nThere are other ideas I have advanced during this Congress. For \nexample, Senator Snowe and I have now gotten a majority of Senators to \nagree with our proposal to lift the restriction so Medicare can bargain \nand hold down the costs. That, like the question of catastrophic \ncoverage, is a step you can take right now. Let's protect our citizens \nfrom the catastrophic illness and let's hold down the costs of \nmedicine. Those are practical, bipartisan approaches that can be taken \ntoday. We ought to pursue them and get them done.\n  I also think there is another track to health care. I noticed that \nSenator Hatch was on the Senate floor. He and I were the authors of the \nlegislation creating the Citizens' Health Care Working Group that is \ngoing to look at opportunities to make sure that all Americans have \ndecent, affordable coverage. We have only been on that issue for more \nthan 60 years--going back to the 81st Congress, in 1945, and Harry \nTruman. I have said let's also work on that second track that involves \ngetting all Americans under the tent for essential and affordable \nhealth care coverage.\n  That obviously isn't going to get done in the next 15 minutes. But if \nthe Senate, on a bipartisan basis, as Senator Smith and I have sought \nto do on the catastrophic issue, and as Senator Hatch and I have sought \nto do on a broader approach to look at health care that works for all \nAmericans--if we team up and look at health care on those two tracks, I \nthink we can make a great contribution for our country.\n  There are no costs going up in the United States like medical bills. \nWe spent $1.7 trillion last year on health care. There are 290 million \nAmericans--I guess we are approaching 300 million. When you divide $1.7 \ntrillion by 290 million Americans, it comes to something like $25,000 \nthat could be sent to every family of four in America with the amount \nof money now being spent on health care.\n  So while we are spending enough money, my sense is that we are not \nspending it in the right places. Once again, Senator Smith has given us \nan opportunity to think creatively about better ways to approach the \nuse of the health care dollars. I was pleased when Senator Smith \nsuggested in our legislation that we also make it possible to include a \nfocus on health care prevention. We are not doing enough with health \ncare prevention in this country. The Medicare Program shows that pretty \nwell. Medicare Part A, for example, will pay huge checks for senior \ncitizens' hospital bills, but Medicare Part B pays virtually nothing \nfor prevention to keep people well. That makes no sense. We need a \nsharper focus on health care prevention, and one of the things that I \nthink is attractive about Senator Smith's leadership on this issue is \nthat he has said even in the context of looking at catastrophic health \ncare, let's put a sharper focus on prevention. We are going to make it \npossible in this legislation to do that.\n  I note we have other colleagues on the floor. I have secured time to \nfocus on the Voting Rights Act legislation later in the afternoon, but \nI am very pleased to have the opportunity to talk for a few minutes \nabout the Catastrophic Health Coverage Promotion Act Senator Smith and \nI are introducing today. We have focused on a number of issues in a \nbipartisan fashion over our years in the Senate, but this has the \npotential to be the biggest as it relates to the needs of our citizens \nat home.\n  We want to make sure when folks go to bed at night, they don't have \nto fear they are going to be wiped out financially by a serious medical \nillness. This legislation moves us one step closer toward the goal. We \nhope many colleagues on both sides of the aisle will want to support \nthe legislation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, Senator Snowe and I today are introducing \nthe\n\n[[Page S8062]]\n\nMedicare Prescription Drug Lifeline Act. This legislation provides a \nsolution for those seniors falling into the coverage gap, also known as \nthe doughnut hole of the Medicare prescription drug benefit. The \ndoughnut hole occurs when the spending for a senior's drug expenses \nreaches $2,250: at the point, the senior is on their own until their \nspending for prescription drugs reaches a total of $5,100, where the \nbenefit picks up again. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that \nnearly 7 million seniors will fall into the coverage gap this year.\n  Seniors who enter this ``no man's land'' of spending face the same \nproblems seniors faced before the drug benefit even began: they skip \ndoses, they don't take all their medicine to make it stretch, and they \nare forced to choose between their food and fuel costs and their \nprescription drug costs.\n  This legislation would take three steps to deal with this problem: \nFirst, the Secretary of HHS would be required to let seniors know they \nare approaching the coverage gap. Second, it would allow seniors, when \nthey are notified that they are reaching the coverage gap, to switch \nplans to avoid the gap. Finally, the legislation requires the \nGovernment Accountability Office to examine ways in which the benefit \ncould be redesigned to eliminate the gap without increasing Federal \nspending. Together, these provisions will give seniors a lifeline to \ncoverage.\n  Senator Snowe and I both voted for the legislation that created the \nMedicare prescription drug benefit. When we did so, we pledged that we \nwould continue to work to improve the benefit. Senator Snowe and I have \nteamed up together on many occasions to try to reduce the cost of the \nprescription drug program by giving the Secretary the same power other \nGovernment officials have to bargain for better prices. Our legislation \nhas won a majority of votes in the Senate, and we intend to continue to \npress for that power.\n  The latest effort is aimed at another shortcoming in the law: finding \na way to help seniors avoid falling into the coverage gap. Senator \nSnowe and I believe that our legislation will help seniors a \nstraightforward way to avoid the gap.\n  Congress needs to address both these issues and we will continue our \nstrong commitment to seniors by working to improve the drug benefit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 3702. A bill to provide for the safety of migrant seasonal \nagricultural workers; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith Senator Snowe that will provide our Nation's migrant agricultural \nand forest workers with a safe ride to work. The Farm and Forestry \nWorker Transportation Safety Act would require a designated seat and \nseatbelt for each person riding in a vehicle used to transport these \nworkers.\n  Today, many migrant workers travel to their jobs in dangerous and \nunsafe conditions. It is not uncommon for these workers to ride in \novercrowded vans and trucks while sitting on benches and buckets with \nno access to seatbelts.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 78 agricultural workers \nlost their lives and 440 were injured in transportation accidents in \n2004.\n  I would like to take a moment to share with you just a few of the \naccidents that have resulted from the lack of adequate safety \nregulations for these workers:\n  In December of 2005, two Guatemalan forest workers were killed when \ntheir vehicle crashed driving off icy roads in Washington. Five \nGuatemalan forest workers were killed in the same manner the previous \nyear.\n  In June of 2004, 2 migrant workers were killed in Port St. Lucie, FL, \nwhen their overcrowded van carrying 11 people rolled over on Interstate \n95. Two months later, 9 citrus workers were killed in Fort Pierce when \ntheir 15-passenger van rolled over and ejected all 19 passengers.\n  In September 2002, 14 forestry workers were killed when their van \ntransporting them to work toppled off a bridge in Maine.\n  In August 1999, 13 tomato field workers were killed when their van \nslammed into a tractor-trailer in Fresno County, CA. Most of the \nvictims were riding on three benches in the back of the van.\n  As you can see, this issue does not just affect my home State of \nCalifornia. It is a problem that requires national attention. Congress \nneeds to take action to ensure these workers safe travel to and from \ntheir jobs. My bill would seek to provide these workers with a \ndesignated seat and operating seatbelt.\n  This legislation would also address the issue of converted vehicles. \nThe bill would direct the Department of Transportation to develop \ninterim seat and seatbelt safety standards for vehicles that have been \nconverted for the purpose of transporting migrant workers. Owners and \noperators of these vehicles would have 7 years to make the necessary \nimprovements so that their vehicles would meet the same safety \nstandards as new vehicles.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in standing up for the safety of \nour Nation's migrant workforce.\n  Mr. President, I request that the text of this legislation appear \nimmediately following this statement in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3702\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Farm and Forestry Worker \n     Transportation Safety Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SEATS AND SEAT BELTS FOR MIGRANT AND SEASONAL \n                   AGRICULTURAL WORKERS.\n\n       (a) Seats.--Except as provided in subsection (d), in \n     promulgating vehicle safety standards under the Migrant and \n     Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (29 U.S.C. 1801 \n     et seq.) for the transportation of migrant and seasonal \n     agricultural workers by farm labor contractors, agricultural \n     employers or agricultural associations, the Secretary of \n     Labor shall ensure that each occupant or rider in, or on, any \n     vehicle subject to such standards is provided with a seat \n     that is a designated seating position (as such term is \n     defined for purposes of the Federal motor vehicle safety \n     standards issued under chapter 301 of title 49, United States \n     Code).\n       (b) Seat Belts.--Each seating position required under \n     subsection (a) shall be equipped with an operational seat \n     belt, except that this subsection shall not apply with \n     respect to seating positions in buses that would otherwise \n     not be required to have seat belts under the Federal motor \n     vehicle safety standards.\n       (c) Performance Requirements.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Labor, shall issue minimum \n     performance requirements for the strength of seats and the \n     attachment of seats and seat belts in vehicles that are \n     converted, after being sold for purposes other than resale, \n     for the purpose of transporting migrant or seasonal \n     agricultural workers. The requirements shall provide a level \n     of safety that is as close as practicable to the level of \n     safety provided for in a vehicle that is manufactured or \n     altered for the purpose of transporting such workers before \n     being sold for purposes other than resale.\n       (2) Expiration.--Effective on the date that is 7 years \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, any vehicle that is \n     or has been converted for the purpose of transporting migrant \n     or seasonal agricultural workers shall provide the same level \n     of safety as a vehicle that is manufactured or altered for \n     such purpose prior to being sold for purposes other than \n     resale.\n       (d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to alter or modify the regulations contained in \n     section 500.103, or the provision pertaining to \n     transportation that is primarily on private roads in section \n     500.104(l), of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, as in \n     effect on the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (e) Definitions.--The definitions contained in section 3 of \n     the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act \n     (29 U.S.C. 1802) shall apply to this section.\n       (f) Compliance Date.--Not later than 1 year after such date \n     of enactment, and except as provided in subsection (c)(2), \n     all vehicles subject to this Act shall be in compliance with \n     the requirements of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 3703. A bill to provide for a temporary process for individuals \nentering the Medicare coverage gap to switch to a plan that provides \ncoverage in the gap; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today with my \ncolleague and friend, Senator Wyden, with whom I have worked for many \nyears to achieve affordable prescription drug\n\n[[Page S8063]]\n\ncoverage for our seniors. We have certainly come a long way from back \nwhere we were nearly 10 years ago.\n  Yet much remains to be done. As we have seen, the implementation of \nthe Medicare Part D benefit has been difficult, and there is no doubt \nwe are still on the road to a sustainable benefit which our seniors can \neasily navigate. The complexity of the benefit is certainly posing a \nhazard to many of our seniors.\n  Today we face a crisis as millions of seniors are entering a gap in \ntheir prescription drug coverage--the so-called doughnut hole. In fact, \nwhen a senior's drug costs exceed $2,250 this year, they will no longer \nreceive benefits until their spending reaches $5,100. That leaves \nseniors with a full $2,850 of drug costs to absorb before they receive \na single cent of coverage. And they must continue to pay premiums. The \nKaiser Foundation has reported that an estimated 7 million seniors will \nbe affected by this coverage gap. How will they continue to receive \nessential medications?\n  Earlier this year, I offered legislation which would have addressed \nthis issue by allowing every beneficiary to change their plan once this \nyear so that those beneficiaries who realized that they require a more \ncomprehensive plan could choose to change to an appropriate plan. We \nknow that selecting drug coverage was a challenging process for \nseniors, all the more so as the deadline loomed and they struggled to \nget assistance.\n  Many may have made a good decision, but their circumstances may have \nsince changed significantly. How many of us know of a senior who has \nhad a major illness or hospitalization just since January? Most seniors \nin that situation will have changes in their medications as a result \nand often will use more prescription drugs and likely more expensive \nones as well.\n  Finally, with coverage available, there is little doubt that \nphysicians were encouraged to prescribe medications that at last their \npatients could afford--drugs which could prevent serious illness, such \nas heart disease. Yet now, just as seniors see the possibility of a \nfuture with better health, the cost of that critical treatment may be \nunsustainable. So millions are facing the dilemma we have seen before--\ncutting doses or even discontinuing medications. This must not occur \nagain.\n  As many medical experts will tell you, to stop taking essential \nmedications or to begin rationing their use will pose serious safety \nrisks to many of our beneficiaries. That undermines the benefits we \nshould see from Part D--improved health and decreased health \nexpenditures.\n  So Senator Wyden and I are here to offer a solution--one which, I \nmight add, both HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt and Dr. Mark McClellan, \nthe Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \nhave previously suggested they would pursue. That solution is a simple \none--to allow those facing a coverage gap to change to a plan which \nwould offer continuous coverage. That solution has simply not been \nemployed and that compels us to act today, to protect our seniors.\n  The bill I rise to introduce today--the Medicare Prescription Drug \nLifeline Act--truly gives a second chance to those who most need this \ncoverage. Under this legislation we require that CMS notify those who \nare approaching the coverage gap and give them an option of making a \none-time plan change in order to obtain essential drug coverage. Under \nour legislation, beneficiaries could change to any plan which would \nprovide continuous coverage. That includes drug plans which provide \ngeneric or brand-name drugs as well as Medicare Advantage plans \noffering comprehensive drug coverage.\n  In a few States, there is simply not an option which allows a \nbeneficiary to obtain continuous brand-name drug coverage. I note that \nin my State of Maine, as well as in New Hampshire and Alaska, such \ncoverage simply cannot be obtained. So this legislation directs the \nSecretary to provide an option for beneficiary enrollment in a plan \nwith brand-name drug coverage outside their region. That is simply \nfair, and it is essential to ensure that we don't see the doughnut hole \nthreaten the health of our seniors.\n  We know that this coverage gap is an issue we simply must address. \nSeniors need to be able to plan and budget and count on a predictable \nmonthly cost for their essentials of life. When the Congress adopted \nPart D 3 years ago, we said we never wanted to make seniors again \nchoose between buying food and buying essential medicines. Yet without \naddressing the doughnut hole now, we will put seniors in that exact \nposition again.\n  So this legislation also asks the GAO to undertake a study of options \nfor eliminating the doughnut hole--looking at ways to level the benefit \nstructure--including how we might do so without increasing federal \nexpenditures. I note that one might be able to accomplish this, without \nchanging the beneficiary's copayment rates appreciably. Obviously, if \nwe saw some improvement in the pricing of drugs, that certainly would \nhelp get us there.\n  Today our most critical need is to avoid the harm this coverage gap \nposes, and I call on my colleagues to join us in this effort--to \npreserve drug access for our seniors so both they, ad our Medicare \nsystem, realize the benefits of modern medicine.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 3704. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nrequire staff working with developmentally disabled individuals to call \nemergency services in the event of a life-threatening situation; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend Senator \nLautenberg to introduce Danielle's Act, an important piece of \nlegislation that I know will save countless lives. I also recognize \nRepresentative Rush Holt, who has championed the bill in the House and \nhas been a tireless advocate for individuals with disabilities. This \nbill is named in memory of a young woman from New Jersey, Danielle \nGruskowski, whose life was cut tragically short by a failure to call 9-\n1-1. The great State of New Jersey has already passed Danielle's Law, \nand it is time for Congress to act as well.\n  In order to understand the importance of this legislation, I would \nlike to share Danielle's story. She was born December 6, 1969, to Diane \nand Doug Gruskowski and raised in Carteret, NJ. Danielle was \ndevelopmentally disabled and diagnosed with Rett Syndrome, a \nneurological disorder that causes a delay or regression in development, \nincluding speech, hand skills, and coordination. While Danielle needed \nhelp with daily activities, she managed to lead a full and active life. \nAs a young adult, Danielle moved to a group home to experience the \npositive benefits of independent living. Tragically, on November 5, \n2002, Danielle passed away at the age of 32 because no one in the group \nhome called 9-1-1 when she was clearly in need of emergency medical \nattention.\n  So that no other mother would lose her child in such a tragic \ncircumstance, Danielle's mother and her aunt, Robin Turner, developed a \nstrong coalition of supporters and worked with their State \nrepresentatives to develop and pass what we know as Danielle's Law. \nLike the New Jersey law, my bill will require staff working with \nindividuals who have a developmental disability or traumatic brain \ninjury to call emergency services in the event of a life-threatening \nsituation. The legislation would raise the standard of care by \nimproving staff training and ensuring that individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities get emergency care when they need it.\n  All Americans deserve an advocate, and today I am speaking for those \nwho often cannot speak for themselves. I am proud to be an advocate for \nindividuals with disabilities, and I am proud to be an advocate for the \nfamilies in New Jersey who are counting on safe, secure, and healthy \nindependent living environments for their loved ones with disabilities. \nI also would like to recognize the hard-working caregivers and staff \nwho help provide for the needs of those with disabilities. They show \ntheir compassion every day when they show up for work, performing one \nof the most difficult but rewarding jobs in our society--caring for \nsomeone's mother, father, son, or daughter. These caregivers play such \na critical role in our society and their contributions are to be \ncommended. By raising awareness and education about Danielle's Law, my \nhope is that more caregivers will realize how important it is to call \n9-1-1 for all life-threatening situations and\n\n[[Page S8064]]\n\nthat better training and support will be provided to staff across the \ncountry.\n  I am introducing this legislation to remember Danielle and to make \nsure no other family or community experiences the pain and suffering of \nlosing a loved one to an avoidable death. I hope my colleagues will \njoin me in supporting this important bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3704\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nimprove requirements under the Medicaid program for items and services \nfurnished in or through an educational program or setting to children, \nincluding children with developmental, physical, or mental health \nneeds, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my Senate and \nHouse colleagues in introducing the Protecting Children's Health in \nSchools Act of 2006. This bill will ensure that the Nation's 7 million \nschool children with disabilities will have continued access to health \ncare in school.\n  In 1975, the Nation made a commitment to guarantee children with \ndisabilities equal access to education. For these children to learn and \nthrive in schools, the integration of education with health care is of \nparamount importance. Coordination with Medicaid makes an immense \ndifference to schools in meeting the needs of these children.\n  This year, however, the Bush administration has declared its intent \nto end Medicaid reimbursements to schools for the support services they \nneed in order to provide medical and health-related services to \ndisabled children. The administration is saying ``NO'' to any further \nfinancial help to Medicaid-covered disabled children who need \nspecialized transportation to obtain their health services at school. \nIt is saying ``NO'' to any legitimate reimbursement to the school for \ncosts incurred for administrative duties related to Medicaid services.\n  It's bad enough that Congress and the administration have not kept \nthe commitment to ``glide-path'' funding of IDEA needs in 2004. Now the \nadministration proposes to deny funding to schools under the federal \nprogram that supports the health needs of disabled children. It makes \nno sense to make it so difficult for disabled children to achieve in \nschool--both under IDEA and the No Child Left Behind.\n  At stake is an estimated $3.6 billion in Medicaid funds over the next \n5 years. Such funding is essential to help identify disabled children \nand connect them to services that can meet their special health and \nlearning needs during the school day.\n  This decision by the administration follows years of resisting \nMedicaid reimbursements to schools that provide these services, without \nclear guidance on how schools should appropriately seek reimbursement.\n  The ``Protecting Children's Health in Schools Act'' recognizes the \nimportance of schools as a site of delivery of health care. It ensures \nthat children with disabilities can continue to obtain health services \nduring the school day. The bill also provides for clear and consistent \nguidelines to be established, so that schools can be held accountable \nand seek appropriate reimbursement.\n  The legislation has the support of over 60 groups, including parents, \nteachers, principals, school boards, and health care providers--people \nwho work with children with disabilities every day and know what is \nneeded to facilitate their growth, development, and long-term success.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to join us in supporting these children \nacross the Nation, by providing the realistic support their schools \nneed in order to meet these basic health care requirements of their \nstudents.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that the attached bill be \nprinted into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3705\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat \nspaceports like airports under the exempt facility bond rules; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, today I rise with my colleagues, \nSenators Feinstein, Nelson of Florida, Hutchison, and Bingaman, on the \n37th anniversary of the lunar landing when American astronauts Neil \nArmstrong and Edwin Aldrin set foot on the Moon, to introduce the \nSpaceport Equity Act of 2006--a bill to help bring additional \ninvestment to the space transportation industry.\n  On June 18th, the Washington Post reported on the launching of \nKazakhstan's first satellite and their catapult into the space \ntransportation industry. Home to the world's largest space center, the \nBaikonur Consmodrome, this ex-Soviet state is joining the list of \nrivals to the U.S. space industry. America's competitive edge is \ndeclining and will continue to do so unless we act now. My colleagues \nand I recognize this, and that is why we are introducing this most \nimportant legislation.\n  U.S. satellite manufacturers face increasing pressure to consider the \nuse of foreign launch vehicles and launch sites, due to the lack of a \nsufficient domestic launch capability. The United States once dominated \nthe commercial satellite-manufacturing field with an average market \nshare of 83 percent;\n\n[[Page S8067]]\n\nhowever, that market share has since declined to 50 percent. An even \nsmaller share of U.S.-manufactured satellites is actually launched from \nU.S. spaceports. This comes at an estimated loss of $1.5 to $3.0 \nbillion to the U.S. economy.\n  The space economy is made up infrastructure of manufacturers, service \nproviders, and technologists in both the Government and private sector \nthat deploy and operate launch vehicles, satellites, and space \nplatforms. Many everyday goods and services rely on space \ninfrastructure, including broadcast, cable, and satellite television, \nglobal internet services, satellite radio, cellular and international \nphone calls, etc.\n  Satellites are also used for global positioning systems, known as \nGPS, which enable us to have hands-on directions in our cars and \nvehicles. GPS is also influential in the trucking, aviation, and \nmaritime industries for day-to-day operations and for our Nation's \nmilitary operations. Thousands of gas stations use inexpensive small \nsatellite dishes to connect to credit card networks so customers can \npay instantly at the pump. Satellites also generate 90 percent of the \nweather forecasting data in the United States and are used to track \nhurricanes, tsunamis, and other weather phenomenon.\n  These satellites are launched vertically atop of rockets, propelling \nthem into orbit in space. Because most U.S. space-launch facilities are \noperated by NASA, priority for launches at these facilities is given to \nGovernment projects. This means our commercial satellite needs take a \nback seat to Government operations. This often leaves U.S. commercial \nsatellite ventures without reliable launch availability. This in turn \nhas forced many companies seeking manufacturing and launch services \ntoward our international competitors.\n  Spaceports are subdivisions of State governments that provide \nadditional launch infrastructure than that available at Federal \nfacilities. They attract and promote the U.S. commercial space \ntransportation industry. Spaceport authorities function much like \nairport and port authorities by providing economic and transportation \nincentives to the industry, which in turn benefits the surrounding \ncommunities. Many States are forming space authorities to pursue ways \nof developing space transportation infrastructure.\n  The Florida Space Authority was the first such entity, which was \ncreated as a subdivision of the Florida State government by Florida's \nGovernor and State legislature in 1989. Florida Space Authority is \nfocused on leading the State's space industry in new directions through \npartnering with the commercial space industry to improve space \ntransportation and provide innovative, forward-thinking solutions to \nthe challenges facing this evolving industry.\n  The last few years have begun a new phase in space exploration. \nSpaceports presently operate in Florida, California, Virginia, and \nAlaska, but efforts are underway to establish 13 additional commercial \nspaceports in Alabama, California, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, South \nDakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin.\n  The commercial space transportation industry includes not only \nspaceports themselves but also companies that develop the needed \ninfrastructure for testing and servicing launch vehicles. When \nincluding these industry partners with spaceports, at least 23 States \nare directly impacted by the commercial space transportation industry. \nBoth spaceports and industry partners face increasing pressure from \ngovernment-sponsored or subsidized competitors in Europe, China, Japan, \nIndia, Australia, Russia, and now Kazakhstan.\n  Commercial space transportation is a growing part of the U.S. \neconomy. In 2004, this industry alone generated a total of nearly $98.1 \nbillion dollars in economic activity, over $25 billion in earnings, and \nover 550,000 jobs; and $56.5 billion, more than half of this economic \nactivity, was from satellite services. A 2004 Gallup poll shows \noverwhelming public support for space exploration. Roughly 80 percent \nof Americans agree that ``America's space program helps give America \nthe scientific and technological edge it needs to compete in the \ninternational marketplace.'' And 76 percent agree that our space \nprogram ``benefits the nation's economy'' and inspires ``students to \npursue careers in technical fields.''\n  The space industry has also led to a number of ``spin-off'' \ntechnologies--those influenced by space technology research and \ndevelopment. Home roof insulation and air filtration, antilock brakes, \nathletic shoes, vehicle protective airbags, cellular phones, and lasik \nsurgery all owe thanks to NASA and space-based research. The list of \nspace ``spin-off' technologies is estimated to exceed 40,000. These \nrelated technologies have helped employ tens of millions of Americans. \nEncouraging commercial investment in the space industry and increasing \nU.S. marketshare in this industry will certainly lead to additional \ninnovation and technology that will impact other fields.\n  As you can see, this once government-dominated industry is now \nbecoming a diverse mix of government and commercial entities--also \nleading way into future avenues of commercial space transportation, \nsuch as space tourism.\n  The increase in recent commercial launches includes the debut of the \nfirst commercial crewed suborbital launches of SpaceShipOne--leading \nthe way to public space travel. ``Space tourism,'' as public space \ntravel is now referred, has the potential to become a major growth \nindustry. Recent market studies have shown space tourism has the \npotential to become a billion-dollar industry within 20 years.\n  Even though the average American may not be able to participate in \npublic space travel, its potential impact on our economy and \ninternational competitiveness is something to be appreciated. Space \ntourism industry players expect there to be a market demand of at least \n15,000 Americans per year to travel into suborbit and orbital flights. \nThis would require an estimated 665 launches per year by 2010. If the \nUnited States continues as is, we will only be able to capture 10 \npercent market share, at best, of this emerging industry. If needed \ninfrastructure is added, however, the United States is expected to pick \nup 60 to 70 percent of space flight demand by 2010. Every launch that \nwe do not provide for in the United States means a loss to our economy \nand a gain for our international competitors. The Federal Aviation \nAdministration's Commercial Space Transportation Division expects a $3 \nbillion dollar loss to our economy if we do not meet the rising demand \nfor space tourism.\n  Currently, U.S. launch facilities are few and most are owned and \noperated by the Federal Government, putting commercial users in direct \ncompetition with the U.S. military, NASA, and other Government \nentities, which get priority over commercial projects. If the United \nStates is to remain competitive in the commercial space industry, added \nand improved infrastructure will be needed to support this growing \nindustry.\n  On a more local note, my own State of Florida could stand to gain \nmuch by way of economic development from increased investment in \nspaceport infrastructure. According to recent studies by the Florida \nSpace Authority, increase spaceport infrastructure and activity in \nFlorida could mean as much as $29.7 million in additional economic \nactivity by the year 2015--this does not include the economic activity \ngenerated from impacted tourism, secondary contracts, and spinoff \ntechnologies.\n  Other modes of transportation--highways, airports, and seaports--\ncurrently enjoy a tax incentive for meeting their infrastructure needs, \nso why not spaceports?\n  This Spaceport Equity Act of 2006 would provide spaceports with the \nsame treatment provided for airports, seaports, rail, and other transit \nprojects under the exempt facility bond rules. With international \ncompetition on the rise, our Nation's spaceports are a vital component \nof the infrastructure needed to expand and enhance the U.S. role in the \ninternational space arena. The Spaceport Equity Act is an important \nstep to increasing our competitiveness in this field because it will \nstimulate investment in expanding and modernizing our space launch \nfacilities and lower the costs of financing spaceport projects.\n  Since 1968, tax-exempt bonds have played a crucial role in meeting \nairport investment needs, with 50 percent or more of major airport \nprojects being financed through municipal tax-exempt\n\n[[Page S8068]]\n\nbonds. By extending this favorable tax treatment to spaceports, this \nbill will help meet spaceport needs and increase our Nation's ability \nto compete with expanded international interests in space exploration \nand technology. Similar legislation has been considered since the \n1980s, and we cannot afford to wait any longer to address the needs of \nthis important sector.\n  This proposal does not provide direct Federal spending for our \ncommercial space transportation industry but, rather, creates the \nconditions necessary to stimulate private capital investment in \nindustry infrastructure. By issuing tax-free bonds to finance spaceport \ninfrastructure, space authorities could provide site-specific and \nvehicle-specific tailoring to promote the competition and innovation \nnecessary to maintain the U.S. competitive edge in the space \ntransportation industry.\n  This is an efficient means for achieving our space transportation \nneeds, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join us in this most \nimportant effort by cosponsoring this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3706\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to improve retention of public elementary and secondary school \nteachers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Teacher Center \nAct of 2006, to help establish and fund teacher centers across the \nNation. Its goal is to provide more effective and relevant professional \ndevelopment for teachers, and create a network of support for them to \nshare best practices, improve classroom training, and improve working \nconditions in their schools. It's a privilege to join my distinguished \ncolleague, Congressman George Miller, who is introducing companion \nlegislation for teacher centers in the House of Representatives.\n  As research makes clear, good teachers are the single most important \nfactor in achieving the success of students, both academically and \ndevelopmentally. Students who receive good instruction can reach new \nheights through the hard work, vision, and energy of their teachers. \nGood teaching can also overcome the harmful effects of poverty and \nother disadvantages on student learning.\n  In 2002, with the No Child Left Behind Act, we made a commitment to \nput a first-rate teacher in every classroom to help all students \nsucceed in school and in life. But to reach that goal, we need to \nrecruit, train, retain, and support our teachers. Today, about half of \nall teachers who enter the profession leave the classroom within five \nyears. That's an unacceptable loss--the 5-year mark is just the time \nwhen teachers have mastered their work and are consistently able to \nimprove the education of their students.\n  Too often, teachers lack the training and support needed to do well \nin the classroom. Eliminating this deficit can make all the difference \nin their decision to remain in the profession. Teacher centers can help \nsee that teachers have the professional development, mentoring, and \nsupport they need in order to succeed. Developing and expanding these \ncenters is an important step toward enriching teachers' lives, \nenhancing their knowledge and skills, and encouraging them to stay in \nthe profession and succeed in the classroom.\n  The teacher centers model grew out of an innovative approach to \nsupporting the professional development of teachers in England. That \nmodel enables teachers to become leaders and decision-makers in their \nown professional growth and in the environments in which they work. It \nenables them to collaboratively plan and implement staff development \nand reform that can be shared with their colleagues, as a means for \nreflection and improvement in their teaching practice.\n  Since the initial creation of teacher centers in the United States in \nthe late 1970s, we have seen how effective they can be in supporting \nteachers, so that they can respond more effectively to student needs \nand help them reach the high standards now required by the No Child \nLeft Behind Act.\n  Teacher centers offer valuable programs for educators when aligned \nwith State standards and school district curriculums. The centers \nsupport new teachers during their first years in the profession, and \ntheir peer-to-peer networks facilitate communication and collaboration \namong teachers to improve instruction. The centers also help teachers \nincorporate new research into their daily routines, and support the use \nof technology and proven strategies to keep students engaged and help \nthem do well in school.\n  Most important, teacher centers are essential to the development of \nteacher capability and leadership. The training provided is aimed at \nbuilding the capability of teachers to reach all of their students \nthrough differentiated instruction--a goal central to the promise of \nleaving no child behind. And by\n\n[[Page S8069]]\n\ntaking advantage of the support provided by teacher centers, educators \ncan have a more active role in their own professional growth and \neventually hold leadership positions in their schools and communities.\n  As we know, teachers are on the front lines in the Nation's schools \nand in our efforts to improve public education. We cannot expect the \nquality of our classrooms to improve without investing more in the \nquality of our teachers. Teacher centers ensure that the nation's \neducators have the time, resources, and support they need to work and \nlearn with one another.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this bill, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3710\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Teacher Center Act of \n     2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) There are not enough qualified teachers in the Nation's \n     classrooms, and an unprecedented number of teachers will \n     retire over the next 5 years. Over the next decade, the \n     Nation will need to bring 2,000,000 new teachers into public \n     schools.\n       (2) Too many teachers do not receive adequate preparation \n     for their jobs.\n       (3) More than one-third of children in grades 7 through 12 \n     are taught by a teacher who lacks both a college major and \n     certification in the subject being taught. Rates of ``out-of-\n     field teaching'' are especially high in high-poverty schools.\n       (4) Teacher turnover is a serious problem, particularly in \n     urban and rural areas. Over one-third of new teachers leave \n     the profession within their first 3 years of teaching, and 14 \n     percent of new teachers leave the field within the first \n     year. After 5 years--the average time it takes for teachers \n     to maximize students' learning--half of all new teachers will \n     have exited the profession. Rates of teacher attrition are \n     highest in high-poverty schools. Between 2000 and 2001, 1 out \n     of 5 teachers in the Nation's high-poverty schools either \n     left to teach in another school or dropped out of teaching \n     altogether.\n       (5) African-American, Latino, and low-income students are \n     much less likely than other students to have highly-qualified \n     teachers.\n       (6) Research shows that individual teachers have a great \n     impact on how well their students learn. The most effective \n     teachers have been shown to be able to boost their pupils' \n     learning by a full grade level relative to students taught by \n     less effective teachers.\n       (7) Only 16 States finance new teacher induction programs, \n     and fewer still require inductees to be matched with mentors \n     who teach the same subject.\n       (8) Large-scale studies of effective professional \n     development have documented that student achievement and \n     teacher learning increases when professional development is \n     teacher-led, ongoing, and collaborative.\n       (9) Research shows that the characteristics of successful \n     professional development include a focus on concrete \n     classroom applications and practice, and opportunities for \n     teacher observation, critique, reflection, group support, and \n     collaboration.\n       (10) Data on school reform shows that teachers are \n     attracted to and continue to teach in academically challenged \n     schools when appropriate supports are in place to help them \n     succeed. Appropriate supports include high-quality induction \n     programs, job-embedded professional development, and small \n     classes which allow teachers to tailor instruction to meet \n     the needs of individual students.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I speak today to submit a resolution with \nmy good friend and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nSpecter. Our resolution recognizes and commends the National Sexual \nAssault Hotline for counseling and helping more than 1 million callers. \nOne of the most telling statistics since passage of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act in 1994 is the number of individuals reporting rape \nto the authorities. Almost half--42 percent of rape victims are now \nstepping forward and reporting these heinous crimes to the authorities, \nwhile prior to 2002, only 31 percent reported their attacks. Each \nnumber represents a brave victim who steps forward and says out loud \nthat she has been raped. For years, rape was a crime of shame. Our \nsociety blamed the victim. Police, lawyers, and judges focused on her \nconduct--what did she wear? where was she walking? was she drinking \nalcohol? Slowly but surely, we are working to change societal attitudes \nabout rape and improve our criminal justice system to encourage \nreporting and prosecution of rapes, whether committed by the neighbor \nnext door or a stranger in an alley.\n  A critical partner in our fight to end sexual assault has been the \nNational Sexual Assault Hotline operated by RAINN, the Rape, Abuse and \nIncest National Network. RAINN created this toll-free telephone \nhotline--1-800-656-HOPE--in 1994 and manages it with 1,100 local \naffiliates in 50 States, and the District of Columbia. Victims from \nacross the country can telephone the Hotline and receive confidential, \ntrained expertise from experienced professionals with the assistance of \nover 10,000 volunteers. In June 2006, the Hotline received its \nmillionth call since it answered its first call in 1994. In 2005 alone, \nthe Hotline helped 137,039 individuals, an average of 11,420 people a \nmonth.\n  The National Sexual Assault Hotline is truly a national treasure. It \nhelps individuals and families recover from a horrendous violation. It \nprovides a safe haven for victims to talk about the crime, and offers \nreferrals on local psychological and physical help. A call to the \nNational Sexual Assault Hotline is often the first step towards justice \nfor a victim. Research shows that victims who receive counseling are \nsignificantly more likely to report the assault, and more likely to \nfully participate in the prosecution. Every 2.5 minutes, another \nAmerican is sexually assaulted. We are fortunate to have the hotline \nthere to answer victims' calls for help and healing. The hotline's \nvolunteers are doing God's work, and deserve our gratitude. I am proud \nto rise with my good friend from Pennsylvania to introduce a resolution \nmarking the hotline's millionth call and commemorating the hotline's \ntremendous work to help America's families and make our streets safer.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/20/senate-section/article/S8071-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8071]]\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 111--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE \nTHAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD EXPAND TRADE OPPORTUNITIES WITH MONGOLIA \n  AND INITIATE NEGOTIATIONS TO ENTER INTO A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH \n                                MONGOLIA\n\n  Mr. HAGEL (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Obama, Ms. Murkowski, and Mr. \nGregg) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, on behalf of my colleagues Senators Lugar, \nObama, Murkowski and Gregg, I rise to submit a resolution that \nexpresses the sense of the Senate that the United States should begin \nnegotiations to establish a free trade agreement with Mongolia.\n  The United States and Mongolia enjoy healthy and deepening relations \nsince the end of one-party Communist rule in Mongolia in 1990. Today, \nMongolia is a strong and consistent partner of America, and has \ndemonstrated its commitment to peace, democracy and international \nstability, notably by its involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nAmerica's relationship with Mongolia carries geostrategic importance.\n  Mongolia has made significant progress to strengthen its democratic \ngoverning institutions, to protect individuals rights and achieve free-\nmarket reforms. Its governments have adopted reforms that have enacted \ndemocratic electoral processes and the rule of law, privatized state \nenterprises, lifted price controls and improved fiscal discipline. \nMongolia has achieved remarkable progress and continues to express its \ncommitment to continued democratic and economic transition.\n  Mongolia has worked over the past years to become re-integrated in \nthe international economic framework. In 1991, Mongolia joined the \nInternational Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian Development \nBank. In 1997, Mongolia joined the World Trade Organization. In 1999, \nthe United States provided permanent normal trade relations to \nMongolia. And, in 2004, the United States and Mongolia signed a \nbilateral Trade and Investment Framework Agreement. In 2005, bilateral \ntrade was valued at more than $165 million.\n  This resolution recognizes the significance of the U.S.-Mongolia \nrelationship and emphasizes that a deeper and more lasting bilateral \neconomic and trading relationship is in the interest of both countries. \nI urge my colleagues to support the adoption of this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/20/senate-section/article/S8071-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 112--RELATING TO CORRECTING A CLERICAL \n                   ERROR IN THE ENROLLMENT OF S. 3693\n\n  Mr. REID submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The effect of the intrastate production, \n     transportation, distribution, receipt, advertising, and \n     possession of child pornography on the interstate market in \n     child pornography.\n       (A) The illegal production, transportation, distribution, \n     receipt, advertising and possession of child pornography, as \n     defined in section 2256(8) of title 18, United States Code, \n     as well as the transfer of custody of children for the \n     production of child pornography, is harmful to the \n     physiological, emotional, and mental health of the children \n     depicted in child pornography and has a substantial and \n     detrimental effect on society as a whole.\n       (B) A substantial interstate market in child pornography \n     exists, including not only a multimillion dollar industry, \n     but also a nationwide network of individuals openly \n     advertising their desire to exploit children and to traffic \n     in child pornography. Many of these individuals distribute \n     child pornography with the expectation of receiving other \n     child pornography in return.\n       (C) The interstate market in child pornography is carried \n     on to a substantial extent through the mails and other \n     instrumentalities of interstate and foreign commerce, such as \n     the Internet. The advent of the Internet has greatly \n     increased the ease of transporting, distributing, receiving, \n     and advertising child pornography in interstate commerce. The \n     advent of digital cameras and digital video cameras, as well \n     as videotape cameras, has greatly increased the ease of \n     producing child pornography. The advent of inexpensive \n     computer equipment with the capacity to store large numbers \n     of digital images of child pornography has greatly increased \n     the ease of possessing child pornography. Taken together, \n     these technological advances have had the unfortunate result \n     of greatly increasing the interstate market in child \n     pornography.\n       (D) Intrastate incidents of production, transportation, \n     distribution, receipt, advertising, and possession of child \n     pornography, as well as the transfer of custody of children \n     for the production of child pornography, have a substantial \n     and direct effect upon interstate commerce because:\n       (i) Some persons engaged in the production, transportation, \n     distribution, receipt, advertising, and possession of child \n     pornography conduct such activities entirely within the \n     boundaries of one state. These persons are unlikely to be \n     content with the amount of child pornography they produce, \n     transport, distribute, receive, advertise, or possess. These \n     persons are therefore likely to enter the interstate market \n     in child pornography in search of additional child \n     pornography, thereby stimulating demand in the interstate \n     market in child pornography.\n       (ii) When the persons described in subparagraph (D)(i) \n     enter the interstate market in search of additional child \n     pornography, they are likely to distribute the child \n     pornography they already produce, transport, distribute, \n     receive, advertise, or possess to persons who will distribute \n     additional child pornography to them, thereby stimulating \n     supply in the interstate market in child pornography.\n       (iii) Much of the child pornography that supplies the \n     interstate market in child pornography is produced entirely \n     within the boundaries of one state, is not traceable, and \n     enters the interstate market surreptitiously. This child \n     pornography supports demand in the interstate market in child \n     pornography and is essential to its existence.\n       (E) Prohibiting the intrastate production, transportation, \n     distribution, receipt, advertising, and possession of child \n     pornography, as well as the intrastate transfer of custody of \n     children for the production of child pornography, will cause \n     some persons engaged in such intrastate activities to cease \n     all such activities, thereby reducing both supply and demand \n     in the interstate market for child pornography.\n       (F) Federal control of the intrastate incidents of the \n     production, transportation, distribution, receipt, \n     advertising, and possession of child pornography, as well as \n     the intrastate transfer of children for the production of \n     child pornography, is essential to the effective control of \n     the interstate market in child pornography.\n       (2) The importance of protecting children from repeat \n     exploitation in child pornography:\n       (A) The vast majority of child pornography prosecutions \n     today involve images contained on computer hard drives, \n     computer disks, and related media.\n       (B) Child pornography is not entitled to protection under \n     the First Amendment and thus may be prohibited.\n       (C) The government has a compelling State interest in \n     protecting children from those who sexually exploit them, and \n     this interest extends to stamping out the vice of child \n     pornography at all levels in the distribution chain.\n       (D) Every instance of viewing images of child pornography \n     represents a renewed violation of the privacy of the victims \n     and a repetition of their abuse.\n       (E) Child pornography constitutes prima facie contraband, \n     and as such should not be distributed to, or copied by, child \n     pornography defendants or their attorneys.\n       (F) It is imperative to prohibit the reproduction of child \n     pornography in criminal cases so as to avoid repeated \n     violation and abuse of victims, so long as the government \n     makes reasonable accommodations for the inspection, viewing, \n     and examination of such material for the purposes of mounting \n     a criminal defense.\n\n     SEC. 502.

GRANTS FOR RAPE, ABUSE & INCEST NATIONAL NETWORK.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) More than 200,000 Americans each year are victims of \n     sexual assault, according to the Department of Justice.\n       (2) In 2004, 1 American was sexually assaulted every 2.5 \n     minutes.\n       (3) One of every 6 women, and 1 of every 133 men, in \n     America has been the victim of a completed or attempted rape, \n     according to the Department of Justice.\n       (4) The Federal Bureau of Investigation ranks rape second \n     in the hierarchy of violent crimes for its Uniform Crime \n     Reports, trailing only murder.\n       (5) The Federal Government, through the Victims of Crime \n     Act, Violence Against Women Act, and other laws, has long \n     played a role in providing services to sexual assault victims \n     and in seeking policies to increase the number of rapists \n     brought to justice.\n       (6) Research suggests that sexual assault victims who \n     receive counseling support are more likely to report their \n     attack to the police and to participate in the prosecution of \n     the offender.\n       (7) Due in part to the combined efforts of law enforcement \n     officials at the local, State, and Federal level, as well as \n     the efforts of the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network \n     (RAINN) and its affiliated rape crisis centers across the \n     United States, sexual violence in America has fallen by more \n     than half since 1994.\n       (8) RAINN, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation headquartered \n     in the District of Columbia, has since 1994 provided help to \n     victims of sexual assault and educated the public about \n     sexual assault prevention, prosecution, and recovery.\n       (9) RAINN established and continues to operate the National \n     Sexual Assault Hotline, a free, confidential telephone \n     hotline that provides help, 24 hours a day, to victims \n     nationally.\n       (10) More than 1,100 local rape crisis centers in the 50 \n     States and the District of Columbia partner with RAINN and \n     are members of the National Sexual Assault Hotline network \n     (which has helped more than 970,000 people since its \n     inception in 1994).\n       (11) To better serve victims of sexual assault, 80 percent \n     of whom are under age 30 and 44 percent of whom are under age \n     18, RAINN will soon launch the National Sexual Assault Online \n     Hotline, the web's first secure hotline service offering live \n     help 24 hours a day.\n       (12) Congress and the Department of Justice have given \n     RAINN funding to conduct its crucial work.\n       (13) RAINN is a national model of public/private \n     partnership, raising private sector funds to match \n     congressional appropriations and receiving extensive private \n     in-kind support, including advanced technology provided by \n     the communications and technology industries to launch the \n     National Sexual Assault Hotline and the National Sexual \n     Assault Online Hotline.\n       (14) Worth magazine selected RAINN as one of ``America's \n     100 Best Charities'', in recognition of the organization's \n     ``efficiency and effectiveness.''\n       (15) In fiscal year 2005, RAINN spent more than 91 cents of \n     every dollar received directly on program services.\n       (16) The demand for RAINN's services is growing \n     dramatically, as evidenced by the fact that, in 2005, the \n     National Sexual Assault Hotline helped 137,039 people, an \n     all-time record.\n       (17) The programs sponsored by RAINN and its local \n     affiliates have contributed to the increase in the percentage \n     of victims who report their rape to law enforcement.\n       (18) According to a recent poll, 92 percent of American \n     women said that fighting sexual and domestic violence should \n     be a top public policy priority (a higher percentage than \n     chose health care, child care, or any other issue).\n       (19) Authorizing Federal funds for RAINN's national \n     programs would promote continued progress with this \n     interstate problem and would make a significant difference in \n     the prosecution of rapists and the overall incidence of \n     sexual violence.\n       (b) Duties and Functions of the Administrator.--\n       (1) Description of activities.--The Administrator shall--\n       (A) issue such rules as the Administrator considers \n     necessary or appropriate to carry out this section;\n       (B) make such arrangements as may be necessary and \n     appropriate to facilitate effective coordination among all \n     Federally funded programs relating to victims of sexual \n     assault; and\n       (C) provide adequate staff and agency resources which are \n     necessary to properly carry out the responsibilities pursuant \n     to this section.\n       (2) Annual grant to rape, abuse & incest national \n     network.--The Administrator shall annually make a grant to \n     RAINN, which shall be used for the performance of the \n     organization's national programs, which may include--\n       (A) operation of the National Sexual Assault Hotline, a 24-\n     hour toll-free telephone line by which individuals may \n     receive help and information from trained volunteers;\n       (B) operation of the National Sexual Assault Online \n     Hotline, a 24-hour free online service by which individuals \n     may receive help and information from trained volunteers;\n       (C) education of the media, the general public, and \n     populations at risk of sexual assault about the incidence of \n     sexual violence and sexual violence prevention, prosecution, \n     and recovery;\n       (D) dissemination, on a national basis, of information \n     relating to innovative and model programs, services, laws, \n     legislation, and policies that benefit victims of sexual \n     assault; and\n       (E) provision of technical assistance to law enforcement \n     agencies, State and local governments, the criminal justice \n     system, public and private nonprofit agencies, and \n     individuals in the investigation and prosecution of cases \n     involving victims of sexual assault.\n       (c) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section:\n       (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n     Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention.\n       (2) Rainn.--The term ``RAINN'' means the Rape, Abuse & \n     Incest National Network, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation \n     headquartered in the District of Columbia.\n       (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Administrator to carry out this \n     section, $3,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2007 through \n     2010.\n\n     SEC. 629.

FUGITIVE SAFE SURRENDER.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Fugitive Safe Surrender is a program of the United \n     States Marshals Service, in partnership with public, private, \n     and faith-based organizations, which temporarily transforms a \n     church into a courthouse, so fugitives can turn themselves \n     in, in an atmosphere where they feel more comfortable to do \n     so, and have nonviolent cases adjudicated immediately.\n       (2) In the 4-day pilot program in Cleveland, Ohio, over 800 \n     fugitives turned themselves in. By contrast, a successful \n     Fugitive Task Force sweep, conducted for 3 days after \n     Fugitive Safe Surrender, resulted in the arrest of 65 \n     individuals.\n       (3) Fugitive Safe Surrender is safer for defendants, law \n     enforcement, and innocent bystanders than needing to conduct \n     a sweep.\n       (4) Based upon the success of the pilot program, Fugitive \n     Safe Surrender should be expanded to other cities throughout \n     the United States.\n       (b) Establishment.--The United States Marshals Service \n     shall establish, direct, and coordinate a program (to be \n     known as the ``Fugitive Safe Surrender Program''), under \n     which the United States Marshals Service shall apprehend \n     Federal, State, and local fugitives in a safe, secure, and \n     peaceful manner to be coordinated with law enforcement and \n     community leaders in designated cities throughout the United \n     States.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the United States Marshals Service to \n     carry out this section--\n       (1) $3,000,000 for fiscal year 2007;\n       (2) $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2008; and\n       (3) $8,000,000 for fiscal year 2009.\n       (d) Other Existing Applicable Law.--Nothing in this section \n     shall be construed to limit any existing authority under any \n     other provision of Federal or State law for law enforcement \n     agencies to locate or apprehend fugitives through task forces \n     or any other means.\n\n     SEC. 633.

Res. 535\n\n       Whereas in 2005, a small group of American Legion Riders in \n     Kansas calling themselves the ``Patriot Guard'' began a \n     movement to shield the families and friends of fallen service \n     members from interruptions by protesters appearing at \n     military funerals;\n       Whereas individuals from Colorado, Oklahoma, and Texas \n     later brought together diverse groups of motorcycle \n     organizations across the country who rode to honor fallen \n     service members, forming an organization known as the \n     ``Patriot Guard Riders'';\n       Whereas the Patriot Guard Riders have since grown into a \n     nationwide network, including both veterans and nonveterans \n     and riders and nonriders, and is open to anyone who shares a \n     respect for service members who have made the ultimate \n     sacrifice for the Nation;\n       Whereas Patriot Guard Riders attend military funerals to \n     show respect for fallen service members and to shield \n     mourning family members and friends of the deceased from \n     protestors who interrupt, or threaten to interrupt, the \n     dignity of the event;\n       Whereas across the Nation, Patriot Guard Riders volunteer \n     their time to come to the aid of military families in need, \n     so as to allow the memories of the deceased service member to \n     be remembered with honor and dignity;\n       Whereas regardless of one's opinion of the Nation's \n     military commitments, the families, friends, and communities \n     of the Nation's fallen soldiers deserve a peaceful time of \n     mourning and should not be harassed and caused further \n     suffering at a funeral;\n       Whereas Patriot Guard Riders appear at a funeral only at \n     the invitation of the fallen soldier's family and participate \n     in a nonviolent, legal manner; and\n       Whereas the members of the Nation's Armed Forces willingly \n     risk their lives to protect the American way of life and the \n     freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate expresses its deepest \n     appreciation to the Patriot Guard Riders who--\n       (1) attend military funerals across the country to show \n     respect for fallen members of the Armed Forces and, when \n     needed, shield mourning family members and friends of the \n     deceased from protestors who interrupt, or threaten to \n     interrupt, the dignity of a funeral; and\n       (2) in so doing, help to preserve the memory and honor of \n     the Nation's fallen heroes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/20/senate-section/article/S8091-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CORRECTING THE ENROLLMENT OF S. 3693\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

It is a bill that has been \npassed by the House of Representatives last week and was passed through \nour Judiciary Committee yesterday, came to the floor today, and passed \na few moments ago.\n  We confirmed four of the President's judicial nominations and about \nan hour ago we passed the Adam Walsh bill, a bill that establishes a \nnational sex offender registry that toughens penalties for crimes \nagainst children that directly, and in a tough fashion, combats \nInternet predators and child pornography and child exploitation, that \nprevents abuse. I mentioned in my remarks a few moments ago, four \nchildren die as a result of child abuse every day, and although a lot \nof States do have registries, this information is not shared with other \nStates.\n  I am delighted we were able to create this national child abuse \nregistry which, indeed, will make such a difference in people's lives.\n  As I mentioned earlier, also, we will not have any votes during \ntomorrow's session.
