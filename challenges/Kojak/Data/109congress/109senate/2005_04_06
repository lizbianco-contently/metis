Mr. President, in about an hour and a half we will receive \nthe address by Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko.\n  It all began on November 22--not that long ago. On that icy Ukrainian \nday, hundreds of thousands of protesters from all over the countryside \nconverged on Kiev's Independence Square to protest the Ukrainian \nPresidential election. The incumbent favored candidate, Viktor \nYanukovych, had been declared the winner already. Meanwhile, \nnonpartisan, independent exit polling--or series of polls--showed that \nViktor Yushchenko, leader of the opposition party, had a clear nine-\npoint lead.\n  For 17 days, in subzero weather, hundreds of thousands of men and \nwomen filled the streets of Independence Square, huddled in tents among \nstrangers, braving the threats of police violence. It was an \nastonishing emotional display that stunned the world as these images \ncame through our newspapers and across the television. After 17 days of \nthis nonviolent solidarity, the people won. A new election was held. On \nJanuary 23, Viktor Yushchenko was\n\n[[Page S3238]]\n\nsworn in as the new President. The ``Orange Revolution'' will be \nforever emblazoned in the memories of all those who strive for freedom.\n  On behalf of the Senate, I am privileged to welcome the leader of \nthis historic moment, President Viktor Yushchenko, to our Nation's \nCapitol.\n  Today, at 11 a.m. the President will address a joint session of \nCongress, making him the only leader of a former Soviet republic \noutside of Russia to do so. We are honored to have him address our \nhighest legislative Chambers. We extend to him our congratulations and \nto the Ukrainian people our friendship and support. We are grateful for \nthe sacrifices the Ukrainian military made in pursuing the cause of \nfreedom and security in Iraq.\n  However, much lies ahead. I am heartened by President Yushchenko's \ncommitment to reform. Following his inauguration, the Senate pledged to \nsupport the Ukrainian people to establish full democracy, rule of law, \nrespect for human rights, and a free, transparent, and open economy. We \nfirmly support Ukraine's independence and territorial sovereignty and \ntheir full integration into the international community of democracies.\n  The President of the United States has requested resources to support \nUkraine's democracy building. It goes without saying that the Senate \nsupports funding Ukraine's efforts.\n  I look forward to President Yushchenko's historic address to the \nCongress in a short while. He and the people of Ukraine have inspired \nthe world and have written a new chapter in the story of human freedom.\n  On that first day the marchers filled Independence Square, they \nchanted: ``Together we are many. We cannot be defeated.''\n  Today, on behalf of the American people, I say to the people of \nUkraine: Together we are one. Freedom will prevail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/06/senate-section/article/S3238-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   COMMENDING THE NORTH CAROLINA TAR HEELS MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM FOR \n                 WINNING THE 2005 NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I rise to speak to the resolution that was \njust passed, along with my fellow Lady Vol fan and colleague, Senator \nLamar Alexander, who is currently occupying the Chair.\n  This is a resolution honoring our friend Pat Summitt, head coach for \nthe University of Tennessee women's basketball team, as one of the \ngreatest coaches in NCAA basketball history.\n  For 31 seasons, Pat Summitt has served as the head coach of the \nTennessee Lady Volunteer basketball team. When she first took the \nposition in 1974 as a 22-year-old graduate teaching assistant, her team \nconsisted of non-scholarship players who depended on her to wash their \nuniforms and drive the team's van. Only 53 fans witnessed Coach \nSummitt's first win that season. But from that day forth, Coach Pat \nSummitt and the Lady Vols started what is now an unprecedented winning \ntradition.\n  This season, Pat became the Nation's all-time winningest NCAA \nbasketball coach, men's or women's, with her 880th career victory, \nsurpassing the legendary Coach Dean Smith of the University of North \nCarolina. Along the way, Pat Summitt has achieved unparalleled results \non the court, elevating the Lady Vols to one of the elite programs in \nall of sports.\n  Her resume consists of 15 30-plus win seasons, including one \nundefeated season record of 39 to 0. Pat has coached her team to six \nnational titles, including back-to-back-to-back championships in 1996, \n1997 and 1998. The Lady Vols played in their 16th Final Four this past \nSunday as Pat Summitt set a new all-time record for Final Four \nappearances.\n  Following her remarkable run in the 1990s, the Lady Vols were named \n``Team of the Decade'' by ESPN, tying with the Florida State football \nteam, and on October 13, 2000, Coach Summitt became only the fourth \nwomen's coach inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. The University \nof Tennessee has recently honored Pat Summitt by renaming the court at \nThompson-Boling Arena ``The Summitt.''\n  Today I join together with the many Lady Vols fans in acknowledging \nCoach Pat Summitt for her service to her team, the University of \nTennessee, and the game of basketball. Her dedication to excellence \nover the past 31 years has been exemplary and has made her a role model \nfor future generations of students, players, and coaches.\n  Congratulations, Pat Summitt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I join my colleague, the majority \nleader, in saying a word about Pat Summitt.\n  I am delighted the majority leader scheduled time for this discussion \nof Pat Summitt and submitted the resolution, which I am proud to \ncosponsor.\n  There are a great many superlatives one could offer about Coach \nSummitt. Perhaps the most obvious is sustained excellence over such a \nlong period of time--as the majority leader said, 16 Final Four \nappearances, three back-to-back national titles, 107 NCAA tournament \ngames, virtually undefeated on the floor of the Thompson-Boling Arena, \nwhich is now renamed The Summitt in her honor, always playing the \ntoughest schedule, always high expectations.\n  I was president of the University of Tennessee for nearly 3 years. I \nremember going to a year-end Lady Vols basketball banquet because I \nremember the team had won the Southeastern Conference Championship and \ndid not make the Final Four. Pat Summitt congratulated the players, but \nI remember the atmosphere was more like a funeral than a celebration \nbecause, obviously, the team did not meet the expectations Coach \nSummitt had for her players.\n  We live in a society of televised images in which we meet a steady \nstream of people who are at the top of their game for 15 minutes or for \na few months or for a few years. But for Pat Summitt, it has been 31 \nyears at the top of her game, and there is no end in sight.\n  There are a couple of other less obvious superlatives about Coach \nSummitt. One of these is unselfishness. The coaches whom she regularly \ndefeats will tell you, to a woman or a man, that no one has done more \nto build the game of women's basketball than Pat Summitt. When she \nstarted, there were three girls at each end of the court playing in an \nempty gym. Today it is my favorite game to watch on television because \nof the skill of the players, because of the team play, because of the \ngood coaching, and now because of the parity of the sport.\n  There are a lot of good teams, a lot of good coaches, and many of \nthem are former assistants to Pat Summitt. It seems she always has a \ngood word to say about this program or that program, this opponent or \nthat opponent. Her objective is to build the game up as much as it is \nto win the game.\n  The final superlative is Pat Summitt's emphasis on academic \nachievement. Every young woman who has ever played for her over 31 \nyears has either graduated or is working today on the requirements for \ngraduation. That is almost as difficult as winning back-to-back NCAA \nchampionships. It certainly sets the right tone for college sports.\n  I know how proud I was as a university president to have that most \nvisible symbol of our university have such high values. It is mentioned \nat all the games, people see it all the time. It is a superlative \nachievement.\n  This past year, Nicky Anosike, one of eight children of a mother from \nNigeria now living in the United States, became a sudden star at the \nUniversity of Tennessee as a freshman. There were six great recruits \nsaid to be the best recruiting class ever in the history of this \ncountry. Four of them were hurt. Nicky Anosike was not hurt, and she \nsuddenly became a starter on the team and one of its best starters. \nSome people say she is a female Scottie Pippen at the top of his game.\n  As I suspect happens with many of Pat's freshman students, Nicky \nAnosike called home the next few weeks discussing with her mother how \ndifficult it was to play for Pat Summitt because she demanded so much. \nHer mother said: What does she expect of you that I did not expect of \nyou? That is the reason why I believe parents and young women want \nthose young women to go to the University of Tennessee to play for Pat \nSummitt when they might be admitted to any school in the country. It is \nthat for 31 years, Pat Summitt has brought out the best in those young \nwomen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/06/senate-section/article/S3239-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3239-S3240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VIKTOR YUSHCHENKO\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to comment on the majority \nleader's remarks about Viktor Yushchenko, who will be addressing a \njoint meeting at 11 o'clock.\n  Two weeks ago, I had the privilege, with the Democratic leader, of \nvisiting with Mr. Yushchenko for an hour. We also were in Georgia, \nIraq, Palestine, and Israel. We saw emerging democracies across the \ncountry.\n  One of the most vivid impressions I had was after meeting with Mr. \nYushchenko, we met with students in Ukraine. Senator Reid asked them \nhow long before they expected results. These were the ones who Senator \nFrist described as being among the hundreds of thousands in November \nand December waiting outside in the bitter cold\n\n[[Page S3240]]\n\ncausing this change. Some of the students said a year. Others disagreed \nand said 9 months.\n  It seems to me one of the greatest dangers we have with these \nemerging democracies is reminding them that there is no such thing as \nan instant democracy in Ukraine or anywhere else. So I said to the \nstudents with respect: In the United States, it took us 12 years to \nwrite a constitution after the Declaration of Independence, and we had \nto lock the press out to do it. It took us 130 years to give women the \nright to vote. It took us 200 years before African Americans could vote \nin every part of our country.\n  So in Iraq, in Georgia, in Ukraine, in emerging democracies, patience \nis important, and that is one of the examples we have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/06/senate-section/article/S3240-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3240-S3241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    FOREIGN RELATIONS AUTHORIZATION ACT, FISCAL YEARS 2006 AND 2007\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 286\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask Senators to oppose the Biden \namendment. I appreciate the perspective of Senators who want to \npreserve the 27-percent cap, as well as those who want the cap to be \nreduced to the 25-percent level in accordance with the Helms-Biden \nlegislation.\n  In offering this amendment, I am attempting to represent the views of \nthose Senators who believe that forthcoming discussions on U.N. reform \nshould include additional consideration of U.S. financial obligations \nfor peacekeeping. This is a reasonable expectation given the reform \ncontext at the United Nations. Since our committee marked up this bill, \nJohn Bolton has been announced as the President's nominee to be \nAmbassador to the U.N., and Secretary General Kofi Annan has put \nforward a sweeping U.N. reform plan.\n  Clearly, U.N. reform is going to be high on the agenda. The Helms-\nBiden legislation anticipates that the U.S. share of peacekeeping dues \nwould decline to 25 percent of the world total. This remains a goal of \nU.S. policy toward the United Nations. I believe we should give the \nU.S. negotiators the most leverage possible to attain U.S. goals.\n  It has been suggested that the 27-percent agreement struck subsequent \nto the Helms-Biden legislation is the best we can do. Many Senators \nassert this is true, particularly since we are entering a period when \nsubstantial reform negotiations will take place at the U.N. But in the \ncoming weeks, Congress will have further opportunities to work with \nPresident Bush to craft the most efficient means possible of reducing \nthe U.S. share of peacekeeping assessments.\n  I believe defeating the Biden amendment at this time will facilitate \nthese consultations and strengthen the hand of our negotiators.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this amendment implements what President \nBush is requesting. Specifically, the President requested that for the \nnext 2 years we keep our assessment at 27 percent.\n  Mr. President, 10,000 forces are being sent to the Sudan under the \nauspices of the United Nations. They are responding as we are asking \nthem to respond. We are in the process of making genuine progress. The \nlast thing we need to do is start to build up arrearages again; it took \nyears to work ourselves out of the hole, both politically and \nfinancially.\n  If my colleague from Indiana is correct that the administration wants \nroom to negotiate, the President is going to be President for 3\\1/2\\ \nmore years, God willing and the creek not rising, as my grandpop used \nto say. The truth is, this lasts for 2 years. It gives all the \nnegotiating room possible. To now go ahead and change the deal in the \nminds of every Ambassador to the United Nations--here they go again--at \nthe very time we are sending the worst person we can possibly send, not \nin terms of morality but in terms of his attitude to the U.N.--the \ndouble whammy of sending Bolton to the United Nations and cutting our \ncommitment that we have kept to for the past years, and over the \nrequest of the President we cut by 2 percent our commitment, would be a \nvery serious problem.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support the Biden amendment. I fully \nappreciate the position of my friend from Indiana, but I think he is \nmistaken on this point. We do not often disagree that much, but on this \none we do disagree.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the Biden amendment to keep the \nPresident's request in this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Biden amendment \nand to second Chairman Lugar's remarks. The chairman is looking to the \nfuture of the United Nations and not to the past. The negotiations at \nthe U.N. regarding U.N. reform and the lowering of U.N. peacekeeping \ndues are underway. Let us ensure that our next Ambassador to the United \nNations has an opportunity to go to New York and to work on this issue.\n  Our Ambassador will be working to lower U.S. dues. By adopting \nSenator Biden's amendment, we will make that job more difficult by \nconceding our willingness to live with the status quo. We have an \nopportunity to lower the U.S. rate to serve the U.S. taxpayers better \nand to make the U.N. more efficient if Congress does not send mixed \nsignals to the U.N.\n  Next week, the Foreign Relations Committee will have its hearing on \nJohn Bolton to be Ambassador to the U.N. We will have the opportunity \nto discuss this issue at length with him. Do we want to make his job \nthat much harder by adopting this amendment? If we adopt this \namendment, we undercut him before he gets there.\n  It is time for real reform at the U.N. Achieving a sustainable level \nfor peacekeeping assessments is an important first step.\n  The Congress has spoken to this issue in the past. Let us give our \nAmbassador to the U.N. an opportunity to get up there and to lower our \nrates. Let us also not let this issue be the one item that threatens \npassage of this important legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S3241]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Does the Senator from Delaware have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 58 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the leader has much better access to the \nPresident than I do, but to the best of my knowledge there is no \nnegotiation, has been no negotiation, no discussion, no comment \nwhatsoever about changing the U.S. provision from 27 percent to 25 \npercent. I know of nothing. The State Department has never said \nanything to me. The Defense Department, the White House, Kofi Annan, \nnobody has raised this, except my friends on the conservative right in \nthe Republican Party.\n  If we do not want to send a mixed signal, do not vote against the \nPresident. The President of the United States, not our conservative \nfriends on the right side of the aisle, says 27 percent. Do not \nundercut the President and send a mixed signal.\n  I yield whatever time I have remaining, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. Is there a sufficient \nsecond?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 286.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

INTERNATIONAL POLICE TRAINING.\n\n       (a) Requirements for Instructors.--Prior to carrying out \n     any program of training for police or security forces through \n     the Bureau that begins after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary shall ensure that--\n       (1) such training is provided by instructors who have \n     proven records of experience in training law enforcement or \n     security personnel;\n       (2) the Bureau has established procedures to ensure that \n     the individuals who receive such training--\n       (A) do not have a criminal background;\n       (B) are not connected to any criminal or insurgent group;\n       (C) are not connected to drug traffickers; and\n       (D) meet the minimum age and experience standards set out \n     in appropriate international agreements; and\n       (3) the Bureau has established procedures that--\n       (A) clearly establish the standards an individual who will \n     receive such training must meet;\n       (B) clearly establish the training courses that will permit \n     the individual to meet such standards; and\n       (C) provide for certification of an individual who meets \n     such standards.\n       (b) Advisory Board.--The Secretary shall establish an \n     advisory board of 10 experts to advise the Bureau on issues \n     related to cost efficiency and professional efficacy of \n     police and security training programs. The board shall have \n     not less than 5 members who are experienced United States law \n     enforcement personnel.\n       (c) Bureau Defined.--In this section, the term ``Bureau'' \n     means the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law \n     Enforcement Affairs of the Department of State.\n       (d) Annual Report.--Not later than September 30 of each \n     fiscal year, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report \n     on the training for international police or security forces \n     conducted by the Bureau. Such report shall include the \n     attrition rates of the instructors of such training and \n     indicators of job performance of such instructors.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I rise in support of this amendment to \ndocument the importance of making sure we have the right standards and \ncertifications with respect to training law enforcement and security \nofficers on missions around the world.\n  I speak to this amendment based on my experience as Colorado attorney \ngeneral where I sat as chairman of the peace officers standards and \ntraining board for a period of 6 years. Working with my colleagues in \nlaw enforcement, we developed a set of standards that made sure the \npeople we were recruiting into our police forces in the State of \nColorado were people who had been checked for criminal backgrounds and \nwould be able to serve. We also developed a set of standards with \nrespect to the training of these law enforcement officers. This \namendment creates those same standards and background checks with \nrespect to people being recruited into security forces to help with our \nefforts around the world.\n  I understand the amendment I have offered will be considered by \nSenator Lugar and others as we return to the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 284\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, yesterday I offered an amendment on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Wyden from\n\n[[Page S3242]]\n\nOregon. I will now describe that amendment in some greater detail. I \nknow others, including my colleague from Oregon, will be here.\n  It is an amendment to terminate something called TV Marti, Television \nMarti. It is spending money on something that does not work, spending \nmoney we do not have on something that is not needed. Even waste, of \ncourse, has a constituency in this town, so there will be those who \nwill oppose this amendment. I will describe why this is a tragic waste \nof the American taxpayers' money.\n  This is a picture of an aerostat balloon called Fat Albert. Fat \nAlbert has a great history. Fat Albert has been used for a number of \nthings. At one point we had an aerostat balloon, Fat Albert, that got \nloose of its mooring in Florida. Eventually, it lifted fishing boats \nfrom the sea. They had to shoot it down. The Air Force had to shoot \ndown Fat Albert.\n  This is the aerostat balloon, along with a 20,000-foot tether cable \nthat broadcasts television signals into the country of Cuba to tell the \nCubans how good life is in America and to give the Cubans a straight \nstory.\n  We have spent $189 million on this program over a number of years \nsince 1989. Over 16 years we have spent nearly $200 million.\n  We have another program called Radio Marti. I don't propose that we \nterminate funding for that because by and large the Cubans are \nreceiving signals from Radio Marti. Radio Marti is beneficial. I have \nbeen to Cuba and talked to the Cubans. They can listen to commercial \nstations from Miami, as well, and do. But Radio Marti gets its signals \nto the Cuban people.\n  TV Marti, by contrast, has cost the American taxpayer since 1989 $189 \nmillion to broadcast television signals into Cuba that the Cuban people \ncannot see because the Castro Government routinely jammed those \nsignals. In fact, for much of its existence, Television Marti was \nbroadcasting signals from 3 a.m. until 8 in the morning--again, \nbroadcasting signals the Cuban people could not see.\n  That, of course, is no barrier in this country. The 20,000-foot \ntether on the aerostat balloon called Fat Albert sits up there in the \nsky with the technicians. By the way, since they had to shoot one down \nand since another one got loose and went over to the Everglades and \nthey had to round up this aerostat balloon and figure out a way to \ncatch it, since then they now have three different ways of \ncommunicating with and controlling Fat Albert which I am sure is of \ngreat comfort to the people who might be in the way of an aerostat \nballoon that gets loose in this country.\n  Fat Albert is up there every day on the case, broadcasting television \nsignals to the Cuban people. And every day, the Cuban people see this--\nthis is a television screen in Cuba--they see snow, because Castro jams \nthe signals. So we have a program we pay for that doesn't work, that is \nnot needed, and we keep doing it year after year.\n  And this year, guess what. The President wants to double the funding. \nYes, that is true, a program that does not work, is unneeded, is \nwasting the taxpayers' money, and the President's budget says, let's \ndouble the funding.\n  Let me tell you what they did after they had this introduction of Fat \nAlbert. Fat Albert gets loose, goes over to the Everglades, it is kind \nof a problem, and everyone is embarrassed about it. It is a worthless \nprogram that sends signals no one can receive to the Cuban people, and \nthen they lose a balloon and they have all these embarrassing anecdotes \nof the fact that they are spending money to broadcast a television \nsignal no one can receive, and so they decide they will do something \ndifferent.\n  October 10, 2003, in the Rose Garden, the administration announced \nnew ``get tough'' measures with Cuba which, among other things, said we \nwill stop using Fat Albert; we are not going to use an aerostat balloon \nanymore. Now we are going to take Commando Solo, a C-130 Air National \nGuard plane, special operations C-130 airplane called Commando Solo. \nThey are going to now broadcast television signals from Commando Solo.\n  The broadcast of TV Marti from Commando Solo commenced once a week \nfor a 4\\1/2\\ hour broadcast. They use the same technology the current \nFat Albert blimp uses. It broadcasts a signal from a high altitude \nwhich then is jammed by the Castro Government. The Commando Solo cannot \novercome jammers in Havana, either. It can only reach areas if there \nare areas where the Castro Government is not jamming.\n  Commando Solo is operated by the 193rd Special Operations Wing of the \nPennsylvania National Guard. It was designed for psychological warfare \nin military situations. It has been used to broadcast television \nmessages in Panama, Desert Shield, Grenada, Desert Storm, Afghanistan, \nand Iraq, largely areas where there has been combat that has occurred. \nThere are half a dozen of these airplanes that exist. They are a \nprecious military resource that is being used for what is now a \nnonmilitary operation. So now instead of Fat Albert, or in addition to \nFat Albert, we have Commando Solo. There is no evidence, of course, \nthat the Cubans can receive a signal from Commando Solo, but we are \nstill pumping taxpayers' money into this folly.\n  The President's budget says we are spending $10 million a year. We \nhave been doing that for 16 years, and we understand this is a program \nwe do not need, a program that does not work, but we still want to keep \nfunding it and we want to actually enhance it. Now what we want to do \nis go purchase a new airplane, go buy a new airplane for $8 million so \nthat it becomes the TV Marti airplane to broadcast signals the Castro \nGovernment will jam and that the Cuban people cannot see.\n  If you sat around a smalltown cafe and talked about this, you would \nnot get one person in a million who would say, well, if we have \nsomething that doesn't work, let's keep doing it; in fact, let's double \nit. Let's do more of it. Almost everyone would say: Are you out of your \nmind? What are you thinking about, funding something that does not \nwork? If it is clear it does not work, why does it take you 16 years to \ndecide it does not work? And if it does not work, why on Earth would \nyou suggest doubling the funding? Yet that is exactly what we have.\n\n  Now, we have people who will, I am sure, defend this, and they will \nsay: Well, do you know something? There are some Cubans who say they \nhave seen it. We have 19 million people in Cuba, somewhere in that \nneighborhood. I think when the State Department talks about this, they \nsay: We have 250 sitings of people who actually have seen Television \nMarti.\n  What they were doing is, they were interviewing people off the boats \ncoming from Cuba in order to see if they could get some evidence that \nsomebody was actually able to see something more than the snow on this \nscreen. They got such an embarrassingly small amount of testimony from \npeople who have said they could see this, they finally stopped asking \npeople. So now there are no surveys because it was too embarrassing to \nget a survey completed that said this is a tragic, complete, total, \nthorough waste of taxpayer money.\n  What we have is a bill on the floor of the Senate that promotes the \nPresident's budget that says we will double funding for this program \nthat is a total waste from $10.3 million to $21.1 million in fiscal \nyear 2006. And the $10 million increase would go toward buying an \nairplane that would transmit 4 hours of TV broadcast to Cuba each day \nthat would be jammed by the Castro Government and that would not be \nable to be received by the Cuban people.\n  TV Marti says it could operate a secondhand, modest twin engine plane \nfor about $8 million. They would buy it for $8 million, and spend $2 \nmillion a year on the plane. There is not a shred of evidence--not a \nshred of evidence--anywhere that this would put us in a different \nposition than now exists. The desire to use, for 16 years, an aerostat \nballoon called Fat Albert, and then the desire to expropriate military \nassets to send a highly specialized military plane, designed for \npsychological warfare, up in the air to broadcast for 4 hours a week \nsignals the Cuban people cannot see--it is unbelievable.\n  It is one of these things that leads me to say, as I have from time \nto time, that even waste has a strong constituency here in the \nCongress. But from time to time you can see waste for what it is. This \nis evident. It is clear. It is not about Republicans or Democrats. It \nis about whether we want to spend money on something that does not\n\n[[Page S3243]]\n\nwork. Do we want to continue to do that?\n  My colleague, Senator Wyden, and I say absolutely not. Let's finally, \nfinally, finally--after 16 years--have the courage to shut down a \nprogram that is a total waste of the American taxpayers' money.\n  My colleague from New York wishes to, I think at this time, set aside \nand offer his own amendment; and then we will continue the debate with \nmy colleague from Oregon immediately after the offering of the \namendment.\n  Let me at this time yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 309\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendments be laid aside and that amendment No. 309, offered by \nmyself and the Senator from South Carolina, be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for himself, Mr. \n     Graham, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Dole, Mr. \n     Feingold, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Kohl, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 309.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To authorize appropriate action if the negotiations with the \n People's Republic of China regarding China's undervalued currency are \n                            not successful)\n\n       On page 277, after line 8, add the following:\n\n                     TITLE XXIX--CURRENCY VALUATION\n\n     SEC. 2901. NEGOTIATIONS REGARDING CURRENCY VALUATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The currency of the People's Republic of China, known \n     as the yuan or renminbi, is artificially pegged at a level \n     significantly below its market value. Economists estimate the \n     yuan to be undervalued by between 15 percent and 40 percent \n     or an average of 27.5 percent.\n       (2) The undervaluation of the yuan provides the People's \n     Republic of China with a significant trade advantage by \n     making exports less expensive for foreign consumers and by \n     making foreign products more expensive for Chinese consumers. \n     The effective result is a significant subsidization of \n     China's exports and a virtual tariff on foreign imports.\n       (3) The Government of the People's Republic of China has \n     intervened in the foreign exchange markets to hold the value \n     of the yuan within an artificial trading range. China's \n     foreign reserves are estimated to be over $609,900,000,000 as \n     of January 12, 2005, and have increased by over \n     $206,700,000,000 in the last 12 months.\n       (4) China's undervalued currency, China's trade advantage \n     from that undervaluation, and the Chinese Government's \n     intervention in the value of its currency violates the spirit \n     and letter of the world trading system of which the People's \n     Republic of China is now a member.\n       (5) The Government of the People's Republic of China has \n     failed to promptly address concerns or to provide a \n     definitive timetable for resolution of these concerns raised \n     by the United States and the international community \n     regarding the value of its currency.\n       (6) Article XXI of the GATT 1994 (as defined in section \n     2(1)(B) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. \n     3501(1)(B))) allows a member of the World Trade Organization \n     to take any action which it considers necessary for the \n     protection of its essential security interests. Protecting \n     the United States manufacturing sector is essential to the \n     interests of the United States.\n       (b) Negotiations and Certification Regarding the Currency \n     Valuation Policy of the People's Republic of China.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding the provisions of title I \n     of Public Law 106-286 (19 U.S.C. 2431 note), on and after the \n     date that is 180 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, unless a certification described in paragraph (2) has \n     been made to Congress, in addition to any other duty, there \n     shall be imposed a rate of duty of 27.5 percent ad valorem on \n     any article that is the growth, product, or manufacture of \n     the People's Republic of China, imported directly or \n     indirectly into the United States.\n       (2) Certification.--The certification described in this \n     paragraph means a certification by the President to Congress \n     that the People's Republic of China is no longer acquiring \n     foreign exchange reserves to prevent the appreciation of the \n     rate of exchange between its currency and the United States \n     dollar for purposes of gaining an unfair competitive \n     advantage in international trade. The certification shall \n     also include a determination that the currency of the \n     People's Republic of China has undergone a substantial upward \n     revaluation placing it at or near its fair market value.\n       (3) Alternative certification.--If the President certifies \n     to Congress 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act \n     that the People's Republic of China has made a good faith \n     effort to revalue its currency upward placing it at or near \n     its fair market value, the President may delay the imposition \n     of the tariffs described in paragraph (1) for an additional \n     180 days. If at the end of the 180-day period the President \n     determines that China has developed and started actual \n     implementation of a plan to revalue its currency, the \n     President may delay imposition of the tariffs for an \n     additional 12 months, so that the People's Republic of China \n     shall have time to implement the plan.\n       (4) Negotiations.--Beginning on the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with \n     the United States Trade Representative, shall begin \n     negotiations with the People's Republic of China to ensure \n     that the People's Republic of China adopts a process that \n     leads to a substantial upward currency revaluation within 180 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act. Because various \n     Asian governments have also been acquiring substantial \n     foreign exchange reserves in an effort to prevent \n     appreciation of their currencies for purposes of gaining an \n     unfair competitive advantage in international trade, and \n     because the People's Republic of China has concerns about the \n     value of those currencies, the Secretary shall also seek to \n     convene a multilateral summit to discuss exchange rates with \n     representatives of various Asian governments and other \n     interested parties, including representatives of other G-7 \n     nations.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 284\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be laid aside and we return to the Dorgan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I said 19 million Cuban people. I meant \n11 million people who live in the country of Cuba.\n  Madam President, before I yield the floor so my colleague from Oregon \ncan have the floor, let me say again, I think we will have people come \nto the floor and say: What do you mean ``a waste of money''? We have to \ndeal with the Castro government. We have to get tough. We cannot back \naway.\n  I do not come to the floor to say anything good about the Castro \ngovernment. The Cuban people deserve to be free and deserve to have the \nboot removed from their neck, the boot of oppression from a government \nthat does not allow that kind of freedom.\n  But let me say this: This country has stated as its purpose for a \nlong while with respect to China and Vietnam, both Communist countries, \nthat the road to progress toward democratic reform in those countries \nis through trade and travel and engagement. We have believed that \nfervently, Republicans and Democrats. We trade with Vietnam. We trade \nwith China. We travel to both countries. We believe that advances both \ncountries toward more human rights and better human rights.\n  It is only with Cuba we have this obsession--believing if we can \ntrack down Americans who attempt to travel in Cuba, and slap them with \nbig fines, restrict travel, restrict trade, and somehow waste money on \nthings like TV Marti--it is only with Cuba we are obsessed with a \npolicy that does not work.\n  Fidel Castro has lived through 10 Presidents. The fact is, the \nembargo this country slapped on Cuba is the best weapon he has to \ncontinue in office, to continue his power in the Cuban government. He \nsays it is the 500-pound gorilla up North that has its fist around the \nthroat of the Cuban people. It would be much smarter, in my judgment, \nto remove the travel restrictions and all the trade restrictions from \nCuba and do with Cuba as we do with China and Vietnam. The quickest way \nto move Castro out of Cuba is through trade and travel and engagement, \nand I believe that strongly.\n  But this amendment of ours does not address that. It addresses one \npiece of this obsession with Cuba; and that is, the continued spending \nof money for TV signals into the Cuban country that the Cubans cannot \nsee. It is one thing to do things that are wrong; it is another thing \nto do things that are dumb. I understand somebody shooting themselves \nin the foot. But after you have done it the first time, to take aim at \nyour foot the second time--there is something fundamentally wrong and \nunsound about the thinking that allows you to do that. That is exactly \nwhat we are doing.\n  I will yield the floor so my colleague from Oregon, who is a \ncosponsor of this amendment, can speak.\n\n[[Page S3244]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I tell my colleague, I am pleased to be \nable to team up with him on this effort. Over the last few months, we \nhave been digging into a variety of areas where waste of taxpayers' \ndollars has occurred.\n  I think Senator Dorgan has made the central argument with respect to \nour amendment; that is, you do not get tough with somebody by wasting \nmoney. In other words, we are going to have a fair amount of \ndiscussion, I suspect, on this amendment about whether you are being \nsoft minded on Castro, or something of that nature, whether you agree \nwith Castro's political agenda.\n  What we are talking about is stopping foolishness with respect to \nfrittering away taxpayer dollars. As my colleague has said, what we are \nfaced with is a situation where Fidel Castro has jammed TV Marti's \nairwaves since their conception. As a result, instead of feeding the \nCuban people a glimpse of honest television, what we have been feeding \nthe Cuban people is static and snow. Now, the snow on Cubans' TV \nscreens may be the only snow they get in Cuba, but I can assure you \nthis is about the most expensive snow we have seen on the planet.\n  What we want to do is protect the interests of taxpayers. We have \ngone through Fat Albert. Now you have the question of the sequel to Fat \nAlbert, with the President having proposed slashing other programs, \nparticularly programs here at home. How do you argue that something \nsuch as this ought to be preserved, that the use of taxpayers' dollars \nin this area ought to be preserved, where everything here at home is on \nthe chopping block during a belt-tightening environment in Government?\n  TV Marti was intended to follow in the footsteps of Radio Marti, \nproviding Cubans access to balanced information from the outside world \nso that Cubans living under Fidel Castro's regime would have a taste of \nthe freedom that Americans enjoy here at home.\n  We are willing to stipulate for purposes of this discussion and \ndebate we are having on the floor of the Senate that Radio Marti enjoys \na strong listening audience and successfully transmits news to Cubans \nfrom the outside world. But the bottom line is, TV Marti has never come \nclose--never come close--to meeting the standards of Radio Marti. I \ndefy anybody to find a significant group of people in Cuba who see this \ntelevision.\n  As Senator Dorgan has mentioned, the process of surveying people, \nwhich under normal circumstances would be a good way to determine the \nextent of use, has now been hot wired so they do not even do the \nsurveys anymore because they are not going to get the results they want \nto have. They want to have surveys that show a significant number of \npeople are getting this, and they cannot prove it. So if you cannot \nprove it, you do not put out a survey that says: Oh, no viewers. You \nsort of figure out a way to make the surveys disappear. That is \nessentially what has happened.\n  Our discussions and examination, as we have pursued this issue over \nthe last few months in an effort to root out this waste, indicates \nvirtually nobody sees this. That is where we are now. So we are looking \nat the prospect, after all of this waste of money--well over $100 \nmillion sunk into this static, this static and snow over the years--of \nspending still more money.\n  Senator Dorgan and I believe it is time to draw a line in the sand \nand say: Halt this waste. Halt this frittering away of the American \npeople's scarce dollars.\n\n  The President does have a new plan to circumvent the jamming. His \nidea is to use military aircraft to broadcast TV Marti that way. We \nhave our folks, men and women from Alaska and North Dakota and Oregon, \nand they are in harm's way today. So at a time when our troops are in \nharm's way and face great peril around the world, we are talking about \ntransferring military assets that we need to protect their well-being \nand the well-being of this country. I do not see how you can make the \ncase again that that is a wise expenditure at this time.\n  So I hope as the Senate debates the Dorgan-Wyden amendment, we can \nmake it clear that when programs such as Radio Marti work, we are \nwilling to make sure the United States plays an active role in trying \nto make sure people have information, accurate, objective information, \non what freedom is all about. But where you are talking about waste, \nwhere you are talking about funding programs that may make people say, \n``oh, you're getting tough, you're getting tough on Castro,'' when in \nfact you are wasting money, that is where the two of us are trying to \nblow the whistle and prevent further efforts to throw taxpayers' money \nat TV Marti, when there is no evidence it will work.\n  The money we have spent year after year goes, as I have said, to \nfinance some of the most expensive static, the most expensive snow in \nthe history of television screens. What we ought to be doing is making \nsure that taxpayers' dollars are spent wisely. Here it could be used in \na whole host of other areas. It is our hope, and the purpose of this \namendment, to pull the plug on a program that does not work now, has \nnot worked in the past, and is not going to work in the future.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I wonder if the Senator from Oregon will \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I used a picture of Fat Albert, the \naerostat balloon. I will show that once again. Fat Albert was \nfearlessly broadcasting television signals that no one could receive, \ndoing it for 16 years or so. And now, in order to continue broadcasting \nsignals no one can receive, we have expropriated the use of the \nPennsylvania Air National Guard's airplane called Commando Solo, one of \nonly a half a dozen ever made, used in Bosnia, used in Iraq, used in \nAfghanistan, for very sophisticated electronic psychological warfare \npurposes. That has been flying now for 4 hours a week, broadcasting \nsignals, without any evidence at all that the Cuban people can see \nthose signals.\n  So we have gone from Fat Albert to Commando Solo and now the next \nstep, to purchase a new airplane, to purchase a new airplane so TV \nMarti has its own airplane to broadcast signals no one can see. Does it \nsound a little goofy? It would in my hometown, if you told this story. \nSometimes there are people who serve here who think they know more than \nanybody else, they can see over the horizon things others cannot see.\n  There is a broad common sense in this country that takes a look at \nthings like this. And wouldn't it be the case that in a small town cafe \nin Oregon or a small town cafe in North Dakota or Alaska, people would \ntake a look at this and say: What on Earth are you thinking about, \nspending money on something we don't need and doubling the funding for \nsomething that doesn't work? Where have you been? What planet are you \nliving on?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate the Senator's question. It seems to me that \nthis is Government Waste 101. This is not complicated. Since its \ninception in 1980, it appears that this particular program, TV Marti, \nhas had essentially no real Cuban viewership. We have been doing \neverything we can to find anything resembling a current study, a \ncurrent report, any body of evidence which would indicate that there is \nan actual market, a group of Cubans who see this.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota has indicated in his question, if \nyou go into a coffee shop in Alaska or North Dakota or Oregon, this \nprogram doesn't pass the smell test. People are going to say: Look, we \ndon't like Castro. And this isn't a debate about whether you like \nCastro. I have been studying this issue since my dad wrote a book about \nthe Bay of Pigs, the untold story. So like many of my colleagues, I \nhave been studying this issue for a long time. This is not a referendum \non whether you are going to be tough on Castro or whether you like \nCastro. This is a referendum on whether we are going to allow millions \nof dollars of Government waste to go forward. We have been doing it for \nyears. We should have pulled the plug some time ago. And yet, because \nthis program sort of masquerades under the title of being tough on \nCastro, we just keep shoveling money at it.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota, who has spent a great deal of \ntime on it. I also want to come back to\n\n[[Page S3245]]\n\na point the Senator from North Dakota touched on that is very \nimportant. Personally, a lot of us would like to reexamine our policy \nwith respect to Cuba. That is not what this amendment is about. This \namendment is about one thing: whether we are going to sanction more \nwaste. This program doesn't pass the smell test. You wouldn't possibly \nbe able to explain it in a coffee shop.\n  My hope is that we support real programs, such as Radio Marti, that \nare going to make a difference in terms of getting information to the \nCuban people about areas where there is waste and not continue to \nfritter away scarce taxpayer resources.\n  I thank my colleague for giving me the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The point I have not made is, we don't propose to spend \nthis money in other ways; we simply propose that we strike the funding \nfor TV Marti, a program that doesn't work, and thereby reduce the \nFederal indebtedness. So we are not suggesting taking this money and \nspending it in some other way. Get rid of this program that doesn't \nwork, that is unneeded, and thereby eliminate at least this small \namount of Federal indebtedness.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \namendment. It is interesting that just a few minutes ago we were at the \nother end of this building in the House of Representatives in a joint \nsession of Congress hearing from President Yushchenko speaking of \nfreedom and the value of freedom and the unique opportunity freedom \npresents to a people. In order to ensure the ability of folks to raise \na family, to conduct their lives, to conduct free commerce, all of \nthese exciting things spark and begin with a flame of freedom. There is \nno more important way in which the flame of freedom can be conveyed \nthan by information and communication.\n  We know that today the world of information transforms lives, \ntransforms people around this Earth. We also know that there are still \npeople across the world who do not have the opportunity to hear the \nfree and unfettered bits of information that we so take for granted.\n  Let me take a moment to describe for you a little bit about what Cuba \nis like. Cuba is a country today where there is only one source of \ninformation: the Cuban Government. Cuba is a country where anyone who \nwould dare to use the Internet without authorization from the Cuban \nGovernment, without oversight by the Cuban Government, would have their \nfreedom threatened and taken away. In addition, we also know there is \nwithin Cuba a tremendous and growing movement of folks who believe that \nit is time for Cuba to be free as well and a dissident movement within \nCuba. Those people who dare to risk their lives and freedom each and \nevery day, those people who today suffer in Cuba's prison camps because \nof their desire to seek freedom, those people are emboldened and \nencouraged by what they can hear and see in the voices and sounds of \nfreedom.\n  For a long time the United States has had a long and valued tradition \nof standing with people who are oppressed and suppressed. Mr. \nYushchenko spoke this morning eloquently of the words of Ronald Reagan \nwhen he said ``tear down this wall'' and what a profound impact that \nhad in beginning the change that occurred in the eastern European \nnations.\n  In addition to that, we know the words of Vaclav Havel, other leaders \nof the ``Velvet Revolution,'' and also the people of Poland, Lech \nWalesa. And they have said that without a doubt, the thing that made a \ndifference in their lives was Radio Free Europe. I have never heard any \none of these patriots of liberty of the modern day say in any public \nsetting that the difference was made for them in seeking freedom when \nmore tourists came and drank rum in their country or when they had the \nopportunity to see foodstuff in stores that they couldn't buy. But I \nhave heard repeatedly said how valuable was the information and the \nopportunity to pierce that government control over the people.\n  You see the control of information is not just about the exchange of \nnews and information, valuable as that is. It is about showing the \npeople who dare to rise in opposition to tyranny that the tyrannical \nregime that controls their lives is not all powerful, is not \nomnipresent, but that they, in fact, have the right and opportunity to \nhear the message of freedom and liberty.\n  Let me talk specifically about TV Marti. The fact is that while we \nmight mock in commentary what happens with the TV Marti broadcast to \nCuba, I have a little different story. Around the time of my ascension \nto the U.S. Senate, when I had this awesome and unique privilege, the \nfirst Cuban American, the first person born in the island of Cuba to \never have the honor to speak from this floor, to be a part of this \nlongest serving democratic institution in the history of mankind, the \npeople of Cuba were rightfully proud and excited by that moment.\n\n  I want to tell you that about the time of my taking my oath, I did an \ninterview for TV Marti. I spoke of my thrill and my pride and my hopes \nand aspirations as I came to the Senate. That interview was broadcast \nby Commando Solo. That interview was broadcast in the only way in which \nthey can pierce Castro's control over his people about information: by \nflying this airplane over international waters in a way that can and \ndoes, in fact, pierce Castro's blockade and jamming.\n  That information that got through that night, that interview was seen \nby people in the hometown where I grew up, Sagua La Grande, Cuba. It is \na small city on the northern coast of Cuba where I had the joy of \ngrowing up as a small child and where today there are people who still \nremember me and my family, and where there were people who, \nunbelievably to me, heard the broadcast and were able to communicate \nthrough telephone and otherwise about what they had seen and heard on \nTV that day, about the images of me taking my oath on this very floor, \nabout the images of me celebrating with other people who supported my \ncandidacy, who came from Florida, many of them Cuban Americans who rode \non a bus for 18 hours to come here and join with me and celebrate.\n  They joined with me here, but those people in Cuba had the \nopportunity to see those images in my very hometown where I was born, \nto see me take the oath of office from Vice President Cheney, President \nof the Senate. That happened because of the Commando Solo flights. It \nwas a moving experience to the people in this little town, the people \nwho I know sometimes seem unimportant and are not very well known but \nwho, in fact, have the rare opportunity to see that blockade pierced.\n  So what is our hope? Our hope is we can expand that, that we can do \nmore of it, that we can transfer the technology we now have and the \nability to pierce the information blockade so that more and more people \ncan have this information. Too often we talk about an economic blockade \nwith Cuba. The greatest blockade that exists in Cuba, in the words of \nsome of Cuba's dissidents, is the blockade of the Cuban Government \nagainst its own people, whether it be for economic opportunity, the \nrights of the individual, or just to perceive and hear information that \ncomes across the airwaves.\n  I believe that while imperfect and while still a work in progress, \nfor us to turn our backs on those people in Cuba who depend today on \nthe little bit of information they can get through Radio and TV Marti \nwould be a step away from the long and proud tradition of this country \nto stand by people who are oppressed. To harken back to the words of \nPresident Bush, to the words he gave upon taking office for his second \nterm, if you are oppressed, we stand with you. If you seek freedom, we \nwill be by your side. That wave of democracy that President Bush has \nbegun in places such as the Middle East, that is the very hope that we \nhave.\n  The President's policy toward Cuba began on May 10 of last year. It \nis a dynamic policy. It is not just about what we don't do; it is about \nwhat we do, about the proactive measures such as the Commando Solo \nflights, the opportunity for TV Marti to, in fact, be seen by the Cuban \npeople, the opportunity for us to help the dissident movements, for us \nto proactively help the people of Cuba to remove the yoke of tyranny \nfrom their backs.\n\n[[Page S3246]]\n\n  I believe that when the facts are examined, we would also know that \nthe Interests Section Survey in Havana monitors the ability of the \nCommando Solo flights to be seen by the Cuban people. There is no such \nthing in Cuba as a Gallup poll or the ability to even speak freely \nabout what you watch on TV, but 16 percent of those surveyed responded \nin the affirmative to the U.S. Interests Section in Havana that they \nwere, in fact, seeing TV Marti and that it reached an audience. It does \nnot cover the entire island. It doesn't cover as much as we would like. \nBut each and every day, we make more happen with it.\n  I am proud to be a supporter of the efforts of TV Marti, and I urge \nmy colleagues to defeat this amendment which would end the little \nglimmer of light that is available to the people of Cuba today and that \notherwise would not be there for them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to yield myself \nsuch time as I may consume on this amendment by the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I rise to urge my colleagues to oppose \nthis amendment and continue to support our country's investment in \ntelevision broadcasting into Cuba. Otherwise known as TV Marti. The \nSenator from North Dakota may be exaggerating, and folks get carried \naway as well. He will say that this is not needed. This is needed. \nThere may be a question as to how effective the TV Marti signal is \ngetting in to Cuba.\n  Because we are talking about signals and broadcasts, let's make sure \nwe are sending the right signal here. Whether it is my good friend from \nOregon or whether my friend from North Dakota, we all, I would hope, \nwant to make sure we are standing strong on the ability of people who \nare repressed and under the tyranny of Castro, to get information.\n  There are questions as to whether all the ways that we are trying to \nget around the jamming and scrambling of signals by Castro's regime are \neffective or not; however, it is a matter of our national interest that \nwe try to get information, objective information, to the people of \nCuba. It doesn't matter one's culture. All human beings, no matter \ntheir background or culture, if given the choice, the opportunity, will \nchoose freedom. We have seen it with the Afghan people. We have seen it \nwith the people in Iraq. We are seeing it with the Lebanese rising up \nto get the Syrian troops out. We have seen it with the Palestinians, \nwith the death of the corrupt terrorist Arafat. The same applies to the \npeople of Cuba, or anywhere else in the world. The Cuban people share \nthe desire that all human beings have, and that is a need to have \ninformation and an opportunity to determine their own destiny.\n  I believe that Radio Marti and TV Marti can help promote freedom and \njustice in Cuba. We all know the United States has sponsored television \nand radio broadcasting in Cuba for almost 20 years. The effect of all \nof that--and we can all try to find measurements. It is not as if you \ncan go around Cuba and do surveys. This is not allowed. Remember, this \nis Castro's regime. If I want some evidence of a probative witness, I \nam going to listen to the Senator from Florida, Mr. Martinez, who made \nhistory, standing here as the first person ever born in Cuba to be \nelected to serve in the U.S. Senate. He understands the impact of our \nmessage to Cuba better than anybody or any statistics one would want to \nput forth.\n  So while we understand it is very difficult to get into Cuba and make \nsure of the effectiveness of TV or radio broadcasts, it is well known \nthat Radio Marti--and to the extent we can get TV Marti in--is looked \nupon as an authoritative and reliable source of accurate, objective, \nand comprehensive news for the Cuban people.\n  If this Congress were to eliminate TV Marti, we would be sending the \nwrong message to the Cuban people. At a time when freedom is on the \nmarch around the world, eliminating TV Marti would tell the Cuban \npeople--I suspect Castro would be getting his minions and fellow thugs \nof that regime out to say the United States isn't going to bother. We \nsucceeded with jamming or scrambling the signals, saying the United \nStates doesn't want to worry about this. It would be a signal for him \nto say that the United States is not committed to the cause of freedom \nin Cuba. Of course, with his long history of repressing free speech and \nthe free flow of information and ideas in Cuba, this plays right into \nCastro's hands.\n  Thomas Jefferson once said:\n\n       A free people [claim] their rights as derived from the laws \n     of nature, and not as a gift of their chief magistrate.\n\n  The sharing of information and free flow of ideas, and the foundation \nof any free country is not to be something that is given or taken away \nby the machinations of a dictator like Castro.\n  In my view, there are four pillars of a free and just society. This \nis how I measure freedom myself for people if they are living in a free \nand just society. The first pillar is freedom of religion, where \npeople's rights are not enhanced or diminished because of religious \nbeliefs; second, freedom of expression; third, private ownership of \nproperty; fourth, the rule of law, where disputes are adjudicated \nfairly and God-given rights are protected. The second pillar, freedom \nof expression, is absolutely essential, where people are allowed to get \ninformation and to think for themselves. To communicate not in a way \nthat is harmful, but the God-given rights of expression being \nprotected.\n  We have to support the opportunity of the people of Cuba to get \ninformation. They are not going to get it from their Government. People \nwill say, gosh, we are having to use airplanes. There are different \nways you have to get at it. You cannot use balloons or a dirigible; you \ncannot do it off of broadcasting. Why can't we use it the way everybody \nelse sees TV? It is because of that regime. Sometimes you have to be \nmore clever than some of the reptilian cutthroats that we are dealing \nwith. In my view, we ought to stand for the concept of freedom of \nexpression. We have seen it work and we have seen it on Radio Marti. I \nhate wasting money, but there are certain things we need to do. This is \nactually a less expensive way of advocating freedom, by using \ntechnology--using extraordinary means, but still getting the message to \nthe people of Cuba, regardless of the obstacles that are established by \nCastro's regime. I think we need to be providing news, commentary, and \npromoting the open exchange of information and ideas in Cuba and \nelsewhere to promote the cause of freedom.\n  To be effective in further opening communications and the sharing of \nideas throughout Cuba, Radio and TV Marti must continue to be broadcast \nand should receive our country's support. I sincerely urge my \ncolleagues to oppose this amendment and stand with the Senator from \nFlorida, Mr. Martinez, but, most importantly, stand for the advancement \nof freedom.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, the business before us is the \nDorgan amendment, which strikes $21 million from the President's budget \nand prevents the funds from being used for the broadcast of TV Marti.\n  You can say I have a parochial interest in this, being the senior \nSenator from Florida, joining my colleague, Senator Martinez. Indeed, \nwe do have a parochial interest because we have quite a few Cuban \nAmericans who are citizens of our State. But the reason we should \ndefeat this amendment goes far beyond parochial interests, or any \ninterest of any particular group, for it strikes at what the heart of \nAmerica stands for in our promotion of freedom--freedom of speech, \nfreedom of assembly, freedom of the press--all of these freedoms that \nwe are privileged to have, protected by our Constitution, which \nsupposedly are protected under the Cuban Constitution, but have never \nbeen protected.\n  This amendment sends the wrong message to the Cuban people at a time \nwhen change is in the wind, when in fact change is occurring on the \nisland. This amendment would cut the entire budget for TV Marti.\n  It would also prevent the Broadcast Board of Governors from \npurchasing a small aircraft that they will use to transmit the signals. \nThe aircraft is\n\n[[Page S3247]]\n\nequipped to broadcast both television and radio signals. Eliminating \nthis funding would also limit the U.S. radio broadcast operations. \nCurrent broadcasting operations, including radio, are conducted from a \nDepartment of Defense EC-130 Commando Solo aircraft. It is based, \ninterestingly, in Harrisburg, PA. It has to fly every Saturday all the \nway from Pennsylvania down to the Florida Keys for its mission. It \nmakes a lot more sense for the Broadcasting Board of Governors to have \na smaller aircraft that is located close to Cuba, being more economical \nand still having the same equipment.\n  This station and this money shows our commitment to the Cuban people \nas they continue to suffer under a dictatorship that ignores human \nrights and imprisons political dissidents. We simply should not be \nturning our backs on Cubans at a time when the regime is beginning to \ncrack and a fledgling civil society is emerging.\n  Look, for example, at what has happened in the last couple of years. \nThe Senate has heard me speak many times on the floor about this very \nbrave Cuban named Oswaldo Paya and the Varela Project; where Cuban \ncitizens put their name on a petition to the Government. Interestingly, \nthis is under a process of the Cuban Constitution that said if you get \n10,000 signatures--and they got well over that--that automatically an \nissue goes to the Government. The petition calls for freedom of \nexpression, freedom of association, free enterprise, electoral reform, \nand also calls for elections within 1 year.\n  Have those brave Cubans who stood up suffered reprisals and \nintimidation by the Cuban security forces? You bet they have, and some \nof them went to jail. And only because the international community \nraised Cain were some of the dissidents released when, in fact, others \nare still in jail. But they were brave, and they went ahead and signed \nthat petition that was generated by Oswaldo Paya. This type of \ndissident action is supported and promoted through TV Marti.\n  Some say all of these signals have been jammed. They have been jammed \nbecause they were either being transmitted from a stationary tower or \nthey were being jammed when they tried to start transmitting from a \nsatellite in the eastern Atlantic. This new airplane has only been \nflying since the fall of last year. We have to give it a chance to see \nif the signals are getting through. Now we will do it more economically \nwith the smaller aircraft.\n  I will give another example of what is happening on the island in \naddition to the Varela Project. There are others in Cuba who are coming \ntogether to create civil society groups advocating for basic human \nrights and changes in the Cuban Government's structure. On May 20, next \nmonth, these groups will come together for the first time ever in \nHavana for a historic meeting to openly discuss and debate the future \nof the island and a transition after the future death of Castro.\n  TV Marti has produced a series of TV programs, including a 10-part \nseries in which experts discuss a possible transition to democracy. \nThat needs to be out there to be received by the Cuban people.\n  These are just some of the historic changes that are occurring on the \nisland. These are the reasons that, maintaining our commitment to the \nfreedom-loving Cuban people, we need to continue to broadcast TV Marti \nto Cuba.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Senators, we need your \nhelp. Senadores, necesitamos su ayuda.\n  I yield to my colleague from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question? \nI wonder if the Senator has considered why the Cuban Government would \nspend all the money and make all the effort that it takes for them to \njam these broadcasts. If it is not insignificant, if it is not \nimportant, why does the Senator think the Cuban Government goes on day \nafter day jamming at great cost and expense each and every time we have \nbroadcasts to Cuba?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I say to my colleague from \nFlorida, the proof is in the pudding. Absolutely, the Castro Government \nfor years has continued to try to jam broadcasts, and the fact is that \nwe know the broadcasts of Radio Marti get through to the island. \nBroadcasting by this airplane is a new means by which we can get the \ntransmission of TV Marti into the island. This clearly is what America \nstands for.\n  I am going to close. I see the chairman of our Foreign Relations \nCommittee wanting to be recognized. I say to Chairman Lugar, when I was \n17 years old, I was taken, representing the youth of America, to \nGermany to broadcast over Radio Free Europe behind the Iron Curtain on \na broadcast that years later we found out, much beyond my little \nbroadcast, had a profound effect in bringing information to people who \nwere enslaved behind the Iron Curtain. That was effective.\n  I think this is going to be effective in Cuba behind that iron \ncurtain that enslaves those people on the island of Cuba.\n  Therefore, it is my hope, my prayer, that we will continue this \neffort, particularly where there are the beginning signs of liberty \nstriking out all over the island.\n  I thank the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, the esteemed \nSenator from Indiana, for the opportunity to speak on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, there has been a good debate on this \namendment. It is an important amendment. I just wanted to make the \npoint, however, that we have reached a point in our bill where we are \ngoing to have to move expeditiously; therefore, I move to table the \namendment and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this moment there is not a sufficient \nsecond.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield to the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I simply wanted 5 minutes to respond to some of what has \nbeen said. I have no objection at all to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I would like an additional 5 minutes as \ncoauthor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the motion to table has been made. If we \ndid it 5 minutes, 5 minutes, and then the vote?\n  Mr. LUGAR. OK.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from North Dakota \nbe recognized for 5 minutes, the Senator from Oregon for 5 minutes, the \nSenator from Indiana for 1 minute, and then we vote on his motion to \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I regret that we have a disagreement on \nthe Senate floor, but I am not surprised. I would like to make a couple \nof comments. First, those who have opposed this amendment apparently \nhave tried to win a debate we are not having. This debate is not about \nnurturing the flame of freedom. It is not about resisting tyranny. All \nof that is wonderful. I could stand here and tell a story about Vaclav \nHavel on a late night on a street corner in Prague, Czechoslovakia, \nhearing the Declaration of Independence for this country being recited \nby someone in Czechoslovakia. I could tell a story about Lech Walesa \nand what he did to light the flame of freedom in Poland, but I will not \ndo that. That is not what this debate is about.\n  My colleague from Florida, Senator Martinez, talked about how \nimportant these television signals are and that is why the Castro \nGovernment jams them each and every day. That is the point he made. \nThat is exactly the point I was making.\n  If, in fact, these are jammed--and they are--let me read the expert \nfrom the U.S. Government. He says: Even though TV Marti is jammed, it \nis well positioned to be an important instrument of U.S. foreign policy \nor a crisis will occur on the island. Transmission to Cuba ``has been \nconsistently jammed by the Cuban government.'' That is a U.S. official \nsaying that. So we spend $10 million a year to send television signals \nno one can receive in Cuba to a Fat Albert, the aerostat balloon, and\n\n[[Page S3248]]\n\nnow we have decided we are going to Commando Solo, a C-130 specially \nequipped.\n  By the way, there is no new technology here. I know several people \nhave said this is new technology. Nonsense. This is plain old-fashioned \nwaste of the taxpayers' money by now using a C-130 airplane to send \ntelevision signals into Cuba the Cubans cannot receive. This is the \nsame technology that is used by Fat Albert, the aerostat balloon. We \nhave been doing it for 16 years. We have wasted $189 million.\n  I support Radio Marti. I have been to Cuba. That gets through to the \nCuban people. I believe we ought to remove the embargo and allow trade \nand travel to Cuba. That is the quickest way to get rid of Fidel \nCastro, but that is not even the subject. The subject is will this \nCongress, when they see colossal waste, fraud, and abuse, stand up and \ndecide to stop the spending?\n  When we talk about freedom, the question is this: Is there freedom \nfrom waste, fraud, and abuse for the American taxpayer? Does that \nfreedom exist? If it does, will we decide to take that step in this \nvote?\n  I started this morning by saying even waste has a constituency in the \nCongress. It seems to me quite clear that we have had our colleagues \nsay: Well, this is not perfect. Not perfect? What do they mean, not \nperfect? We broadcast television signals that the receivers cannot get \nand spend $10 million a year, and now we are going to double funding \nwith the ``purchase of a small airplane''? Eight million dollars to buy \na new airplane now to broadcast signals the Cubans cannot receive? We \nare going to double the funding? I am sorry. This is simply wasting the \ntaxpayers' money.\n  I am all for doing things that remove the boot of oppression from the \nnecks of the Cuban people, but I am not for wasting the taxpayers' \nmoney. We have been told now by the opponents of this amendment that \nthis would send a bad message if we cease TV Marti, sending signals \nthey cannot receive. Stopping that would send a bad message. That is \nthe point of all of this, is it not?\n  Are we sending a message or are we not? The point of it all is we are \nspending a lot of money believing we are sending a message that is \nnever received. Sending a message to someone who does not receive it, \nsending a message by aerostat balloon or by a C-130 or by a new $8 \nmillion airplane to 11 million people who cannot see it is \nfundamentally foolish.\n  Where is the freedom from waste, fraud, and abuse that the American \npeople ought to expect from this Congress? We will see whether that \nfreedom exists in the next 5 or 10 minutes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The Senator yields.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as we conclude with this amendment, I \nparticularly thank the distinguished chairman of the committee for this \nextra time and get back to this question of what the amendment is \nreally all about. I do not quibble at all with the fact that this is a \nlaudable effort to promote freedom, as the Senator from Florida is \ntalking about, but I believe it has to be about more than effort; it \nhas to be about a result.\n  For example, something that strikes me as something that would be \nvery useful is to set up Internet Marti. We have seen, for example, \nwhat happened in China. What really rattled the Chinese Government was \nthe presence of the Internet. As far as I can tell, they have been \nstruggling to block that out as well. They have not been able to do \nthat. But that is the kind of investment that would make sense to me.\n  I would be thrilled to work with the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida on wireless technology, for example. I have served on the \nCommerce Committee. I have a great interest in technology. I think \nthere is a lot of potential as it relates to these kinds of concerns: \nwireless technology, Internet Marti.\n  What brings us to the floor today is that we talk about the flicker \nof freedom, which I am certainly for. As far as I can tell, the only \nthing the Cuban people see flickering is all that static on TV. So I \nhope we can save some money, which is the point of this amendment \nSenator Dorgan and I have offered, and then counsel together on a \nbipartisan basis through the chairman of the committee, Senator Lugar, \nSenator Martinez, our friend Senator Nelson, on something that would be \npractical. Sign me up for something like Internet Marti, something that \nwould be a well-targeted investment, would allow us to build on the \npotential to cap other technologies, wireless technologies, Web-based \ntechnologies. That is something that seems to me makes sense.\n  I hope my colleagues will approve this money, allow us to start \ntargeting these Government expenditures during a time of belt-\ntightening in a more cost-effective way.\n  I urge the passage of the amendment, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the President of the United States has \ndirected deployment of aircraft with capability of transmitting radio \nand television signals into Cuba. Thanks to the aircraft, plus Radio \nand TV Marti, they are reaching parts of the island that were \npreviously unable to receive those signals. That is tremendously \nimportant.\n  As oppressive as that regime is, the state exerts extensive \ncensorship. The Cubans are told only what the state wants them to know \nand are denied the right to obtain accurate information on Cuba and the \nworld. We need to do all we can to open that up.\n  I appreciate the debate. It has offered avenues of constructive \ncriticism of the program, but the program needs to continue. It is \nvital to our security and, we believe, the future of the Cuban people.\n  I renew my request for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. 284.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 65, nays 35, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 85 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--65\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kerry\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--35\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Rockefeller\n     Stabenow\n     Sununu\n     Wyden\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, in a moment I want to ask the Chair to \nrecognize Senators Schumer and Graham for an amendment on Chinese \ncurrency. Before I ask the Chair to do that, let me simply indicate \nthat the status of our bill is such that amendments that clearly fall \nin the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee are going to be opposed \nnot only by that committee but by the so-called blue-slip process, \nwhich means that our bill might not receive consideration on the floor \nof the Senate or ultimately on the floor of the House.\n  So leaving aside the substance of whatever may be the merits of an \namendment, we are talking about an existential question for this bill \nitself as to whether it survives or has the hope of doing so.\n  For that reason, I just want to advise Senators why, at the end of \nabout 40\n\n[[Page S3249]]\n\nminutes of debate, which I hope will be adequate for an exploration by \nthe proponents of what they wish to do, I will be moving to table, to \npreserve really, this bill, the bill we are on. At that point I will \nask the support of the body to table the Schumer-Graham amendment, \nwhatever might be its merits, on the basis of jurisdiction.\n  We are going to have this problem two or three more times on \namendments that have been suggested by Senators. So I make that point \nnow, that will have to be the course of this chairman to preserve at \nleast some hope we will have an authorization bill at all at the end of \nthis process.\n  Having said all that, I am hopeful the Chair might recognize Senators \nSchumer and Graham for a presentation of their amendment. And after \nabout 40 minutes, we will come to a conclusion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, before that, will the Senator yield? I had \nspoken to the Senator from Indiana about perhaps taking 3 to 4 minutes \nbefore they start on another matter. I ask unanimous consent, if I \nmight, to be recognized for not to exceed 4 minutes. I assure the \nSenator it will not be beyond that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Indiana for \nhis usual courtesy.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 309\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I call up amendment 309.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Schumer-\nGraham, et al., amendment that would authorize actions in currency \nnegotiations with China. I have come before the Senate on a number of \noccasions to speak about how strongly I feel against providing \npermanent normal trade relations to China. The Chinese have been \nsystematically devaluing their currency, and they have been buying up \ndollars. This is all done in a concerted effort to keep their goods \ncheaper than United States goods.\n  This should come as no surprise to anyone who has followed how the \nChinese behaved over the years. China's human rights record, their \nantagonism toward Taiwan, and the threat they pose to our own national \nsecurity have been well documented. These issues have been swept under \nthe rug as the Senate has given away its voice on our trade \nrelationship with the most populous nation on the globe. For me it \nlooks as though we are simply putting profits over people. That is \nplain wrong.\n  Now we have a chance to correct that. The amendment before the Senate \nwill give the administration a real tool to deal with the Chinese. The \nChinese need our markets to sell their goods. If we take it away from \nthem, we will have their attention. Hopefully this amendment will show \nthe Chinese we are serious this time and that they need to play fair \nand let the market set the value on their currency.\n  Those opposed to the amendment will talk as if the American economy \nwill be seriously harmed if we pass the amendment. I argue our economy \nis already being harmed. We are losing manufacturing jobs as a direct \nresult of Chinese policies. The Chinese are killing what is left of our \ndomestic textile industry. Hopefully, the U.S. Trade Representative's \noffice will step in. It sounds as though they will. But we are \ndangerously close to losing what few textile jobs we have left in \nKentucky, and I know other States are in the same boat.\n  For those who are not concerned about China's human rights, foreign \npolicy, and trade record, let's take another cold, hard look at the \nfacts. China operates one of the most oppressive regimes in the world, \nbrutalizing its own people and persecuting people of faith. China ships \nweapons of mass destruction to terrorist states. China threatens other \nfreedom advocates such as Taiwan and snubs its nose at the \ninternational community by occupying Tibet. China tried to buy access \nto our Government through illegal campaign contributions and to \ninfluence our elections.\n  The trade deficit with China has grown to record heights. For over a \ndecade, the supporters of free trade with China have been making the \narguments over and over again that China is changing, that things are \ngetting better, and that we will soon reap the benefits of free trade \nwith China. The facts prove them wrong. It has been over 10 years since \nTiananmen Square and the Chinese are still oppressing their own people. \nThey are still selling weapons to terrorists. They are still bullying \nother nations and threatening Taiwan and United States interests in the \nPacific. Nothing is any different with China now. In fact, it might be \nworse.\n  Those who say otherwise are fooling themselves. We are seeing a march \nof freedom around the world--in Afghanistan, Iraq, the Orange \nRevolution in the Ukraine, whose President addressed Congress today, \nthe Cedar Revolution in Lebanon, and other prodemocracy revolutions. We \nhave seen that the time of the oppressive regimes is coming to an end. \nIt is time to stop propping up the Communist government of Red China. \nVote for the Schumer-Graham, et al. amendment and tell the Chinese our \nGovernment will no longer support tyranny. Vote for this amendment for \nthe sake of America's economy and our workers. Vote for this amendment \nbecause it is the right thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. What is the status of the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time control.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We are trying to do the debate within 40 minutes. That \nwas our goal.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. No time limit, but we will try to keep it to 40 minutes. \nGreat.\n  I rise in strong support of this amendment of which my friend from \nKentucky is a cosponsor. The lead sponsor of this legislation is \nSenator Graham as well as myself. What this legislation does is simple. \nIt says to the Chinese, enough already. It says to the Chinese that \ntheir unfair trade policies have got to end. It says to the Chinese, \nthis is a shot across your bow. Reform because if you don't, there are \ngoing to be dramatic consequences throughout the world, in our country, \nand in your country as well.\n  The bottom line is very simple: The Chinese have enjoyed a huge trade \nsurplus with the United States, as this chart shows. Every year it gets \nlarger and larger and larger. Admittedly, some of that trade surplus is \ndue to the rules of free trade. But much of that trade surplus is \nbecause the Chinese don't play fairly. They don't let our goods into \ntheir country. I can tell you of company after company in New York that \ncannot sell goods in China or can only sell the goods under certain \nconditions that make it impossible for them to sell them.\n  The Chinese make no effort to prevent the ripping off of our \nintellectual property. These are our crown jewels, the great \ncreativity, the great entrepreneurialness of the American business \ncommunity that is taken, and they shrug their shoulders. And worst of \nall, the Chinese, despite the fact that they have tremendous advantages \nby the rules of free trade, pile on unfair rules that violate free \ntrade.\n  At the top of that list is the fact that the Chinese peg their \ncurrency abnormally low so that their exports get a 27-percent \nadvantage in the United States; our imports get a 27-percent \ndisadvantage when sold in China. Every tenet of free trade, if you \nbelieve in it, says they should not peg their currency.\n  Senator Graham and I have foreborn. We were asked by the \nadministration last year: Let us negotiate. I agreed. Negotiating would \nbe better. But nothing happened. The Chinese give lipservice and don't \nchange their trade policies a jot.\n  What does this mean for America? It means a huge job loss.\n  We have suffered dramatically in manufacturing jobs, and now service \njobs and other jobs. It means we have a huge trade deficit. It means \nthe dollar\n\n[[Page S3250]]\n\nsinks to abysmally low levels, threatening our wealth. It creates chaos \nin the whole world trading system. The euro and the yen bear the \npressure of the Chinese currency evaluation against the dollar.\n  We are fed up. This is a measure that should not have to be on this \nfloor. The Chinese should play by the rules once and for all. How can \nwe stand by as millions of American workers lose their jobs, as \nthousands of American companies cannot compete fairly, as our country \nas a whole has wealth drained from it?\n  The U.S.-China Commission, set up by this and the other body to try \nto bring fair trade to China, believes this is the best way to go. The \nlist of manufacturers, business leaders, and labor leaders who support \nthis legislation is long and large. It is a bipartisan amendment. \nSenator Graham and I have endeavored to pick up equal amounts of \nsupport from each side of the aisle. No one seeks political advantage. \nWhat we seek, rather, is fairness--fairness in trade, not in the sense \nof saying we don't want free trade, but in the sense of playing by the \nrules.\n  The Chinese do not play by the rules. We have talked and talked and \ntalked, as a nation, to them, with other nations of the world. We have \ntalked and talked to the Chinese until we are blue in the face. The \ntime for action is now. If not now, when? If not us, who? Millions of \nAmerican workers, thousands of American businesses, look to us to try \nto set things right. Today, by passing the Schumer-Graham amendment, we \ncan do that. My guess is this would not have to become law. As soon as \nit passes this body, the Chinese will actually start to negotiate in \nearnest. But as long as they think all we do is wield words and do \nnothing to prevent these practices from continuing year after year \nafter year, they will not budge. So it has come to this.\n  This amendment is probably one of the most important amendments we \nwill vote on this year in this session of the Senate. I urge my \ncolleagues to study it, to not put off the hour of decision, and to \nsupport the Schumer-Graham amendment.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, first, I acknowledge that it has been a \npleasure to work with Senator Schumer and others to develop this \namendment. We have been involved in this effort for 2 years. We come \nfrom different ends of the political spectrum on many issues, but we \nfound common ground here because we hear the comments, whether it is in \nSouth Carolina or New York, from manufacturing entities and other \nbusiness people basically saying China has a business relationship that \nwe cannot compete with. The political dynamic here is real.\n  Senator Lugar explained how this amendment affects this bill. I want \nto let him know I totally understand that. We are now basically running \nout of options. As Senator Schumer said, whether this amendment becomes \nlaw is probably not the point. The point is that the Chinese need to \nunderstand where the Senate and House stand. The President spoke \nnumerous times about trying to get China to change the value of the \ncurrency. Secretary Snow has been to China and brought up this topic. \nThere has been a begrudging movement in words but none in deeds. Talk \nis literally cheap with the Chinese. Their money is cheaper and it is \nhaving an effect on our economy and world relationships that need to be \nmet with decisive political action, because the truth is, for the last \ndecade we have had a very mixed message when it comes to China--both \nRepublicans and Democrats. The only thing the Chinese understand is \nresolve. The one thing this country has had, when it comes to China in \nterms of trade, is the lack of resolve.\n\n  No one is advocating building a wall around our country. China \npresents a great opportunity for American business. What we are \nadvocating is allowing China to become part of the world community \nunder the same set of rules we all abide by. They are missing the mark \nby miles. The money they are making off these trade agreements, where \nthey cheat, is not going into the hands of the everyday Chinese worker; \nit is going into their military. If we had the same approach during the \nSoviet Union era by having trade deals with the Soviet Union that would \nbe constantly violated, enriching the government, the Soviet Union \nwould never have collapsed.\n  China's Communist government is taking the benefit of these trade \ndeals and enriching their military and growing in economic and military \nstrength in the way that I think hampers freedom. It doesn't help \nspread it. Here are the facts. Since March, 2002, the U.S. dollar has \nfallen 30 percent against the euro. You know what that has done against \nthe yuan? Not one change. Thirty percent against the euro, but no \nchange against the yuan. They always create an advantage. When we \npassed normal trading relations with China in 2001, the trade deficit \nwas $100 billion; today it is $160 billion--a 60-percent increase of a \ntrade imbalance since PNTR was passed.\n  Now, is our market access improving? There is a 5-percent increase of \nAmerican goods going to China. If you don't believe me and Senator \nSchumer, and you think we are advocating a protectionist philosophy \nthat is antiquated and outdated in the 21st century, maybe you will \nbelieve the U.S.-China Commission, which was authorized and empowered \nby the Congress, the Senate and the House, to investigate China's \nbusiness dealings, their trade policies.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this document printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nU.S.-China Commission Releases Findings and Recommendations on China's \n                               WTO Record\n\n       The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission has \n     released the official record of its two-day public hearing \n     held on February 3 and 4, 2005 in Washington, DC examining \n     China and the WTO: Assessing and Enforcing Compliance.\n       The hearing examined China's record of compliance to date \n     with its WTO commitments and explored options for using U.S. \n     trade laws and WTO mechanisms to address continuing trade \n     problems, including China's undervalued currency and weak \n     enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPR) \n     protections. The Commission heard testimony from senior \n     Administration officials, industry groups, labor \n     organizations, economists, and trade law experts, as well as \n     a bipartisan group of Members of Congress from both the House \n     of Representatives and the Senate.\n       There was a general consensus among the witnesses that \n     China remains in violation of its WTO obligations in a number \n     of areas impacting vital U.S. economic interests. Witnesses \n     highlighted China's undervalued currency and lack of IPR \n     protections and expressed the view that U.S. government \n     efforts to move China to address these serious problems have \n     not achieved satisfactory results. The hearing also dealt \n     with the application of U.S. trade remedies. The Commission \n     heard testimony that the Administration has not effectively \n     utilized available U.S. anti-dumping laws and China-specific \n     import safeguards to counter China's unfair trade practices.\n       ``It has become increasingly clear that China is not \n     meeting key commitments it made when joining the WTO and that \n     our trade laws have to date been insufficient in addressing \n     these problems,'' said Commission Chairman C. Richard \n     D'Amato. ``In some cases our trade remedies need to be \n     enhanced, in other cases they have been woefully \n     underutilized. The end result has been a trading relationship \n     that is undermining important U.S. economic interests.''\n       In response to these concerns, the Commission has developed \n     a comprehensive set of recommendations to the Congress \n     designed to improve the use of U.S. trade remedies and to \n     move China toward more effective compliance with its WTO \n     commitments. A list of the Commission's recommendations is \n     attached.\n       The complete hearing record is available on the \n     Commission's web site at www.uscc.gov. Copies may be obtained \n     by calling the Commission at (202) 624-1407.\n\n\n                Addressing China's Currency Manipulation\n\n       The Commission recommends that Congress pursue the \n     following measures to move China toward a significant near-\n     term upward revaluation of the yuan by at least 25 percent.\n       Press the Administration to file a WTO dispute regarding \n     China's exchange rate practices. China's exchange rate \n     practices violate a number of its WTO and IMF membership \n     obligations, including the WTO prohibition on export \n     subsidies and the IMF proscription of currency manipulation.\n       Consider imposing an immediate, across-the-board tariff on \n     Chinese imports unless China significantly strengthens the \n     value of its currency against the dollar or against a basket \n     of currencies. The tariff should be set at a level \n     approximating the impact of the undervalued yuan. The United \n     States can justify such an action under WTO Article\n\n[[Page S3251]]\n\n     XXI, which allows members to take necessary actions to \n     protect their national security. China's undervalued currency \n     has contributed to a loss of U.S. manufacturing, which is a \n     national security concern for the United States.\n       Reduce the ability of the Treasury Department to use \n     technical definitions to avoid classifying China as a \n     currency manipulator by amending the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act \n     to (i) include a clear definition of currency manipulation, \n     and (ii) eliminate the requirement that a country must be \n     running a material global trade surplus in order for the \n     Secretary of the Treasury to determine that the country is \n     manipulating its currency to gain a trade advantage.\n\n\n        Addressing Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Violations\n\n       The Commission recommends that Congress urge USTR to \n     immediately file one or more WTO disputes pertaining to \n     China's violation of its WTO IPR obligations, particularly \n     China's failure to meet the requisite standards of effective \n     enforcement, including criminal enforcement.\n\n\n                 Treating China as a Nonmarket Economy\n\n       The Commission recommends that Congress require that the \n     Department of Commerce obtain Congressional approval before \n     implementing any determination that a nonmarket economy such \n     as China has achieved market economy status. Congress should \n     ensure that China continues to be treated as a nonmarket \n     economy in the application of antidumping and countervailing \n     duties through 2016, as is explicitly permitted by China's \n     WTO accession agreement, unless China clearly meets the \n     statutory requirements for market economy status.\n\n\n                         WTO Dispute Resolution\n\n       The Commission recommends that Congress establish a review \n     body of distinguished, retired U.S. jurists and legal experts \n     to evaluate the dispute resolution mechanism at the WTO. The \n     review body would consider all decisions made by a WTO \n     dispute settlement panel or appellate body that are contrary \n     to the U.S. position taken in the case. In each instance, a \n     finding would be made as to whether the WTO ruling exceeded \n     the WTO's authority by placing new international obligations \n     on the United States that it did not assent to in joining the \n     WTO. If three affirmative findings were made in five years, \n     Congress would be prompted to reconsider the relationship \n     between the United States and the WTO.\n\n\n           Enhancing the Effectiveness of U.S. Trade Remedies\n\n       The Commission recommends that Congress authorize \n     compensation to petitioners in the Section 421 safeguard \n     process for legal fees incurred in cases where the ITC finds \n     that market disruption has occurred but the President has \n     denied relief. Congress should also consider eliminating \n     presidential discretion in the application of relief through \n     Section 421 petitions or limiting discretion to the \n     consideration of non-economic national security factors.\n       The Commission recommends that Congress maintain the \n     Continued Dumping and Subsidies Offset Act of 2000 (CDSOA or \n     the ``Byrd Amendment''), notwithstanding the WTO's ruling \n     that the law is inconsistent with WTO requirements, and \n     accept any retaliatory tariffs that may ensue as the U.S. is \n     permitted to do under its WTO obligations. Congress should \n     press the Administration to seek explicit recognition during \n     the WTO's Doha Round negotiations of the right of WTO members \n     to distribute monies collected from antidumping and \n     countervailing duties to injured parties.\n       The Commission recommends that Congress clarify without \n     delay the authority of the Committee on the Implementation of \n     Textile Agreements (CITA) to consider threat-based petitions \n     for use of the China-specific textile safeguard negotiated as \n     part of China's WTO agreement.\n       The Commission recommends that Congress direct the \n     Department of Commerce to make countervailing duties \n     applicable to nonmarket economies to provide an additional \n     tool to combat China's use of government subsidies for its \n     exporters.\n       The Commission recommends that Congress repeal the ``new \n     shipper bonding privilege'' that has allowed many importers \n     of Chinese goods to avoid payment of antidumping duties. \n     Importers of goods subject to anti-dumping or countervailing \n     duties should be required to deposit in cash the amount of \n     any estimated applicable duty.\n\n\n                Countering China's Government Subsidies\n\n       The Commission recommends that Congress direct USTR and \n     Commerce to investigate China's system of government \n     subsidies for manufacturing, including tax incentives, \n     preferential access to credit and capital from financial \n     institutions owned or influenced by the state, subsidized \n     utilities, and investment conditions requiring technology \n     transfers. The investigation should also examine \n     discriminatory consumption credits that shift demand toward \n     Chinese goods, particularly as a tactic of import \n     substitution for steel, Chinese state-owned banks' practice \n     of noncommercial-based policy lending to state-owned and \n     other enterprises, and China's dual pricing system for coal \n     and other energy resources. USTR and Commerce should provide \n     the results of this investigation in a report to Congress \n     that assesses whether any of these practices may be \n     actionable subsidies under the WTO.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. What do they tell us? There was a general consensus among \nthe witnesses--they held 2 days of hearings--that China remains in \nviolation of its WTO obligations in a number of areas impacting vital \nU.S. economic interests:\n\n       It has become increasingly clear that China is not meeting \n     key commitments it made when joining the WTO and that our \n     trade laws have to date been insufficient in addressing these \n     problems.\n\n  They lay out the problems: China currency manipulation, intellectual \nproperty theft; treating China as a nonmarket economy; lack of \nenforcement of U.S. trade remedies that are on the books; China \nsubsidies to businesses that are in violation to WTO.\n  We have had a very tepid response to China's cheating across the \nboard and we are paying a huge price. Many Americans are losing jobs \nnot because they are being outworked, or because the Chinese are \nsmarter, but because they are being cheated out of their jobs. One way \nis that the Chinese have taken the value of their currency and \nartificially suppressed it, creating a discount on every product coming \nout of China to the detriment of American manufacturing and the world \ncommunity at large, and all we do is talk to China.\n  A lot of people are depending on us to do something about China in a \nconstructive fashion. Is this the best way to have done it? No. This is \nthe only way I know of, after 2 years, to get anybody's attention, our \nattention or China's attention. We passed a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution in 2003 that was a compromise that Senator Schumer and I \nmade. OK, let's get the Senate on record. It was a sense of the Senate, \nand no one objected that China is manipulating its currency in \nviolation of international norms and it costs Americans jobs. That was \n2 years ago.\n  Last year, we were going to put it on the FSC/ETI bill. Everybody \nsaid you are going to mess up the bill. So we had a colloquy with \nSenator Grassley, who is a good friend, and we talked about holding \nhearings and we talked about engaging China anew, because we didn't \nwant to mess up the bill by bringing this bill forward. That was over a \nyear ago. Not one thing has changed--not one hearing--and the problem \ngets worse and worse. The balance of trade between us and China is \nabsolutely shameful. We are doing nothing about it other than talking.\n  Well, this amendment does something about it other than talking. Let \nme tell you what the U.S.-China Commission said about currency \nmanipulation.\n\n       The commission recommends that Congress pursue the \n     following measures to move China toward a significant near-\n     term upward reevaluation of the yuan by at least 25 percent.\n\n  We look moderate compared to the United States-China Economic \nSecurity Review Commission.\n\n       Consider imposing an immediate, across-the-board tariff on \n     Chinese imports unless China significantly strengthens the \n     value of its currency against the dollar or against a basket \n     of currencies.\n\n  The experts tell us the yuan is 15 to 40 percent below its true \nmarket, causing havoc on American manufacturing.\n\n       Reduce the ability of the Treasury Department to use \n     technical definitions to avoid classifying China as a \n     currency manipulator. . . .\n\n  They have a list things for us to do. One is imposing an across-the-\nboard tariff. What I and Senators Schumer, Bunning, and others are \nsuggesting we do is put China on notice: In the next 6 months, allow \nChina to move toward reevaluation in a way that will help the American \neconomy, will make China a true, fair member of nations, and if they do \nnot act in the next 6 months in some significant way, then we will look \nat the ability of this country to protect ourselves against a Communist \ndictatorship that cheats. And if the Senate is not here to protect the \nAmerican worker against a Communist dictatorship that cheats, what the \nheck are we here for?\n  I hope we will send a message to China they can understand because \napparently they do not understand what we are saying any other way.\n  I have enjoyed this experience working in a bipartisan fashion to \nstand up for American business interests that are being cheated out of \njobs because of a Communist dictatorship that cheats and is building up \ntheir military at our expense.\n\n[[Page S3252]]\n\n  To the American manufacturing community, there are a million other \nways we can help. I talked with Governor Engler today. We are going to \ndo more domestically and internationally to level the playing field, \nbut this is a significant start. Will it solve all the problems? No. \nWill this put China on notice as they have never been put on notice \nbefore? Yes. And if we fail to adopt this message, we are also sending \na message to China. I am not sure that is a message the American worker \ncan stand having sent to China.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all the \nsponsors of the bill, S. 600--the amendment is identical to the bill--\nbe added to amendment No. 309.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Further, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Durbin's \nname be added as a cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Burr \nbe added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Senator \nBurr will be added as a cosponsor.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would like a followup to some of the \ncomments the Senator from South Carolina has made in reference to our \nlegislation.\n  First, I will mention the cosponsors of this bill, in addition to \nSenator Graham and myself, as well as Senator Bunning. They are: \nSenator Reid, the minority leader, Senator Bayh, Senator Dodd, Senator \nBurr, Senator DeWine, Senator Stabenow, Senator Mikulski, Senator \nJohnson, Senator Kohl, and Senator Feingold, and there are others as \nwell. Senator Dole I know is a cosponsor as well on the main bill. Now \nshe is added to this amendment as well.\n  Mr. President, we have asked over and over again those who have said, \nDon't do this amendment, we know your intention is good, but don't do \nit, we have asked them over and over, What do we do? Secretary Snow \ncalled Senator Graham and me and asked us not to do the amendment, give \nthem a chance to negotiate with the Chinese. That was over a year ago.\n  You may recall before he even set foot in China, as his plane was in \nthe air, the Chinese Government announced: Do not even try to negotiate \non this; we are not changing. We are going to keep pegging our \ncurrency--which devalues our currency.\n  I sat down with a group of leading New York business people. It was \nat the invitation of one of them who gathered the group of very bright \nmen in an effort to persuade me not to be for this amendment. After an \nhour and a half, they all agreed it was the right thing to do because \nwe made the argument to them that day that if you believe in free \ntrade, you cannot have one of the largest trading countries abjectly \nviolating the rules. It does not work. It does not work for China, it \ndoes not work for America, and it does not work for the rest of the \nworld.\n  If anyone doubts that the Chinese really play fair, let me mention \none little story, and this is the kind of thing that drives us crazy. \nThere is a company in Cortland, NY, called Marietta. Cortland has had \ntough times. It is an industrial town. Smith Corona used to make \ntypewriters there. It obviously does not do that anymore. Buckbee-Mears \nhad a big ball bearing plant, and that closed. The one saving grace of \nCortland was Marietta, which kept growing.\n  Marietta makes a product we all use. They are the manufacturer of the \nlittle soaps and little shampoos that you get when you go to hotels and \nmotels. The way Marietta gets its business, the chairman told me, is \nthat they go to the big hotel companies, such as Hilton, and they say: \nYou pick the color of the soap and the smell of the soap, and we will \nmake sure it is in every room. That is how they have Hilton and other \nbig companies as their customers.\n  Only one country does not allow Marietta to import its soap and its \nshampoo--China. When the president called me and I visited the plant up \nin Cortland, NY, 30 miles south of Syracuse, he told me that the \nChinese now do their own business in China. They are using that \nprotected market in China to compete with Marietta now in Southeast \nAsia, in Europe, and soon in America.\n  I said: Why don't you file with the WTO?\n  He said: I will get an answer in about 8 years, and I will be out of \nbusiness.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, I could not agree more with \nwhat Senator Graham said. We must do something. This is the best thing \nto do. It is certainly a lot better than what we have been doing over \nthe last 2 years, which is absolutely nothing.\n  I urge, on behalf of free trade, on behalf of the world system that \nreally works, and on behalf of saying to countries, You have to play by \nthe rules to gain the benefits, you should not have a $162 billion \ntrade surplus and not play by the rules, I urge them to support the \namendment on which Senator Graham and I have worked so long and hard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I, too, believe in free trade, but I \nshare Senator Schumer's thoughts and Senator Graham's ideas. A great \nnation such as China needs to understand it has moved to a different \nlevel, that it sells an incredible amount of products to the United \nStates of America, and what they do with the value of their currency \nimpacts that trade.\n  What they have done is not sound policy. Because I believe in free \ntrade, I believe it is not even going to be good for China. It is \ncertainly not good for the United States today.\n  I do not want to be involved in telling a nation what their currency \nought to be. I know the Senator from New York and the Senator from \nSouth Carolina do not believe they should, but this is reality.\n  We are not talking about theory. We moved beyond theory. It is jobs. \nIt is trade. It is a deficit trade that we have with China to an \nextraordinary degree that continues to grow. So I thank the Senators \nfor their efforts, and I would be pleased to support their amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I do not believe we have any more speakers on deck.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, as I indicated at the outset of the debate, \nas we asked recognition of the Senators who have spoken so eloquently \non this amendment, the issue before the Senate is the preservation of \nthe authorization bill itself that we are debating. The issue has been \noften expressed, but let me mention it again, that the Finance \nCommittee claims jurisdiction of this item. They also have indicated, \nboth on the Senate and House sides, that they will prevent passage of \nthe authorization bill for the State Department and foreign assistance \nif this item and, for that matter, several others that have been \nincluded in prospective amendments are adopted as a part of this bill.\n  I will not debate the merits of the amendment on China. We have had a \nhearing before our Foreign Relations Committee and delved into what is \nclearly a very complex and important issue. I do know, however, that \neven as we had the hearing for our own information and that of the \npublic, we understood the jurisdictional question. We have tried to \nrespect that. Therefore, on this amendment and on others that also are \nclearly in the jurisdiction of the Finance or of other committees, I \nfeel compelled, for the sake of preserving this bill, to move to table \nthe amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3253]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, I voted for Senator Schumer's and \nSenator Graham's China currency amendment even though I prefer my own \nlegislation, S. 377, on this issue, which is consistent with our \ninternational obligations. Nonetheless, I supported this amendment to \nsend a message to the administration that the time for action on \ncurrency manipulation has come.\n  I acknowledge that if passed, this legislation may be disruptive to \nour trade obligations. But as noted economist Fred Bergsten wrote in \nthe Financial Times on March 15, the world economy would suffer from a \nrapid and precipitous decline in the U.S. currency. Such a shock could \ndrive up interest rates and curb U.S. growth to the detriment of all \nour trading partners.\n  These risks are greatly exacerbated by the growing U.S. current \naccount deficit and the connected actions by some countries, including \nChina, that are blocking the orderly adjustment of the U.S. dollar by \ntheir direct currency intervention. It is long past time for market \nforces to be allowed to work and time for the administration to press \nthis issue. I note that if national security problems arise, the \nPresident under the amendment has waiver authority.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will continue the call of the roll.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection. The clerk will continue \ncalling the roll.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Massachusetts and \nthe Senator from New Jersey would they be in agreement that a 15-minute \npresentation at this point would be possible, and then they would yield \nto me? I make this request because we have an existential crisis with \nthe bill. Unless we solve it, we will probably not be continuing. This \nis serious. I understand you have an important colloquy. If it can be \ncontained in 15 minutes, that would be fine.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We appreciate the opportunity that the Senator has \ngiven us.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could we ask then that the Senator from Indiana be \nrecognized after 15 minutes to take whatever action is necessary?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as \nhas been mentioned.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n\n                     Independence Of The Judiciary\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to discuss the situation that \nis developing, questioning the value of the separation of powers, about \nwhether one of the powers has rights that succeed the powers of the \nother. Particularly, my subject now regards the judiciary and whether \nit is a free, unencumbered judiciary, as it ought to be.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator from New Jersey be kind enough to yield \nfor a brief observation and question?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator from New Jersey is addressing \nthe Senate on a very important issue, the independence of the \njudiciary. I think this is an important statement. Many of us have been \ndeeply concerned by statements that have been made recently by \nCongressman Tom DeLay, who used the words, ``The time will come for men \nresponsible for this to answer for their behavior,'' in relationship to \nthe decision of the courts in the Schiavo case. The Senator from Texas \nhas also mentioned and talked about the judiciary in a similar vein \nthis week..\n  I ask unanimous consent that a New York Times editorial, regarding \nthese statements be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 6, 2005]\n\n                       The Judges Made Them Do It\n\n       It was appalling when the House majority leader threatened \n     political retribution against judges who did not toe his \n     extremist political line. But when a second important \n     Republican stands up and excuses murderous violence against \n     judges as an understandable reaction to their decisions, then \n     it is time to get really scared.\n       It happened on Monday, in a moment that was horrifying even \n     by the rock-bottom standards of the campaign that Republican \n     zealots are conducting against the nation's judiciary. \n     Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, rose in the chamber \n     and dared to argue that recent courthouse violence might be \n     explained by distress about judges who ``are making political \n     decisions yet are unaccountable to the public.'' The \n     frustration ``builds up and builds up to the point where some \n     people engage in'' violence, said Mr. Cornyn, a former member \n     of the Texas Supreme Court who is on the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, which supposedly protects the Constitution and its \n     guarantee of an independent judiciary.\n       Listeners could only cringe at the events behind Mr. \n     Cornyn's fulminating: an Atlanta judge was murdered in his \n     courtroom by a career criminal who wanted only to shoot his \n     way out of a trial, and a Chicago judge's mother and husband \n     were executed by a deranged man who was furious that she had \n     dismissed a wild lawsuit. It was sickening that an elected \n     official would publicly offer these sociopaths as examples of \n     any democratic value, let alone as holders of legitimate \n     concerns about the judiciary.\n       The need to shield judges from outside threats--including \n     those from elected officials like Senator Cornyn--is a \n     priceless principle of our democracy. Senator Cornyn offered \n     a smarmy proclamation of ``great distress'' at courthouse \n     thuggery. Then he rationalized it with broadside accusations \n     that judges ``make raw political or ideological decisions.'' \n     He thumbed his nose at the separation of powers, suggesting \n     that the Supreme Court be ``an enforcer of political \n     decisions made by elected representatives of the people.'' \n     Avoiding that nightmare is precisely why the founders made \n     federal judgeships lifetime jobs and created a nomination \n     process that requires presidents to seek bipartisan support.\n       Echoes of the political hijacking of the Terri Schiavo case \n     hung in the air as Mr. Cornyn spoke, just days after the \n     House majority leader, Tom DeLay, vengefully vowed that ``the \n     time will come'' to make the judges who resisted the \n     Congressional Republicans' gruesome deathbed intrusion \n     ``answer for their behavior.'' Trying to intimidate judges \n     used to be a crime, not a bombastic cudgel for cynical \n     politicians.\n       The public's hope must be that Senator Cornyn's shameful \n     outburst gives further\n\n[[Page S3254]]\n\n     pause to Senate moderates about the threats of the majority \n     leader, Senator Bill Frist, to scrap the filibuster to ensure \n     the confirmation of President Bush's most extremist judicial \n     nominees. Dr. Frist tried to distance himself yesterday from \n     Mr. DeLay's attack on the judiciary. But Dr. Frist must carry \n     the militants' baggage if he is ever to run for president, \n     and he complained yesterday of ``a real fire lighted by \n     Democrats around judges over the last few days.''\n       By Democrats? The senator should listen to what's being \n     said on his side of the aisle, if he can bear it.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I draw to the attention of the Senate \nthat today the Judicial Conference has asked the White House and the \nSenate for $12 million to help protect judges from violence. When we \nsee leaders in Congress making statements which clearly have incited, \nor threaten to incite, violence against judges, the same judges, \nhonorable men and women appointed to uphold America's laws and ideals, \nwho are living in fear of violence, we must be concerned.\n  The Judicial Conference is requesting $12 million to provide \nprotection for the American judiciary. What in the world is this \nCongress and this Senate coming to? I think it is appropriate for the \nleaders and other members in this body and the House to tone down their \nrhetoric, and avoid the threats to the American judiciary. I think that \nis absolutely unconscionable.\n  When you have the Judicial Conference asking for this, that indicates \nwhere the judges themselves--made up of Republicans and Democrats--are \ncoming from. I intend to offer an amendment on the supplemental to \npositively respond to their request and to get the $12 million. I am \ninterested if my friend from New Jersey would cosponsor that.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes, I would be pleased to. Mr. President, I ask the \nSenator from Massachusetts, why should we be surprised they ask for \nmore protection? We have seen atrocious assaults on members of the \nbench and their families.\n  What we see is, I think, the beginning of a firestorm, and the \nproblem is that the fuel is being provided by comments made here and in \nthe other body.\n  I start off by reading from article III, section 1 of the U.S. \nConstitution. It says:\n\n       The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in \n     one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the \n     Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.\n\n  It is pretty clear to me. It says judicial power is vested in our \ncourts, not in the Congress. The Constitution gives the Senate a role \nin the appointment of judges, and we are supposed to provide advice and \nconsent, not direction. But once a judge is seated on the bench, his or \nher decisions are not subject to our approval.\n  The Founding Fathers, in their brilliance, set it up that way on \npurpose. They wanted to make sure that court decisions would be based \non legal grounds, not political grounds. But today there is an \norchestrated effort to smear the reputation of the judiciary, \nespecially Federal judges. And the effort is being waged by Republicans \nin Congress as a prelude to an attempt to change the rules for \nconfirming judicial nominations.\n  In order to justify this nuclear option, they are trying to paint \njudges as ``activists'' and ``out of control.''\n  In reality, it is the leadership of this Congress that is out of \ncontrol and endangering the future of a fair court system.\n  In this Chamber on Monday, one of our colleagues said Americans are \nbecoming frustrated by the rulings of the judges--so be it; that is all \nright, you can be frustrated as much as you want--but then he accused \nthe judges of making ``raw political or ideological decisions.'' That \nwas in the quote from our colleague's statement.\n  He went on to say:\n\n       I wonder whether there may be some connection between the \n     perception in some quarters, on some occasions, where judges \n     are making political decisions yet are unaccountable to the \n     public . . . that it builds up and builds up and builds up to \n     the point where--\n\n  Listen to this--\n\n     where some people engage in violence.\n\n  These are comments made by a Senator. The remarks are almost \nunbelievable. Yet they echo the words last week of the House majority \nleader. Speaking of the judges in the Schiavo case, the House majority \nleader said:\n\n       The time will come for the men responsible for this to \n     answer for their behavior.\n\n  What does that imply? These are inflammatory words. They ignore the \nfact that our Founding Fathers wanted judges to be insulated from \npolitical pressure, and they are words that could easily incite \nviolence against judges.\n  On this past Sunday, a columnist in the hometown newspaper of the \nHouse majority leader, the Houston Chronicle, wrote:\n\n       It is time for him to stop sputtering ill-tempered threats, \n     not only at the judiciary but also at the U.S. Constitution, \n     which he repeatedly has sworn to uphold.\n\n  There were two matters that made things worse, two recent episodes to \nwhich the Senator from Massachusetts made reference involving violence \nagainst judges and their families. In Chicago, a man fatally shot the \nhusband and the mother of a Federal judge who had ruled against him in \na medical malpractice suit. And in Atlanta last month, a man broke away \nfrom a deputy, killed four people, including the judge presiding over \nhis rape trial. Is that what these people see? Is that what our \ncolleagues saw? Is that what the House majority leader saw, an \nopportunity to take revenge on judges who make decisions with which \nthey disagree? What are we, some lawless nation where if you do not \nlike it, you kill the person who did it?\n\n  Were these judges who suffered terribly while performing their \nofficial duties activists? Were they out of control?\n  The message being sent to the American people by the other side of \nthe aisle is not only irresponsible, but downright dangerous to our \nNation's judges.\n  Like the nuclear option, the goal here is to have judges make \npolitical decisions rather than legal decisions. They are trying to \nintimidate sitting judges, and they are trying to change Senate rules \nto get bad judges on the bench.\n  I vow to fight this nuclear option, as well as these irresponsible \nthreatening statements. I do that for my family and for American \nfamilies across this country.\n  In my view, the true measure of democracy is how it dispenses \njustice. In this country, any attempt to intimidate judges not only \nthreatens our courts but our fundamental democracy as well.\n  I note that a letter was sent out most recently by the distinguished \nmajority leader. It is dated March 31, 2005. He invites colleagues--it \nsays: ``Get a Fresh Perspective on Our Nation's''--this is on the \nmajority leader's stationery--``Get a Fresh Perspective on Our Nation's \nReligious Heritage with a Special Tour of the U.S. Capitol'':\n\n       Dear Colleague: I am writing to invite you and your family \n     to a private tour of the U.S. Capitol Building with \n     WallBuilders' President, David Barton, on Monday, April 11, \n     2005.

Frist M.D.,\n                                     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I quote from this report:\n\n       Now Barton appears to be angling for a spot on the national \n     stage. He is touring the nation again, this time with \n     financial support from the Republican National Committee as \n     part of what is described as a larger get-out-the-vote \n     effort.\n       As he tours the country, Barton leads pastors in sessions \n     examining the role Christianity played in America's founding \n     and puts forth his usual shaky thesis. But Barton doesn't \n     stop there. Barton's not-so-subtle message is that America's \n     Christian heritage is at risk--and only voting Republican can \n     save it.\n\n  I want those who hear me across America to pay attention: ``Christian \nheritage is at risk.'' That means that all the outsiders, all of those \nwho approach God differently but are people who believe in a supreme \nbeing; people who behave and live peacefully with their neighbors and \ntheir friends. No, this is being put forward as an attempt--a not too \nsubtle attempt--to make sure people understand that America is a \nChristian country. Therefore, we ought to take the time the majority \nleader offers us, as Members of the Senate, for a chance to learn more \nabout how invalid the principle of separation between church and state \nis.\n  I hope the American public sees this plan as the spurious attempt it \nis.\n  I ask my colleagues if they want to go to a Christian-only spokesman \nwho will tell us about how insignificant the separation between church \nand state is. The question is fundamental to the Constitution. Are we a \ncountry of laws? If we are, then we must respect the law and we must \nhold the law free from threats.\n  How does it feel when one looks at the Federal judge in Chicago who \nhad her husband and her mother murdered because someone disagreed with \nher legal decision? How do we feel about seeing this guy break loose in \nAtlanta and kill the judge and a deputy? Senator Kennedy just mentioned \nthe fact that there was a $12 million request for security for judges \nand courtrooms. I do not blame them. This is not some lawless country \nwhere if a judge makes a decision he better run for his life; nor is it \nIraq, where those who are upholding the law are getting killed because \nother people disagree with them. We should not stand for this.\n  I ask the majority leader to withdraw that invitation to tour the \nU.S. Capitol with this man who says that this should be a Christian-\nonly country. How can he dare undermine the principles that are in our \nbrilliant Constitution that was written so many years ago? We are \nentering a dangerous period, in my view.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, work continues among a number of Senators \nwho are deeply interested, as I am, in the resolution and the amendment \nahead of us. For the moment it appears we ought to give more time to \nthis discussion. So I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard. The quorum call will \nbe continued.\n  The legislative clerk continued to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, in a moment I am hopeful the Chair may \nrecognize the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, for 10 \nminutes in which he will offer an amendment. On our side, we are \nprepared to accept the amendment. Therefore, we will at least make some \nprogress while the other discussion continues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 318\n\n  Mr. Dodd.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To specify requirements under the Arms Export Control Act \napplicable to the VHXX Executive Helicopter Program (also known as the \n              Marine One Presidential Helicopter Program).\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title XXII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 2239. APPLICABILITY OF ARMS EXPORT CONTROL ACT \n                   REQUIREMENTS TO VHXX EXECUTIVE HELICOPTER \n                   PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Treatment as Cooperative Project.--The VHXX Executive \n     Helicopter Program (also known as the Marine One Presidential \n     Helicopter Program) shall be treated as a cooperative project \n     for purposes of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 \n     et seq.) as authorized under section 27 of that Act (22 \n     U.S.C. 2767).\n       (b) Licensing and Notice Requirements.--\n       (1) In general.--Any licensing and notice to Congress \n     requirements that apply to the sale of defense articles and \n     services under the Arms Export Control Act shall apply to any \n     foreign production (including the export of technical data \n     related thereto) under the VHXX Executive Helicopter Program \n     without regard to any dollar threshold or limitation that \n     would otherwise limit the applicability of such requirements \n     to such production under that Act.\n       (2) Notice to congress.--Notwithstanding the treatment of \n     the VHXX Executive Helicopter Program as a cooperative \n     project for purposes of the Arms Export Control Act under \n     subsection (a), section 27(g) of that Act (22 U.S.C. 2767(g)) \n     shall not be applicable to the program, and the notice \n     requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of section 36 of that \n     Act (22 U.S.C. 2776) shall be complied with in the issuance \n     of any letters of offer or licenses for the program as \n     required by paragraph (1).\n       (c) Limitation on Issuance of Licenses.--No license may be \n     issued under the Arms Export Control Act for any portion of \n     the VHXX Executive Helicopter Program, including research and \n     development and the sharing of technical data relating to the \n     program, until each participant in the program agrees, in \n     writing, not to enter into any contract, or otherwise do any \n     business, with any party who is subject to the jurisdiction \n     of a country that supports international terrorism for five \n     years after the date of the completion of the participation \n     of such participant in the program.\n       (d) Country That Supports International Terrorism \n     Defined.--In this section, the term ``country that supports \n     international terrorism'' means any country whose government \n     has repeatedly provided support for acts of international \n     terrorism for purposes of either of the provisions of law as \n     follows:\n       (1) Section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 \n     (50 U.S.C. App. 2405(j)).\n       (2) Section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \n     U.S.C. 2371).\n\n\n[[Page S3256]]\n\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in order to move things along in time, I \nappreciate the willingness of the distinguished chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee to accept the amendment. It is very simple \namendment.\n  It says that foreign companies involved in developing the President's \nMarine One helicopter must pledge in writing that they will not conduct \nbusiness with state-sponsors of terrorism during the contract and 5 \nyears after it has been completed. Moreover, it provides that those \ninvolved in building such technologies will be subject to at least the \nsame export licensing requirements as other defense projects built \njointly by the U.S. and foreign manufacturers, as governed by the U.S. \nArms Export Control Act.\n  The principle is clear, and hardly controversial. I am sure my \ncolleagues will agree that there are few more sensitive and more \nimportant national security concerns than the safe transport of our \ncountry's chief executive. But the aircraft we are talking about today \nis far more than a mode of transportation. It will be outfitted with \nsome of the most advanced technology available to ensure secure \ncommunications and easy maneuvering to avoid any possible threats from \nthe ground and air. As long as the President is in flight, this \naircraft will be a global nerve center, with critical information \nconstantly flowing in and essential decisions flowing out. This \naircraft needs to be safe and secure, and well-equipped to ensure \nsecure communications. For obvious reasons, the technology making this \nhappen needs to be protected at all costs.\n  We cannot afford to let America's enemies gain access to any of this \ncritically important technology. That is why companies involved in \ndeveloping Marine One cannot be allowed to have any relations with our \nmost dangerous adversaries. Such relations might present opportunities \nfor the sharing of designs or materials with state-sponsors of \nterrorism.\n  Armed with such information, terrorists could learn about the \nvulnerabilities of the Presidential helicopter, and attempt to \nintercept critical communications or effectively target our President \nfrom the air or from the ground.\n  My amendment also says that when it comes to this critically \nimportant technology, there should be no chance that anyone wishing \nAmerica harm could gain access to our most sensitive secrets. When it \ncomes to this critical defense system, there should be no exceptions to \nour export licensing.\n  It may come as a surprise to some that this amendment would even be \nnecessary, but it should not come as a surprise that Senator Lieberman, \nmy cosponsor on this amendment, and I are deeply concerned about what \ncould happen. But I am afraid that troubling reports have surfaced \nabout a European partner in the manufacturing team recently awarded the \ncontract to build Marine One. As many of my colleagues know, Agusta \nWestland, an Italian-British consortium, was tasked with building this \nhelicopter's basic design as well as manufacturing approximately 30 \npercent of the aircraft's components, including the rotor blades to be \nbuilt in Yeovil, England, and the main transmission, to be constructed \nin Cascina Costa, Italy.\n  Obviously, I have some local interests in this case. The Navy \nselected the European/American team over the Connecticut-based, All-\nAmerican Sikorsky team which has administered the Marine One contract \nfor about 50 years. Truth be told, I believe that Sikorsky has a better \nperforming, more experienced aircraft team as well as a superior \ndesign. But my concerns go beyond parochial interests, and even the \ntechnical merits of the aircraft. I am gravely troubled about the \nimpact this contract award will have on the United States' ability to \nstay competitive in the global helicopter industry. But more \nimportantly, I am deeply troubled that the European partner in the \nwinning contractor team is currently considering conducting business \nwith a sworn enemy of the United States--the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n  I have here a list of companies who recently attended an air show in \nKish, Iran, exhibiting their wares, and soliciting business from the \nIranian Government. Listed at number 50 on this list is Agusta Westland \nas well as its parent company Finneccanica at number 52. We do not know \nwhat they were marketing at their exhibits during the January 18-21 \ntrade show, but it is surely the view of this Senator that no \ngovernment manufacturer of such sensitive technology as the U.S. \nPresidential helicopter has any business even entertaining the idea of \ndoing business with state sponsors of terrorism such as Iran.\n  How can we allow the chance that a sworn adversary of the United \nStates like Iran could gain access to America's most sensitive defense \ntechnologies? I know that my colleagues are keenly aware of the history \nof Iran's government, dating back to the taking of American hostages in \n1979 and the installation of a brutal fundamentalist dictatorship. But \nlet me be utterly clear about the threat that we are dealing with here. \nWe are talking about one of the three members of what President Bush \nreferred to as ``the Axis of Evil.'' This is how the State Department \ndescribed U.S. relations with Iran in its most recent Iran country \nreport:\n\n       As a state sponsor of terrorism Iran remains an impediment \n     to international efforts to locate and prosecute terrorists . \n     . . The U.S. Government defines its areas of objectionable \n     Iranian behavior as the following: Iranian efforts to acquire \n     nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction; Its \n     support for and involvement in international terrorism; Its \n     support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace \n     process; and Its dismal human rights record.\n\n  President Bush himself referred to the threat posed by Iran in his \nmost recent State of the Union address, stating:\n\n       Today, Iran remains the world's primary state sponsor of \n     terror, pursuing nuclear weapons while depriving its people \n     of the freedom they seek and deserve.\n\n  Unclassified intelligence reports have attributed dozens of acts of \ninternational terrorism to the Iranian government or surrogate \nterrorist groups since the 1990s. One such Iranian surrogate is Islamic \nJihad, also known as Hezbollah, which publicly has claimed \nresponsibility for a number of attacks on innocent civilians throughout \nthe world from Argentina to Israel. And they continue to prosecute \nattacks in Israel, and threaten instability in Lebanon.\n  Meanwhile, terrorists are moving in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan \nacross Iranian borders, attacking U.S. troops with either Tehran's \nsupport or outright sponsorship. And today, as we entrust the security \nof our President and our most sensitive national security secrets to a \nmajor European subcontractor, we are facing the prospect of having such \na critical U.S. defense system shared with one of the America's gravest \nadversaries.\n  The stakes could not be any higher. We cannot afford to allow \ncritical American technology to fall into the hands of terrorist \nstates. And we cannot allow those who wish us harm access to \ninformation on any aircraft that would be carrying the President of the \nUnited States.\n  For these reasons, I am offering this amendment which, I repeat, \naddresses two critical concerns that I have raised here today:\n  First, my amendment forbids any company involved in building the \nMarine One aircraft from conducting business with a state sponsor of \nterrorism; second, it subjects the Marine One contract to standard \nexport controls governing joint U.S.-foreign defense programs, waiving \nexemptions provided to companies from NATO countries.\n  I know that there are some who might object to this provision as \nbeing too harsh on our allies, particularly since it eliminates waiver \nprotections pertaining to companies in NATO countries. But the honest \nand sobering reality is that I am not proposing anything nearly as \ndrastic as what our NATO allies are currently doing in the conduct of \ntheir own defense contracts.\n  Unlike the legitimate security concerns I have voiced here on the \nfloor today, our European friends are currently banning non-European \nhelicopter manufacturers from even competing for bids in their \ncountries, simply in order to protect their domestic defense industry. \nAs this chart demonstrates--in the market for medium lift helicopters, \nthe U.S. has been banned from even bidding for contracts with the \ngovernments of the United Kingdom, France, Portugal, Norway, the \nNetherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, and Greece.\n\n[[Page S3257]]\n\n  My amendment does not attempt to impose the same protectionist \nmeasures that these countries have imposed. This measure is critically \nimportant in safeguarding secrets that are fundamental to our Nation's \ngovernment. It will ensure that no person with access to our most \nsensitive national security technologies has the opportunity to share \nthese critical secrets with those who would wish us harm. We are simply \nstanding up for the most sensitive security interests of our nation and \nthe safety of our President.\n  Anything less would be reckless and a dereliction of our duty as \nAmericans.\n  I merely point to this fact. Nothing in this amendment would suggest \nwe ought to keep them out of our own country, but we ought to be aware \nthat, while we are talking about free trade, in the European nations \nthemselves a United States firm cannot even get in the bidding process. \nSo there are other reasons why this amendment ought to be adopted.\n  I urge my colleagues to do so, and I thank the chairman of the \ncommittee for supporting the amendment.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, as I indicated at the outset, we are \nprepared on our side to accept the amendment. Therefore, I urge its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). Is there further debate?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 318) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this amendment has the effect of placing a \nserious impediment, if not an absolute block, against the United States \nproceeding to fulfillment of a contract entered into by the Department \nof Defense--more specifically, the Navy Department having been the \nexecutive agent on this contract--for the procurement of the \nreplacement helicopters commonly referred to as marine I. It is the \nfleet that serves the President primarily and others associated with \nthe White House.\n  This contract was in negotiation for over a year. It was an open and \nfree competition. So far as I know there was no question raised against \nthe contract being awarded to the winning company, a U.S. company, \ntogether with a consortium of overseas participants with, nevertheless, \nthe U.S. company being the lead company.\n  The amendment was drafted to the Arms Export Control Act and it is \nintended to prevent the Navy from going forward with this acquisition \nprogram. This is a matter that is clearly within the jurisdiction of \nthe Armed Services Committee. Normally, we consult committees before \nacting.\n  I do not fault the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. I think at the time this was done very hastily, it was not \nclear to the staff and the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee \nthat it was within the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee. \nOtherwise, I would have come over to the floor earlier.\n  Now, the amendment having been adopted, I, together with my two \ndistinguished colleagues from New York, Senators Clinton and Schumer, \nwill address this matter tomorrow or during the course of the further \nconsideration of the Foreign Affairs Authorization Act. But I can \nassure you, we will employ every parliamentary device available to us \nto see that this matter is rectified because I think it was not done in \na manner that is consistent with what we normally do around here by way \nof procedures. Secondly, I think it is detrimental to the whole \nperformance of the contracting and procurement responsibilities of the \nSecretary of Defense.\n  So for the moment, for those interested in this contract, let it be \nknown there is a group of us who are going to have this reexamined and, \nif necessary, take it to the full Senate for consideration before this \nbill is finally acted upon.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I am advised the distinguished Senator from Illinois has a \nstatement he would like to make at this time. I ask the Chair to \nallocate 5 minutes to the Senator and then to recognize me following \nthat statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wonder if I might be recognized after \nthe distinguished chairman, Chairman Lugar.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I amend my request that after I am recognized, the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President I ask that the Chair now recognize the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama. I understand he will discuss \namendments but not offer them at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to share some comments about a \nmatter which I became aware of recently. I think it is rather dramatic, \nand it is a matter which this Senate should deal with.\n  The United Nations is planning to renovate the United Nations \nHeadquarters Building in New York. The New York Sun reports that they \nare projecting to spend $1.2 billion to renovate that building. That is \na lot of money! But, frankly, I don't know what it takes to build a \nbuilding in New York, and neither do most folks. But there are some \npeople who do and we'll look to their opinions later.\n  It is a 30-story building. We own the real estate. It was modern \nonce, when it was built in 1953, and people thought it was avant garde \nat the time. I have never been impressed with it, but it is an imposing \nstructure. The fact that we need to renovate that building may not be \ndisputable. It probably does need it, although it was renovated pretty \nsubstantially in the 1970's. Equivalent in today's dollars, over $150 \nmillion was spent on it.\n  The current plan is for the United States to loan the money at a 5.5 \npercent interest, a somewhat realistic interest rate, whereas the U.N. \nis holding out on accepting the offer. They probably would like a loan \nat no cost. The GAO reported that was Annan's initial desire.\n  The United Nations, as we know, is notoriously wasteful in the \nspending of its money. I wish that it weren't so, but it is a plain \nfact. Their cost controls have never been good. The Oil-For-Food \nProgram that has been discussed so much lately is the biggest \nboondoggle--fraud, really--in the history of the world. This U.N. \nprogram is out of control. Waste of money under any circumstances is \nnot acceptable.\n  The United States, of course, pays about 20 percent of U.N. dues. We \nare the largest dues-paying member of the United Nations. I believe we \npay a total of 22 percent of those dues. But regardless of that, UN \ndues are funds that have been sent to the United Nations by nations all \nover the world, and that money ought to be spent for good things with \ngood purposes, purposes consistent with the ideals and principles on \nwhich the United Nations was founded--feeding the poor, improved \nmedical care around the world, aid for research and treatment, river \nblindness, and peacekeeping missions.\n  We don't have enough money to handle all the missions we need to do \nin the world, and the U.N. ought to do more. They do economic \ndevelopment, infrastructure improvements, and democracy building, but \nthere is never enough money to do all of those things we should. \nSurely, with all the potential beneficial projects in the world, there \nis no room to waste money on a project, much less a project that would \nbuild offices for bureaucrats.\n  Let me share this story with you, which is pretty shocking to me. The \n$1.2 billion loan the United Nations wants is to renovate a building. \nSome member of the United Nations, a delegate, apparently, from Europe, \nhad read in the newspaper in New York that Mr. Donald Trump, the \npremier real estate developer in New York, the largest in New York by \nfar, who has his own television show now--had just completed the Trump \nWorld Tower--not a 30-story building like the United Nations, but a 90-\nstory building, for a\n\n[[Page S3258]]\n\nmere $350 million, less than one-third of that cost. So the European \nUnited Nations delegate was curious about the $1.2 billion they were \nspending on the United Nations.\n  He knew he didn't know what the real estate costs are in New York. \nSo, he called Mr. Trump and they discussed it. Mr. Trump told him that \nbuilding he built for $350 million was the top of the line. It has the \nhighest quality of anything you would need in it.\n  They discussed the matter, and an arrangement was made for Mr. Trump \nto meet Kofi Annan, Secretary-General, to discuss the concerns. The \nEuropean delegate was somewhat taken back at Trump's reaction because \nhe just didn't know how much it would cost. He had originally thought \nMr. Trump's figures that were printed in the paper were in error.\n  So according to Mr. Trump, who I talked to personally this morning, \nthey go meet with Mr. Annan, who had asked some staff member to be \nthere, and Mr. Trump is very outraged about this staffer. When the \nEuropean asked how these numbers could happen, Mr. Trump said the only \nway would be because of incompetence, or fraud. That is how strongly he \nfelt about this price tag because he pointed out to me that renovation \ncosts much less than building an entirely new building. So he has a \nmeeting with Mr. Annan, and they have some discussion. And Mr. Trump \nsays these figures can't be acceptable.\n  He told me in my conversation this morning, he said: You can quote \nme. You can say what I am saying. It has already been reported in the \nnewspapers. He said they don't know. The person who had been working on \nthis project for 4 years couldn't answer basic questions about what was \ninvolved in renovating a major building. He was not capable nor \ncompetent to do the job.\n  He was further concerned. He went and worked on it, and talked about \nit, and eventually made an offer. He said he would manage the \nrefurbishment, the renovation, of the United Nations Building, and he \nwould not charge personally for his fee in managing it. He would bring \nit in at $500 billion, less than half of what they were expecting to \nspend, and it would be better.\n  He told me: I know something about refurbishment and renovations. I \ndo a lot of that, also. I know how to do that. Yet he never received a \nresponse from the United Nations, which raised very serious concerns in \nhis mind about what was going on there.\n  Let me further note some comments in the New York Sun article of \nFebruary 4 of this year dealing with this subject. It starts off \nquoting Mr. Trump in this fashion:\n\n       ``The United Nations is a mess, and they're spending \n     hundreds of millions of dollars unnecessarily on this \n     project.'' And several other Manhattan real estate experts \n     agreed, saying that the space should cost a fraction of what \n     is being projected on a square foot basis.\n\n  In addition to this, by the way, after refurbishing their existing \nbuilding, there are plans to construct a 35-story, 900,000-square-foot \nswing space over Robert Moses Park, plus a 100,000-square-foot \nesplanade park, which the United Nations Development Corporation says \nwill be built into the East River. That has an additional price tag of \n$650 million. But that is a separate issue because they are having some \nadditional problems with that, I understand, at this point.\n\n       An executive managing director at the commercial real-\n     estate firm Julien J. Studley Inc., Woody Heller, said a \n     thorough renovation of an office building would probably cost \n     between $85 and $160 per square foot.\n\n  I am still reading from that newspaper article.\n\n       Also from there, an executive vice president at Newmark, \n     Scott Panzer, said renovation prices could range between $120 \n     and $200 per square foot.\n\n   From the article:\n\n       Mr. Panzer, who works with many corporations to redevelop \n     their buildings for future efficiency and energy cost \n     savings, put a price of $70 to $100 per square foot on \n     infrastructure upgrades. Those would include heating; \n     ventilation; air conditioning; replacing the central plant; \n     fenestration (specifically, switching from single-pane to \n     thermal-pane windows); upgrading elevator switch gears, \n     mechanicals, and vertical transportation; improving air \n     quality, and making security upgrades. On top of that amount, \n     another $50 to $100 per square foot would take care of the \n     inside office improvements.\n\n  Fifty dollars is a lot of money to renovate a room. Remember, this is \nrenovation, not building. You can probably build a building in Alabama \nfor $100 a square foot.\n\n       The chairman of the global brokerage at commercial real-\n     estate firm CB Richard Ellis, Stephen Siegel, said high-end \n     commercial renovation usually runs from $50 to $100 per \n     square foot. For a renovation that does not include new \n     furniture . . . [and this plan does not] but does provide for \n     improved heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning \n     equipment, as well as work on the building exterior, the cost \n     would be closer to the $100 end of the range, Mr. Siegel \n     said. Even accounting generously for upgrades that might be \n     peculiar to the U.N., Mr. Siegel added he would set $250 per \n     square foot as the absolute maximum.\n\n  Some in the industry have estimated, however, that the dimensions of \nthe U.N. headquarters building and total square footage in need of \nrefurbishment is probably actually less than 1.1 million square feet \n,less than what they are saying, because it has been suggested that \nthey were counting the parking deck in the renovation and other parts \nof the building that are not occupied. If you take out the parking deck \nand these other areas, you get a different figure than the 2.5 million \nthey give you.\n  Using the U.N. figures, the capital master plan yields a square foot \ncost of $452.71 for the renovation per square foot. That is \nbreathtaking and completely out of common sense. It is almost twice \nwhat Mr. Siegel said would be the absolute maximum.\n  But that is not all. If you go back and take out the parking deck and \nsome of these other areas of the building that would not normally be \nconsidered when you think of the square foot of renovation, let me tell \nyou what the figure comes to, and hold on to your hat: $1,100 per \nsquare foot. According to Mr. Trump, this is three, four, maybe five \ntimes the cost of this renovation, making this the most expensive \nrenovation in history. Mr. Siegel said the $1.2 billion cost estimate \nwas ``outrageous.'' This is a professional real estate man in New York \nCity. He said the cost of renovation would be nearly as much as the \nprice of putting up a new building, including the cost of land, and he \nwould set the cost of the land at $500 per square foot, but that is \nalready paid for in this case.\n  This is a big deal. A GAO report has looked at it. It assumes that \nour Government will pay 22 percent of the $1.2 billion loan principal. \nIn other words, because we pay about that much percentage in our dues \nto the U.N., we will pay 22 percent of the $1.2 billion paying the \nprincipal back. The American taxpayers have a real interest in this.\n  There are some negotiations now. The administration is saying, you \nought to pay some interest. We want to be paid 5.5 percent. We will \nloan you the money, but we want to be paid 5.5 interest. The U.N. is \nholding out to accept our loan, perhaps Mr. Annan is holding out for a \nloan with zero-interest.\n  We would like the U.N. to have good quarters. We would like them to \nrenovate if that is the right thing to do. However, the United Nations \nhas a responsibility not only to the United States, the largest \ncontributor, but to every single country that contributes to that \norganization. Many of them are not wealthy. Many of them contribute \nsignificantly to the U.N. They have a responsibility to use that money \nwisely.\n\n  I am very concerned in light of the oil-for-food scandal and other \nproblems we have seen at the U.N. that we are heading down the road to \nan incredibly wasteful adventure in New York. The U.S. Government ought \nto do everything it can not only to protect our own treasury, but to \nprotect the U.N. Secretary, to make sure this boondoggle does not go \nforward.\n  At some point legislation by this Congress needs to be passed to \nallow, encourage, or require our leadership to demand strict accounting \nof what is being spent, to demand that any construction or renovation \nbe done in a cost-effective way, to make sure there is no fraud, there \nis no corruption, no kickbacks, and no abuses whatsoever in building \nthis building, and that every dollar of the U.N. is spent wisely and \ncarefully.\n  Those are my concerns. I thank the New York Sun for making a point in \nthis article. I thank Mr. Trump for his willingness to speak publicly. \nHe is pretty frank about it. Obviously, he is very concerned. He felt \nthis was not being handled in a wise way. He saw a\n\n[[Page S3259]]\n\ndisaster on the horizon, and he was willing to speak out about it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Amendments Nos. 319, 320, 321, and 322, en bloc\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to \noffer four amendments en bloc, and I send those four amendments to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to considering the \namendments en bloc?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes amendments \n     numbered 319 through 322, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will send a copy of an amendment to the \ndesk, but I am not going to offer the amendment right now. I would like \nto discuss what I would like to do at some point on a matter of \nsignificance. I will send the amendment up to the desk and ask \nunanimous consent to lay aside the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very briefly, I know we are about to maybe \nhave a more important matter come to the floor. I am going to keep my \neye on the chairman of the committee so he can let me know when I \nshould wrap up these comments.\n  The amendment that at some point I would like to offer, either on \nthis bill or another piece of legislation, deals with what I believe is \nan extremely important issue about enhancing U.S. diplomatic and \nstrategic influence in the Western Hemisphere.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have been a member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee on the subcommittee dealing with Latin America for \nthe 24 years I have been in the Senate, either as the ranking member or \nas the chairman of the subcommittee.\n  I am deeply concerned, as I know many of my colleagues are, that \nwhile our attention is focused on other parts of the world, for obvious \nreasons, there is a serious condition developing in Latin America that \ndeserves our attention.\n  The amendment I would be offering is quite simple. It would permit \nnations in this hemisphere to receive international military and \neducational training, so-called IMET training, assistance from the \nUnited States.\n  My colleagues might say: Well, don't we do that? Haven't we been \ndoing that for years? The answer is yes. But it has been stopped in 11 \ncountries in Latin America, along with economic support funds. The \nreason is because these nations have not signed on to the so-called \narticle 98 agreement with the United States. The article 98 agreement \nhas to do with the American Service Members Protection Act. That is \nbecause the administration is vehemently opposed to the International \nCriminal Court, and any nation that does not protect American \nservicemen from potentially being prosecuted under that act would have \nthe international military and educational training funds, along with \neconomic support funds, cut off entirely.\n  Now, again, I am not arguing at all about whether we ought to have \nthe American Service Members Protection Act. My colleagues have voted \nfor that. That is the law of the land. My concern is linking that \nlegislation with the international military and educational training \nfunds and economic assistance funds.\n  Let me tell you what has happened as a result of linking these up. We \nused to have as many as 800 junior officers or senior officers from \nLatin America come to the United States each year to go to our schools, \nto learn about how we would conduct our military operations, to receive \nthe critical training that would make them more in tune with our \nideals, our values, as military officers.\n  As a result of this linkage we have now adopted, we now have zero \nmilitary personnel coming from these countries that I have already \nmentioned, the 11 countries affected; the countries being Bolivia, \nEcuador, Peru, Venezuela, Brazil, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Uruguay, \nBarbados, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad, and Tobago.\n\n  To give you some idea, we used to have from Peru 172 young officers \ncome to the United States. Because of the linkage, we now have zero. \nUruguay sent 202. We now have zero. Venezuela, 73; Ecuador, 85--to give \nyou some idea in the last year or so, and on down the list.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of the number of people coming \nfrom these countries on a roughly annual basis be printed in the \nRecord, if I may.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, an amendment just passed without notice \nto any of us that involves a dispute about a helicopter between New \nYork and Connecticut. I did not know of that amendment. Neither did \nSenator Clinton. Neither did anybody else. So I have to object to this \nuntil I see what it is. It was offered by my good friend from \nConnecticut. I will serve notice, I will hold up this bill and sit here \nuntil we deal with this in a fair way. This was a sneak attack. We knew \nnothing about it. It was not debated. And it is not the right way to do \nbusiness around here.\n  Mr. DODD. Well, Mr. President----\n  Mr. SCHUMER. So I object to whatever the unanimous consent request \nwas until I see what it is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, my point on this amendment is that with the \nsignificant deterioration in the connections between our country and \nthese nations that have received in the past the international military \nand educational training funds and the economic support funds, that we \nfind ourselves in a very precarious position with these countries and \nthe junior officers and senior officers who have come here for their \ntraining. So the amendment, in effect, would delink these issues. It \ndoes not overturn the American Service Members Protection Act; it just \ndelinks it.\n  Who is advocating this? SOUTHCOM, which is the military structure and \norganization that has the responsibility for dealing with Latin \nAmerica, is a strong advocate of delinking these issues. In fact, in \ntoday's Washington Times, the headline is ``U.S. 'hands tied' in South \nAmerica.'' I will quote from the article:\n\n       As the Bush administration tries to craft a new foreign \n     policy toward an increasingly belligerent Venezuela, Pentagon \n     and military officials say they cannot blunt that nation's \n     regional influence unless a law meant to protect U.S. \n     personnel from prosecution in the International Criminal \n     Court is changed.\n\n  The article goes on:\n\n       That law, the American Service Members Protection Act, \n     prohibits U.S. security assistance funds and most military \n     cooperation unless a country rejects the U.N.-backed ICC or \n     signs a bilateral immunity agreement with the United States. \n     . . .\n       Of the 22 nations in the world that are on the black list \n     [so-called]--they have ratified the ICC agreement and have \n     refused to grant the United States bilateral immunity--11 of \n     them are in Latin America.\n\n  I have listed them already.\n  So again, I will not go on at great length. I know there is a \npossibility here of reaching an agreement on a matter that has held up \nthis bill. This amendment would delink these issues. I do not need to \nemphasize the point. My colleagues should be aware of this.\n  There was a growing influence from the People's Republic of China in \nLatin America, offering to spend billions of dollars in the region and \nI presume, willing as well, to train military personnel. We do not want \nto lose the tremendous opportunity we have had over the years to \nmaintain these relationships.\n  Again, I am not here to argue today the wisdom or lack of wisdom of \nthe American Service Members Protection Act. The only case I want to \nmake to my colleagues is, Should we be linking these IMET funds--that \nis, the international military and educational training funds--and \neconomic support funds, which are critically important in Latin \nAmerica, with that legislation? I do not think we should. SOUTHCOM, our \nmilitary leaders, do\n\n[[Page S3262]]\n\nnot think we should. Roger Noriega, with whom I do not always agree on \nLatin American issues, thinks it is wrong to link the economic support \nfund issues as well. So people who have strong credentials, if you \nwill, in opposing the International Criminal Court believe that linking \nthese issues in this region is not serving the interests of the United \nStates well at all.\n  At an appropriate time, in consultation with the chairman of the \ncommittee and others, I would like to pursue this matter to see whether \nmy colleagues might agree that we might delink these issues. With that, \nagain, knowing there are other matters that can be dealt with, I won't \nbelabor the point.\n  I have some further comments I will make, but I will wait for the \nappropriate time to do that so that my full statement can be read by \nthose who may be interested in this particular proposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, let me respond briefly to the distinguished \nSenator from New York. The amendment that was offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut, as I indicated before he was on \nthe floor, we were prepared to accept. We presumed there was not \nDemocratic Party opposition to that; there were not members of the \ncommittee on the floor. Senator Dodd is a member of the committee, and, \ntherefore, we acted in good faith, as we have to. We are trying very \nhard to proceed amendment by amendment, depending upon Senators to be \non the floor, to be represented by their party officials and by their \nstaffs. So I am hopeful the distinguished Senator from New York and the \nSenator from Connecticut may be able to agree on a course of action, \nbut from our standpoint, we believe the amendment was offered and \naccepted legitimately and in due course.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Members \nwho are in the Chamber and who are dealing with the State Department \nauthorization bill and allowing me to proceed as in morning business as \nthey address the issues surrounding that bill.\n  I wanted to raise an issue which I believe is of very high \nsignificance of how we deal with the threat of biological attacks. This \nhas been an issue I have been involved in for a considerable amount of \ntime, having authored the first bioshield bill as the chairman of the \nHELP Committee at the time.\n  Just weeks after September 11, anthrax attacks occurred in Florida, \nNew York, and Washington. They killed five people, and they crippled \nthe mail delivery system in several cities and required a cleanup that \ncost more than $1 billion. For all that, the President's Commission \nwhich just reported on weapons of mass destruction says we were lucky.\n  We cannot really know whether we were exclusively lucky or whether \nthis was the result of responsible effort to prepare ourselves for the \nnext attack that we have not been attacked again or in a worse way, but \nthe facts remain that the threat continues. The President's Commission \nmakes obvious the finding that biological weapons are cheaper and \neasier to acquire than nuclear weapons, and they could be even more \ndeadly.\n\n  There is no question that if terrorists are able to get their hands \non a weaponized biological agent, whether it is anthrax, small pox, \nbotulism, or ebola, they will use it in a place where Americans gather \nin their daily lives. Whether it is a subway system as occurred in \nJapan or a building as occurred in the Capitol, it is these types of \nattacks--biological, chemical, and dirty bombs--that pose the greatest \nthreat to our Nation.\n  The President's Commission, which released its report last Thursday, \nexposed the stark reality that our intelligence community may have \nunderestimated the progress of terrorists and others in developing \nbiological weapons. For example, in Afghanistan, investigators found \nevidence that after the war, al-Qaida had the capability to produce a \nvirulent biological weapon identified only as ``agent X,'' which \ndocuments suggest was anthrax.\n  Much of the information we have on the development of biological \nweapons by terrorist groups and rogue nations is classified; however, \nit is no secret that Soviet scientists were working on engineering \nbiological agents before the fall of the Soviet Union, including \nsmallpox engineered to be totally lethal, a hybrid plague that is more \nresistant to vaccine, and a strain of anthrax resistant to seven \ndifferent antibodies. Unfortunately, we have no assurance that all of \nthese products which they were trying to develop have been destroyed. \nWe are aware of some rogue countries that developed delivery systems \nsuch as anthrax-laced cigarettes and botulism-contaminated beer.\n  While the President's Commission finds the threat deeply troubling \ntoday, they foretell that it will be more tomorrow, when genetics \nmodification techniques will allow creation of even worse biological \nweapons. These findings underscore that the threat posed to our \nnational security from biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear \nweapons is truly real and significant.\n  Even before the anthrax attacks here, we as a Congress recognized the \nneed to enhance three critical enterprises or sectors in our country to \nbetter protect our people from attacks by biological agents: No. 1 the \nresearch enterprise, led by NIH and private researchers; No. 2 the \nbiotechnology development and manufacturing sector, particularly \nvaccines but also other countermeasures such as drugs and devices; and \nNo. 3 the broader health care delivery system, including physicians, \nhospitals, and public health departments here and abroad.\n  The first substantial effort, started before the anthrax attacks and \ncompleted in 2002, was the Bioterrorism Act of 2002, which dramatically \nincreased funding for the Strategic National Stockpile so that a \nnational pool of countermeasures, including those to protect against \nsmallpox, could be maintained. It also dramatically improved our border \nprotection authorities, particularly for food imports; protected our \nwater supply; dramatically increased oversight of research labs that \nhandled agents that could potentially be used in an attack; and \ncommitted substantial new resources to our state public health systems \nand hospitals to ensure improved surveillance and surge capacity. \nInstitutionally, it also created a number of new Federal authorities to \nidentify and develop and coordinate our response to a threat.\n  In 2003 and 2004, following the President's call and leadership, we \npassed the bipartisan Project BioShield Act to confront weaknesses in \nour ability to have the research enterprise speed results to us and to \nhave FDA speed products to potential victims. Notably, we pre-funded a \n$5.6 billion account to assure the developers of countermeasures that \nif they delivered a product that protected this country from a \nbiological attack then the Government would in fact have the resources \nto purchase that product and recognize their work.\n  Project BioShield recognized that we had very little on hand to \naddress even\n\n[[Page S3263]]\n\nthe handful of agents that pose the greatest threat, such as smallpox, \nanthrax, botulism and plague. As a result, we have made valuable \nprogress.\n  Our smallpox stockpile has grown from 90,000 doses of smallpox \nvaccine ready for use in 2001 to 300 million doses today. We have \nmodified vaccinia Ankara, a next-generation smallpox vaccine that \npromises greater safety, in clinical testing and others in \npredevelopment. In addition, we have a new oral form of an antiviral \ndrug cidofovir in advanced product development for use in the event of \na smallpox attack and to treat the rare complications from the smallpox \nvaccine.\n\n  To combat anthrax, a new recombinant vaccine is in clinical testing \nand may need fewer doses than the classic vaccine, and the Department \nof Health and Human Services has contracted with VaxGen to purchase 75 \nmillion vaccine doses under BioShield. New anthrax therapies that can \nneutralize the anthrax toxin are also being developed, such as \nmonoclonal and polyclonal antibodies.\n  To combat botulism, treatments for the toxin and a vaccine to prevent \nthe disease are in development. And finally for Ebola a new vaccine is \nin development.\n  Project BioShield was a good start, but we must do more. As the \nauthors of the Center for Biosecurity report note: The legislation \nrepresents a significant step for the government and demonstrates [its] \nseriousness [but] is only a necessary first step.\n  We have identified dozens of agents that could be used against our \npeople, yet we still lack vaccines and treatments for some of the \ngravest biological and chemical threats, such as ricin, plague, and \nviral hemorrhagic fever. We still lack an antidote to sulfur mustard \nand nitrogen mustard--and those available for sarin and VX have \nsignificant limitations in their practical utility given the speed with \nwhich they need to be applied.\n  We are also not prepared to fight naturally occurring infectious \ndiseases--such as avian flu--that could be equally as deadly and could \nbe weaponized in the future. And experts in HELP testimony, as well as \nthose responding to a comprehensive survey by the University of \nPittsburgh Center for Biosecurity, note the increasing threat of new \nbio-engineered and genetically modified pathogens. A 2003 CIA review \nconfirms that these strains could be ``worse than any disease known to \nman.'' Many have observed that we in fact need to move beyond the \nproduct-by-product and bug-by-bug approach of BioShield and address \nsolutions more comprehensively and innovatively.\n  And we have seen a very anemic response within the research and \nmanufacturing sectors to engage in biodefense work. Fewer than 100 \ncompanies have come forward with even a modest interest in developing \ncountermeasures for bioterrorism and other agents. The profile of these \ncompanies is in many ways positive--they are entrepreneurial, often \nhave crucial insights into a bioterrorism agent or product, can move \nquickly, and many have strong venture capital connections. However, in \nother critical ways they lack the ability in our current environment to \ndeliver a finished, effective product to potential victims. These same \ncompanies tend to be small, often work on only a single product, rarely \nhave the capital required to bring a product to market, and typically \nhave limited ability to manufacture a product at the level and with the \nspeed required to respond fully to an emergency. BioShield has done \nlittle to address these latter concerns.\n\n  The President's Commission stated that to combat this continuing \nthreat, the Intelligence community, and the government as a whole, \nneeds to approach the problem with a new urgency and new strategies. We \nare in fact pushing our luck.\n  This is precisely why BioShield II--a bill that I introduced as part \nof S. 3--is critical to our efforts in the war against terrorism. S. 3 \nclearly indicates that the Senate Republican leadership puts a very \nhigh priority on invigorating our biodefense capability. The people and \n10 organizations that will be on the front lines of national defense \nwill no longer be just traditional defense industries--providing arms \nand artillery--but will now include biomedical research and \nbiotechnology manufacturing sectors, as well as health care delivery \nsystems.\n  Building this biodefense sector is the first step in winning what \ncould be the arms race of the 21st century. We must be secure in the \nability of this sector to prevent and defend the United States against \nbiological weapons. If we are capable of developing a vaccine or some \nother treatment that will neutralize the effect of these types of \nbiological agents, including genetically modified pathogens, then they \nare less likely to be used against us. This same sector must also be \npositioned to fight new natural threats, such as a pandemic of avian \nflu. And, as highlighted by a recent GAO report on Anthrax Detection, \nwe need improved detection and testing methods to accurately determine \nwhen an agent has been released and when an area has been \ndecontaminated and is safe. Similarly, as the Washington Post helped \nuncover, BioWatch style technologies need to be dramatically improved, \nso that we have confidence in the detection of airborne pathogens \naffecting our key cities. Currently, lab analysis, even when it is \ncorrect, requires days to return results on only 10 agents to date.\n  A range of experts, including researchers, government officials, and \nmanufacturers, told us in hearings that they need greater Federal \nassistance for them to bear the risk of developing products to counter \nbiological threats or infectious disease that also divert capital away \nfrom the development of other important and often more profitable \ndrugs. Many of the measures in BioShield II legislation, including \nfinancial incentives, intellectual property protection, and liability \nprotection were recommended during those hearings.\n  A key point here is that we need to ensure the participation in this \nenterprise of not just small, fleet, and innovative biotechnology \ncompanies. We need to broaden our attention to large, experienced \ncompanies, with multiple sources of financing, the ability to \nmanufacture, license, and bring to market a product, and do so on a \nlarge scale in an emergency. Additional measures are needed to \nencourage potential research, manufacturing, and health care delivery \npartners to commit substantial resources and take the risks necessary \nto bring innovative new products to market.\n  The number-one threat cited by experts in our hearings and experts in \na range of forums and publications is the almost boundless liability \nexposure associated with developing these products--and the resulting \nmassive cost of product liability law suits. The unfortunate liability \nexperience of Bayer, manufacturer of Cipro, bears witness to the \nexposure a biodefense manufacturer faces--and the litigation costs that \nwill be incurred even when, as in the Bayer case, the manufacturer is \neventually absolved.\n  Manufacturers of biodefense countermeasures typically risk exposure \nto devastating product liability lawsuits to a far greater degree than \ntypical drug companies and for this reason are unlikely to get \ncommercial liability insurance for countermeasure products. There are a \nnumber of reasons. For example, as Project BioShield specifically \ncontemplates, such countermeasures may be made available without the \nusual battery of clinical trials required for other FDA-approved \nproducts. Safety and efficacy data often must be derived, for the most \npart, from animal trials because healthy humans cannot be exposed to \ntoxic agents during testing for obvious reasons.\n  Further, the scope of distribution of biodefense products and their \nmethod of distribution heightens the risk of a lawsuit--even if the \nproduct is otherwise safe and effective. For example, when distributed \nto large numbers of potential victims, perhaps millions of Americans in \nan emergency, there will inevitably be harm or injuries that occur \naround the time of the use of the product but that are in fact \nassociated with the inevitable pre-existing health conditions in that \nlarge population. Determining the cause of the harm and distinguishing \nbetween the product and other factors will be nearly impossible--and \nyet liability exposure is evident. Methods of distribution in an \nemergency, perhaps using less trained persons as a last resort, also \nincrease risk of liability.\n  Large, responsible, successful companies are--without liability \nprotection--\n\n[[Page S3264]]\n\nthe most likely to remain on the sidelines for fear of risking \ncorporate assets in defending lawsuits. And with other sources of \nrevenue, other successful products, and products generally with higher \nprofit margins, these same companies in fact act prudently in \nprotecting their general corporate assets from unnecessary litigation \nassociated with lower-margin biodefense products.\n  Even as Government has begun to purchase BioShield countermeasures, \nthe Government's ability to limit liability has significant \nlimitations. Under current law there are only two legal authorities \nthat allow the Federal Government to mitigate the liability concerns of \nproducers of countermeasures other than small pox vaccine.\n  The first is through Federal indemnification under Public Law 85-804. \nThe second is through designation/certification under the SAFETY Act. \nBoth of these measures are woefully inadequate to address the practical \nrealities of potential litigation facing providers of countermeasures \nand the fiscal realities facing the Federal Government.\n  Protection under Public Law 85-804 and its executive order extension \nto biodefense products is not frequently granted. When it is, the \nprimary limitation is that the administration typically will not \naddress indemnification prior to award of a contract for a \ncountermeasure--unlike the Department of Defense, which typically does \naddress liability earlier in the process. As a result, potential \nproviders must expend resources to compete for a contract that they may \nhave to refuse due to the lack of liability protection. More often \ncompanies simply refuse to bid at all due to lack of certainty on the \nissue of liability. Numerous technical and definitional limitations on \nthe scope of the indemnification also exist--Is the product inherently \ndangerous? Is it involved in national defense?--not to mention the \nnature of indemnification may expose the Federal Government to enormous \nliability exposure as awards and liability is not structured or limited \nin any way.\n  The practical utility of SAFETY Act protections to biodefense \nproducts is limited. For example, the potential liability of a provider \nof a vaccine that is administered prior to a bioterror attack is not \naddressed--leaving producers of vaccines in particular, as they are \ntypically dispensed prior to an attack, at great risk of liability \nexposure. Protection also requires a burdensome pre-certification \nprocess that has not resulted yet in designation of any biotechnology \nproducts. Clearly dramatic improvements on this model are required.\n  The net impact of this atmosphere results in needed countermeasures \nnot being developed and deployed, thereby exposing the economy, and the \nNation as a whole, to far greater potential liability due to the lack \nof available effective countermeasures in the event of attack. Either \nway, the Federal Government is likely to bear both the human and \nfinancial cost of such an attack as it did on September 11th. But by \nfailing to account for these costs before an attack, countermeasures \nwill not be developed and the Nation will be more exposed to attack, \ncosting America both lives and economic stability.\n\n  S. 3, which contains liability protections based on the SAFETY Act, \nattempts to address these liability concerns not only for terrorism, \nbut also countermeasures developed and deployed to protect the Nation \nagainst naturally occurring epidemics such as SARS and pandemics such \nas Avian influenza. Further, liability protections would be extended to \nensure that those delivering health care in an emergency, including \nbiodefense products, receive due protection for 19 stepping up and \nprotecting our country when it is under attack. Further, S. 3 puts some \nlimits on the almost boundless liability exposure.\n  The second most significant barrier to investment in biodefense \ntechnology, according to experts testifying before the HELP committee \nand other public documents is the failure of current intellectual \nproperty law to adequately recognize and protect a researcher or \nmanufacturer's investment in a technology.\n  The current law mechanism for this involves a combination of patent \nterm extensions and grants of market exclusivity for a product, which \npermit a patent term essentially to be extended to compensate for \nperiods of time while a countermeasure is in the regulatory review or \nother process.\n  Under current law, there are several arbitrary limits placed on the \nduration and nature of the patent extensions that may be granted on a \npharmaceutical product. First, the total effective period of the patent \nfrom the date the drug is approved until the patent expires cannot \nexceed 14 years. Second, no patent extension can exceed 5 years. In \naddition, only partial credit for a patent extension is granted for the \nlengthy time the product undergoes research and development before an \napplication is reviewed by the FDA. S. 3 would create a patent term \nextension authority that is not subject to these arbitrary limits. This \ntype of incentive is also important to recoup some of the innovator or \nmanufacturer's investment in developing the product and for diverting \nresources from manufacturing other more profitable drugs.\n  As an alternative, S. 3 provides a second type of patent provision to \npermit the Government to reward manufacturers who work to develop a new \ncountermeasure use from an existing product or technology during an \nemergency. This provision could, for example, have been useful with the \ndrug Cipro, used as a therapeutic for a number of reasons, but at that \ntime not otherwise studied for use as a treatment for anthrax exposure. \nDuring the anthrax attacks, the government asked the company to step \nforward--the company responded by researching and developing \nconsiderable evidence that their product was indeed safe and effective \nfor treatment following anthrax exposure. Under current law, Americans \ncan only rely on the unselfish generosity of a company to expend these \nresources to provide the safety and effectiveness data we need. Under \nmy legislation, depending on circumstances, additional incentives \ninvolving market exclusivity could be granted for up to two years for \nthe product that was used as a countermeasure. This is an important \ndistinction from the so-called ``wild card'' exclusivity idea, which \nwould allow a company to extend the patent protection of a different \nproduct as a reward for stepping forward. Again, this type of incentive \nwill encourage manufacturers to step forward in a crisis and will help \nthem recoup their losses from diverting their research and \nmanufacturing efforts from more profitable products.\n  We've heard resoundingly that our research, manufacturing, and health \ncare delivery sectors need reasonable assurances that a market for \nthese products will in fact exist should they invest the resources \nnecessary to fully develop them. Under the BioShield approach the \nmanufacturer takes the gamble for product development--the government \nas the sole purchaser needs to be a reliable partner. I look forward to \ncontinuing to discuss viable approaches in this area. In my view, \nhowever, it is not politically viable to have that basket of options or \nincentives include ``wild-card'' exclusivity--or the ability to apply a \npatent extension or market exclusivity to any product in a company's \nportfolio, regardless of whether it has any use for biodefense \npurposes. Today, politically, the reality is that this approach is not \nsustainable--even if it would serve as a powerful incentive to \ncompanies to step up and deliver much-needed biodefense products.\n  The role of the government in facilitating research, development, and \ndelivery of biodefense products can be great. Unfortunately, all too \noften, government gets in the way. Accordingly, S. 3 also contains \nimportant regulatory reform initiatives for protecting Americans \nagainst bioterrorism. First, it has provisions that will improve the \ninternational harmonization of U.S. Food and Drug Administration \nregulations with those of the regulatory bodies of our allies in \nEurope, Canada, and other developed countries. This will help \nfacilitate the development and approval of biodefense products, and \nwill reduce the costs of regulation by the United States and these \ncountries of biodefense countermeasures such as drugs, vaccines and \nmedical devices. Streamlining and making truly effective the regulatory \napproaches from these developed countries will also assure the \ncontinued safety and effectiveness of these medical countermeasures. S. \n3\n\n[[Page S3265]]\n\nalso requires additional reviews by experts on how to improve \nregulation of these products.\n\n  Second, the bill includes important provisions to assure uniformity \nthroughout the United States of biodefense product labeling and other \nFDA-regulatory requirements. We urgently need this provision to respond \nin a uniform and united way to a potential bioterrorist attack or other \ndeadly epidemic.\n  Dramatically conflicting or confusing state and local labeling and \ncomposition requirements will limit the ability of Americans across the \ncountry to respond adequately and quickly. It is important to note that \nthe provision includes language for exempting purely local matters such \nas pharmacy practice laws from national uniformity requirements and \nunique local conditions.\n  The Bioterror Act of 2002 took significant steps forward to address \npublic health infrastructure needs of the country. BioShield II builds \non these authorities in an effort to prioritize resources to those \nareas faced with the greatest threat--to build the technical expertise \nof the federal workforce, particularly at our premier biomedical and \nhealth organizations at NIH, FDA, and CDC--and to build private sector \nresponse capacity in various private-public arrangements designed to \nhave credentialed, expert, and trained teams on hand to respond quickly \nto a crisis. Surveillance authorities here and abroad also need to be \nstrengthened and developed--using innovative private sector analysis of \nprescription drug, hospital emergency room and doctor visits and other \n``leading indicators.'' In short, as Richard Falkenrath of the \nBrookings Institution notes, ``there's no area of homeland security in \nwhich the administration has made more progress than bioterrorism, and \nnone where we have further to go. But, it is critical to agree with \nElin Gursky with the Anser Institute for Homeland Security, ``This \nproblem won't be solved by money alone.''\n  We have an obligation to be prepared for the worst threat. Maybe that \n``next'' attack will never come. Or maybe it will come tomorrow.\n  We can't know where or when it will come or what our enemies will try \nto do. We have to be prepared for all possibilities. Therefore, we have \nto have a vibrant and strong biotechnical industry, a biomedical \nindustry, and an atmosphere here in the Federal Government which \nencourages the development of the vaccines and other antibodies which \nwill allow us to address these type of threats.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an amendment \nmy colleague Senator Lindsey Graham and I have submitted that would \ncreate a special trade prosecutor within the Office of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative.\n  It is my understanding, working with our leader and the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, that we are not going to proceed with this \namendment and instead will be entering into a colloquy with the \nchairman of the Finance Committee about his willingness to work with us \nto add language to create a special trade prosecutor on appropriate \nlegislation coming to the Finance Committee to reauthorize trade laws. \nWe look forward to working with him. I look forward to the colloquy we \nwill be submitting for the Record shortly.\n  I thought it was important to be able to speak about this issue for a \nmoment because I know there are many of us on both sides of the aisle \nwho are deeply concerned about what is happening as it relates to \nunfair trade practices by other countries. We want to work together on \na bipartisan basis in order to address this, and address this as \nquickly as possible. That is why I am so pleased Senator Graham has \njoined with me as an author of this amendment. We also have a separate \nbill as well to do the same thing. We look forward to working with the \nFinance Committee in order to be able to create the prosecutor and to \ninclude legislation in a future bill coming to the Senate.\n  This amendment is based on the concept by Senator Bayh from Indiana. \nI thank him for being a serious and thoughtful voice in this debate, \nfor his ongoing advocacy, and for providing the Senate with solutions \nto fix our growing trade deficit. I congratulate Senator Bayh as well.\n  This amendment would create a special trade prosecutor appointed by \nthe President and confirmed by the Senate with authority to ensure \ncompliance with trade agreements and to protect our manufacturers as \nwell as our farmers against unfair trade practices. This prosecutor \nwill have the authority to investigate and recommend the prosecution of \ncases before the WTO, as well as those under trade agreements to which \nthe United States is a party.\n  Currently, we have an executive branch that is organized in such a \nway as to make prosecution of unfair trade cases unlikely, at best. \nThis trade prosecutor would allow us to fix that. Coupled with the fact \nthat our domestic manufacturing base has eroded due to unfair trade \npractices, and we have put our manufacturers and others in our economy \nin an impossible situation, we are asking our U.S. Trade Representative \nto do too much and the office is not able to deliver. We ask that they \nnegotiate trade agreements with foreign nations at one moment and then \nturn around and enforce agreements the next, all without damaging the \nability of the United States to negotiate the next trade deal. It is \nnot working. While significant portions of our trade imbalances are not \ncaused by lax enforcement, many of them are.\n  In February, the Department of Commerce reported that the merchandise \ntrade deficit reached a record level of $666.2 billion in 2004, a 21.7-\npercent increase since 2003. That translates into job loss. The \naggregate U.S. trade deficit, which includes both goods and services, \nwas $617.7 billion dollars, a 24-percent increase over 2003. We have \nmany trading partners that fulfill their obligations under our \nagreements, but we also have many that do not. We should address this \nproblem with a straightforward solution, a special trade prosecutor.\n\n  Yesterday, we finally saw a glimmer of hope on the trade front as the \nadministration began the process of imposing import quotas on shirts, \ntrousers, and underwear. But it could have come much sooner if we had \nsomeone in the Government whose job it was to look for these violations \nand to recommend action.\n  Commerce Secretary Gutierrez, a man whom I respect and strongly \nsupported as Secretary of Commerce, coming from the great State of \nMichigan, is already having a positive impact. I hope he will pursue \nthis case until our textile industry finally gets the relief it \ndeserves.\n  That is not enough. There are more U.S. industries facing similar \nunfair trade practices. We are proposing an institutional change that \nwill allow us to thoroughly and vigorously investigate and prosecute \nthese cases.\n  For instance, China is a textbook case of how a foreign government \nhas used a network of illegal subsidies and government interventions in \norder to destroy foreign competition both in the United States as well \nas in many other countries.\n  According to the United States-China Economic and Security \nCommission, these actions have gone virtually unchallenged by the U.S. \nGovernment, despite the fact that China's actions are in clear \nviolation of both U.S. trade law and WTO rules.\n  These anticompetitiveness actions by the Chinese Government include \ncurrency manipulation. I am very proud to have been a cosponsor of the \namendment that overwhelmingly passed earlier today, bipartisan \namendment, to send a very strong message to China regarding the fact we \nwill no longer tolerate the manipulation of their currency. It is \ncausing job loss. It is causing pressure on our American businesses. I \nam pleased we were able to address that.\n\n[[Page S3266]]\n\n  It is estimated that currency manipulation provides as much as a 40-\npercent subsidy for Chinese exporters. In addition, the Chinese \nGovernment also has illegal direct Government subsidies of its state-\nowned textile and apparel sectors, illegal export tax rebates of about \n13 percent, and the deliberate extension of billions of dollars in \nnonperforming or free money loans by China's central banks in order to \naward a competitive advantage against foreign competition.\n  The Commission goes on to say that in the case of China, the dramatic \nincrease in subsidies has caused Chinese prices to drop by an average \nof 58 percent over the past 2 years in those product areas where the \nquotas have been removed.\n  As a result, China has begun a near monopoly share in these products \nover the last 24 months, gaining 60 percent of the market.\n  Our businesses in Michigan just ask for a level playing field. They \njust ask the rules be fair. It is our job to make sure they are. \nHowever, our Government has failed to file any complaints at the WTO \ndespite the Chinese Government's repeated and widespread violations of \nWTO rules. This is of grave concern to colleagues on both sides of the \naisle and was reflected again in the vote earlier today as it relates \nto China's manipulation of their currency.\n  Last year, as is widely reported, our Government refused to criticize \nChina's human rights and labor rights record before the United Nations \nHuman Rights Commission despite overwhelming evidence of human rights \nviolations.\n  Our Government's inaction is costing hundreds of thousands of \nAmerican jobs--I argue that is rapidly becoming millions crippling our \nmanufacturing sector, distorting trade and investment patterns \nglobally, and leaving hundreds of millions of Chinese workers \nvulnerable and mistreated, as well.\n  Let me give a few examples of the violations occurring. Counterfeit \nautomotive products are a big problem in my home State of Michigan. Not \nonly does it kill American jobs, but it has the potential to kill \nAmericans as cheap, shoddy automotive products replace legitimate ones \nof higher quality. The American automotive part and components industry \nloses an estimated $12 billion in sales on a global basis to \ncounterfeiting. We do not even keep statistics on the potential loss of \nlife. We should understand if left unchecked, this penetration of \ncounterfeit automotive products jobs has the potential to undermine the \npublic's confidence and trust in what they are buying. We cannot let \nthat happen.\n  Our amendment, the effort we will work on with the Finance Committee, \nwill give us a voice and a watchdog so we can take appropriate action \nsooner, more aggressively, more appropriately.\n  In Michigan, we lost 51,000 manufacturing jobs from 1989-2003 due to \nChina's unfair trade practices, according to the Economic Policy \nInstitute.\n  Unfortunately, the plant closings continue in Michigan and around the \nNation. Over the past three months we see example after example of the \ndamage a ``wait and see'' attitude has on workers in this country.\n  Lear Corporation continues to cut jobs in Grand Rapids, a total of \n300 to date, and the company promises more layoffs this summer. Also, \nin Grand Rapids, Steelcase will cut 600 jobs. The ripple effect of Lear \nCorporation's decision will lead Advanced Plastics in Schoolcraft, MI, \nto layoff more than 100 employees this spring.\n  The City of Edmore recently lost 120 high paying manufacturing jobs \nat the local Hitachi plant. Those jobs are moving to China.\n  In Alma, 260 employees at Oxford Automotive are now unemployed due to \nthe competitive pressures in the automotive industry, a large part of \nwhich is due to current manipulation by Japan and China.\n  And the examples don't end there as we all know. We should not be \nshirking our responsibilities to enforce trade rules. This amendment \nhelps us do that. And it helps us save American jobs.\n  I believe in trade and the benefits it can have for our \nmanufacturers, farmers, and other industries. But, we need to have fair \ntrade first and foremost.\n  A Special Trade Prosecutor would have the power to stand up for our \nmanufacturers and farmers and make sure that other countries are \nholding up their end of their trade agreements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. ALEXANDER pertaining to the introduction of S. \n726 and S. 727 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMINT). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an amendment that I have \nfiled and will offer formally. It is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nthat calls for the United Nations to give full nation membership status \nto Israel.\n  Unfortunately, and wrongly, Israel has not been granted the full \nstatus that other 190-nation members enjoy, ever since it became a \nnation state in 1948 and formally became a member of the United Nations \nin 1949. For over 50 years, until the year 2000, Israel was the only \nmember state that was consistently denied admission into a regional \ngroup.\n  Even now, it is still limited to the Western European and others \ngroup in New York but not in Geneva and elsewhere. As a result, for \nexample, Israel cannot participate in the voting for the composition of \nthe International Court of Justice in The Hague, nor can an Israeli \njudge serve on that court. Yet the court is called upon, and was \nrecently, by other nations and the General Assembly to pass judgment on \nthe actions of Israel to protect its national borders and to secure the \nlives and the safety of its citizens.\n  Also, as a result of the denial of full status, Israel is not allowed \nto participate in United Nations conferences on human rights, racism, \nand other issues held in world locations, which is particularly \nimportant since some of those conferences unfairly discriminate against \nIsrael in their consideration of issues they do not consider to the \nsame extent or at all as they affect other member nation states.\n  My amendment says it is the sense of Congress that President Bush \nshould direct the U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations \nto seek an immediate end to the persistent and deplorable inequality \nthat is experienced by Israel in the United Nations; that Israel should \nbe afforded the benefits of full membership in Western European and \nother groups in the United Nations to achieve that full participation, \nand that the U.S. Secretary of State should report to Congress on a \nregular basis on the actions of the administration to encourage \nIsrael's full acceptance by other member states in the United Nations. \nObviously this law and those requirements would apply equally to future \nadministrations of our Government as well.\n  It is ironic because the United Nations created the State of Israel \nback in 1948, and yet it has been the body where some of the most anti-\nSemitic and discriminatory attacks against the democratically elected \nGovernment of the people of Israel have taken place. There have been \nsome improvements. There have been recognitions most recently by \nSecretary Kofi Annan of the anti-Semitic and anti-Israel bias \nhistorically in the United Nations. Some progress has been made, but \nsome is not full progress or acceptance, and some is not enough.\n  The United Nations was founded upon the principle that all member \nnations of the world, all of which may be engaged to some or another \nextent in practices or activities that other nations may disagree with, \nare equal members there for the purpose of resolving the differences \namong nations and among the peoples of the world peacefully, equitably, \nand hopefully in the ultimate best interests of all concerned. So by \ndenying this great nation, a democratic government and the people of \nIsrael, the full rights of citizenship in that world body runs contrary \nto the founding principles and the purpose of the United Nations. It is \ndestructive to the attempt to resolve the differences in the Middle \nEast peacefully, equitably, and hopefully permanently for the benefit \nof all concerned.\n\n[[Page S3267]]\n\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, It is said that Pope John Paul II was \nprobably the most widely recognized person in the entire world. We have \nheard many inspiring tributes to this great man, and rightly so.\n  I would like to take a few minutes to pay tribute to two other great \nmen who died recently. Unlike the Pope, their names and their faces \nwere not instantly recognizable. But they shared some of his finest \nqualities. They were remarkably brave men who risked much to protect \ntranscendent truths, and who continued to defend those truths even in \nthe twilight of their lives. In their cases, the truths were the \nprinciples that are the essence of America.\n  Both of these men first made their marks on American history during \nWorld War II.\n  Ernest Childers was a Native American, a member of the Creek Nation \nfrom Oklahoma, and a recipient of the Medal of Honor.\n  He was a lieutenant in the Army National Guard when he arrived on the \nbeaches of Salerno, Italy, in September 1943. Hearing that many in his \ndivision were pinned down by enemy fire in nearby hills, he organized a \ngroup of eight soldiers to help clear a path to rescue the endangered \nsoldiers.\n  An exploding enemy shell threw Lt. Childers to the ground, breaking \nhis ankle, but he continued to advance. Ordering his soldiers to lay \ndown a base of fire to protect him, he crawled--with his shattered \nankle--toward an enemy sniper's nest.\n  Almost out of ammunition, he reached down and threw a rock at the \nsnipers guessing correctly that they would mistake it for a hand \ngrenade. He was right. When the snipers stood to run, Lt. Childers shot \nand killed one of them; one of his soldiers killed the other. Later \nthat day, he single-handedly captured an enemy soldier.\n  After recovering from his wounds, he was sent back into combat and \nfought at the Battle of Anzio, where he was wounded again. He was \nrecovering in a military hospital when he learned that he was to \nreceive the Medal of Honor.\n  He retired from the Army as a lieutenant colonel in 1965, worked \nbriefly in Washington, then returned home to Oklahoma.\n  After September 11, he wrote a widely circulated column criticizing \nthe attacks on some Arab-Americans. He wrote:\n\n       Even though I have darker skin than some Americans, that \n     doesn't mean I'm any less patriotic than any other American. \n     I am appalled that people who call themselves ``Americans'' \n     are attacking and killing other Americans simply because of \n     their skin color.\n\n  Now let me speak of another recently lost. Fred Korematsu also \nsuffered a great injury in World War II. In his case, however, the \ninjury wasn't physical, and it wasn't inflicted by enemy soldiers. It \nwas inflicted by the United States government in one of the most \nshameful chapters in our Nation's history.\n  In 1942, Mr. Korematsu was 22 years old, living in California, when \nthe U.S. government declared 120,000 Japanese-American citizens and \nimmigrants ``enemy aliens'' and ordered that they be forced from their \nhomes into internment camps--prison camps.\n  Mr. Korematsu--who was born in California to immigrant parents--had \ntried twice to enlist in the military after Pearl Harbor, but was \nrejected for health reasons. He did everything he could think of to be \naccepted as American. He changed his name, and even had an operation to \ntry to make his eyes appear rounder. Still, he was still ordered to be \nimprisoned at Tule Lake, an infamous internment camp in California.\n  His family and friends complied with the order. But Fred Korematsu \nresisted because, he said, he was an American, and he believed that the \ninternments were unconstitutional.\n  He challenged the order all the way to the United States Supreme \nCourt. In a decision that remains one of the most infamous decisions in \nits history, the Court ruled in 1944 that the internment of American \ncitizens of Japanese descent was justified by the need to combat \nsabotage and espionage.\n  It took nearly 40 years for Fred Korematsu's conviction for opposing \ninternment to be overturned by a U.S. District Court.\n  In 1988, Mr. Korematsu helped win an apology and reparations from the \nUnited States Government for internment camp survivors. A decade later, \nhe was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n  In November 2003, Mr. Korematsu did something he never expected he \nwould have to do again in his life. He filed another brief before the \nSupreme Court protesting what he believed to be unconstitutional \ninternments by our Government only this time, the detainees were being \nheld at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n  Mr. Korematsu's brief contained a simple plea.\n\n     . . . to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, this court \n     should make clear that the United States respects \n     constitutional and human rights, even in times of war.\n\n  Fred Korematsu died on March 30 at his home in Larkspur, CA after a \nlong respiratory illness. He leaves his wife, Katherine, and their son \nand daughter.\n  Ernest Childers, a courageous warrior to the end, died March 17 at a \nhospice in Tulsa after suffering a number of strokes. He leaves his \nwife of 59 years, Yolanda, and their three children.\n  These men were recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the \nhighest civilian honor our Nation can bestow on an individual; and the \nMedal of Honor, the highest military honor our Government grants.\n  They risked everything as young men to defend the great principles on \nwhich our Nation is based, and they continued to speak out for those \nprinciples until they died. They were truly American heroes.\n  Our thoughts and prayers go out to their family and friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/06/senate-section/article/S3267-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3267-S3269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE NUCLEAR OPTION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we heard a distinguished leader of a \ncountry pushing into democracy this morning, addressing a joint meeting \nof the Congress over in the other body. I think every time a country \nmoves into democracy, and its leaders and citizens come to this \ncountry, one of the things they are thrilled about is the independence \nof our Federal judiciary and our judiciary overall. They say in their \ncountry, if they ever want to have democracy, they have to have the \nindependence of the judiciary.\n  I mention this because in recent weeks there seems to have been this \nescalating verbal attack by political leaders--and I must say, with all \ndue respect, Republican political leaders--against Federal judges, \nincluding those who have been appointed by Republican Presidents, and \nagainst the Supreme Court, where most of the justices have been \nappointed by Republican Presidents.\n  The Republican leader of the House has spoken seeking vengeance \nagainst judges involved in the Terri Schiavo matter. A Senate \nRepublican has referenced the brutal murders in the State court in \nGeorgia and of Judge Lefkow's family in Illinois as if they were \nsomehow connected to judicial decisions that some people do not like \nand which lead to pressures that explode in violence.\n  Now, I know all Senators, Republicans and Democrats, including the \nSenator who made those remarks, strongly agree there can be no \njustification for violence against judges or their families. In Iraq, \njudges are being attacked by insurgents. In Columbia, honest judges \nwere murdered by drug-dealing thugs. That is not a circumstance we want \nto see anywhere in the world, especially here. We cannot tolerate or \nexcuse or justify it here in the United States.\n  When I chaired the Judiciary Committee in 2001, one of the first \nthings I did was push for passage of the Judicial Protection Act, which \ntoughened criminal penalties for assaults against judges and their \nfamilies. I sponsored it\n\n[[Page S3268]]\n\nwith Senator Gordon Smith. We enacted it. We were right to do so. \nProtecting our judges and Federal law enforcement officers should be a \ntop priority for us. I think sometimes the focus on terrorism distracts \nus from the day-to-day dangers for judges.\n  I remember the autumn of 2001, when Senator Daschle and I were each \nsent anthrax-laced letters in an environment in which high-ranking \nRepublican leaders had criticized us unfairly during the sensitive \nweeks leading up to that. People who touched the outside of the \nenvelope addressed to me--the envelope I was supposed to open--people \nwho simply touched it, doing their job, died as a result of that. And \nno perpetrator was ever arrested or convicted for these anthrax attacks \nby someone who may have thought himself a ``super patriot'' willing to \nwill to make his point.\n  I do not want to see more attacks on our Federal and State judges. So \nI urge those members of the other party who are making these attacks to \ndisavow the rhetoric and those attacks. They should not be creating an \natmosphere in which anyone will feel encouraged or justified in \nattacking our judiciary if they do not like a particular decision.\n  In this regard, I thank the Senator from Texas for the comments he \nmade Tuesday afternoon in which he expressed his regrets with regard to \ncertain remarks he made on Monday that he says were taken out of \ncontext and misinterpreted. He has urged that the overheated rhetoric \nabout the judiciary be toned down and acknowledged that ``[o]ur \njudiciary must not be politicized.''\n  Mr. President, I became a Member of the Senate more than 30 years ago \nat a time when the country was recovering from an abuse of power by \nPresident Nixon. In the wake of the Watergate scandal, many of us were \nelected to be a forceful check on executive power. It was a mindfulness \nof the danger that absolute power corrupts that the Founders designed \nour Constitution to contain a vital set of checks and balances among \nthe three branches of our Federal Government. Those checks and balances \nhave served to guarantee our freedoms for more than 200 years.\n\n  Today, Republicans are threatening to take away one of the few \nremaining checks on the power of the executive branch by their use of \nwhat has become known as their ``nuclear option.'' This assault on our \ntradition of checks and balances and on the protection of minority \nrights in the Senate and in our democracy should be abandoned.\n  The American people have begun to see this threatened partisan power \ngrab for what it is and to realize that the threat and the potential \nharm are aimed at our democracy, at the independent Federal judiciary \nand, ultimately, at their rights and freedoms. A thoughtful editorial \nappeared in one of my home State's newspapers today. In that editorial, \nThe Barre-Montpelier Times Argus observed: ``Abolishing the filibuster \nfor judicial nominees is another, more extreme, form of intimidation.'' \nI ask that a copy of that editorial be included in the Record at the \nend of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Eliminating the filibuster by the nuclear option would \nviolate and destroy the Constitution's design of the Senate as an \neffective check on the executive. The elimination of the filibuster \nwould reduce any incentive for a President to consult with home-State \nSenators or seek the advice of the Senate on lifetime appointments to \nthe Federal judiciary. It is a leap not only toward one-party rule and \nabsolute majoritarianism in the Senate but to an unchecked executive.\n  Recently Republican partisans have ratcheted up the vitriol even \nfurther with their direct threats upon the judiciary. They spare no \none, neither State court judges, nor Federal judges, nor Federal judges \nappointed by Republican Presidents, nor the Supreme Court Justices \nthemselves. Their goal is intimidation and subservience to an \nideological agenda, rather than adherence to the rule of law. Worst of \nall, some Republican leaders have taken their rhetoric to a level that \nshould concern all Americans, at a time when violence against judges, \ntheir families and courtroom personnel has shocked the nation. The \nRepublican leader of the House has recently spoken of seeking vengeance \nagainst judges involved in the Terri Schiavo matter. I recall a similar \ncall by that House leader in 1997 in which he called for the \nintimidation of judges. I spoke against it then and do so again today. \nIt is essential that we preserve the independence of our judiciary and \nprotect it from intimidation.\n  In my time in the Senate we have often faced issues directly relevant \nto the separation of powers and the role this body plays as a check on \nexecutive power. As ranking Democratic member of the Judiciary \nCommittee and as a former chairman of the committee, I have invested \nsignificant time and energy on providing resources to our third branch \nof Government. During the 17 months I chaired the committee, the Senate \nconfirmed 100 of President Bush's judicial nominees. In the other 34 \nmonths of the Bush administration, the Senate has confirmed but 104.\n  The independent, nonpartisan role that judges play in our democracy \nis vital. I agree with Chief Justice Rehnquist when he called the \nindependent judiciary the ``crown jewel'' of our democracy. It is the \nenvy of and the model for the world. In order to keep this branch of \nGovernment independent and above politics, these nominations to \nlifetime appointments should be of the caliber to garner wide \nconsensus, not political divisiveness. The goal should not consistently \nto be to see how many controversial nominees can be confirmed by the \nnarrowest of partisan margins. Partisan passions must be kept in check \nwhen we are addressing an independent branch of Government, and no \nPresident should seek to pack the bench with unalloyed partisans or \nnarrow ideologues.\n\n  It is the Federal judiciary that is called upon to rein in the \npolitical branches when their actions contravene the Constitution's \nlimits on governmental authority and restrict individual rights. It is \nthe Federal judiciary that has stood up to the overreaching of this \nadministration in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. It is more \nand more the Federal judiciary that is being called upon to protect \nAmericans' rights and liberties, our environment and to uphold the rule \nof law as the political branches under the control of one party have \noverreached. Federal judges should protect the rights of all Americans, \nnot be selected to advance a partisan or personal agenda. Once the \njudiciary is filled with partisans beholden to the administration and \nwilling to reinterpret the Constitution in line with the \nadministration's demands, who will be left to protect American values \nand the rights of the American people? The Constitution establishes the \nSenate as a check and a balance on the choices of a powerful President \nwho might seek to make the Federal judiciary an extension of his \nadministration or a wholly-owned subsidiary of any political party.\n  The Senate's role in advising the executive and determining whether \nto consent to confirmation of particular nominees is a fundamental \ncheck and balance on the executive. It is especially important with \nrespect to lifetime appointments to the judiciary. The Senate's rules, \nalready adopted and in place for this Congress, continue to provide for \nan orderly procedure to end debate on matters before the Senate and an \norderly procedure for amending the Senate rules.\n  Just as amending our fundamental charter, the Constitution, requires \nsupermajorities, so amending our Senate rules does, as well. When the \nSenate rule for ending debate in the Senate has been amended in the \npast, the rules for amending those rules have been followed. Previous \nSenate majorities have followed the rule of law by amending rule XXII \nonly after a supermajority has agreed to end debate on amending the \nrule. The nuclear option would circumvent rule XXII and would destroy \nthe equivalent of the rule of law in the Senate.\n  Even the Senate's Republican majority should not be above the law. \nThe Senate has always protected minority rights. The nuclear option \nwould bring an end to that tradition and to the comity and cooperation \non which the Senate depends. The Senate and the House were designed by \nthe Founders to serve different functions in our Government. The \nnuclear option destroys the fundamental character of the Senate. \nBreaking so fundamental a Senate rule by brute force is lawlessness. \nOver\n\n[[Page S3269]]\n\nthe past 2 years, the Republican majority has already bent, broken or \nignored the rules governing committee consideration of judicial \nnominees. This year they are moving to destroy the one Senate rule left \nthat allows the minority any protection and any ability to protect the \nrights of the American people.\n  In political speeches we all talk about the importance of the rule of \nlaw. In Iraq over the last 2 years, young Americans have given the \nultimate sacrifice seeking to help establish a democracy that upholds \nthe rule of law. The governing transitional law that the Bush \nadministration helped design for Iraq calls for a two-thirds vote of \nthe Iraqi legislature to select the president and vice presidents. This \nwas created to protect the minority and encourage consensus. Just today \nwe hear that the long period of negotiations following the Iraqi \nelections has yielded an agreement on the presidency council, which is \nthe next step in forming an Iraqi government, and that the Iraqi \nnational assembly expects to have the two-thirds vote required to \nproceed to name a Kurdish leader, a prominent Shiite Arab politician \nand a Sunni Arab leader as the president and the two vice presidents of \nIraq. While we recognize and fight for consensus-building and minority \nprotection in Iraq, Republican partisans here at home are threatening \nthe nuclear option to remove protection for the minority in the U.S. \nSenate. That is wrong.\n\n  When President Bush last met earlier this year with President Putin \nof Russia, he spoke eloquently about the fundamental requirements of a \ndemocratic society. President Bush acknowledged that democracy relies \non the sharing of power, on checks and balances, on an independent \ncourt system, on the protection of minority rights and on safeguarding \nhuman rights and human dignity. What we preach to others we should \npractice. Destroying the protection of minority rights, removing the \nSenate as a check on the President's power to appoint lifetime judges \nand undermining our independent Federal judiciary are inconsistent with \nour democratic principles and values but that is precisely what the \nnuclear option would do.\n  Breaching the Senate rules to eliminate filibusters of nominations \nwill only produce more division, bitterness and controversy. To date \nthe Senate has proceeded to confirm 204 lifetime appointments to the \nFederal judiciary by President Bush. The Senate has refused to grant \nits consent to only a handful of his most controversial and divisive \nnominees and only after public debate and the votes of a substantial \nnumber of Senators. Those who now threaten the nuclear option were \nwilling to forestall votes on more than 60 of President Clinton's \nmoderate and qualified judicial nominees if only one anonymous \nRepublican Senator had a secret objection.\n  The way to resolve this conflict is for the President and Senate \nRepublicans to work with all Senators and engage in genuine, bipartisan \nconsultation aimed at the appointment of consensus nominees with \nreputations for fairness who can gain wide support and join the more \nthan 200 judges confirmed during President Bush's first term. By last \nDecember, we had reduced judicial vacancies to the lowest level, lowest \nrate and lowest number in decades, since President Ronald Reagan was in \noffice.\n  There are currently 28 judicial vacancies for which the President has \ndelayed sending a nominee. In fact, he has sent the Senate only one new \njudicial nominee all year. I wish he would work with all Senators to \nfill those remaining vacancies rather than through his inaction and \nunnecessarily confrontational approach manufacture longstanding \nvacancies.\n  There are currently two of his nominees, Michael Seabright of Hawaii \nand Paul Crotty of New York, who the Republican leadership refuses to \nschedule for consideration. I believe that those nominees can be \ndebated and will be confirmed by overwhelming bipartisan votes, if the \nRepublican leadership of the Senate would focus on making progress \ninstead of seeking to manufacture a crisis. They can become the first \njudges confirmed this year. Let us join together to debate and confirm \nthese consensus nominees.\n  Rather than blowing up the Senate, let us honor the constitutional \ndesign of our system of checks and balances and fill judicial vacancies \nwith consensus nominees without unnecessary delay.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                  [From the Times Argus, Apr. 6, 2005]\n\n                            Time To Stand Up\n\n       Republicans and Democrats are headed for a showdown in the \n     Senate over the Democrats' insistence that, for a handful of \n     extreme and ill-suited judicial nominees, it will use the \n     filibuster to block action. Sen. Patrick Leahy, ranking \n     Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, will be in the \n     center of the fight.\n       Republicans have responded to the prospect of Democratic \n     filibusters by threatening to throw out the rule allowing \n     filibusters for judicial nominees. Democrats say that if that \n     happens they will halt all but the most essential Senate \n     action.\n       The battle over the judiciary is a central political \n     struggle of our time. The congressional effort to meddle in \n     the Terri Shiavo case was a prelude to the battle over the \n     courts, and it revealed the dangerous degree to which the \n     nation's Republican leaders intend to twist the judiciary to \n     their will.\n       The party line among Republicans is that they favor judges \n     who interpret the law rather than making it. They don't want \n     judges imposing outcomes or crafting decisions to carry out a \n     personal agenda.\n       Yet the astonishing comments by Rep. Tom DeLay, House \n     Republican leader, show the Republicans' true aim. DeLay \n     revealed that, above all, he wants to impose outcomes. The \n     outcome in the Schiavo case didn't go his way so he began \n     talking of impeaching the judges involved. Judges whose \n     independence is curbed by that kind of intimidation will be \n     forced into outcomes demanded by politics, not by the law.\n       The Schiavo case passed before judges in state and federal \n     courts, the federal appeals court, even the U.S. Supreme \n     Court, and all those judges, liberal and conservative, ruled \n     that Terri Schiavo's expressed wishes, as conveyed by her \n     husband, should prevail. There has been much debate about \n     whether the husband was reliable and whether the medical \n     diagnosis was correct. But those questions went to judgment \n     in the courts. That is what courts are for. The judiciary is \n     independent so that courts can weigh facts in a calm and \n     reasoned fashion, free of political pressures or the \n     enthusiasms of enflamed groups. Sometimes we don't agree with \n     the outcome, but citizens, like judges, are not supposed to \n     impose outcomes.\n       Intimidation of the judiciary was also the approach of \n     former Attorney General John Ashcroft, who sought to \n     discipline judges who acted counter to his wishes. Abolishing \n     the filibuster for judicial nominees is another, more \n     extreme, form of intimidation.\n       The Republican critique of the judiciary suggests they \n     believe judges are somehow outside the democratic system, \n     that they have no business thwarting the workings of the \n     legislative branch. But judges are an essential part of the \n     democratic system. For one, they are appointed by the elected \n     executive and confirmed by elected senators. And they exist \n     to safeguard our democratic system when the legislative or \n     executive branches try to ride roughshod over the law.\n       In the Schiavo case, the executive and legislative branches \n     sought to abolish the constitutional role of the judiciary as \n     an independent branch. In those cases where President Bush's \n     judicial nominees exhibit similar lack of respect for the \n     law, senators have the duty to oppose them and to stand up \n     against the intimidating tactics of the Republican \n     leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/06/senate-section/article/S3269-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3269-S3271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING POPE JOHN PAUL II\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to \nexpress my sorrow on the passing of his Holiness, Pope John Paul II.\n  Karol Jozef Wojtyla, born in the village of Wadowice, Poland, grew up \nin a poor family, and was an orphan by the age of 21. But by the end of \nhis long, energetic life, he had overseen a new outpouring of faith in \nthe Catholic Church and a renewal of freedom around the world.\n  With his election in 1978, John Paul became the first non-Italian \npope in over 450 years. How fitting that of all the countries to \nproduce the next pope, he came from Poland. In 1978, Poland, like most \nof Eastern Europe, was straining under the yoke of Soviet domination. \nThe Soviet Communists had dubbed religion ``the opiate of the masses,'' \nand purposefully destroyed churches, detained or murdered priests, and \nterrorized worshippers.\n  The last thing they wanted was a native son of Poland returning there \nto remind his people of the power of faith.\n  Despite the Polish Communist government's attempts to prevent his \nvisit, John Paul journeyed to Poland in June 1979. When he arrived he \nknelt down and kissed the Earth. He made over three dozen public \nappearances, in Warsaw, in Krakow, even in Auschwitz, and millions of \nPolish Catholics defined their government to see him. John Paul \nreminded the world that the\n\n[[Page S3270]]\n\npower of faith was stronger than tanks. He told his listeners that \nChrist could not be removed from human history. He urged them, ``be not \nafraid.''\n  With his visit, John Paul reminded Eastern Europeans that no economic \nsystem was more powerful than the human spirit. Within months, the \nPolish solidarity movement began, and was the first crack in the Iron \nCurtain. Thanks to continuous pressure by the Pope and other Western \nleaders, the Soviet empire finally crumbled 12 years later.\n  John Paul knew something about the power of faith over \ntotalitarianism. In 1944, while studying for the priesthood in Krakow, \nPoland, the Nazis began rounding up men to forestall an uprising \nagainst their brutal regime. They captured 8,000 in Krakow. But they \nmissed 24-year-old Karol, by failing to look in the basement of the \nhouse he was staying in. He was down there praying.\n  John Paul was not a political leader, but a religious one. He was a \nchampion of human freedom because he believed that freedom was a right \ngranted by God. And he wanted to share that message with others. \nThrough his travels, John Paul took the Christian faith to more people \nin more places than anyone else has ever done. In his 27 years as Pope, \nhe made 104 foreign trips, the most in papal history. Fluent in seven \nlanguages, he spoke directly to people the world over.\n  More than any Pope before him, John Paul championed a brotherhood of \nfaith between Christians, Jews and Muslims. He was the first pope to \nvisit both a synagogue and a mosque. he referred to the Jewish people \nas `our elder brothers.'' His goal was to establish trust and peace \nbetween the world's great religions.\n  In 1994, he established full diplomatic relations between the Vatican \nand Israel. And in the closing years of the 20th century, he issued the \nhistoric document, ``We Remember: A Reflection on the Shoah.'' In it he \napologized for the Church's failure to stop the Nazi holocaust.\n  John Paul made history when, after so many years of working towards \nreconciliation, he became the first Pope to officially visit the Holy \nLand in 2000. He visited the sites of Jesus' birth, the Last Supper, \ncrucifixion, burial and resurrection. In Jerusalem, he prayed at the \nWestern Wall. Still in Jerusalem, he visited the al-Aqsa mosque, where \nMuslims hold that Muhammad ascended to Heaven.\n  John Paul recognized that worshipers of Judaism, Christianity and \nIslam, who all too often clash with raised fists, also share the same \nholy ground. By visiting these sites he reminded us that they belong to \nnone, yet are holy to all.\n  John Paul was wonderful at delivering his message of love, hope and \npeace to millions at a time. He holds the record for having been seen, \nwith the naked eye, by more people over his lifetime than anyone else \nin the world. As shepherd of the Catholic Church, he increased its \nnumber from 750 million to one billion over the globe. But he could \nalso speak directly to just one man.\n  Take a man named Mehmet Ali Agca. On May 13, 1981, Agca shot the pope \nas he rode in a jeep driving through St. Peter's Square, and wounded \nhim in the abdomen, right arm and left hand. John Paul was rushed to \nsurgery and remained there for 5 hours. Part of his intestines had to \nbe removed, and this man, a former skier, hiker and mountain climber, \nnever fully recovered from this murderous attack.\n  But 2 years after the shooting, John Paul went to visit Agca in an \nItalian prison. The apostle and the assassin spoke face to face, and \nJohn Paul forgave Agca for attempting to kill him. In 1999, the Vatican \nendorsed clemency, and the Italian Government pardoned Agca a year \nlater.\n  Right up until the end of his life, John Paul continued to teach us \nmoral lessons. By continuing his duties through his ill health, he \nreminded us that all life has value and there is no such thing as a \ndisposable human being.\n  We have lost a great moral leader, whose counsel will be missed as we \ncontinue to fight for freedom against the forces of violence, \nintolerance and hatred. it will be hard to fill the vacuum John Paul \nhas left. His wisdom and fearlessness spoke not just to Catholics, but \nalso to all Christians, Jews, Muslims, and the religions of the world. \nAs we face a future without him, we must go forward as he did, with \nconfidence in the human soul to find meaning amidst the chaos. And we \nmust ``be not afraid.''\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Pope John Paul II, \nwho passed away on Saturday, April 2, 2005.\n  I certainly will not be able to capture Pope John Paul's entire \nlegacy in these few words. He was a truly remarkable individual who led \na truly remarkable life.\n  Pope John Paul II was a man who had a deep commitment to human \nfreedom political freedom and economic freedom certainly, but more \nimportantly, a freedom of the human soul from the bondage and burdenls \nof tyranny, oppression, and poverty. As a young man who came of age \nduring World War II, he opposed Nazism. One of his first encyclicals as \nPope was in support of workers' rights. During the 1980's, he was one \nof the leading world figures who helped bring about the end of \ncommunism. And he warned us all against the dangers of unbridled \ncapitalism, particularly for those who are less fortunate.\n  Without a doubt, Pope John Paul II was the most ecumenical Pope the \nworld has ever seen. It is fitting that his passing has sparked an \noutpouring of appreciation not simply from Catholics, but from people \nof all faiths.\n  John Paul II visited 129 countries outside of Italy by far the most \nof any Pope. He was the first Pope to visit a synagogue or a mosque. He \nvisited the Western Wall in Israel and apologized for the Church's \nfailure to resist and speak out against the Holocaust. Like no other \nPope before him, he used his position to build bridges of understanding \nand respect between different faiths.\n  Pope John Paul II did not merely give sermons. He led by example. \nThis was particularly evident when it came to the issue of forgiveness. \nMany of us often talk about forgiveness in an abstract sense. In \nJanuary 1981, the Pope survived a bullet wound from a would-be \nassassin. Two years later, he visited and forgave the man who made an \nattempt on his life.\n  The Pope was an incredibly charismatic individual. A former actor, he \nused the skills he developed on stage to his advantage. I was fortunate \nenough to meet personally with him twice. Like so many, I was impressed \nnot only by his thoughtfulness, and by the depth of his spiritual \nsentiment, but by his great human vitality, as well as his sense of \nhumor.\n  In many ways, John Paul II was the first ``modern pope.'' Born in \nthis century, he lived through a world war and saw the emergence of the \nnew threat of terrorism. He witnessed the dawn of the space age, as \nwell as the developments of modern air travel, the computer, and the \ninternet. A great deal of his time was devoted to addressing the \ntensions that often exist between modern society and Church traditions \nand doctrines.\n  The world truly lost an extraordinary leader this past Saturday. His \nmessage of faith, hope, and peace inspired millions, even in his final \ndays. I share in the mourning of his passing, and I add my words of \ntribute to those of so many who have offered them in recent days.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I pay tribute to Pope John Paul \nII, not only as a leader of the world's 1.1 billion Catholics, but also \nsomeone who was a moral leader in our troubled world. I was privileged \nto have met this Pope twice in my life while representing the people of \nFlorida. I will always remember his devotion to faith, his intellect \nand his charm but, mostly, I will remember his overwhelming humility.\n  I was struck by how a man in a position of such awesome power could \nbe so humble. And I believe people around the world saw this, too, \nwhich is why millions came to see and hear him during his visits to 129 \ndifferent countries. His words of freedom and peace penetrated the \nhuman heart.\n  John Paul II was also a man of great courage, who learned firsthand \nthe suffering of the Polish people he later would come to serve. As a \nyoung man, he performed forced labor at the hands of the Nazis but \nchallenged their rule. As the archbishop of Krakow, he defied communist \nrulers, telling his countrymen no one could take faith and hope from \ntheir hearts.\n\n[[Page S3271]]\n\n  He used his 26-year papacy to spread the message of freedom and peace \nto all corners of the world, and did so with vigor. His international \ntrips always served a higher purpose, for he always sought to bring \npeople together as equals in God's eyes. At one large gathering of \nyouth, the faithful chanted, ``We love you; we love you.'' When they \nquieted, the Pope humbly responded, ``I love you more.'' He also \ninspired open communication among the world's faiths, as the first Pope \nto enter the main Jewish synagogue in Rome and the first to enter a \nmosque.\n  When he was selected to be the church's 264th Pope, his first words \nto the public were: ``Be not afraid.'' Indeed, Pope John Paul II taught \npeople around the world they need not fear those who try to oppress, \nnor fear those who might be different. As the world mourns his passing, \nwe all should try to heed his words.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/06/senate-section/article/S3271-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           PRESIDENT VIKTOR YUSHCHENKO'S ADDRESS TO CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, Viktor Yushchenko, President of \nUkraine, addressed a joint meeting of the United States Congress. I was \nhonored to be part of the committee that escorted President Yushchenko \ninto the House Chamber.\n  President Yushchenko's courage and commitment to democracy have \ninspired thousands of people in Illinois, and millions more in this \ncountry and throughout the world. In Illinois, we have a sizable \nUkrainian-American population, particularly in Chicago. My son lives in \na section of Chicago known as Ukrainian Village, and soon after \nPresident Yushchenko's election, the neighborhood was covered with \norange ribbons in celebration.\n  Yesterday, President Yushchenko and his wife, Kathy Chumachenko-\nYushchenko, a native of Chicago, visited the Windy City. I am glad they \nhad the chance to experience our Illinois hospitality during their \nbrief trip to the United States.\n  Just last month, I traveled to Ukraine as part of a bipartisan \ncongressional delegation. There, I met with President Yushchenko and \nmembers of his government, and had the chance to see for myself a \nnation newly aglow in the light of democracy.\n  The story of President Yushchenko's election as the President of \nUkraine is a story of great personal courage. It is a story of the \npower of democratic values and ideals. It is a story of what can be \naccomplished by individuals, united in peaceful protest against \ncorruption, cronyism, and unfettered power.\n  President Yushchenko was elected as President of Ukraine despite a \npowerful array of opposing forces which, in pursuit of their ambitions, \nwere willing to obstruct free assembly, free speech, and a free and \nfair democratic election. He ran for President at great risk to his own \nlife. And he prevailed.\n  President Yushchenko spoke today with optimism and with hope for \nUkraine's future as a democratic country. He said of his country, ``We \nwant a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.'' \nThis is a desire that we as Americans understand and share. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in Congress and with President \nYushchenko to help nurture the flame of democracy that has started to \nburn so brightly in Ukraine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/06/senate-section/article/S3271-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation.

Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On March 1, 2005, a man was found murdered in Daly City, CA. The \nvictim, who was dressed in women's clothing, was found with multiple \nstab wounds to his chest and abdomen. Police have identified gender \nidentity and sexual orientation as possible motives.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/06/senate-section/article/S3271-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ZIMBABWE ELECTIONS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to express my concern regarding \nthe recent election in Zimbabwe, which secured sweeping powers for the \nruling ZANU-PF party. These results come as no surprise. In addition to \nreported irregularities on voting day itself, the ruling party had \nwaged a campaign of intimidation, coercion, and institutional \nmanipulation well in advance of the balloting in order to ensure \nvictory.\n  Last month I joined Senator McCain in writing to Secretary Rice, \nurging her to reaffirm the United States commitment to supporting \ngenuine democratic processes and institutions in that troubled country. \nThe U.S. needs a post-election strategy in Zimbabwe for supporting \ncivil society, encouraging respect for civil and political rights, and \nbolstering the forces fighting against corruption.\n  We also need to continue to plan for the future. Once Zimbabwe's \ncorrupt leadership finally released its grasp on power, the country \nwill require substantial international assistance to turn around its \ndevastating economic decline and to rebuild institutions, such as the \nonce-independent judiciary, so that the rule of law can be effectively \nrestored. Too many Zimbabwean youths have been traumatized, pressed \ninto service in brutal pro-ruling party militia forces, enduring \nserious abuse and then often becoming abusers themselves. These young \nmen and women, too, will need support and assistance to find their way \nback on a path toward the futures they once dreamed of as children.\n  I hope that soon the people of Zimbabwe will be given a chance to \nfreely express their will in a genuine democratic process that is free \nfrom manipulation, intimidation, and coercion. As we prepare ourselves \nto be good partners to the people of Zimbabwe when change finally does \ncome, we must also take a hard look at the disappointing passivity of \nleaders in many southern African states who have failed to speak and \nact in support of basic human rights and the rule of law in their own \nneighborhood. These decisions raise real doubts about the commitment of \nthese regional leaders to democracy, and over the long term, these \nfailures threaten the prospects for stability and prosperity throughout \nthe region. South Africa, with its painful history, its tremendous \npromise, and its special moral authority, might have been a powerful \nprotector of the rights of the people of Zimbabwe. Instead, South \nAfrica's leadership has chosen, time and again, to sweep repression and \nabuse in Zimbabwe under the rug and to lend support to a bullying \nPresident who would rather destroy his own country than accept the rule \nof law and let real power rest with the Zimbabwean people. This South \nAfrican choice is perhaps one of the greatest disappointments of all.\n  The people of Zimbabwe have suffered through years of economic and \npolitical catastrophe. Those of us who have watched this decline feel \ntremendous frustration and real sadness as we observe what has happened \nto their country. But we must not surrender to hopelessness, and we \nmust not give up. I continue to be deeply moved by the bravery and \npatriotism of Zimbabwean citizens who resist the state's repression, \neven at enormous personal cost. The United States must remain committed \nto working with them to ensure that the people of Zimbabwe succeed in \ntheir fight for freedom and genuine democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/06/senate-section/article/S3271-4", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3271-S3272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               BOY SCOUTS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor an important \ninstitution in America that has contributed greatly to the quality of \nour youth and is very dear to my heart and the hearts of many here--the \nBoy Scouts of America.\n  For more than 90 years, the Scouts have supported our youth and \nhelped produce some of the best and brightest leaders in our country--\nas many of my colleagues can attest--and I believe we\n\n[[Page S3272]]\n\nmust reaffirm our support for the vital work they have done and \ncontinue to do. Like many of my friends here, I was a Boy Scout many \nyears ago.\n  As a result of the great work they do, I am pleased to be an original \ncosponsor of S. 642, the ``Support Our Scouts Act of 2005'', a bill \nthat reinforces our strong commitment to the Boy Scouts.\n  In fact, I had at one time considered introducing my own bill on this \nvery important matter. However, I was so pleased with the substance of \nthis bill that I was proud to add my name as a cosponsor, and I thank \nmy leader, Senator Frist, for his efforts on this issue.\n  This bill addresses efforts by some groups to prevent federal \nagencies from supporting our Scouts. This bill would remove any doubts \nthat Federal agencies can welcome Scouts and the great work they do \nfrom camping on Federal property to hosting the national jamboree every \n4 years at Fort A.P. Hill.\n  As Senator Frist has said, this legislation will specifically ensure \nthat the Department of Defense can and will continue to provide Scouts \nthe type of support it has provided in the past. Moreover, the Scouts \nwould be permitted equal access to public facilities, forums, and \nprograms that are open to a variety of other youth or community \norganizations.\n  Regrettably, as we all know, in recent years, the Boy Scouts have \ncome under attack from aggressive liberal groups blatantly pushing \ntheir own social agendas.\n  In particular, Scouts have been the target of lawsuits by \norganizations that are more concerned with pushing these liberal \nagendas than sincerely helping our youth.\n  For instance, the Federal government is currently defending a lawsuit \naimed at severing traditional ties between the Boy Scouts and the \nDepartments of Defense and Housing and Urban Development.\n  What is more, Scouts have been excluded by certain State and local \ngovernments from utilizing public facilities, forums and programs, \nwhich are open to other groups.\n  It is certainly disappointing and, frankly, frustrating that we have \nreached a point where groups like the ACLU are far more interested in \ntearing down great institutions like the Boy Scouts than helping foster \ncharacter and values in our young men.\n  I am tired of these tactics. It is very disturbing to me that these \ngroups unabashedly attack organizations, regardless of the good they do \nor the support they have from the vast majority of Americans, simply to \nfurther their own subjective social agendas.\n  I for one, am saddened that the Boy Scouts of America has been the \nmost recent target of these frivolous lawsuits. I reject any arguments \nthat the Boy Scouts is anything but one of the greatest programs for \ncharacter development and values-based leadership training in America \ntoday.\n  We must coalesce around those values that are so important to our \nsociety. We should seek to aid, not impede, groups that promote values \nlike duty to God and country, faith and family, and public service and \nsacrifice, which are deeply ingrained in the oath of every scout.\n  To fail to support such values would allow the very fabric of \nAmerica, which has brought us to this great place in history, to be \ndestroyed.\n  Today, with more than 3.2 million youth members, and more than 1.2 \nmillion adult volunteers, we can certainly say that the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica has positively impacted the lives of generations of boys, \npreparing them to be men of great character and values. Remarkably, Boy \nScout membership since 1910 totals more than 110 million.\n  I am proud to report that in Oklahoma we have a total youth \nparticipation of nearly 75,000 boys, and in Oklahoma City alone, we \nhave about 7,000 adult volunteers.\n  These young men have helped serve communities all over our State with \nprograms like Helping Hands for Heroes, program where Scouts help \nmilitary families whose loved ones are serving overseas. These young \nmen have cut grass, cleaned homes, taken out the garbage and walked \ndogs. What a great service for our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines and their families. Our Boy Scouts have also to served as \nushers and first aid responders at the University of Oklahoma football \ngames for more than 50 years.\n  Notably, Scouts in my State have also shared a long and proud history \nof cooperation and partnership with military installations in Oklahoma.\n  Given all this, I hope my colleagues will join me in defending this \norganization and others like it. We must not be afraid to support our \nyouth and organizations like the Boy Scouts that support them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/06/senate-section/article/S3272-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3272-S3273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        LIVING STRONGER, LONGER\n\n  Mr. KOHL.

Mr. President, Vermont is a State filled with \nextraordinary people who lead extraordinary lives. We take great pride \nthat despite our modest geographical size, Vermont produces people \nwhose voices, commitment and accomplishments transcend our borders and \nleave a lasting impact on the world in which we live.\n  Later this spring, one such Vermonter will be moving on to a new \nchapter in his life. Professor Alan Wertheimer, the John G. McCullough \nProfessor of Political Science at the University of Vermont, will be \nretiring after over 35 years of teaching.\n  Professor Wertheimer is a distinguished scholar, having authored a \nnumber of highly acclaimed books. He has taught thousands of students \nover the years, including many members of my staff. He has been active \nin the affairs of the university and the community. His wife Susan and \ntheir children have been by his side every step of the way.\n  The role of scholars in shaping our society has been debated for \nthousands of years. Professor Wertheimer leaves in his wake a whole \ngeneration of students who he helped grapple with some of the most \ndifficult and complex political and philosophical questions of our \ntime, in a relevant, provocative and memorable style.\n  We in Vermont owe an enormous debt to Professor Wertheimer. He chose \nto grace our State university with his presence for his entire academic \ncareer. Thousands of Vermonters and students from all over the country \nand the world have had their lives enhanced by his dedication and \nscholarship.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a recent article in the Vermont \nQuarterly about Professor Wertheimer be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 What Does Professor Wertheimer Think?\n\n                            (By Kevin Foley)\n\n       Bright as they are, try as they will UVM's first class of \n     Honors College students can't always figure that one out, but \n     they just might learn to define and defend their own thoughts \n     in the process. Inside the Honors Ethics Seminar, where a \n     college's debut is sparked by a venerable professor's swan \n     song.\n       Alan Wertheimer's method is the question, and right now, as \n     a high-wattage October sun pours in and illuminates the \n     buttery walls of his Allen House honors college seminar room, \n     the question is this: ``Is Alan Wertheimer tall?''\n       Well, no, not in modern-day America. But in the 18th \n     century? Among the diminutive Bayaka, a Central African pygmy \n     tribe? Among political theorists, where Wertheimer cuts a \n     large figure because of decades of work illuminating crucial \n     concepts in ethics and law like coercion? Who is to say? \n     Perhaps Wertheimer, who goes about five-seven in his teaching \n     clogs, really is tall.\n       But there's no time for that now. The professor has moved \n     on to another proposition, another question.\n       Wertheimer, who is the John G. McCullough Professor of \n     Political Science to his colleagues and ``Big Al'' to his \n     honors students (offering another data point on the \n     contingency of height), is ending his 37-year career at the \n     University with a beginning: Along with philosopher Don Loeb, \n     Wertheimer, who is retiring at the end of this academic year, \n     developed a two-semester course in ethics that all 90 \n     students enrolled in the new Honors College are taking. (See \n     ``Your Honor,'' below.) The idea is to provide these talented \n     first-year students, a diverse group of future environmental \n     engineers, doctors, English teachers, and software \n     developers, a shared intellectual experience that cuts across \n     every academic discipline and profession.\n       But the universal applicability of ethics--we all, after \n     all, have strong notions of right and wrong, fair and unfair, \n     whether to hand back the overpriced grocery store's \n     miscounted change or keep it--is also a potential trap, at \n     least if you've got a group of 15 very young, very bright, \n     and very vocal students. Loeb puts it this way: ``When you \n     teach particle physics, nobody tries to come in with equally \n     valid opinions on whether mesons have mass.'' Ethics is \n     different: whether or not protestors should mass inspires \n     more passionate opinions than the properties of sub-atomic \n     matter.\n       But in the Honors College, emoting is not thinking. Opinion \n     is not analysis. Instructors need to spark a lively \n     discussion (generally an easy task with this crowd, even when \n     the subject is Plato's Crito), but also to manage it, keeping \n     the conversation aligned with the readings, and helping \n     members of the class interrogate their classmates' ideas, and \n     their own. Voicing your thoughts is great; defending them \n     well is something else entirely. Something better. And \n     putting logic into opinions is where Wertheimer's teaching \n     excels.\n       The professor proffers another statement to the class, ``It \n     is not wrong to download music even if it violates the law.'' \n     The students are supposed to reply true, false, or don't \n     know, but once again, a statement quickly morphs into an \n     interrogatory and the discussion surges. Passions rise--was \n     that a telltale flash of porcelain iPod earbuds in the \n     messenger bag across the table?--as the first-years come to a \n     somewhat sheepish consensus: when it comes to illegally \n     downloading music, fine, true, cool. Wertheimer winces. It is \n     early in the semester, after all. (Or was that a smile?) The \n     seminar soon rumbles on to categorizing a statement about the \n     existence of God. The group opinion here, just barely, is \n     ``don't know.''\n       Questions, questions, questions. But few answers from \n     Wertheimer: none today, in fact. At a different time, in the \n     more relaxed confines of his corner office on the top floor \n     of Old Mill, the professor sits under a Chicago Art Institute \n     poster depicting a bright horseracing scene, and explains \n     why.\n       ``The job is not to answer the question,'' he says. ``It's \n     to get them to think about it more rigorously.''\n\n\n                            AN ORDERLY MIND\n\n       The method is the question: Reading Consent to Sexual \n     Intercourse, Wertheimer's most recent book and a tome far \n     less racy than its title might imply, illustrates the power \n     of carefully chosen, interlocking queries. With a \n     characteristic intellectual flip, Wertheimer's discussion is \n     not so much about the obvious ``when does no mean no?''--\n     that's morally clear, he thinks, or should be--but when does \n     yes really mean yes.\n       Think about that: when does yes really mean yes? It can \n     make your skull vibrate, even before the professor launches \n     into nearly 300 pages of tricky cases and complicated \n     theories. Can a retarded person truly consent to sex? A \n     coerced one? Someone deceived, egregiously or subtly? Someone \n     drunk? And those scenarios are only the beginning.\n       Wertheimer doesn't present a grand theory, an overarching \n     vision, a huge program for social change. That's not his \n     style. Instead, he offers a lot of thorough discussion of \n     complicated cases, and some focused theories for hashing \n     through them. This is not to say that the book lacks moral \n     vision, however. Wertheimer's philosophical peregrinations \n     leave him convinced that sexual deception, a matter largely \n     ignored by the law, needs to be taken more seriously. Why \n     should the law say so much about commercial deceits, when \n     dollars are at stake, and so little about sexual lies, which \n     cost so much emotionally?\n       Lawyers like to say that ``hard cases make bad law,'' and \n     they well may, but Wertheimer's gifts for sustained, precise \n     and dispassionate analysis at least makes them into \n     compelling theories. The books that Wertheimer built his \n     intellectual reputation with, Coercion and Exploitation, take \n     similarly knotty philosophical areas and methodically think \n     through them in ways that are useful to political theorists, \n     philosophers, and lawyers. More than useful: One reviewer \n     said of Exploitation that ``no one interested in the topic \n     will be able to ignore this classic work.'' Wertheimer's \n     scholarly appeal, says his colleague Robert Pepperman Taylor, \n     a fellow political science professor and dean of the Honors \n     College, comes down to the clarity and rigor of his approach.\n       ``These are issues which people tend to wax rhetorical \n     about, but Al brings his extremely clear analytical mind to \n     bear on problems that can raise a lot of heat, a lot of \n     passion, a lot of rhetoric,'' Taylor says. ``He insists that \n     we speak clearly about these things and understand them \n     clearly.''\n       Wertheimer's career, unlike his writing and thinking, \n     hasn't always taken the clearest and most logical path from \n     point A to B. The professor, in fact, attributes many of his \n     professional breakthroughs to good fortune; a fellowship at \n     Princeton led to his first book, a semester spent teaching \n     law at the University of San Diego contributed to his latest \n     book. Now, after stepping down from his full-time duties at \n     UVM, Wertheimer will spend a year at the National Institutes \n     of Health, working on issues of coercion and consent in \n     medical research.\n       ``Things happen,'' he says. ``Truth be told, that's the \n     story of a lot of my career--anybody's career--things happen. \n     Each opportunity led to new opportunities. I suppose it's \n     true that the rich get richer; and, while I'm not exactly \n     rich, I have gotten intellectually richer.''\n\n\n                           SHARING THE WEALTH\n\n       In casual conversation, Wertheimer is genial and amusing, \n     fairly soft-spoken, prone to answer questions after one of \n     the stretches of contemplation that make him a formidable \n     bridge player. In the classroom, he's loud and kinetic (``I \n     think he shocks the kids a little,'' a colleague says, \n     ``because he is passionate--very passionate--about things \n     that maybe they never know anyone cared about'') as he \n     explores and tests his students' logic.\n       ``To make a class of the kind I teach go well, you need at \n     least four or five articulate, bright students,'' Wertheimer \n     explains. ``One or two isn't enough: You need a critical \n     mass. If you have that, you get the others going.''\n       In the honors seminar, Wertheimer has his requisite fluent \n     five and then some, and while the discussions are lively, the \n     conversation isn't always totally satisfying for\n\n[[Page S3274]]\n\n     the students. As the class spent a fall semester wrestling \n     with abortion, inheritance, Plato, and the war in Iraq, their \n     frequent tendency was to try to gauge what Big Al, the \n     compact seer in the front of the room, thought. But after \n     nearly 40 years of undergraduate teaching, Wertheimer is wily \n     about concealing his personal views behind a Socratic screen \n     when it suits his pedagogical purposes.\n       First-year honors student Kevin Ohashi, an electric-haired \n     computer jock who spent his last two years of high school in \n     Kathmandu, says that sphinx-like quality drove some of his \n     classmates nuts. ``Professor Wertheimer loves to play the \n     devil's advocate,'' Ohashi says. ``In class he would take the \n     side that most people weren't on and propose a hypothetical \n     situation that started tilting things his way, and then he \n     might switch again. I thought it was great.''\n       Ohashi says that the result of all those hours of \n     discussion, at least for him, wasn't a messenger bag full of \n     new ideas or a changed sense of moral purpose. Instead, in \n     conversations with friends from the honors floor and \n     elsewhere, he has over time found himself defending his old \n     ideas with more confidence and care. Ohashi's experience \n     echoes a theme common in letters from Wertheimer's former \n     students: They often say things like ``I never knew what \n     it meant to think through a problem before.''\n\n\n                        INTELLECTUAL ATMOSPHERE\n\n       The professor got involved with creating the inaugural \n     honors seminar (hardly a relaxed way to spend one's last year \n     before retirement) because his experiences on the UVM faculty \n     and as a UVM parent left him convinced that the campus needed \n     a more intellectual culture.\n       If we're successful, we'll have created an intellectual \n     environment,'' he says. ``We toyed with the idea of having \n     some variation in content between sections of the first-year \n     seminars, but we dropped that, precisely so that people can \n     engage in a common experience.''\n       Honors students live together, study together, and play \n     together. But the honors experience operates in quieter, more \n     personal ways as well. Rahul Mudannayake, a first-year pre-\n     med honors student from Sri Lanka, says that some of the \n     class readings and discussions have haunted him, especially a \n     particular essay by the famous Princeton philosopher Peter \n     Singer. In the essay, ``Rich and Poor,'' Singer outlines the \n     vast discrepancies between wealth and poverty in the world, \n     and insists that the wealthy have an obligation to assist. \n     (Singer also visited campus to speak and meet with students \n     in the class.) After the end of the fall semester, \n     Mudannayake went home to Sri Lanka, just before the tsunami \n     struck and devastated the country's coastal areas. The \n     student did what he could, helping to ferry food and medicine \n     to affected regions in the days after the tragedy, but the \n     calamity made the ethical arguments he heard in the seminar, \n     especially Singer's, immediate.\n       ``The class has stayed with me in my life,'' Mudannayake \n     says. ``Spending a $1.50 here on a bottle of soda is \n     difficult, considering what I read, what I saw in Sri Lanka. \n     The way I spend my money now is totally different, and \n     Wertheimer and Singer are part of that.''\n       And here is where Al Wertheimer's questions finally end \n     with an answer: A student thinking through the issues and \n     making a personal choice, arrived at with rigor.\n\n\n                               SIDEBAR 1\n\n     Your Honor\n       Students at the University's newest college live and learn \n     together and, proponents of the program say, their debates, \n     excitement and activities will enrich the entire academic \n     atmosphere of campus.\n       It works like this: The campus-wide Honors College accepts \n     about 100 of the most gifted first-year students enrolling at \n     the University, regardless of major, and throws them together \n     for a intense program of social events, a two-semester in-\n     depth seminar class (for now, the ethics course developed by \n     Wertheimer and Loeb), special lectures from big-name \n     intellectuals and, in most cases, living on an all-honors \n     floor at Harris/Millis.\n       By 2007, as successive classes enroll, the program will \n     grow to encompass about 700 students (sophomores can apply \n     for admission; college organizers wanted to give students who \n     don't catch fire academically until they reach UVM a chance \n     to participate in the program, which includes perks like \n     priority class scheduling), supporting and extending existing \n     college-level honors programs. Down the line, honors students \n     will live in the new $60 million University Heights Student \n     Residential Learning Complex, creating a Harvard or Oxford-\n     style ``residential college.''\n\n\n                               SIDEBAR 2\n\n     A Teacher's Tribute\n       On April 15, a daylong symposium in Old Mill will celebrate \n     Alan Wertheimer's intellectual life in a manner befitting the \n     man. Instead of gold watches and encomiums, judges, \n     politicians and scholars will gather for a program on ethics \n     in public life. The event will feature former Vermont Gov. \n     Madeleine Kunin; Vermont Supreme Court Associate Justice John \n     Dooley; and Harvard University's Arthur Applebaum, Dennis \n     Thompson, and Nancy Rosenbaum. The discussion will range from \n     Iraq to judicial activism and gay relationships to \n     presidential campaign ethics. All events are free and open to \n     the public; and, of course, Professor Wertheimer will be \n     there doing what he does, asking questions, listening \n     closely, weighing arguments, thoughtfully negotiating the \n     tricky philosophical waters of politics and life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/06/senate-section/article/S3274-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION OF THE COLLEGE OF ST. CATHERINE\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my heartfelt \ncongratulations to the College of St. Catherine, in St. Paul, MN, on \nthe celebration of its centennial year. St. Catherine is our country's \nlargest Catholic college for women. Its numerous academic achievements \nwould be impressive for a college of any size, but for an institution \nwith fewer than 5,000 students, such accomplishments are downright \nspectacular.\n  Since its founding 100 years ago, the College of St. Catherine has \nexpanded its student body from high school and lower division college \nstudents to include associate, bachelor's and graduate degree \ncandidates in more than 60 fields. In 1937, St. Catherine became the \nfirst Catholic college to be awarded a chapter of the national honor \nsociety, Phi Beta Kappa.\n  Today, the College of St. Catherine continues to distinguish itself \nas a leading institution for women's education. Its ``Women of \nSubstance'' series features lectures and performances of theatre, \nmusic, and dance by female speakers and artists from around the world. \nIn the classroom, the college's new ``Centers for Excellence'' focus on \nthe role of women in such diverse fields as public policy, \nspirituality, and health.\n  Annually, the College of St. Catherine graduates more nurses than any \nother college or university in Minnesota. It is second only to the much \nlarger University of Minnesota in the number of public school teachers \nit has educated and placed in the State's capital city of St. Paul.\n  Along with all of the Minnesotans whose lives have benefited from the \ntalents, professionalism, and leadership of St. Catherine's outstanding \ngraduates, I would like to say thank you. The College of St. \nCatherine's commitment to the highest standards of academic excellence \nand social responsibility have enriched the lives of its students and \nits State's citizens for a century.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize the Miracle League, an organization dedicated to providing \nopportunities for all children to play baseball, regardless of their \nabilities.\n  In 1997, Coach Eddie Bagwell of the Rockdale Youth Baseball \nAssociation in Atlanta, GA, noticed a young boy in a wheelchair on the \nsidelines at all of the youth baseball team's practices and games. The \nenthusiasm and excitement that this boy had for baseball was inspiring \nand it was then that Coach Eddie realized that youth with disabilities \nought to have the same opportunities as others to play ball.\n  In 1988, Coach Bagwell formed the Miracle League, a youth baseball \nleague designed to allow children of all abilities to participate in \nour Nation's favorite pastime--baseball. The league started with 35 \nchildren. The following year, the number more than doubled, with 80 \nchildren clamoring to join a team. Since the Miracle League was \nbreaking new ground, it came up with five rules to play by: every \nplayer bats once each inning; all base runners are safe; every player \nscores a run before the inning is over (last one up gets a home run); \ncommunity volunteers serve as ``buddies'' to assist the players; and \neach team and each player wins every game.\n  As word spread quickly, Miracle League baseball teams were started \nacross the country. In my home State of California, there are now four \nMiracle League teams: in Belmont, Westminster, Ventura County, and \nVisalia. Nationwide, there are more than 50 Miracle League teams.\n  I commend the Miracle League for its philosophy that ``Every Child \nDeserves\n\n[[Page S3275]]\n\na Chance to Play Baseball.'' As the Miracle League begins its Spring \n2005 season, I send my best wishes for a fun and exiting season. Play \nBall!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/06/senate-section/article/S3275-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM McWHORTER COCHRANE\n\n Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, North Carolina lost a loyal son and \na devoted public servant when William McWhorter Cochrane died in \nCharlotte at the end of December. Bill dearly loved his home State and \nwas often referred to as ``North Carolina's third Senator.'' He was a \nman of great knowledge from whom I learned so much over the span of \nmany years, and I feel certain that folks who knew him agree that his \nkindness was abundant and his accomplishments were endless.\n  Bill attended the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, earning a \nbachelor's degree in journalism in 1938 and a law degree in 1941. Upon \ngraduation, he served as the assistant director of the UNC Institute of \nGovernment. In 1941, he joined the U.S. Naval Reserve and in 1942, he \nwas called to active duty and served aboard the minesweeper USS Improve \noff the Mediterranean coast. He then returned to the UNC Institute of \nGovernment. In 1950, he earned an advanced law degree from Yale \nUniversity and became an associate research professor of public law and \ngovernment at UNC.\n  In 1954, when Kerr Scott was elected to the Senate, Bill moved to \nWashington and served as Senator Scott's executive secretary and legal \ncounsel until the Senator's death in 1957. Bill always insisted that he \nintended to return to North Carolina, having originally told Senator \nScott that he would stay for only one year. But, B. Everett Jordan, \nappointed as Scott's successor, urged Bill to stay on in Washington. He \ndid so and served as Senator Jordan's administrative assistant for the \nnext 14 years.\n  Through the years, countless North Carolinians made their way to the \nRussell Building. Those seeking information, advice or a job, found \nBill in his office piled high with documents, copies of the \nCongressional Record, mementos of presidential inaugurations, and \nthousands of index cards. At the service for Bill in Chapel Hill, many \nof those who spoke told of the wise counsel Bill provided and of his \nhelp in finding a position here in Washington. I count myself among \nthose when, as a young woman, I first came to Washington and received \nBill's advice and counsel.\n  During the summer of 1960, I worked in Senator Jordan's office as a \nsummer employee. Knowing that first-hand historical experiences are \nmuch treasured by young people, Bill helped me get a front-row ticket \nto my first national campaign. Because of Bill, I was able to join \nonboard Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee Lyndon B. Johnson's \nwhistle stop tour of the South.\n  Although my staunchly Republican father was concerned about my riding \nthrough the South, especially through my hometown on LBJ's train, I \nknew Bill was giving me, this political science major, an unmatchable \nlearning experience and I was right. I took in every single moment, \nwatching and learning as the Johnson campaign rolled along all over the \nSouth and through my hometown of Salisbury, NC.\n  On the train I met both LBJ and his gracious wife, Lady Bird. Those \nexciting days on the LBJ express were a blur of cheering crowds, \nspeeches and yellow roses that surely ignited my already burning \ninterest in politics. I will forever be grateful to Bill for that \nexperience.\n  Senator Jordan chaired the Senate Rules Committee for many years, but \nwhen he lost his Senate seat in 1972, Bill was appointed staff director \nand majority counsel of the committee. He held that position from 1972-\n80; from 1981-86 he was minority staff director to the committee, and \nfrom 1987 to 1994 he served as senior advisor. For 20 years he was \nstaff director of the Joint Committee on Presidential Inaugurals, \ndirecting the inaugurations of Presidents Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, \nand Ronald Reagan.\n  For 30 years he served on the staff of the Joint Committee on the \nLibrary, and in 1995, James Billington the Librarian of Congress, named \nBill honorary historical consultant to the Library of Congress. Dr. \nBillington said of Bill's service to the library, ``Bill Cochrane was \none of the most knowledgeable, wise and devoted public servants I have \nhad the pleasure of knowing. In a career that spanned three decades, as \nthe senior staffer, institutional memory, and conscience of the Joint \nCommittee on the Library and the Senate Committee on Rules and \nAdministration, Bill was involved in every major library initiative, \nincluding the construction of the Madison Building, the renovation of \nthe Jefferson and Adams Buildings, and an architect of smooth \ntransitions from one Librarian of Congress to the next. His affection \nfor the library and his long record of support for its mission and \nprograms were unparalleled and will be long remembered.''\n  Bill's long and valued service to this body and to his home State \nspeak to a remarkable dedication and devotion for which Bill was \nadmired and respected by all those who knew him. It is fitting that at \nthis time, we in the Senate recognize and remember his service. We will \nsurely miss this wise and caring man, wearing his bow tie and smoking \nhis pipe.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Shirley, and sons, \nWilliam Daniel Cochrane and Thomas McWhorter Cochrane.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/06/senate-section/article/S3275-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NEW MEXICAN CONTRIBUTION TO IED COUNTERMEASURES EQUIPMENT IN IRAQ\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I recognize and praise the \noutstanding contribution of Delta Group Electronics and Canberra Aqulia \nof Albuquerque, NM, and New Mexico State University to ongoing efforts \nto protect our service men and women from improvised explosive devices, \nIEDs, in Iraq.\n  One of the greatest threats to our military personal deployed in the \nglobal war on terrorism is the IED. These devices used by terrorists \nand insurgents in Iraq are the single greatest cause of American \ncasualties. These remote controlled bombs are used to attack American \nforces individually and as part of larger assaults on patrols and \nconvoys.\n  While the up-armoring of military vehicles has provided a partial \nsolution to the problem of combating IEDs, a better solution is to \nprevent IEDs from exploding at all. The IED countermeasures equipment, \nICE, being fielded by the U.S. Marine Corps in Iraq is designed to \naccomplish this goal. ICE will jam the radio signal which is used to \ndetonate many of these devices.\n  Delta Group Electronics and Canberra Aquila are an integral part of \nmaking ICE available to our soldiers in Iraq. Aqulia Technologies Group \nInc. has been located in New Mexico since 1971. Delta Group Electronics \nhas been operating since 1987.\n  These companies have been instrumental in delivering ICE to our Armed \nForces in Iraq at one-third the cost of previous IED countermeasure \nsystems. I thank them for helping to insure that our brave soldiers \nfighting the global war on terror are safer from these kinds of \nattacks. I have no doubt that both of these companies in the future \nwill continue to contribute significantly to the national security of \nour great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/06/senate-section/article/S3275-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3275-S3276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            RWANDAN GENOCIDE\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today marks the 11th anniversary \nof the start of the Rwandan genocide of 1994. Eleven years ago, a \ndeliberate, centrally planned, and organized campaign of mass murder \nand rape was set in motion in Rwanda, and eventually it took the lives \nof some 800,000 men, women, and children. The victims were ethnic \nTutsis and also moderate ethnic Hutus who believed in tolerance and \nresisted the call to participate in madness. In many ways, the entire \ncountry was victimized. Millions were displaced, and shattered state \ninstitutions are still recovering from the devastating loss of skilled \npersonnel. Survivors have struggled to cope with their memories, and \norphans have had to assume adult responsibilities in the wake of \ntragedy. The entire central African region has been violently unstable \never since.\n  As this horror unfolded, the international community, including the \nUnited States, failed the people of Rwanda, and failed to act in the \nface of true evil. The world had said ``never again'' to genocide. And \nthen we abandoned the people of Rwanda to an unspeakable national \nnightmare.\n\n[[Page S3276]]\n\n  Even as the world marks this solemn anniversary, we read ongoing \nreports of the crisis in Darfur, Sudan--a crisis that our President and \nthis Congress has called a genocide. Once more, we confront a reality \nthat exposes the inadequacy of our pledges of ``never again.'' And many \nwill seize the anniversary of the Rwandan tragedy to rally support for \nmore effective action in Darfur, where the international response has \ntoo often been sluggish and inadequate.\n  In the case of Darfur, the United States has spoken boldly. Our \nhumanitarian response, though slow to gear up, is significant and \ncommendable. The efforts of the African Union are laudable. But the \nbottom line is that neither the African Union nor the U.S. has taken \neffective action to protect the people of Darfur. While last week the \nUnited Nations Security Council made some progress on Darfur, much more \nremains to be done, and I do not believe that the United States has \nexerted adequate diplomatic and political effort on behalf of the \npeople of Darfur. We ought to be able to do more--to be more forceful, \nmore focused, more innovative, and more persuasive--to stop genocide.\n  So I applaud those who will work to refocus American attention on \nDarfur today, and I stand with them in their urgent call for a more \neffective response. But today, of all days, we must not forget Rwanda. \nWe cannot pretend that Rwanda's struggles are simply in the past, or \nthat the country exists simply to serve as a cautionary tale. The \npeople of Rwanda still struggle today with efforts to rebuild their \ncountry, with the devastating HIV/AIDS pandemic, with the need for \njustice and accountability, and broadly, with fear. And though it is \ntrue that even the most conscientious policy will never erase the \nfailures of the past, it is also true that we only compound our \nmistakes when we ignore the realities of Rwanda today.\n  Frankly, some of these realities are deeply disturbing. Crushing \npoverty characterizes the economic situation of far too many Rwandans, \nand serious repression is a dominant feature of the country's political \nlife. The most recent State Department Human Rights Report on Rwanda \ncites instances of political disappearances, arbitrary arrest of \nopposition supporters, and harassment of independent journalists. \nAccording to the report, last year the government of Rwanda \n``effectively dismantled independent human rights organizations'' and \nthe Government declined to use its considerable influence with the RCD-\nG faction in Eastern Congo to effectively curtail that group's practice \nof killing, raping, and robbing the people of Eastern Congo on a \nmassive scale.\n  Of course the government of Rwanda and the Rwandan people value order \nand are extremely sensitive to ethnically divisive forces. Rwanda \nremains a traumatized society. But not all dissent is dangerous or \ndivisive, and history teaches us that imposing order alone is not \nenough to guarantee stability and security. Over the long run, \nsuppression and intimidation can undermine security rather than \nprotecting it, forcing healthy debates into illicit channels, and \ncasting doubt on the legitimacy of the prevailing order. We fail to be \ntrue friends to the people of Rwanda when we fail to be honest about \nthese issues, and to raise our voices in support of the civil and \npolitical rights of the Rwandan people.\n  As we remember the past today, we should resolve to pay close \nattention to the present. The people of Rwanda deserve more than our \nregret. They deserve our support for their efforts to build a more \njust, more free, and more secure future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/06/senate-section/article/S3276-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/06/senate-section/article/S3276-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/06/senate-section/article/S3276-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:14 p.m., a message from the House, delivered by Ms. Niland, one \nof its reading clerks, announced that the House has agreed to the \nfollowing concurrent resolution, in which it requests the concurrence \nof the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to amend section 227 of the Communications Act of 1934 \n(47 U.S.C. 227) relating to the prohibition on junk fax transmissions; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Inouye and other \ncolleagues to introduce the ``Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005.'' This \nbill will strengthen existing laws by providing consumers the ability \nto prevent unsolicited fax advertisements and provide greater \nCongressional oversight of enforcement efforts by the Federal \nCommunications Commission (FCC). This bill will also help businesses by \nallowing them to continue to send faxes to their customers in a manner \nthat has proven successful with both businesses and consumers.\n  In July of 2003, the FCC reconsidered its Telephone Consumer \nProtection Act (TCPA) rules and elected to eliminate the ability for \nbusinesses to contact their customers even where there exists an \nestablished business relationship. The effect of the FCC's rule would \nbe to prevent a business from sending a fax solicitation to any person, \nwhether it is a supplier or customer, without first obtaining prior \nwritten consent. This approach, while seemingly sensible, would impose \nsignificant costs on businesses in the form of extensive record \nkeeping. Recognizing the problems created by this rule, the Commission \nhas twice delayed the effective date, with the current extension of \nstay expiring on June 30, 2005.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to preserve the established \nbusiness relationship exception currently recognized under the TCPA. In \naddition, this bill will allow consumers to opt out of receiving \nfurther unsolicited faxes. This is a new consumer protection that does \nnot exist under the TCPA today.\n  We believe that this bipartisan bill strikes the appropriate balance \nin providing significant protections to consumers from unwanted \nunsolicited fax advertisements and preserves the many benefits that \nresult from legitimate fax communications.\n  In the 108th Congress, this legislation passed both the Senate and \nHouse but was not signed into law prior to the adjournment of Congress. \nWe hope that both the Senate and House can pass this legislation in a \ntimely manner, prior to June 30, 2005, when the FCC's stay expires.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 714\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Junk Fax Prevention Act of \n     2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Wind power is a clean, economical, and reliable \nsource of renewable energy abundant on farms and in rural areas of Iowa \nand elsewhere.\n  With this legislation we can help farmers help themselves by \ndeveloping a new source of income, and help the rest of the country in \nthe production of renewable energy. Farmers are ready to take on this \nchallenge. A recent study found that 93 percent of corn producers \nsupport wind energy. They also strongly support the 2002 farm bill's \nhistoric energy title.\n  This regulation complements the farm bill's energy programs and other \nwind power initiatives currently being\n\n[[Page S3282]]\n\nconsidered by this body, and is strongly supported by the American Wind \nEnergy Association and John Deere. Our bill changes Federal tax law to \nmake the section 45 wind production tax credit more widely available to \nfarmers, farm cooperatives, and other investors. Section 45 of the \nFederal tax code provides a tax credit, currently 1.8 cents per \nkilowatt-hour, for electricity produced and sold during the first ten \nyears of the life of a wind turbine. The credit has been \nextraordinarily successful in spurring greater installation of new wind \npower capacity, making this sustainable energy source economically \nfeasible. However, certain barriers have prevented many farmers and \nother investors from qualifying for the credit, thus impeding their \nparticipation.\n  It is time to allow full participation by farmers and other investors \nin this important tax incentive. Our legislation removes barriers by \nmaking two important changes to the tax code.\n  First, under current tax law most losses, deductions, and credits \nfrom passive investments cannot affect wages or other income or reduce \ntaxes on such income. So a farmer who passively invests in wind energy \ncould not use the credits to offset taxes on farm income. This bill \ncreates an exception to passive loss restrictions for an interest in a \nwind facility that qualifies for the section 45 credit. The wind \nfacility's loss or tax credits could then offset the income or taxes \narising from the taxpayer's farming business. Existing law provides an \neven broader exception for oil and gas investments, but in contrast to \nexisting law, our proposed exception for wind investment applies only \nto those with income under $1 million, in order to avoid potential \nwindfalls or abuse.\n  Second, the bill allows cooperatives to invest in qualified wind \nfacilities and pass through the section 45 credits to cooperative \nmembers. This will allow farmers to join together and pool their \nresources in a cooperative and still take advantage of the credit.\n  When we first introduced this bill in the 108th Congress, it also \ncontained a measure providing alternative minimum tax (AMT) relief. \nThis important piece of the equation was incorporated late last year in \nthe American Jobs Creation Act, and passed into law. But there's more \nto be done.\n  The benefits of this legislation are obvious. Increased renewable \nenergy production lessens our dependence on foreign oil, provides \nenvironmental and public health gains, bolsters farm income, creates \njobs and boosts economic growth, especially in rural areas. The Nation \nmust move toward energy security, and domestically produced wind power, \nalong with other forms of renewable energy like biofuels, plays an \nimportant part in this endeavor.\n  I want to thank Senators Dayton, Durbin and Lautenburg for co-\nsponsoring this legislation with me. Their leadership in this area will \nbe instrumental to moving the bill forward. I am hopeful we can pass \nthis legislation soon to help secure a brighter renewable energy future \nfor our Nation's farmers and all citizens.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 715\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to enhance \nservices provided by vet centers, to clarify and improve the provision \nof bereavement counseling by the Department of Veterans Affairs, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Vet Center \nEnhancement Act of 2005.'' This legislation would enhance care and \nservices provided through Vet Centers. Since their establishment over \n25 years ago, Vet Centers have become a safe place in the community \nwhere more and more veterans and their families have turned for \nassistance and services. This legislation would provide resources that \nVet Centers need to serve and reach out to the growing number of \nOperation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) \nveterans and surviving family members.\n  The legislation would allow the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \nto hire an additional 50 Global War on Terror outreach coordinators, \nstrike the three-year authorization provision for these outreach \nworkers, clarify that Vet Centers can provide bereavement counseling to \nfamily members including parents, and provide more funding for the Vet \nCenter program.\n  In February 2004, VA authorized the Vet Center program to hire 50 \nOEF/OIF veterans to conduct outreach to their fellow Global War on \nTerrorism veterans. There are still many OEF/OIF veterans in need of \nreadjustment services, which requires more workers. This legislation \nwould authorize the hiring of 50 additional outreach coordinators to \nreach this underserved population of veterans. In addition, this \nlegislation would also repeal the three-\n\n[[Page S3283]]\n\nyear authorization provision placed on these positions.\n  The number of brave servicemembers who die while defending freedom \ncontinues to rise, leaving many surviving family members in need for \nhelp. Under current law, VA has the authority to provide bereavement \ncounseling to the immediate family. However, it is necessary to clarify \nthat parents of a deceased servicemember qualify for this bereavement \ncounseling and that such care could be provided at Vet Centers. This \nlegislation would make the clarifications.\n  A recent article in the Washington Post detailed a mother's \nexperience after her son was killed in Iraq and how she finally felt \nrelief at an unexpected place, a Vet Center. The article also provided \ninformation concerning the Vet Center bereavement program and discussed \nthe need for clarification of the Vet Center bereavement care program. \nThis article paints a clear picture of the distress that surviving \nfamily members endure as a result of the death of a beloved soldier. I \nask unanimous consent that the text of The Washington Post article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  As the War on Terrorism persists, the number of veterans seeking \nreadjustment counseling and related mental health services through Vet \nCenters will continue to grow. Experts predict that as many as 30 \npercent of those returning servicemembers may need psychiatric care. \nFor these returning servicemembers who have suffered psychological \nwounds, the stigma surrounding these types of wounds creates a barrier \nthat often times prevents them from seeking the care they need. Vet \nCenters, which have licensed mental health professionals, provide a \nmeans to overcome this barrier because of the center's location in the \ncommunity and because veteran staff members can relate to the \nexperiences of the veterans seeking services. In 2004, Vet Centers \ncared for 9,597 OEF/OIF veterans and 2005 projections are that Vet \nCenters will see 12,656 OEF/OIF veterans.\n  Despite increases in the number of veterans coming for care to Vet \nCenters, the budget for the program has remained stagnant. This \nlegislation would authorize funding for the program from $93 million to \n$180 million.\n  We must make the readjustment period for the returning service \nmembers and the surviving family members of deceased servicemembers as \nsmooth as possible.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 24, 2005]\n\n                 VA Program Offers Solace to Civilians\n\n                           (By David Finkel)\n\n       Her son had been killed in Iraq, and Hope Veverka needed \n     someone to talk to.\n       ``It was so horrific, the pain,'' said Veverka, the mother \n     of Army Pfc. Brandon Sapp, who died in August when he drove \n     his vehicle over a remote-controlled bomb. ``I didn't want it \n     to destroy me.''\n       Unable to sleep, Veverka, 45, tried a hospice-based program \n     for dealing with grief. Unable to stop thinking about the \n     person who was the last to see her son while deliberately \n     pushing a detonator, she talked to friends and attended a \n     support group for parents who lost children. All helped \n     somewhat, she says, but it was in an unexpected place--a \n     readjustment center for veterans--where she finally felt some \n     relief.\n       ``These guys, they have served,'' Veverka said of the \n     counselors she sees weekly at the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs' Vet Center near her home in West Palm Beach, Fla. \n     ``They get it. I can just talk, and they understand.''\n       More and more relatives of service members who died are \n     learning the same thing, that because of a new bereavement \n     program, vet centers are not just for veterans anymore. In \n     August 2003, as the number of fatalities in Iraq passed the \n     250 mark, the 206 vet centers across the United States began \n     offering counseling and bereavement services to immediate \n     relatives of anyone in the military to die while on active \n     duty.\n       The program marks the first time that non-veterans have \n     been eligible for a benefit previously restricted to \n     veterans. Before the program began, civilian family members \n     might go to a vet center as part of a living veteran's \n     counseling but had to go elsewhere if they needed counseling \n     of their own.\n       ``It's a big deal,'' said Alfonso Batres, chief of the VA's \n     Office of Readjustment Counseling. ``And the families are so \n     grateful that anything is being done.''\n       The program, which is free and allows unlimited visits, had \n     367 participants in connection with 252 deaths as of Feb. 1. \n     Eighty-six of the 367 were spouses, 119 were mothers, 64 were \n     fathers, 60 were siblings, 37 were children and one was a \n     grandparent.\n       Batres says the numbers would be higher, but privacy \n     concerns prohibit counselors from contacting people to see \n     whether they are interested in getting help. Instead, initial \n     contact must come from the family members.\n       Typically, relatives are referred to the program by \n     military casualty-assistance officers, who are the ones to \n     notify them of the death of their loved ones. A civilian \n     organization called TAPS, the Tragedy Assistance Program for \n     Survivors, which offers around-the-clock grief counseling \n     and peer support--but does not have professionally trained \n     counselors as at a vet center--also refers people to the \n     program.\n       ``It's really, really significant,'' TAPS founder and \n     chairman Bonnie Carroll said of the VA's decision to treat \n     family members. ``From our perspective, it has just been \n     revolutionary.''\n       Batres says that implementing the program has not been \n     problem-free. Especially in the early months, he says, some \n     counselors complained that they already had more to do than \n     they could handle. Others were concerned that expanding the \n     centers' mandate to non-veterans could create a bad \n     precedent.\n       The provisional status of the program has also been \n     unsettling to some. Batres says he had hoped to get the \n     program authorized by Congress, which would have given it a \n     sense of permanence, but instead it was approved as an \n     unfunded initiative at the discretion of the secretary of the \n     VA.\n       Nonetheless, Batres says, as the months have gone by, the \n     nature of the work has changed the misgivings of his staff \n     into a shared sense of mission. ``It's akin to going to a \n     disaster site'' is how he describes the work. ``This is a \n     death site. It's almost like going into a sacred place.''\n       Joe Griffis, a counselor at the vet center in Lake Worth, \n     Fla., agrees that this first venture into treating non-\n     veterans is worthwhile. ``We're here to help the veteran,'' \n     he said, ``and when they've been killed, it's the closest we \n     can get to them to give them that service.''\n       Griffis says he has treated family members connected to \n     five deaths, four of which occurred from enemy fire and one \n     by suicide.\n       ``They come in with grief, with a great sense of loss, \n     often with guilt feelings about what they could have done, \n     angry at the government, angry at God, angry at the child \n     himself,'' he said of his clients, most of whom have been \n     parents.\n       Rather than diagnosing a condition, he says, his goal is to \n     ``let them ventilate all of their feelings. Their anger. \n     Their grief. Their sadness. No matter what it's about. And \n     let them have a feeling of relief before they walk out of the \n     session.''\n       Veverka, who is one of Griffis's clients, says that is \n     exactly what has happened to her in her weekly sessions.\n       ``There was something lacking,'' she said of the support \n     groups she attended in the first days after her son's death, \n     where she found herself undifferentiated from the parents \n     whose child had died of leukemia and the parents whose child \n     had been killed crossing a street. ``It was only addressing \n     half of my emotions. I needed something with the military.''\n       Try the vet center, someone suggested.\n       ``So I went,'' she said of a place so familiar to her now \n     that counselors have hung a photograph of her son for her to \n     see every time she walks in the door, ``and it ended up being \n     the door I needed.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. McConnell, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Corzine, and Ms. \n        Cantwell):\n  S. 718. A bill to amend title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \nStreets Act of 1968 to provide standards and procedures to guide both \nState and local law enforcement agencies and law enforcement officers \nduring internal investigations, interrogation of law enforcement \nofficers, and administrative disciplinary hearings, and to ensure \naccountability of law enforcement officers, to guarantee the due \nprocess rights of law enforcement officers, and to require States to \nenact law enforcement discipline, accountability, and due process laws; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the State and Local Law \nEnforcement Discipline, Accountability, and Due Process Act of 2005, \nalong with Senator Specter, Senator McConnell, Senator Chambliss, \nSenator Dayton, Senator Murray, Senator Corzine, and Senator Cantwell.\n  These are trying times for the men and women on our front lines who \nprovide our domestic security and public safety--our Nation's law \nenforcement personnel. In fact, our men and women in blue are facing \nwhat I have called a perfect storm. First, they are being called upon \nto undertake more responsibilities than ever before. They are being \nrequired to undertake homeland security duties that weren't required \nbefore September 11, and, at the same time, the FBI is reprogramming \nits field agents from crime to terrorism\n\n[[Page S3284]]\n\ncases. While I don't disagree that this shift in resources is \nappropriate, it undoubtedly leaves a gap in law enforcement efforts to \ncombat drugs and crime, and State and local agencies must fill this \ngap. At the same time, budget shortages at the local level are forcing \npersonnel lay-offs, an increasing use of overtime to meet demand, and \nthe forced elimination of critical crime prevention programs. Local law \nenforcement is struggling to keep up with service calls. To add insult \nto injury, Federal assistance for State and local law enforcement has \nbeen reduced by billions over the last 2 years--with the proposed \nelimination of the COPS hiring program--a proven initiative that has \nbeen hailed as one of the keys to the crime-drop of the nineties. Quite \nsimply, we are asking law enforcement to do more with less, and I \nbelieve that public safety is being compromised as a result of \nCongress's unfortunate choices on the Federal budget.\n  We may argue about the Federal responsibility to provide financial \nassistance to State and local law enforcement, however, few will \ndispute the sacrifices that our men and women in law enforcement make \nfor our nation. Indeed, they face one of the most difficult work \nenvironments imaginable--an average of 165 police officers are killed \nin the line of duty every year. Our Nation's law enforcement officers \nput themselves in harms way on a daily basis to ensure the safety of \ntheir fellow citizens and the domestic security of our Nation. \nNevertheless, many times these brave officers do not receive basic \nrights if they become involved in internal police investigations or \nadministrative hearings. According to the National Association of \nPolice Organizations, ``[i]n roughly half of the states in this \ncountry, officers enjoy some legal protections against false \naccusations and abusive conduct, but hundreds of thousands of officers \nhave very limited due process rights and confront limitations on their \nexercise of other rights, such as the right to engage in political \nactivities.'' Similarly, the Fraternal Order of Police notes that, \n``[i]n a startling number of jurisdictions throughout this country, law \nenforcement officers have no procedural or administrative protections \nwhatsoever; in fact, they can be, and frequently are, summarily \ndismissed from their jobs without explanation. Officers who lose their \ncareers due to administrative or political expediency almost always \nfind it impossible to find new employment in public safety. An \nofficer's reputation, once tarnished by accusation, is almost \nimpossible to restore.''\n  The legislation that we introduce today, which is endorsed by the \nFraternal Order of Police and of the National Association of Police \nOrganizations, seeks to provide officers with certain basic protections \nin those jurisdictions where such workplace protections are not \ncurrently provided. First, this bill allows law enforcement officials \nto engage in political activities when they are off-duty. Second, it \nprovides standards and procedures to guide State and local law \nenforcement agencies during internal investigations, interrogations, \nand administrative disciplinary hearings. Additionally, it calls upon \nStates to develop and enforce these disciplinary procedures. The bill \nwould preempt State laws which confer fewer rights than those provided \nfor in the legislation, but it would not preempt any State or local \nlaws that confer rights or protections that are equal to or exceed the \nrights and protections afforded in the bill. For example, my own State \nof Delaware has a law enforcement officers' bill of rights, and those \nprocedures would not be impacted by the provisions of this bill.\n\n  This bill will also include important provisions that will enhance \nthe ability of citizens to hold their local police departments \naccountable. The legislation includes provisions that will ensure \ncitizen complaints against police officers are investigated and that \ncitizens are informed of the outcome of these investigations. The bill \nbalances the rights of police officers with the rights of citizens to \nraise valid concerns about the conduct of some of these officers. In \naddition, I have consulted with constitutional experts who have opined \nthat the bill is consistent with Congress' powers under the Commerce \nClause and that it does not run afoul of the Supreme Court's Tenth \nAmendment jurisprudence.\n  I would also like to note that I understand the objections that many \nmanagement groups, including the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice, have to this measure. I have discussed this with them, and I've \npledged that their views will be heard and considered as this bill is \ndebated in Congress. It is my view that we must bridge this gap. \nWithout a meeting of the minds between police management and union \nofficials, the enactment of a meaningful law enforcement officers' bill \nof rights will be difficult. Law enforcement officials are facing \nunprecedented challenges, and management and labor simply must work \ntogether on this issue and the numerous other issues facing the law \nenforcement community.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senators Specter, McConnell, Chambliss, \nDayton, Murray, Corzine, Cantwell, and me in providing all of the \nNation's law enforcement officers with the basic rights they deserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 718\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the rights of law enforcement officers to engage in \n     political activity or to refrain from engaging in political \n     activity, except when on duty, or to run as candidates for \n     public office, unless such service is found to be in conflict \n     with their service as officers, are activities protected by \n     the first amendment of the United States Constitution, as \n     applied to the States through the 14th amendment of the \n     United States Constitution, but these rights are often \n     violated by the management of State and local law enforcement \n     agencies;\n       (2) a significant lack of due process rights of law \n     enforcement officers during internal investigations and \n     disciplinary proceedings has resulted in a loss of confidence \n     in these processes by many law enforcement officers, \n     including those unfairly targeted for their labor \n     organization activities or for their aggressive enforcement \n     of the laws, demoralizing many rank and file officers in \n     communities and States;\n       (3) unfair treatment of officers has potentially serious \n     long-term consequences for law enforcement by potentially \n     deterring or otherwise preventing officers from carrying out \n     their duties and responsibilities effectively and fairly;\n       (4) the lack of labor-management cooperation in \n     disciplinary matters and either the perception or the \n     actuality that officers are not treated fairly detrimentally \n     impacts the recruitment of and retention of effective \n     officers, as potential officers and experienced officers seek \n     other careers, which has serious implications and \n     repercussions for officer morale, public safety, and labor-\n     management relations and strife and can affect interstate and \n     intrastate commerce, interfering with the normal flow of \n     commerce;\n       (5) there are serious implications for the public safety of \n     the citizens and residents of the United States which \n     threatens the domestic tranquility of the United States \n     because of a lack of statutory protections to ensure--\n       (A) the due process and political rights of law enforcement \n     officers;\n       (B) fair and thorough internal investigations and \n     interrogations of and disciplinary proceedings against law \n     enforcement officers; and\n       (C) effective procedures for receipt, review, and \n     investigation of complaints against officers, fair to both \n     officers and complainants; and\n       (6) resolving these disputes and problems and preventing \n     the disruption of vital police services is essential to the \n     well-being of the United States and the domestic tranquility \n     of the Nation.\n       (b) Declaration of Policy.--Congress declares that it is \n     the purpose of this Act and the policy of the United States \n     to--\n       (1) protect the due process and political rights of State \n     and local law enforcement officers and ensure equality and \n     fairness of treatment among such officers;\n       (2) provide continued police protection to the general \n     public;\n       (3) provide for the general welfare and ensure domestic \n     tranquility; and\n       (4) prevent any impediments to the free flow of commerce, \n     under the rights guaranteed under the United States \n     Constitution and Congress' authority thereunder.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to extend Corridor O of the Appalachian Development \nHighway System from its currnet southern terminus at I-68 near \nCumberland to Corridor H, which stretches from Weston, West Virginia, \nto Strasburg, Virginia; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nadd a 35.5 mile segment of a proposed new highway, extending south of \nInterstate 68 near Cumberland, MD to Corridor H in West Virginia, to \nthe Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS). Joining me in co-\nsponsoring this legislation is my colleague Senator Mikulski.\n  The development of a north-south Appalachian highway corridor has \nlong been a priority for elected officials, community leaders and \ncitizens in the Potomac Highlands region of western Maryland, West \nVirginia and neighboring Pennsylvania counties. At least two Maryland \nState economic development task forces over the last decade have \nidentified a north-south corridor as their leading priority for the \nregion. In order to help determine the need, potential alignments as \nwell as the projected economic benefits and the social, transportation \nand environmental impacts of upgrading north-south corridors, six years \nago, I helped secure a grant from the Federal Highway Administration to \nsupport a multi-state study. That study was completed in 2001 and \nidentified two corridors as having the greatest potential for \nbenefiting Appalachian economic development the US 219 Corridor in the \nnorth from I-68 in Maryland to the Pennsylvania Turnpike and the US 220 \nCorridor in south from Corridor H in West Virginia to I-68 in Maryland. \nThe study also found that upgrading US 220 South of Interstate 68 would \nsupport the largest number of potential new jobs, 7,800-8,600 jobs, \nwith the highest relative growth--19 percent--of any of the corridors \nand have fewer impacts than the alternatives.\n  While US 220 north of I-68 is part of the ADHS, the segment south of \nthe interstate is not currently part of the system, although it serves \nAppalachia. This area in Allegany County, MD--a county that has \nexperienced some of the highest rates of unemployment and poverty in \nthe State--has been targeted for economic development and job growth in \nthe ``One Maryland'' economic development program. Major employers in \nthe area--American Woodmark, Aliant Techsystems and MeadWestvaco--as \nwell as others that might look at this region for the location of their \nnext plant currently depend on a two-lane roadway running through \nresidential neighborhoods and commercial areas. The area is well served \nby an important east and west corridor, I-68 (ADHS Corridor E), but \nNorth South transportation is inadequate and hampers the economic \nprosperity potential of Allegany and Garrett Counties and many of the \nsurrounding Pennsylvania and West Virginia communities.\n  Over the past four years, and with additional funding provided by the \nCongress in the Fiscal 2003 Transportation Appropriations bill, \nMaryland and West Virginia have been undertaking a detailed project \nplanning phase of the 35.5 mile segment of US 220 south that was \nrecommended in the feasibility study. Improvements which have been \nproposed include a four-lane divided highway, most of which would be on \na new alignment, with at-grade intersections. Fifteen miles of the \nproposed road improvements are in Maryland and 20.5 miles in West \nVirginia.\n  These upgrades would increase safety and alleviate traffic congestion \nbetween Cumberland and Keyser and provide an important link to the 83.2 \nmiles of Appalachian Development Highways in Maryland and in the system \nof 28 corridors throughout the 13 Appalachian States. The corridor \nwould interconnect several important ADHS corridors including the East-\nWest Corridors P in Pennsylvania, E (I-68) in Maryland & West Virginia, \nH in West Virginia and Virginia along with the ADHS North-South \nCorridor O and Corridor N from Pennsylvania to the North. Currently ARC \nCorridors O & N dead end at I-68, and the closest interstate quality \nroad continuing south is I-81 seventy miles east, or I-79 that is \nseventy miles to the west. The new Appalachian highway would also \nprovide important linkages to the bi-State, Maryland and West Virginia, \nGreater Cumberland Airport, rail facilities in the area, and population \ncenters of Cumberland, Maryland, Keyser, West Virginia, Romney, West \nVirginia, and Moorefield, West Virginia.\n  The Congress recognized the need to help bring the Appalachian Region \ninto the mainstream of the American economy in 1965 when it created the \nAppalachian Region Commission and authorized the Appalachian \nDevelopment Highway System. Now, some 40 years later, with the original \nADHS more than 85 percent complete or under construction, it is time to \nprovide critical linkages to the east-west ADHS corridors, population \ncenters, other inter-modal facilities such as air and rail, and the \nexisting interstate system and to further boost the region's \nopportunity to advance towards economic parity. I hope that the \nCongress will swiftly approve this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VITTER:\n  S. 721.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reduce the tax on beer to \nits pre-1991 level. In 1990, Congress raised taxes on luxury items like \nexpensive cars, fur coats, jewelry, yachts and private airplanes and \ndoubled the Federal excise tax on beer.\n  This was the single largest tax increase on beer in American history \nand resulted in some 60,000 people losing\n\n[[Page S3290]]\n\ntheir jobs in brewing, distributing, retailing and related industries. \nThe tax burden on beer is higher than the average consumer good in the \nAmerican economy, an astounding 44 percent of its retail price. As a \nresult of this tax increase the Government collects approximately seven \ntimes more in beer taxes than the Nation's brewers make in profits.\n  The doubling of the beer excise tax in 1990 was regressive, and \ntherefore unfair, because it hits lower income taxpayers the hardest. \nMost beer consumers have household incomes below $40,000. Regular beer \ndrinkers--Americans raising a family--are the people most affected by \nthe increase in the Federal excise tax on beer. Lowering the beer tax \nmeans more money in the pockets of these hard-working men and women.\n  The beer excise tax was first enacted as an emergency measure to help \nfinance the Civil War. It is an anachronism in our tax code. Since its \nenactment, dozens of corporate and payroll taxes have been imposed on \nbrewers just as they have on other businesses. Yet the beer excise tax \nremains. A rollback of just the 1990 beer tax increase would also help \nmaintain good-paying American manufacturing jobs and will create new \nopportunities and a boost to the economy. The U.S. system of alcohol \nbeverage control has been the maintenance of a domestic presence for \nthe industry with independent supplier, wholesale and retail tiers. \nBrewers, wholesalers and retailers are heavily regulated and to the \nextent the U.S. maintains a strong domestic industry, the Federal, \nState and local agencies will continue to ensure accountability and \nresponsible business practices.\n  The brewing industry has a major presence in many U.S. cities and \nprovides a significant source of manufacturing jobs. The industry \ndirectly and indirectly accounts for close to 2.5 million jobs \nnationwide--a reduction of the beer tax would help brewers maintain or \ngrow their workforce. Brewing, wholesaling and retail combined \ncontribute over 41,000 jobs to the economy of my home State of \nPennsylvania.\n  All of the other luxury taxes enacted in 1990 have been repealed. Yet \nthe beer tax increase remains in place. It is time to roll back the \nFederal excise tax increase on beer and provide another measure of tax \nrelief to America's working men and women. The Federal Government will \nstill collect almost $3.7 billion in excise taxes and the industry will \npay an additional $21 billion in Federal, State, and local taxes. This \nis a modest and reasonable measure of tax relief to a significant \nAmerican industry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Bond, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 723. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nsmall businesses to set up simple cafeteria plans to provide nontaxable \nemployee benefits to their employees, to make changes in the \nrequirements for cafeteria plans, flexible spending accounts, and \nbenefits provided under such plans or accounts, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the SIMPLE \nCafeteria Plan Act of 2005'' to increase the access to quality, \naffordable health care for millions of small business owners and their \nemployees. I am pleased that my good friend from Missouri, Senator \nBond, as well as my good friend Senator Bingaman from New Mexico have \nagreed to co-sponsor this critical piece of legislation.\n  Regrettably, our Nation's healthcare system is in the midst of a \ncrisis. Each year, more and more Americans are unable to purchase \nhealth insurance, and there are no signs that things are improving. As \nevidence, the United States Census Bureau estimates that nearly 47 \nmillion people did not have health insurance coverage for all of 2002. \nSadly, this number rose from 41.2 million uninsured persons in 2001--a \n14.6 percent increase.\n  As if these numbers on a national scale are not alarming enough, the \nresults are even more troubling when we look specifically at the small \nbusiness sector of our economy. Analysis conducted by the Employee \nBenefit Research Institute, a nonpartisan group dedicated to ensuring \nthat all workers have access to affordable health care, suggests that \nthe highest rates of uninsured occur among either self-employed workers \nor workers whose employer employees fewer than 25 persons. When \ncompared to workers in firms that employ 1,000 or more employees, where \njust 12.6 percent of those workers do not have health insurance, it \nbecomes clear that the majority of uninsured Americans work for small \nenterprises. Clearly, these numbers suggest that there is a direct \ncorrelation among those persons who do not have health insurance and \nthe size of their employer.\n  The question, then, is why are our Nation's small businesses, which \nare our country's job creators and the true engine of our national \neconomy, so disadvantaged when it comes to purchasing health insurance.\n  The main reason that small business owners are not able to offer \ntheir employees health insurance is because many small business owners \nare able to pay only a portion of their employees' health insurance \npremiums or, even worse, cannot afford to provide any health insurance \nor other employee benefits at all. As a result, many small business \nworkers must acquire health insurance from the private sector rather \nthan the work place--an unfair, and far more expensive alternative.\n  Clearly, we have a problem on our hands. While we can debate among \nourselves why this crisis exists and how we ended up here, what is not \nopen for debate is that we need to start identifying ways to fix the \nsystem because it is simply unconscionable to do nothing while more and \nmore Americans find themselves without health care.\n  As you know, I re-introduced a bill earlier this year that will go a \nlong ways towards improving the situation by creating Associated Health \nPlans for small businesses. In general, this bill would permit small \nbusinesses throughout the country to band together for purposes of \nobtaining an insurance quote from an insurance company. By pooling \nthese businesses together, they would pay lower premiums because of the \nincreased risk pool.\n  Again, this bill would increase the number of Americans that would be \nable to afford health insurance because their insurance premiums would \nbe based on a more reasonable number. The bill I am introducing today \nbuilds upon this and goes a step further by putting more small business \nowners and their employees on a level playing field when compared to \nworkers of a larger company.\n  Specifically, many large companies and even the Federal government \nenable their employees to purchase health insurance and other qualified \nbenefits with taxfree dollars. Larger companies are able to do this by \nqualifying for certain employee benefit delivery mechanisms under the \ntax code.\n  One such delivery mechanism is a cafeteria plan. As the name \nsuggests, cafeteria plans are programs whereby employers offer their \nemployees the opportunity to purchase certain qualified benefits of \ntheir choosing. The key here is that the employer provides the \nopportunity for the employee to purchase the benefit, and the employee \nis then free to chose whether to participate and which benefits to buy. \nUnder current law, qualified benefits include health insurance, \ndependent-care reimbursement, and life and disability insurance. \nTypically, employer contributions, employee contributions, or a \ncombination of the two fund these plans.\n  Cafeteria plans offer valuable benefits to employees and are popular \nfor many reasons. Specifically, they offer employees great flexibility \nin selecting their desired benefits while enabling them to disregard \nthose benefits that do not fit their particular needs. Participating \nemployees are also able to exclude any wages that they contribute to a \ncafeteria plan from their Federal taxable income, Social Security, and \nMedicare, which means they are using more valuable pre-tax dollars to \nbuy these benefits. Moreover, the employees are usually purchasing \nthese benefits at a lower cost because employers are oftentimes able to \nobtain a reduced price for the benefits through a group rate after they \nestablish a cafeteria plan.\n  Cafeteria plans also provide employers with valuable benefits, most \nnotably as a recruiting tool. It certainly stands to reason that if \nmore small business owners are able to offer their employees the chance \nto enjoy a variety of employee benefits, these owners\n\n[[Page S3291]]\n\nthen will be more likely to attract, recruit, and retain more talented \nworkers, which will ultimately increase the firm's business output. Too \noften, we hear that small businesses loose skilled employees to larger \ncompanies simply because a big firm is able to offer a more attractive \nbenefit package. Given that small businesses are responsible for a \nmajority of the new jobs created in this country, we need to reverse \nthat trend, and this bill will go a long way in rectifying this \ninequity.\n  Clearly, cafeteria plans play a critical role in our Nation's health \ncare system and economy in general. The problem, though, is that in \norder for companies to qualify for the tax benefits that cafeteria \nplans provide, they must satisfy strict nondiscrimination rules under \nthe tax code. These rules exist to ensure that the benefits offered to \nhighly compensated employees are offered to non-highly compensated \nemployees as well. The rules also strive to ensure that non-highly \ncompensated employees in fact receive a substantial portion of the \nbenefits provided under the plan.\n  Now I want to be clear when I say that these non-discrimination rules \nserve a legitimate purpose. Indeed, we need to be sure that employers \nare not able to game the tax system by implementing these cafeteria \nplans, and that the cafeteria plans that qualify for preferential tax \ntreatment are used by a majority of the employees in the company.\n  However, what I find to be unacceptable is the way the tax code \nattempts to implement this policy under the existing rules. Currently, \nmany small businesses simply cannot satisfy these mechanical rules \nbecause, through no fault of their own, they have relatively few \nemployees and a high proportion of owners or highly compensated \nindividuals. As such, were a small business to create a cafeteria plan \nand violate the non-discrimination rules, certain workers within the \ncompany would be subject to a penalty and would be required to include \na substantial portion of their contributions in their taxable income.\n  Consequently, many small companies simply do not even bother to \nimplement a cafeteria plan for fear that they will violate the non-\ndiscrimination rules. According to the Employer's Council on Flexible \nCompensation, while 38.36 million U.S. workers had access to cafeteria \nplans in 1999, only 19 percent of those workers were employees of small \nbusinesses.\n  To improve the current situation, the bill I am introducing today \nwill allow and encourage more small businesses to offer employees the \nopportunity to purchase health insurance with tax-free dollars just as \nlarger companies and the federal government do. My bill accomplishes \nthis by creating a Simple Cafeteria Plan, which is modeled after the \nSavings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) pension plan. As \nwith the SIMPLE pension plan, a small business employer that is willing \nto make a minimum contribution for all employees or who is willing to \nmatch contributions will be permitted to waive the non-discrimination \nrules that currently prevent these owners from otherwise offering these \nbenefits. This structure has worked extraordinarily well in the pension \narea with little risk of abuse, and I am confident that it will be just \nas successful when it comes to broad-based benefits offered through \ncafeteria plans.\n\n  Under the SIMPLE Cafeteria Plan, small companies will not have to \nstruggle with satisfying the burdensome non-discrimination rules that \noften prevent them from offering valuable employee benefits to their \nworkers. As a result, more small business employers will be able to \nprovide their workers with the employee benefits that are often \nreserved for larger employers and that are otherwise unavailable \nbecause of the non-discrimination rules.\n  In addition my bill will expand the types of qualified benefits that \nwill be able to be offered under ALL cafeteria plans--both those that \nqualify under existing law as well as the new SIMPLE cafeteria plans \nthat will be created. Specifically, my bill modifies the rules \ngoverning benefits offered under cafeteria plans, such as flexible \nspending accounts and dependent-care assistance plans that many larger \nemployers offer their employees. These modifications will increase the \nlikelihood that employees of small businesses will utilize the \navailable benefits and that will increase the benefits provided for all \nemployees.\n  For example, current rules impose a ``use it or lose it'' requirement \nwith respect to flexible spending arrangement contributions. This means \nthat the employee forfeits any money he or she contributes to the \naccount but does not use during the plan. My bill would change that \nrule and allow employees to carry over up to $500 remaining in their \naccount to the next plan year. The bill would also permit employees to \ncarry-over any unused funds to a retirement account such as a 401(k) \nplan.\n  In either case, any carried over contributions will reduce the amount \nthat the employee otherwise would be able to contribute to the spending \narrangement in the following year so that the carry-over option will \nnot produce a greater dollar benefit for any employee. As a result, \nmore employees are likely to participate in these spending arrangements \nbecause they will ultimately be able to use any funds that they \ncontribute without any fear of forfeiting them simply because the funds \nwere not used in the year of contribution.\n  Additionally, this legislation modifies rules that pertain to \nemployer-provided, dependent-care assistance plans. First, it would \nincrease the current $5,000 annual contribution limitation of these \nplans to $10,000 if the contributing employee claims two or more \ndependents on his or her tax return. This increase is significant \nbecause it will provide these taxpayers with an opportunity to care for \nnot only their children but also an elderly family member who is a \ndependent of an employee--a scenario that will become increasingly more \nlikely as the current baby-boomer generation continues to age.\n  Second, this bill would amend the current non-discrimination rules \nthat dependent-care assistance plans must satisfy. As is often the case \nwith the majority of small business owners who cannot, through any \nfault of their own, satisfy the non-discrimination rules for \nestablishing a cafeteria plan, these rules often prevent the owner from \noffering this valuable benefit to their employees. To remedy this \ninequity, this bill would change the current mechanical thresholds such \nthat more small businesses can provide dependent-care assistance plans \nto their employees but in a manner that does not encourage the type of \nabuse that the non-discrimination rules are intended to prevent.\n  Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy. According \nto the Small Business Administration, small businesses represent 99 \npercent of all employers, employ 51 percent of the private-sector \nworkforce, and contribute 51 percent of the private-sector output. It \nis therefore critical that small businesses owners are able to offer \ntheir employees the benefits that cafeteria plans provide so that more \nof our nation's workers have the opportunity to purchase quality \nhealthcare and provide security for their families.\n  The ``SIMPLE Cafeteria Plan Act of 2005'' achieves those objectives, \nand it does so in a manner that the employers and employees are able to \nafford. Although the use of pre-tax dollars to acquire these benefits \nreduces current federal revenues, the opportunity to provide small \nbusiness employees these same benefits to workers and their families \nrather than relying on the public sector more than justifies this \nminimal investment. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this important legislation as we work with you to enact this \nbill into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 723\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce with \nSenators Durbin and Salazar a very important piece of legislation, \n``The No Child Left Behind Reform Act.'' This legislation makes three \nbasic changes to the No Child Left Behind Act which was signed into law \nin January of 2002.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act received the support of this Senator and \neighty-six of our colleagues. Like most, if not all, of our colleagues \nwho supported this bill, I supported it because I care about improving \nthe quality of education in America for all of our children. I believed \nthat this law would help to achieve that goal by establishing more \nrigorous standards for measuring student achievement, by helping \nteachers do a better job of instructing students, and last but not \nleast, by providing the resources desperately needed by our schools for \neven the most basic necessities to help put the reforms we passed into \nplace.\n  Regrettably, the high hopes that I and many others had for this law \nhave not been realized. The law is being implemented by the \nAdministration in a manner that is inflexible, unreasonable and \nunhelpful to students. Furthermore, the law is not only failing to help \nteachers do their best in the classroom, it also reflects, along with \nother Administration policies and pronouncements, a neglect and even \nhostility towards members of the teaching profession.\n  Worse still, the Administration's promise of sufficient resources to \nimplement No Child Left Behind's much needed reforms is a promise that \nhas yet to be kept. Indeed, the current budget proposed by the Bush \nAdministration underfunds No Child Left Behind by $12 billion. Since \npassage three years ago, the law has been funded at a level that is \nmore than $39 billion below what was promised when the President signed \nthe Act into law.\n  As a result of the failures of the current Administration to fulfill \nits commitment to our nation's school children under this law, those \nchildren and their teachers are today shouldering new and noteworthy \nhardships. Throughout the State of Connecticut, for example, students, \nteachers, administrators and parents are struggling to implement \nrequirements that are often confusing, inflexible and unrealistic. And \nthey are struggling to do so without the additional resources they were \npromised to put them into place. According to a recent report put \ntogether by the Connecticut State Department of Education, through \n2008, it will cost the State of Connecticut $41.6 million over and \nabove what the Federal Government is going to supply to meet the \nrequirements of No Child Left Behind. Of that $41.6 million, $8 million \nwill need to spent on testing alone. That is a significant amount of \nmoney--a significant amount of money that is going to fall on \nConnecticut taxpayers trying to simultaneously pay for their mortgage, \nbasic health care and the rising cost of their children's tuition.\n  As I have said on numerous occasions in the past, resources without \nreforms are a waste of money. By the same token, reforms without \nresources are a false promise--a false promise that has left students \nand their teachers grappling with new burdens and little help to bear \nthem.\n\n  The legislation I am introducing today proposes to make three changes \nto the No Child Left Behind Act. These changes will ease current \nburdens on our students, our teachers and our administrators without \ndismantling the fundamental underpinnings of the law.\n  First, the No Child Left Behind Reform Act will allow schools to be \ngiven credit for performing well on measures other than test scores \nwhen calculating student achievement. Test scores are an important \nmeasure of student knowledge. However, they are not the only measure. \nThere are others. These include dropout rates, the number of students \nwho participate in advanced placement courses, and individual student \nimprovement over time. Unfortunately, current law does not allow \nschools to use these additional ways to gauge school success in a \nconstructive manner. Additional measures can only be used to further \nindicate how a school is failing, not how a school is succeeding. This \nlegislation will allow schools to earn credit for succeeding.\n  Second, the No Child Left Behind Reform Act will allow schools to \ntarget school choice and supplemental services to the students that \nactually demonstrate a need for them. As the current law is being \nimplemented by the Administration, if a school is in need of \nimprovement, it is expected to offer school choice and supplemental \nservices to all students--even if not all students have demonstrated a \nneed for them. That strikes me as a wasteful and imprecise way to help \na school improve student performance. For that reason, this legislation \nwill allow schools to target resources to the students that actually \ndemonstrate that they need them. Clearly, this is the most efficient \nway to maximize their effect.\n  Finally, the No Child Left Behind Reform Act introduces a greater \ndegree of reasonableness to the teacher certification process. As it is \nbeing implemented, the law requires teachers to be ``highly qualified'' \nto teach every subject that they teach. Certainly none of us disagree \nwith this policy as a matter of principle. But as a matter of practice, \nit is causing confusion and hardship for teachers, particularly \nsecondary teachers and teachers in small school districts. For example, \nas the law is being implemented by the Administration, a high school \nscience teacher could be required to hold degrees in biology, physics \nand chemistry to be considered highly qualified. In small schools where \nthere may be only one 7th or 8th grade teacher teaching all subjects, \nthese teachers could similarly be required to hold degrees in every \nsubject area.\n  Such requirements are unreasonable at a time when excellent teachers \nare increasingly hard to find. The legislation I introduce today will \nallow states to create a single assessment to cover multiple subjects \nfor middle grade level teachers and allow states to issue a broad \ncertification for science and social studies.\n  In my view, the changes I propose will provide significant assistance \nto schools struggling to comply with the No Child Left Behind law all \nacross America. As time marches on and more deadlines set by this law \napproach--including additional testing, a highly qualified teacher in \nevery classroom and 100% proficiency for all students--we have a \nresponsibility to reassess the law and do what we can to make sure that \nit is implemented in a reasonable manner. In doing so, we must also \npreserve the basic tenets of the law--providing a world class education \nfor all American students and closing the achievement gap across \ndemographic and socioeconomic lines. Again, no child should left \nbehind--no special education student, no English language learning \nstudent, no minority student and no low-income student. I stand by this \ncommitment.\n\n  Obviously, funding this law is beyond the scope of this bill. I would \nnote, however, that efforts to increase education funding to authorized \nlevels have thus far been unsuccessful. Despite this, I remain \ncommitted to work to change this outcome as well.

A bill a improve the Child Care Access Means Parents in \nSchool Program; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. PresIdent, I am pleased to rise today with Senators \nSnowe, Kennedy, Collins, Murray, Durbin, Clinton, Inouye, Levin, \nLautenberg and Johnson to introduce legislation which would supply \ngreatly needed support to college students struggling to balance their \nroles as parents with their roles as students. The Child Care Access \nMeans Parents in School Act (CCAMPIS) would increase access to, support \nfor, and retention of low-income, nontraditional students who are \nstruggling to complete college degrees while caring for their children.\n  The typical college student is no longer an 18-year-old recent high \nschool graduate. According to a 2002 study by the National Center for \nEducation Statistics, only 27 percent of undergraduates meet the \n``traditional'' undergraduate criteria of earning a high school \ndiploma, enrolling full-time, depending on parents for financial \nsupport and not working or working part-time. This means that 73 \npercent of today's students are considered non-traditional in some way. \nClearly, non-traditional students--older students, students with \nchildren and students with various job and life experiences--are \nfilling the ranks of college classes. Why? Because they recognize the \nimportance of college to future success. It is currently estimated that \na full-time worker with a bachelor's degree earns about 60 percent more \nthan a full-time worker with only a high school diploma. This amounts \nto a lifetime gap in earnings of more than $1 million.\n\n[[Page S3296]]\n\n  Today's non-traditional students face barriers unheard of by \ntraditional college students of earlier years. Many are parents and \nmust provide for their children while in school. Access to affordable, \nquality and convenient child care is a necessity for these students. \nBut obtaining the child care that they need is often difficult because \nof their limited income and non-traditional schedules, compounded by \ndeclining assistance for child care through other supports. Campus-\nbased child care can fill the gap. It is conveniently located, \navailable during the right hours, and of high quality and lower cost. \nUnfortunately, it is unavailable at many campuses. Even when programs \ndo exist, they are often available to only a fraction of the eligible \nstudents. That is where the Dodd-Snowe CCAMPIS Act comes in.\n  The Dodd-Snowe CCAMPIS Act increases and expands the availability of \ncampus-based child care in three ways. First, it raises the minimum \ngrant amount from $10,000 to $30,000. For most institutions of higher \neducation, $10,000 has proven too small relative to the cost and effort \nrequired to complete a federal application.\n  Second, the Dodd-Snowe CCAMPIS Act ensures that a wider range of \nstudents are able to access services. Present language defines low-\nincome students as students eligible to receive a Federal Pell Grant. \nThis language excludes graduate students, international students, and \nstudents who may be low-income but make slightly more than is allowed \nto qualify for Pell grants. CCAMPIS will open eligibility for these \nadditional populations.\n  Third, the CCAMPIS Act raises the program's current authorization \nlevel from $45 million to $75 million so that we not only expand \nexisting programs, but create new ones as well.\n  Research demonstrates that campus-based child care is of high quality \nand that it increases the educational success of both parents and \nstudents. Furthermore, recipients of campus-based child care assistance \nwho are on public assistance are more likely to never return to welfare \nand to obtain jobs paying good wages.\n  Currently, there are approximately 1,850 campus-based child care \nprograms but over 6,000 colleges and universities eligible to \nparticipate in the CCAMPIS program. Currently, CCAMPIS funds only 427 \nprograms in states and the District of Columbia. Meanwhile, the number \nof non-traditional students across America is increasing. As these \nnumbers increase, the need for campus-based child care will increase as \nwell.\n  Just last week in Connecticut, I went to Eastern Connecticut State \nUniversity where I met a number of students who would benefit from this \nlegislation. One woman is attending part-time as an accounting major. \nShe works as a restaurant supervisor and just gave birth to her first \nchild. She is balancing work, family and school. Another woman is a \njunior social work major with two children. Having already received an \nassociate's degree, she is now working towards a bachelor's degree to \nincrease her competitiveness in the job market. A third woman is \npursuing her second degree in physical and health education. A stay-at-\nhome mom prior to re-enrolling, she has three children at home. These \nare the students that need our assistance--hard working parents trying \nto improve their lot in life for the good of their children.\n  This is a modest measure that will make a major difference to \nstudents. It will offer them new hope for starting and staying in \nschool. I am hopeful that it can be considered and enacted as part of \nthe Higher Education Act. I look forward to working with my colleagues \nto move this important measure forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 725\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide tax incentives to promote the conservation \nand production of natural gas; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Natural Gas \nPrice Reduction Act of 2005 and the ``Tax Provisions for Natural Gas \nPrice Reduction Act of 2005.'' I send to the desk two pieces of \nlegislation. One is the substantive provisions of the bill and one is \nthe tax provisions of the bill.\n  Mr. President, I offer the legislation on behalf of myself and the \nSenator from South Dakota, Mr. Johnson, who is the lead Democratic \nsponsor on the legislation. I do so with appreciation to the chairman \nof our Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Chairman Pete Domenici, \nand the staff of that committee who have worked very closely with us on \nthe development of this comprehensive piece of legislation, and with \nthanks to my own staff, Sharon Segner, who has worked on it for several \nmonths.\n  This is a piece of legislation to address aggressively and \ncomprehensively the rising cost of natural gas in the United States. \nThis is legislation for the blue-collar worker, for the American \nfarmer, and for the American homeowner.\n  Natural gas prices in the United States are at record levels. We have \ngone from having the lowest natural gas prices in the industrial world \nto the highest. These high prices are threatening millions of our jobs. \nOur farmers are getting a 10-percent pay cut. Homeowners are having a \nhard time paying their heating and cooling bills because of our \ncontradictory policies.\n  Our policies boil down to this: We are restricting the supply of \nnatural gas, and we are encouraging the use of natural gas. You do not \nhave to go very far in an economics class at the University of Oklahoma \nor the University of Tennessee to know that if you restrict supply and \nencourage demand, the inevitable result is higher prices. And higher \nprices is a very serious problem for U.S. workers, U.S. homeowners, and \nU.S. farmers.\n  Only an ambitious and comprehensive approach that both increases \nsupply and controls demand can lower the price of natural gas and keep \nour economy growing. This is not a question of tweaking our natural gas \npolicy. It is time, aggressively, to revamp it. We need aggressive \nconservation. We need aggressive use of alternative fuels. We need \naggressive research and development. We need aggressive production. \nAnd, for the time being, we need aggressive importation of liquefied \nnatural gas from other parts of the world.\n  Here on this chart is an idea of where we are today. This is the \nUnited States of America: $7 per unit for natural gas--the highest in \nthe industrialized world. Until recently, we had the lowest natural gas \nprices in the world.\n  What that means is large parts of our industries--the chemical \nindustry, for example--were built on the idea of $1.50 or $2 for \nnatural gas, but today it is $7.\n  A million Americans work in those blue-collar manufacturing jobs in \nevery State in our country. Now, if they are paying $7 here, and it is \n$5.55 in Canada and $5.15 in the United Kingdom and $2.65 in Turkey and \n$1.70 in the Ukraine, where do you suppose,\n\n[[Page S3297]]\n\nthough, a million blue-collar jobs are going to be 5 years from now, if \nwe do not do something about the $7 price? They are not going to be in \nthe United States. They are going to be moving out of the United \nStates, to the United Kingdom, to Germany, to the Ukraine, to other \nparts of the world. And people are going to be writing their \nCongressmen and saying: Why didn't you do something?\n  So here is what we can do. By aggressive conservation, I mean setting \nstronger appliance and equipment standards for natural gas efficiency \nso that a commercial air conditioner will cool the same while using \nless natural gas doing it. Those standards have been generally agreed \nupon by environmental groups with the industry. If they were put in \nplace, by a rough estimate, they might save the equivalent energy that \ncould be produced by 30 or 35 powerplants.\n  By aggressive use of alternative fuels, I mean, for example, fully \ncommercializing coal gasification. Coal gasification is taking this \nabundant supply of coal we have in the United States--we are the \n``OPEC,'' the ``Saudi Arabia'' of coal; we have a 400- or 500-year \nsupply--and finding a clean way to use it instead of importing oil from \na part of the world where people are blowing each other up.\n  That means starting with support so we can have six coal gasification \nplants in this country by the year 2013. Coal gasification means, you \nburn the coal to create gas, and then you burn the gas to create power. \nIf we can do that commercially, we will not only be passing a clean \nenergy bill, we will be passing a clean air bill, because if you do \nthat, you remove most of the mercury, most of the nitrogen, most of the \nsulfur. And by additional research, we may be able to find a way to \nrecapture the carbon that is produced and put that in the ground and \nsolve the carbon problems that a lot of people are talking about around \nthe world.\n  In addition to helping ourselves, we would help ourselves by helping \nothers. China and India and other parts of the world are building \nhundreds of coal plants. We would much rather them build a coal \ngasification plant, one that is clean and does not contribute to air \npollution. Because if China and India and Brazil build dirty coal \nplants, that air blows around the world, and it blows into Tennessee \nand it blows into South Carolina. It blows into Oklahoma.\n  So aggressive alternative fuels is a part of a natural gas supply. \nAggressive research and development includes investment and research in \ngas hydrates. Gas hydrates is gas that is in the ground. Methane \nhydrates hold tremendous potential to provide abundant supplies of \nnatural gas. Hydrates are like ice solid structures, consisting of \nwater and gases, mainly methane, compressed to greater than normal \ndensities.\n  Coastal U.S. areas are rich in this resource. The United States is \nestimated to contain one-fourth of the world's supply. We need to find \na way to use that gas so we do not have $7 per unit natural gas prices. \nThat sends millions of jobs overseas. That cuts the income of farmers. \nAnd that raises home heating prices and cooling prices for residential \nAmericans.\n  Aggressive production means, among other things, allowing States to \nselectively waive the Federal moratoria on offshore production of gas \nand collect significant revenues from such production. Let me give you \nan example. Within the last few weeks, the legislature of Virginia \ndecided it might like to explore the idea of drilling for gas offshore. \nNow, why would Virginia want to do that? Because there is probably a \nlot of gas offshore. What would that mean for Virginia? Well, they \ncould put a gas rig out in the ocean, beyond 20 miles, so nobody in \nVirginia or North Carolina could see it, run a pipeline underground to \nVirginia, and take their share of the revenues. And they can lower \ntaxes in Virginia and put the rest of the money in a trust fund to \nbuild the best colleges and universities in America. That is what they \ncould do in Virginia.\n  If Tennessee had a coastline, and I were Governor of Tennessee, that \nis what I would be asking the Congress to let me do.\n  I think as other Governors and other legislatures and other people \nlook at Texas and Louisiana and Alabama and see what they are doing and \ndecide that they can in an environmentally sensitive way exercise a \nState option to drill for gas in Federal waters so far out you can't \nsee it, that they will find that a good option because it will help \nlower the price of gas. It can build up the schools and keep taxes \ndown, and it can avoid other worse forms of energy.\n  For example, you would have to have 46 square miles of windmills, \nthese things that are 100 yards tall, in order to equal one gas rig \nthat you couldn't see out in the ocean. This is a State option. \nAggressive importation of liquefied natural gas starts with giving the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission exclusive authority for siting and \nregulating what we call LNG terminals. This means importing liquefied \nnatural gas from other parts of the world. There is a lot of it around \nthe world. They freeze it and put it in tankers, and they bring it here \nand put it in our pipelines, and then we have it.\n  That seems like a pretty big waste of effort when we have plenty of \nnatural gas here in the United States that we don't have access to. But \nif we want an adequate supply of natural gas, we are going to have to \nimport some from around the world, and that means we are going to need \nterminals to which to bring it. Some of them may be offshore. They \nmight be 10, 12, 14 miles offshore. Some of them, like the four we have \ntoday, may need to be onshore. There is no silver bullet. There is no \nsingle answer. That is why we need aggressive conservation. If, for \nexample, the United States adopted the conservation attitudes towards \nnatural gas that California did a few years ago, it might equal what 50 \npowerplants could produce in the United States. If that is so, we ought \nto do it today. That would begin to bring this $7 figure down.\n  Aggressive use of alternative fuels such as coal gasification. I also \nwould say nuclear power is the most obvious alternative fuel to natural \ngas. If we had more nuclear power, we would use less natural gas. In \nour country today, what do you suppose we are using to create \nelectricity when we need more electricity even though the cost of it is \n$7 a unit, the highest in the world? Natural gas, because natural gas \nplants can be built for a few hundred million dollars, and we have \ncreated an environment where we can't use nuclear.\n  We haven't built a new nuclear plant since the 1970s, even though we \ninvented the technology, even though France has 80 percent of its power \nnow produced by nuclear power, even though Japan builds a new nuclear \nplant every year or so. We invented it. Our Navy has operated nuclear \nreactors since the 1950s without ever having a single accident. It is a \nclean, obvious alternative to $7 natural gas, and we haven't built a \nplant since the 1970s. So we need to think seriously about aggressive \nconservation, aggressive use of alternative fuels, aggressive research \nand development for solar, for methane hydrates, aggressive production, \nand that includes giving States the option of deciding whether they \nwould like to drill offshore and take some of the revenues and put some \nof the revenues into a conservation fund, and aggressive importation of \nliquefied natural gas from overseas at least for the time being.\n  In March of 2002, the Secretary of Energy requested that the National \nPetroleum Council undertake an extensive study on the natural gas \ncrisis. That advisory council produced a study. It talked about the \nresults I have described. Our Senate Energy Committee, under the \nchairman, Senator Domenici, has paid a lot of attention to that report. \nSenator Domenici hosted what we called a natural gas roundtable that \nwas well attended by Senators and went on for 3 or 4 hours. There were \nmore than 100 proposals presented.\n  I am chairman of the subcommittee of that full committee, and so my \npurpose today is to take many of the ideas that we heard that made the \nmost sense, some of which people haven't been willing to advocate, and \nput them into the discussion. Again, because I do not want to be a \nSenator who 10 years from now somebody comes up to and says: How did \nyou let farmers get a 20-percent pay cut because of $7, $8, $9 natural \ngas; how did you let millions of jobs in the chemical industry, the \nauto industry go overseas because of $7, $8, and $9 natural gas; how \ndid you let prices of natural gas for home heating\n\n[[Page S3298]]\n\nor cooling get so high that middle-income Americans can't even afford \nto heat their homes? I don't want to be that kind of Senator. So I am \nhere today with a comprehensive proposal across the board even though \nsome of the ideas will create that kind of controversy.\n  I have summarized in a few words the provisions of a 250-page piece \nof legislation.\n  We were ambushed in the United States on September 11, 2001. Even \nthough you could argue that we might have known it was coming, \nterrorism wasn't new on September 11, 2001.\n  I remember being in a meeting with Prime Minister Rabin of Israel in \n1994. At the end of a long day, I asked him: What is the greatest \nchallenge threatening the world? And he said terrorism. That was many \nyears before we were attacked. He was right. He was dead within a few \nmonths at the hands of terrorists within his own country. We didn't see \nthe terrorism coming. We were ambushed, and we have paid a terrible \nprice--in lives, in dollars. We have had to create whole new \ndepartments. We have had to interrupt the lives of thousand of national \nguardsmen and Army reservists and send them overseas, some to die and \nsome to be wounded, because of terrorism. Maybe we couldn't have seen \nexactly that act coming, but we knew it was out there.\n  We are about to have another big surprise. That is to our standard of \nliving. We are 5 to 6 percent of all the people in the world. Yet we \nproduce a third of all the money in the world. We could wake up 10 \nyears from now and that picture could be very changed. One way is if we \nlose our brainpower advantage. And we could lose it. Half of our new \njobs have been created by science and technology since the end of World \nWar II. And if we go through our budget balancing, deficit controlling \nexercise for the next 10 years and we don't double investments for the \nphysical sciences and retake the lead in advanced computing, and if we \ndon't see that we have plenty of graduate students in science and \nengineering, we are going to find most of the R will be done in other \nparts of the world. We are going to find most of the engineers who \nproduce this brainpower that creates jobs in other parts of the world.\n  They are thinking in China, and they are thinking in India. There is \nno real good reason why the United States should make a third of all \nthe money in the world every year with just 5 or 6 percent of the \npeople, and we have so little. So they are keeping their bright people \nhome. They are building up their universities. They are doing what we \nneed to keep doing. That is one place we could get a big surprise.\n  But the other is in energy. We have taken energy for granted for a \nlong time. I know I come from Tennessee. We have had the Tennessee \nValley Authority. It has sat there since the 1930s, and it has produced \nreliable, low-cost electricity. Homes that have never been lit, barns \nthat have never been lit, rural areas that have never been lit have \nenjoyed that. That is within my lifetime.\n  And then while I was Governor in the 1990s, I remember that one of \nthe big attractions for Saturn and Nissan and the automobile industry \ncoming into Tennessee was low-cost reliable power. But when I had a \nnatural gas roundtable last fall in Tennessee, there was the president \nof Saturn, the president of Nissan, the head of the Tennessee Farm \nBureau. There was the head of the University of Tennessee. They were \nall saying: We can't live in Tennessee on $7 natural gas. What do they \ndo if they can't? It is very easy what they do. They don't have to have \nthose jobs in Tennessee or South Carolina. They can move them to \nGermany, they can move them to Mexico, they can move them to Canada, \nand they are doing it every day.\n  And Tennessee Eastman in the upper part of east Tennessee, which we \nthink is just like the great Smokey Mountains, has been there so long. \nThere are 12,000 people there, real good incomes. What do they use to \nmake chemicals there? They use natural gas.\n  How long are they going to be there? If we have $7 gas and they have \n$3 and $4 gas in other parts of the world, I am afraid they are not \ngoing to be there too long. And somebody is going to say to me: What \ndid you do about it? At least my answer is I stood up on the floor of \nthe Senate and said this is not the time to tweak our natural gas \npolicy.\n  We do not need to sit around and wait for a big surprise on energy \nlike we had a big surprise on September 11 on terrorism. We need an \naggressive policy. We need a comprehensive policy. We need aggressive \nconservation. That is where we should start. We need aggressive \nalternative fuels. That means nuclear and that means coal gasification. \nWe need aggressive research and development, whether it is hydrogen or \nwhether it is solar, or whether it is methane gas hydrates. We need \naggressive production. We have lots of gas in the United States. We \nshould be using it if we have $7 gas.\n  For the time being, we need to create the terminals that will permit \nus to import enough liquefied natural gas to get that $7 price down to \n$6 or $5 or $4.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Johnson from South Dakota for joining \nme in this comprehensive aggressive approach. I thank Senator Domenici \nfor taking the lead on an energy bill. I thank Senator Bingaman, who is \nthe ranking Democrat on our committee, because I notice on our \ncommittee a greater sense of urgency, a greater sense of bipartisan \ncooperation on coming up with an energy bill this year. Our blue-collar \nworkers, our farmers, our homeowners in Tennessee and across this \ncountry expect it from us.\n  Senator Johnson's and my contribution today is to introduce this \ncomprehensive 250-page bill and to get on the table all the aggressive \nideas we can think of that make sense about how to reduce the price of \nnatural gas for workers, for farmers, and for homeowners. We hope it \ncontributes to the discussion. We hope we find lots of these provisions \nin an ambitious energy bill.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues, as I know Senator \nJohnson does, on a bipartisan basis to help lower the price of natural \ngas, keep our jobs, keep our homes cool and warm, and make it possible \nfor farmers to make a living.\n  Natural gas prices are at record levels and the highest of any \nindustrialized country. High natural gas prices are threatening our \njobs, our farms, and hurting Americans who are trying to heat and cool \ntheir homes. Only an ambitious, comprehensive approach that both \nincreases supply and controls demand can lower the price of natural gas \nand keep our growing economic recovery from becoming recent history.\n  This is not a question of tweaking our natural gas policy. It is time \nto aggressively revamp it. We need aggressive conservation, aggressive \nuse of alternative fuels, aggressive research and development, \naggressive production and for the time being, aggressive imports of \nliquefied natural gas.\n  Aggressive conservation, for example, means setting stronger \nappliance and equipment standards for natural gas efficiency so that a \ncommercial air conditioner will cool the same while using less natural \ngas to do it.\n  Aggressive use of alternative fuels, for example, means fully \ncommercializing coal gasification, starting with support for the \ndeployment of six coal gasification plants by 2013. Coal gasification \nmeans that you burn coal to produce power but get the much lower \npollution output of using natural gas.\n  Aggressive research and development includes investment in research \nof gas hydrates. Methane hydrates hold tremendous potential to provide \nabundant supplies of natural gas. Hydrates are ice-like solid \nstructures consisting of water and gases, mainly methane, compressed to \ngreater than normal densities. Coastal U.S. areas are rich in this \nresource. The U.S. is estimated to contain one-fourth of the world's \nsupply.\n  Aggressive production means, among other changes, allowing states to \nselectively waive the federal moratoria on off-shore production and \ncollect significant revenues from such production.\n  And aggressive importation of liquefied natural gas starts with \ngiving the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission exclusive authority for \nsiting and regulating LNG terminals, while still preserving states' \nauthorities under the Coastal Zone Management Act and other acts.\n  In March 2002, Secretary of Energy Abraham requested that the \nNational Petroleum Council undertake an extensive study on the natural \ngas crisis.\n\n[[Page S3299]]\n\nThat council, a Federal advisory committee to the Secretary of Energy, \nproduced in late 2003 one of the most extensive policy studies and \nrecommendations on the natural gas crisis to date. Since that time, \nother prominent groups, such as the National Commission on Energy \nPolicy, have also produced extensive studies on the natural gas crisis. \nIn October 2004, I held a roundtable on the impact of soaring natural \ngas prices on Tennessee farmers and jobs. The Senate Energy Committee \nhas held numerous hearings over the last 2 years and recently held an \nextensive natural gas roundtable on the subject on January 24, \n2005. Over 100 proposals were submitted to the Senate Energy Committee \non natural gas issues.\n\n  The conclusion of all of these forums has been clear.\n  High natural gas prices are threatening our country's economic \ncompetitiveness and costing us jobs. For example, high natural gas \nprices have been the equivalent of a 10 percent pay cut to American \nfarmers.\n  The situation is urgent.\n  There are no silver bullets. We cannot conserve our way out of this \nproblem, nor can we drill our way out of this problem. We will need to \nbe aggressive on all fronts, in order to keep our industries \ncompetitive.\n  High natural gas costs are also tied to high oil prices. We need to \naddress both natural gas and oil prices in order to lower natural gas \ncosts.\n  Our country has contradictory policies on natural gas--on one hand, \nwe encourage its use. On the other hand, we limit access to its supply. \nWe need to amend our contradictory natural gas and environmental \npolicies.\n  That's why I am introducing the ``Natural Gas Price Reduction Act.'' \nIt is an aggressive, bold approach to tackle this issue. This 250-page \nlegislation is an attempt to start a very difficult, but balanced, \nlegislative discussion in the United States Senate on natural gas \nprices. I have taken the best ideas that I have heard in these \nroundtable discussions and from the various policy studies. I have met \nwith hundreds of people in the past year discussing natural gas prices. \nThis legislation is an attempt to be more aggressive on all areas \nimpacting natural gas prices--energy efficiency and fuel diversity, \nnatural gas supply, and improved infrastructure for importation of \nliquefied natural gas.\n  Half our Nation's increase in natural gas demand in the last decade \nhas come from the power sector. So to conserve natural gas, one must \nnot only reduce consumption of gas itself, but also of electricity. \nAnd, as I noted, since oil prices affect natural gas prices, conserving \noil is also important. My bill addresses conservation in five ways.\n  The bill creates a 4-year national consumer education program on the \nurgent need for energy conservation. A statewide California effort to \neducate energy consumers resulted in savings of 10 percent at peak \nusage--the equivalent of five-and-a-half 1,000 Megawatt coal-powered \npower plants. My bill aims to take that effort to the entire nation.\n  The legislation sets higher appliance and equipment standards for \nnatural gas efficiency. These standards have been negotiated between \nconsumer and industry representatives and are codified in the bill. For \nexample, the standards would require a new kitchen oven to produce the \nsame heat while using less natural gas to do it. The American Council \nfor an Energy-Efficient Economy estimates that these standards will \nreduce natural gas use by about 125 BCF in 2010 and 525 BCF in 2020. In \naddition these standards will reduce peak electric demand by about \n33,500 MW in 2020, equivalent to 34 coal power plants of 1000 MW each, \nand will save consumers and businesses more than $60 billion.\n\n  The bill creates tax incentives and provides regulatory relief to \nenable manufacturing facilities to more easily produce their own power \nand steam from a single source--a process called cogeneration or CHP \nwhich saves money and energy while also reducing pollutants. A CHP \nsystem can produce the same electrical and thermal output at 75 percent \nfuel conversion efficiency as compared to 49 percent separate steam and \npower. This is a 50 percent gain in overall efficiency, resulting in a \n35 percent fuel savings. Large industrial plants, such as International \nPaper, Alcoa and Eastman in my home State of Tennessee all use \ncogeneration in their manufacturing processes. More companies could do \nthe same, and the bill particularly focuses on providing incentive for \nsmaller cogeneration projects.\n  The Alexander bill provides incentive for public utilities to utilize \ntheir natural gas plants based on efficiency. The process of activating \ndifferent power plants to meet demand during a given day is called \n``dispatching.'' For example, on a hot summer day in Tennessee, the \ndemand for electricity, for air conditioning, might be highest in the \nearly afternoon, so then a power company would have to dispatch the \nmost power plants to provide the energy. But during the cooler night, \nthey might dispatch less plants since less power is needed. If power \ncompanies dispatched their most efficient plants first, this would save \nus a significant amount of natural gas. As you can see, the highest \nsaving will be in the medium-term--2010-2015--but real savings continue \nfor many years.\n  Our reliance on foreign oil is the silent elephant in the room when \nit comes to high natural gas prices. My legislation includes a \nprovision that requires the President report to Congress annually on \nefforts to reduce U.S. dependence on imported petroleum 1.75 million \nbarrels a day from projected 2013 levels, almost 10 percent. As I noted \nearlier, oil and gas are usually produced together; and, typically, \nthere is a 6:1 ratio between natural gas and oil prices. Reducing \ndependence on foreign oil will help bring natural gas prices down.\n  Conservation of natural gas and related energy sources is critical to \nlowering prices and keeping our manufacturing and farming jobs here in \nthe United States. But conservation alone is not enough. The second \nfocus must be to develop alternative sources of energy. The ``Keep \nManufacturing and Farming Jobs in the United States Act'' encourages \nthe use of three alternative fuels:\n\n  The bill initiates a national coal gasification strategy. Eastman \nChemical in Kingsport, TN, has been using coal gasification with a 95% \navailability factor for the past 20 years. Tampa Electric has \nsuccessfully demonstrated large-scale coal gasification. It is time for \nthis process to be more widely used. Coal gasification is a process \nwhereby gas derived from burning coal is used as a source of energy or \na raw material. When used in a power plant, coal gasification means \nthat you burn coal but get the much lower pollution output of using \nnatural gas. My legislation provides up to $2 billion in tax or other \nincentives to support the construction of six new coal gasification \npower plants. Similarly, the legislation provides up to $2 billion in \nassistance for industrial gasification projects. The bill also provides \nstreamlined permitting for coal gasification facilities. Coal is an \nabundant resource in the United States; we should use it to produce \nclean energy and raw material for industrial applications.\n  Solar energy is another clean, alternative fuel source that could be \ndeveloped further. Solar energy can be used directly for heating as \nwell as to create electricity. To push an aggressive solar energy \nstrategy, the Alexander legislation provides tax incentives for \ninvestment in solar power generation. Specifically, it provides \nbusinesses a tax credit for investing in geothermal or solar heating \nand/or power generation--10 percent heating, 25 percent for generating \nor displacing electricity.\n  My bill also contains language to invest in new technologies to use \nhydrogen to power fuel cell vehicles. The language in this bill mirrors \nlanguage I offered in the last session of Congress on the Energy Bill \nthat would have enacted President Bush's Hydrogenl/Fuel Cell \nInitiative. When I visited Japan last year, I visited a hydrogen fuel \nstation--that looked much like a gas station--and saw fuel cell \nvehicles that range from small cars to SUVs. These cars not only allow \nus to use an alternative fuel source but are also great for the \nenvironment--their only byproduct is water vapor. The bill invests in \nresearch and development of technologies and infrastructure for 2 \nhydrogen and fuel cell vehicles.\n  Methane hydrates hold tremendous potential to provide abundant \nsupplies of natural gas. Hydrates are ice-like solid structures \nconsisting of water and\n\n[[Page S3300]]\n\ngases--mainly methane--compressed to greater than normal densities. \nCoastal US areas are rich in this resource--the U.S. is estimated to \ncontain one-fourth of the world's supply. My bill invests $200 million \nover the next 4 years in research for this promising new resource, a \nnumber consistent with recommendations from the National Commission on \nEnergy Policy.\n  Conserving natural gas and using alternative fuels will take us a \nlong way to reducing gas prices and keeping jobs here in the U.S., but \nwe must also address the other side of the equation: supply. As Energy \nCommittee members learned at our Natural Gas Roundtable, our current \npolicy encourages consumption of natural gas while restricting the \nsupply. We need to stop putting unnecessary restrictions on production \nand supply of natural gas, and my legislation does so by addressing \nproduction off-shore and in the Rocky Mountains as well as the \nimportation of liquid natural gas from abroad.\n  We have plenty of natural gas here in the U.S., we just cannot get to \nit. There are large fields off the coasts, especially the Atlantic, and \nin the Rocky Mountains. There is no reason for natural gas prices here \nin the U.S. to be so high when we have so much available here--if only \nwe would use it.\n  Today, there are two moratoria on our outer continental shelf, OCS--a \ncongressional moratorium and a Presidential moratorium. The Atlantic \nCoast--40 miles off the coast is believed to be largely natural gas-\nprone. The Pacific Coast is believed--to be mainly oil-prone. The Gulf \nof Mexico is both. Today, when production is greater than 9 miles \noffshore, a State that has oil and gas production gets zero percent of \nthe production revenues. This is radically different than onshore \nproduction; on Federal lands, States get 50 percent of the production \nrevenues. Alaska gets 90 percent of the production revenues. In order \nto have a constructive dialogue on OCS production, the right framework \nneeds to be established.\n  My legislation provides the Department of the Interior with the legal \nauthority to issue natural gas only leases. Currently, Interior can \nonly issue combination gas and oil leases. Since there is greater \nhesitation about the environmental impact of producing oil off-shore, \nissuing natural gas-only leases may alleviate some concerns.\n  It also instructs the Secretary of the Interior to draw the state \nboundary between Alabama and Florida regarding Lease 181--a disputed \narea off the coast of both states in the Gulf of Mexico in which \nAlabama may wish to permit production while Florida may not. The \nboundaries shall be drawn using established international law. Under my \nbill, portions of Lease 181, which are not in the state of Florida and \ngreater than 30 miles off of the coast of Alabama, shall be leased by \nDecember 31, 2007. However, of those portions of Lease 181 that are in \nthe State of Florida, the State of Florida may keep the moratoria. \nLeasing would not be allowed to interfere with U.S. military operations \nin the Gulf Coast.\n  Finally, under the bill, States will have the authority to request \nstudies of natural gas resources off their coasts and be permitted to \nwaive Federal moratoria on offshore production. The states shall not \nhave the authority to lift the moratoria at National Marine Sanctuaries \nor National Wildlife Refuge Area. The State of Virginia recently \nengaged on this issue, and the state ought to have the ability to \nlicense off-shore production--especially if it is far enough off-shore \nthat you cannot even see it from land. My bill also allows States to \ncollect significant revenue from such production, and designates that a \nportion of revenues also go to a conservation royalty. The conservation \nroyalty would be shared equally by the Federal land and water \nconservation fund, state land and water conservation fund and wildlife \ngrants.\n  Importing liquefied natural gas--LNG--requires the infrastructure to \nreceive it. LNG comes to the U.S. by ship, and terminals to receive \nthese ships and unload LNG must be built and appropriate infrastructure \ndeveloped to transport gas from those terminals to users across the \ncountry.\n  My bill streamlines the development of offshore liquefied natural gas \nterminals. The siting of LNG terminals has become a difficult issue \nsince we all want cheaper natural gas, but no one seems to want an LNG \nterminal in ``their backyard.'' The Alexander legislation gives FERC \nclear authority for regulating liquid natural gas terminals, but, \nunlike a related House bill, still preserves States' authorities under \nthe Coastal Zone Management Act and other acts. I hope this will \nprovide some balance so that LNG terminals can be sited, but \nenvironmental concerns will play a significant role in choosing their \nsites. In an effort to speed the siting of pipelines that allow natural \ngas to reach all parts of the country, the bill also requires that FERC \ngrant or deny a terminal or pipeline application within one year.\n  Our country is facing an energy crisis. We are consuming more and \nmore electricity. Gasoline prices are poised to reach all time highs. \nThe price of oil is up. And so, too, is the price of natural gas.\n  The bill I introduce today, the ``Natural Gas Price Reduction Act,'' \naddresses high natural gas prices. Natural gas is not just used for \nheating homes, a source of electricity, it is a raw material for \nindustries, and it is an important component in fertilizers used by \nfarmers. High natural gas prices have cost farmers a 10-percent pay cut \nand are shipping manufacturing and chemical jobs overseas. We can not \nafford to let this problem fester any longer.\n  Bold action is required, and that is what my legislation provides. \nThis bill takes a comprehensive approach to addressing the problem by \nencouraging conservation, developing alternative fuel sources, and \nreducing roadblocks to the production and importation of natural gas. I \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Warner, Mr. \n        Voinovich, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Thune, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Obama, \n        Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Talent, Mr. Cornyn, \n        Mr. Cochran, Mr. Domenici, and Mr. Coleman):\n  S. 728. A bill to provide for the consideration and development of \nwater and related resources, to authorize the Secretary of the Army to \nconstruct various projects for improvements to rivers and harbors of \nthe United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with Senators \nInhofe, Vitter, Warner, Voinovich, Isakson, Thune, Murkowski, Obama, \nLandrieu, Grassley, Harkin, Talent, Cornyn, Cochran, Domenici, and \nColeman, the 2005 Water Resources Development Act.\n  The programs administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are \ninvaluable to this Nation. They provide drinking water, electric power \nproduction, river transportation, environmental protection and \nrestoration, protection from floods, emergency response, and \nrecreation. Few agencies in the Federal Government touch so many \ncitizens and they do it on a relatively small budget. They provide one-\nquarter of our Nation's total hydropower output; operate 456 lakes in \n43 States hosting 33 percent of all freshwater lake fishing; move 630 \nmillion tons of cargo valued at over $73 billion annually through our \ninland system; manage over 12 million acres of land and water; provide \n3 trillion gallons of water for use by local communities and business; \nand have prevented an estimated $706 billion in flood damage within the \npast 25 years with an investment one-seventh that value. During the \n1993 flood alone, an estimated $19.1 billion in flood damage was \nprevented by flood control facilities in place at that time. Our ports \nmove over 95 percent of U.S. overseas trade by weight and 75 percent by \nvalue. Between 1970 and 2003, the value of U.S. trade increased 24 \nfold, and 70 percent since 1994. That was an average annual growth rate \nof 10.2 percent, which was nearly double the pace of the Gross Domestic \nProduct growth during the same period. Unfortunately, the American \nSociety of Civil Engineers grades navigable waterways infrastructure D- \nwith over 50 percent of the locks ``functionally obsolete'' despite \nincreased demand.\n  This bipartisan bill is one that traditionally is produced by the \nCongress\n\n[[Page S3301]]\n\nevery two years, however, we have not passed a WRDA bill since 2000 and \nthe longer we wait, the more unmet needs pile up and the more \ncomplicated the demands upon the bill become making it harder and \nharder to win approval. For some, this bill is too small and for \nothers, too big. For some, the new regulations are too onerous and for \nothers, the new regulations are not onerous enough. Nevertheless, I \nbelieve we have struck a balance here that disciplines the new projects \nto criteria fairly applied while addressing a great number of water \nresources priorities.\n  With the new regulations, we have embraced a common sense bipartisan \nproposal by Senators Landrieu and Cochran similar to the bi-partisan \nHouse agreement that requires major projects to be subject to \nindependent peer review and requires that necessary mitigation for \nprojects be completed at the same time the project is completed, or, in \nspecial cases, no longer than one year after project completion. This \nwill impose a cost on communities, particularly smaller communities, \nbut it is not as onerous as the new regulations proposed last year \nwhich ultimately prevented a final agreement from being reached between \nthe House and Senate.\n  The commanding feature of the bill is its landmark environmental and \necosystem restoration authorities. Nearly 60 percent of the bill \nauthorizes such efforts, including environmental restoration of the \nEverglades, Coastal Louisiana, Chesapeake Bay, Missouri River, Long \nIsland Sound, Salton Sea, Upper Connecticut, and the Illinois and \nMississippi Rivers, and others.\n  Additionally, it is important to understand the budget implications \nof this legislation in the real world. We are contending with difficult \nbudget realities currently and it is critical that we be mindful of \nthose realities as we make investments in the infrastructure that \nsupports the people in our nation who make and grow and buy and sell \nthings so that we can grow our economy, create jobs, and secure our \nfuture. This is an authorization bill. It does not spend one dollar. I \nrepeat, it does not spend one dollar. It makes projects eligible for \nfunding through the appropriations process that operates within the \nrestrictions of the budget Congress provides it. With the allocation \nprovided, the Appropriations Committee and the Congress and the \nPresident will fund such projects deemed of the highest priority and \nthose remaining will not be funded because the budget will not permit \nit. This WRDA process simply permits project consideration during the \nprocess of appropriations and I expect some will measure up and others \nwill not. I hear some suggest that we should not authorize anything new \nuntil all other previously-authorized projects are funded. That, of \ncourse, is nonsense because it assumes falsely that all projects \nauthorized five and 10 and 50 years ago are higher priority than those \nin this package. We have de-authorized a great number of projects in \nthis bill and I expect there will be more added as we proceed and then \nthe remainder will have to face the stingy budget process that will \nprioritize the rest.\n\n  While the majority of this legislation is for environmental \nprotection and restoration, a key bipartisan economic initiative we \ninclude provides transportation efficiency and environmental \nsustainability on the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers.\n  As the world becomes more competitive, we must also. In the \nheartland, the efficiency, reliability, capacity, and safety of our \ntransportation options are critical--often make-or-break. In Missouri \nalone, we ship 34.7 million tons of commodities with a combined value \nof more than $4 billion which include coal, petroleum, aggregates, \ngrain, chemicals, iron, steel, minerals and other commodities.\n  As we look 50 years into the future, and as we anticipate and try to \npromote commercial and economic growth, we have to ask ourselves a \nfundamental question: should we have a system that permits and promotes \ngrowth, or should we be satisfied to restrict our growth to the \nconfines of a transportation straight jacket designed not for 2050, but \nfor 1950 for paddle wheel boats?\n  Further, we must ask ourselves if dramatic investments should be made \nto address environmental problems and opportunities that exist on these \ngreat waterways. In both cases, the answer is, ``Of course we should \nmodernize and improve.''\n  We have a system which is in environmental and economic decline. Jobs \nand markets and the availability of habitat for fish and wildlife are \nat stake. We cannot be for increased trade, commercial growth, and job \ncreation without supporting the basic transportation infrastructure \nnecessary to move goods from buyers to sellers. New efficiency helps \ngive our producers an edge that can make or break opportunities in the \ninternational marketplace.\n  Seventy years ago, some argued that a transportation system on the \nMississippi River was not justified. Congress decided that its role was \nnot to try to predict the future but to shape the future and decided to \ninvest in a system despite the naysayers. Over 84 million tons per year \nlater, it is clear that the decision was wise.\n  Now, that system that was designed for paddlewheel boats and to last \n50 years is nearly 70 years old and we must make decisions that will \nshape the next 50-70 years. As we look ahead, we must promote growth \npolicies that help Americans who produce and employ.\n\n  We must work for policies that promote economic growth, job creation, \nand environmental sustainability. We know that trade and economic \ngrowth can be fostered or it can be discouraged by policies and other \nrealities which include the quality of our transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  So in 20 and 30 and 40 and 50 years, where will the growth in \ntransportation occur to accommodate the growth in demand for commercial \nshipping? The Department of Transportation suggests that congestion on \nour roads and rails will double in the next quarter century. The fact \nof the matter is that the great untapped capacity is on our water.\n  This is good news because water transportation is efficient, it is \nsafe, it conserves fuel, and it protects the air and the environment. \nOne medium-sized barge tow can carry the freight of 870 trucks. That \nfact alone speaks volumes to the benefits of water. If we can, would we \nrather have 870 diesel engines on the roads of downtown St. Louis, or \ntwo diesel engines on the water.\n  The veteran Chief Economist at USDA testified that transportation \nefficiency and the ability of farmers to win markets are higher prices \nare ``fundamentally related.'' He predicts that corn exports over the \nnext 10 years will rise 45 percent, 70 percent of which will travel \ndown the Mississippi.\n  Over the past 35 years, waterborne commerce on the Upper Mississippi \nRiver has more than tripled. The system currently carries 60 percent of \nour Nation's corn exports and 45 percent of our Nation's soybean \nexports and it does so at two-thirds the cost of rail--when rail is \navailable.\n  Over the previous 12 years, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have \nspent $70 million completing a six year study. During that period, \nthere have been 35 meetings of the Governors Liaison Committee, 28 \nmeetings on the Economic Coordinating Committee, among the States along \nthe Upper Mississippi and Illinois waterways, and there have been 44 \nmeetings of the Navigation and Environmental Coordination Committee. \nAdditionally, there have been 130 briefings for special interest \ngroups, 24 newsletters. There have been six sets of public meetings in \n46 locations with over 4,000 people in attendance. To say the least, \nthis has been a very long, very transparent, and very representative \nprocess.\n  However, while we have been studying, our competitors have been \nbuilding. Given the extraordinary delay so far, and given the reality \nthat large scale construction takes not weeks or months, but decades, \nfurther delay is no longer an option. This is why I am pleased to be \njoined by a bipartisan group of Senators who agree that we must improve \nthe efficiency and the environmental sustainability of our great \nresources.\n  This plan gets the Corps back in the business of building the future, \nrather than just haggling about predicting the future. More will need \nto be done later on ecosystem and lock expansions further upstream, but \nthis begins the improvement schedule underway.\n\n[[Page S3302]]\n\n  In this legislation, we authorize $1.58 billion for ecosystem \nrestoration-almost 2 times the federal cost of lock capacity expansion \nwhich we authorize on locks 20-25 on the Mississippi River and Peoria \nand LaGrange on the Illinois. The new 1,200 foot locks on the \nMississippi River will provide equal capacity in the bottleneck region \nbelow the 1,200 foot lock 19 at Keokuk and above locks 26 and 27 near \nSt. Louis. Half the cost of the new locks will be paid for by private \nusers who pay into the Inland Waterways Trust fund. Additional funds \nwill be provided for mitigation and small scale and nonstructural \nmeasures to improve efficiency.\n  As we look ahead, the locks at 14-18 will have to be addressed as \nwill further investments to ecosystem restoration efforts.\n  This effort is supported by a broad-based group of the States, farm \ngroups, shippers, labor, and those who pay taxes into the Trust Fund \nfor improvements. Of particular note, I appreciate the strong support \nfrom the carpenters, corngrowers, farm bureau, soybeans, the diverse \nmembership of MARC2000.\n  I thank my colleagues and their staff for the hard work devoted to \nthis difficult matter and I thank particularly chairman Inhofe for his \nforbearance. I believe that if members work cooperatively and aim for \nthe center and not the fringe, that we can get a bill completed this \nyear. If demands exist that the bill be away from the center toward the \nfringe, we will go another Congress without completing our work as we \nwitnessed last year.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, I would like to thank Senator Bond \nfor the leadership he and his subcommittee staff have demonstrated in \nbringing this piece of legislation together.\n  I have great hopes for getting a WRDA bill passed this session. We \nhave not enacted a WRDA bill since 2000, and the water resources are in \nmuch need of this authorization. We made great progress and were very \nclose to finishing a bill at the end of the 108th Congress. That effort \nhas provided a great stepping stone toward quick completion this year.\n  The Army Corps of Engineers has provided a valuable service to the \nNation for over 200 years. It has been instrumental in creating one of \nthe most dynamic inland waterway systems in the world. For example, the \nCorps activities have provided Tulsa, OK with one of the Nation's most \ninland ports and provides the dredging needed to keep the San Francisco \nBay navigable. There is not a State in the Union that does not reap the \nbenefits of the Army Corps.\n  I am well aware of the stacks of requests that have come in from \nevery State for projects to be included in the bill. While it is \nimportant that we insure the Corps is capable of meeting our future \nwater resource needs, it is also very important that we do not demand \nmore of the Corps than it is capable of providing. No Federal agency \ncould complete all of the projects requested by all of the Senators. \nConsidering the limited staff and budget of the Corps, an ``authorize \neverything'' approach may leave everyone with nothing. While I know \nthat each Senator has his or her own priorities, we all must understand \nthe limitations with which we reside. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to ensure that we give clear direction to the Corps to focus \non completing the highest priority and most beneficial projects.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 729. A bill to establish the Food Safety Administration to protect \nthe public health by preventing food-borne illness, ensuring the safety \nof food, improving research on contaminants leading to food-borne \nillness, and improving security of food from intentional contamination, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, a single food safety agency with authority \nto protect the food supply based on sound scientific principles would \nprovide this country with the greatest hope of reducing foodborne \nillnesses and preventing or minimizing the harm from a bioterrorist \nattack on our food supply. Right now, our food is the safest in the \nworld, but there are widening gaps in our food safety net due to \nemerging threats and the fact that food safety oversight has evolved \nover time to spread across several agencies. This mismatched, piecemeal \napproach to food safety could spell disaster if we do not act quickly \nand decisively.\n  But don't take it from me. Former HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson told \nreporters in December as he resigned that he worries ``every single \nnight'' about a massive attack on the U.S. food supply. ``I, for the \nlife of me, cannot understand why the terrorists have not, you know, \nattacked our food supply, because it is so easy to do,'' Thompson said. \n``And we are importing a lot of food from the Middle East, and it would \nbe easy to tamper with that,'' he said.\n  No wonder he feels that way. Several Federal agencies, all with \ndifferent and conflicting missions, work to ensure our food is safe. \nFor example, there is no standardization for inspections--processed \nfood facilities may see a Food and Drug Administration inspector once \nevery 5 to 6 years, while meat and poultry operations are inspected \ndaily by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that \nas many as 76 million people suffer from food poisoning each year. Of \nthose individuals, approximately 325,000 will be hospitalized, and more \nthan 5,000 will die. Factors such as emerging pathogens, an aging \npopulation at high risk for foodborne illnesses, an increasing volume \nof food imports, and people eating outside their homes more often \nunderscore the need for us to take charge and shed the old bureaucratic \nshackles that have tied us to the overlapping and inefficient ad \nhoc food safety system of the past.\n\n  That is why I come to the Senate floor today to introduce the Safe \nFood Act of 2005. My House counterpart, Representative Rosa DeLauro, is \nintroducing the bill in the other body. This legislation would create a \nsingle, independent Federal food safety agency to administer all \naspects of Federal food safety inspections, enforcement, standards-\nsetting and research in order to protect public health. The components \nof the agencies now charged with protecting the food supply, primarily \nhoused at the Food and Drug Administration and the Agriculture \nDepartment, would be transferred to this new agency.\n  The new Food Safety Administrator would be responsible for the safety \nof the food supply, and would fulfill that charge by implementing the \nregistration and recordkeeping requirements of the 2002 bioterrorism \nlaw; ensuring slaughterhouses and food processing plants have \nprocedures in place to prevent and reduce food contamination; regularly \ninspecting domestic food facilities, with inspection frequency based on \nrisk; and centralizing the authority to detain, seize, condemn and \nrecall food that is adulterated or misbranded. The Administrator would \nbe charged with requiring food producers to code their products so \nthose products could be traced in the event of a foodborne illness \noutbreak in order to minimize the health impact of such an event.\n  The Administrator would also have the power examine the food safety \npractices of foreign countries and work with the states to impose \nvarious civil and criminal penalties for serious violations of the food \nsafety laws. The Administrator would also actively oversee public \neducation and research programs on foodborne illness.\n  It is time to create a single food safety agency in this country. I \nam encouraged by a February 2005 Government Accountability Office \nreport in which government officials in seven other high-income \ncountries who have consolidated their food safety systems consistently \nstate that the benefits of consolidation outweigh the costs.\n  In this era of limited budgets, it is our responsibility to \nstreamline the Federal food safety system. The United States simply \ncannot afford to continue operating multiple redundant systems. This is \nnot about more regulation, a super agency, or increased bureaucracy. It \nis about common sense and the more effective marshaling of our existing \nresources.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S3303]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 729\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the safety of the food supply of the United States is \n     vital to the public health, to public confidence in the food \n     supply, and to the success of the food sector of the Nation's \n     economy;\n       (2) lapses in the protection of the food supply and loss of \n     public confidence in food safety are damaging to consumers \n     and the food industry, and place a burden on interstate \n     commerce;\n       (3) the safety and security of the food supply requires an \n     integrated, system-wide approach to preventing food-borne \n     illness, a thorough and broad-based approach to basic and \n     applied research, and intensive, effective, and efficient \n     management of the Nation's food safety program;\n       (4) the task of preserving the safety of the food supply of \n     the United States faces tremendous pressures with regard to--\n       (A) emerging pathogens and other contaminants and the \n     ability to detect all forms of contamination;\n       (B) an aging and immune compromised population, with a \n     growing number of people at high-risk for food-borne \n     illnesses, including infants and children;\n       (C) an increasing volume of imported food, without adequate \n     monitoring and inspection; and\n       (D) maintenance of rigorous inspection of the domestic food \n     processing and food service industries;\n       (5) Federal food safety standard setting, inspection, \n     enforcement, and research efforts should be based on the best \n     available science and public health considerations and food \n     safety resources should be systematically deployed in ways \n     that most effectively prevent food-borne illness;\n       (6) the Federal food safety system is fragmented, with at \n     least 12 Federal agencies sharing responsibility for food \n     safety, and operates under laws that do not reflect current \n     conditions in the food system or current scientific knowledge \n     about the cause and prevention of food-borne illness;\n       (7) the fragmented Federal food safety system and outdated \n     laws preclude an integrated, system-wide approach to \n     preventing food-borne illness, to the effective and efficient \n     operation of the Nation's food safety program, and to the \n     most beneficial deployment of food safety resources;\n       (8) the National Academy of Sciences recommended in the \n     report ``Ensuring Safe Food from Production to Consumption'' \n     that Congress establish by statute a unified and central \n     framework for managing Federal food safety programs, and \n     recommended modifying Federal statutes so that inspection, \n     enforcement, and research efforts are based on scientifically \n     supportable assessments of risks to public health; and\n       (9) the lack of a single focal point for food safety \n     leadership in the United States undercuts the ability of the \n     United States to exert food safety leadership \n     internationally, which is detrimental to the public health \n     and the international trade interests of the United States.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish a single agency to be known as the ``Food \n     Safety Administration'' to--\n       (A) regulate food safety and labeling to strengthen the \n     protection of the public health;\n       (B) ensure that food establishments fulfill their \n     responsibility to produce food in a manner that protects the \n     public health of all people in the United States;\n       (C) lead an integrated, system-wide approach to food safety \n     and to make more effective and efficient use of resources to \n     prevent food-borne illness;\n       (D) provide a single focal point for food safety \n     leadership, both nationally and internationally; and\n       (E) provide an integrated food safety research capability, \n     utilizing internally-generated, scientifically and \n     statistically valid studies, in cooperation with academic \n     institutions and other scientific entities of the Federal and \n     State governments, to achieve the continuous improvement of \n     research on food-borne illness and contaminants;\n       (2) to transfer to the Food Safety Administration the food \n     safety, labeling, inspection, and enforcement functions that, \n     as of the day before the effective date of this Act, are \n     performed by other Federal agencies; and\n       (3) to modernize and strengthen the Federal food safety \n     laws to achieve more effective application and efficient \n     management of the laws for the protection and improvement of \n     public health.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to establish requirements \nconcerning the operation of fossil fuel-fired electric utility steam \ngenerating units, commercial and industrial boiler units, solid waste \nincineration units, medical waste incinerators, hazardous waste \ncombustors, chlor-alkali plants, and Portland cement plants to reduce \nemissions of mercury to the environment, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I again will discuss mercury \npollution and the serious and immediate health risks it poses to the \nhealth of citizens across our Nation.\n  This is not a new issue. We have known about mercury pollution for \ndecades, and it remains one of, if not the last, major toxic pollutant \nwithout a comprehensive plan to control its release. We know where the \nsources mercury pollution are, we know where the pollution deposits, \nand we definitely know what harm it causes to people and to wildlife.\n  We need to confront mercury pollution because it is a threat to \npregnant women and children. The Environmental Protection Agency's own \nscientists estimate that one of every six women of child-bearing age \nhas elevated levels of mercury in her body above safe thresholds.\n  Mercury can cause neurological harm to children exposed to increased \nmercury levels while in the womb and during the first few years of \ntheir lives, which can lead to increased risk for learning \ndisabilities, developmental delays, and other serious problems.\n  Just last year EPA scientists nearly doubled the previous estimate of \nthe number of children at increased risk from exposure to elevated \nmercury levels in their mothers' wombs from 300,000 to over 600,000. \nThis finding should alarm all of us and spur this Administration to \npromptly develop strong controls on mercury pollution from power plants \nthat meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act and that fully protect \nwomen and children.\n  Yet unfortunately, this Administration has not done that. The \nAdministration's new mercury rule and the so-\n\n[[Page S3313]]\n\ncalled ``Clear Skies'' proposal turn back progress, ignore available \nclean air technology, and will leave more toxic mercury in our air, \nwater, and fish and for a longer time than is necessary.\n  Because of this, on behalf of Senator Snowe and myself, I am \nreintroducing legislation today that will confront this problem \ndirectly and that will reduce mercury pollution from all sources.\n  Our bill will reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants \nby 90 percent by 2010. The cap-and-trade approach the Administration is \npushing for in both the mercury rule and the President's Clear Skies \nproposal would only reduce emissions by less than 50 percent in the \nnear future and possibly 70 percent over the next 15 years.\n  I introduce this legislation on the heels of two recent reports about \nthe proposed EPA mercury rule, one from the Government Accountability \nOffice and one from the EPA Inspector General. Both the IG and GAO \nreports severely criticize this Administration's mercury rulemaking \nprocess, saying it violated EPA policy, OMB guidance, Presidential \nExecutive Orders and, in some instances, important provisions of the \nClean Air Act.\n  I find this extremely troublesome. These are serious problems that \ngreatly undermine the credibility of this Administration and that led \nthem to create policies that fail to adequately protect the children in \nmy state of Vermont and those all across the country. Rather than \ndevelop unbiased science-based limits on mercury pollution, they \ninstead developed limits to fit predetermined numbers found in the \nPresident's industry friendly Clear Skies proposal.\n  The GAO found critical flaws with the economic analysis that \nbasically prevent anyone from actually verifying the supposed benefits \nof the cap-and-trade approach proposed in both EPA's rule and in the \nClear Skies plan. In simple terms you could call it another example of \nthe smoke and mirrors this Administration has used to support its \nflawed dirty air pollution policies.\n  Not only were the supposed benefits of the cap-and-trade proposal \nvirtually undocumented, they did not even bother to analyze whatsoever \nthe health benefits to women and children from controlling toxic \nmercury. If protecting the health of women and children is truly \nimportant to this Administration, then why would they skip such an \nimportant analysis?\n  Not surprisingly, the EPA Inspector General confirmed what the GAO \nfound. That EPA staff were directed to ignore the Clean Air Act and \ninstead write a mercury rule to fit the weak mercury caps in the \nPresident's Clear Skies initiative.\n  Rather than let EPA's capable scientists and engineers do their jobs, \nthey decided to play politics and bow to special interest groups. How \nelse did industry favorable policies and analyses found in memos \nwritten by industry lobbyists make it into the rule, verbatim?\n  Both the GAO and IG reports make it clear that EPA staff were \npressured to ignore parts of the Clean Air Act and to propose weaker \nmercury reductions than what are technically feasible and required \nunder the law.\n  The President's Clear Skies proposal formed the basis for the flawed \nmercury rule, so it obviously shares the same flaws. These two reports \nconfirm what many of us already suspected, that Clear Skies is based on \nbiased analyses, inadequate and faulty justifications.\n  This Administration must stop the shenanigans. They need to stop \ndownplaying the health risks of mercury pollution and stop catering to \nthe special interests of the power industry and their lobbyists.\n  The clarity and diversity of voices opposed to their poor mercury \npolicies are unprecedented in the 30-year history of EPA. Now is the \ntime for them to listen to the voices of more than 600,000 citizens and \nmore than one million sportsmen and women nationwide that sent EPA \nletters opposing the weak mercury rule.\n  Now is the time to listen to the nearly 100 national and local church \nleaders, representing dozens of denominations and millions of \ncongregants, who sent a letter to President Bush expressing ``grave \nmoral concern'' about his misleadingly titled Clear Skies Initiative.\n  I call on the Administration to take immediate action to correct the \nserious problems in EPA's proposed power plant mercury rules. Instead, \nI hope that we can begin to meet the targets set out in this bill and \nstart protecting the health of women and children.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Overview of the Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 2005\n\n         Sponsored by Senators Patrick Leahy and Olympia Snowe\n\n     What will the Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 2005 \n         do?\n       The Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 2005 \n     mandates substantial reductions in mercury emissions from all \n     major sources in the United States. It is the only \n     comprehensive legislation to control mercury emissions from \n     all major sources. It directs EPA to issue new standards for \n     unregulated sources and to monitor and report on the progress \n     of currently regulated sources. It sets an aggressive \n     timetable for these reductions so that mercury emissions are \n     reduced as soon as possible.\n       With these emissions reductions, the bill requires the safe \n     disposal of mercury recovered from pollution control systems, \n     so that the hazards of mercury are not merely transferred \n     from one environmental medium to another. It requires annual \n     public reporting--in both paper and electronic form--of \n     facility-specific mercury emissions. It phases out mercury \n     use in consumer products, requires product labeling, and \n     mandates international cooperation. It supports research into \n     the retirement of excess mercury, the handling of mercury \n     waste, the effectiveness of fish consumption advisories, and \n     the magnitude of previously uninventoried sources.\n     Section 3. Mercury emission standards for fossil fuel-fired \n         electric utility steam generating units\n       The EPA's Mercury Study Report to Congress estimated 52 \n     tons of mercury emissions occur per year from coal- and oil-\n     fired electric utility steam generating units. More recently, \n     an EPA inventory estimated 48 tons of mercury from coal-fired \n     power plants. Collectively, these power plants constitute the \n     largest source of mercury emissions in the United States. In \n     December 2000, the EPA issued a positive determination to \n     regulate these mercury emissions. But these rules will take \n     years to write and implement, and there is already vigorous \n     industry opposition. It is uncertain what form these rules \n     will take or how long they may be delayed. This section \n     requires EPA to set a Amaximum achievable control technology \n     (MACT) standard for these emissions, such that nationwide \n     emissions decrease by at least 90 percent.\n     Section 4. Mercury emission standards for coal- and oil-fired \n         commercial and industrial boiler units\n       The EPA's report on its study estimates that 29 tons of \n     mercury is emitted per year from coal- and oil-fired \n     commercial and industrial boiler units. This section requires \n     EPA to set a MACT standard for these mercury emissions, such \n     that nationwide emissions decrease by at least 90 percent.\n     Section 5. Reduction of mercury emissions from solid waste \n         incineration units\n       The EPA study estimates that 30 tons of mercury emissions \n     are released each year from municipal waste combustors. These \n     emissions result from the presence of mercury-containing \n     items such as fluorescent lamps, fever thermometers, \n     thermostats and switches, in municipal solid waste streams. \n     In 1995, EPA promulgated final rules for these emissions, and \n     these rules took effect in 2000. This section reaffirms those \n     rules and requires stricter rules for units that do not \n     comply. The most effective way to reduce mercury emissions \n     from incinerators is to reduce the volume of mercury-\n     containing items before they reach the incinerator. That is \n     why this section also requires the separation of mercury-\n     containing items from the waste stream, the labeling of \n     mercury-containing items to facilitate this separation, and \n     the phase-out of mercury in consumer products within three \n     years, allowing for the possibility of exceptions for \n     essential uses.\n     Section 6. Mercury emission standards for chlor-alkali plants\n       The EPA study estimates that 7 tons of mercury emissions \n     are released per year from chlor-alkali plants that use the \n     mercury cell process to produce chlorine. EPA has not issued \n     rules to regulate these emissions. This section requires each \n     chlor-alkali plant that uses the mercury cell process to \n     reduce its mercury emissions by 95 percent. The most \n     effective way to meet this standard would be to switch to the \n     more energy efficient membrane cell process, which many \n     plants already use.\n     Section 7. Mercury emission standards for Portland cement \n         plants\n       The EPA study estimates that 5 tons of mercury emissions \n     are released each year from Portland cement plants. In 1999 \n     EPA promulgated final rules for emissions from cement plants, \n     but these rules did not include mercury. This section \n     requires each\n\n[[Page S3314]]\n\n     Portland cement plant to reduce its mercury emissions by 95 \n     percent.\n     Section 8. Report on implementation of mercury emission \n         standards for medical waste incinerators\n       The EPA study estimates that 16 tons of mercury emissions \n     are released per year from medical waste incinerators. In \n     1997 EPA issued final rules for emissions from hospital/\n     medical/infectious waste incinerators. This section requires \n     EPA to report on the success of these rules in reducing these \n     mercury emissions.\n     Section 9. Report on implementation of mercury emission \n         standards for hazardous waste combustors\n       The EPA study estimates that 7 tons of mercury emissions \n     are released each year from hazardous waste incinerators. In \n     1999 EPA promulgated final rules for these emissions. This \n     section requires EPA to report on the success of these rules \n     in reducing these mercury emissions.\n     Section 10. Defense activities\n       This section requires the Department of Defense to report \n     on its use of mercury, including the steps it is taking to \n     reduce mercury emissions and to stabilize and recycle \n     discarded mercury. This section also prohibits the Department \n     of Defense from returning the nearly 5,000 tons of mercury in \n     the National Defense Stockpile to the global market.\n     Section 11. International activities\n       This section directs EPA to work with Canada and Mexico to \n     study mercury pollution in North America, including the \n     sources of mercury pollution, the pathways of the pollution, \n     and options for reducing the pollution.\n     Section 12. Mercury research\n       This section supports a variety of mercury research \n     projects. First, it promotes accountability by mandating an \n     interagency report on the effectiveness of this act in \n     reducing mercury pollution. Second, it mandates an EPA study \n     on mercury sedimentation trends in major bodies of water. \n     Third, it directs EPA to evaluate and improve state-level \n     mercury data and fish consumption advisories. Fourth, it \n     mandates a National Academy of Sciences report on the \n     retirement of excess mercury, such as stockpiled industrial \n     mercury that is no longer needed due to plant closures or \n     process changes. Fifth, it mandates an EPA study of mercury \n     emissions from electric arc furnaces, a source not studied in \n     the EPA's study report. Finally, it authorizes $2,000,000 for \n     modernization and expansion of the Mercury Deposition \n     Network, plus $10,000,000 over ten years for operational \n     support of that network.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Burns, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Dorgan, \n        Mr. Kohl, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Thune):\n  S. 731. A bill to recruit and retain more qualified individuals to \nteach in Tribal Colleges or Universities; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, three years ago, Senator Burns and I \nformed the bipartisan Task Force on Tribal Colleges and Universities to \nraise awareness of the important role that the tribal colleges and \nuniversities play in their respective communities as educational, \neconomic, and cultural centers. The Task Force seeks to advance \ninitiatives that help improve the quality education the colleges \nprovide.\n  For more than three decades, tribal colleges have been providing a \nquality education to help Native Americans of all ages reach their \nfullest potential. More than 30,000 students from 250 tribes nationwide \nattend tribal colleges. Tribal colleges serve young people preparing to \nenter the job market, dislocated workers learning new skills, and \npeople seeking to move off welfare. I am a strong supporter of our \nNation's tribal colleges because, more than any other factor, they are \nbringing hope and opportunity to America's Indian communities.\n  Over the years, I have met with many tribal college students, and I \nam always impressed by their commitment to their education, their \nfamilies and their communities. Tribal colleges and universities have \nbeen highly successful in helping Native Americans obtain a higher \neducation. Congress has recognized the importance of these institutions \nand the significant gains they have achieved in helping more \nindividuals obtain their education. While Congress has steadily \nincreased its financial support of these institutions, many challenges \nstill remain.\n  One of the challenges that the tribal college presidents have \nexpressed to me is the frustration and difficulty they have in \nattracting qualified individuals to teach at the colleges. Recruitment \nand retention are difficult for many of the colleges because of their \ngeographic isolation and low faculty salaries.\n  To help tackle the challenges of recruiting and retaining qualified \nteachers, I am introducing the Tribal Colleges and Universities Teacher \nLoan Forgiveness Act. This legislation will provide student loan \nforgiveness to individuals who commit to teach for up to five years in \none of the tribal colleges nationwide. Individuals who have Perkins, \nDirect, or Guaranteed loans may qualify to receive up to $15,000 in \nloan forgiveness. This program will provide these institutions with \nextra help in attracting qualified teachers, and thus help ensure that \ndeserving students receive a quality education.\n  I would be remiss if I did not recognize that former Senator Daschle \nwas responsible for spearheading this initiative for a number of years. \nThe tribal colleges lost a true champion, but I am pleased to carry \nforward his vision and support for the colleges.\n  I am pleased that Senators Burns, Johnson, Dorgan, Kohl, Domenici, \nand Bingaman are original cosponsors of this bill, and I look forward \nto working with my colleagues to pass this important legislation.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nConrad, in sponsoring legislation to provide student loan forgiveness \nto educators who commit to teaching in our tribal colleges. This \nlegislation will provide up to $15,000 in loan forgiveness--a strong \nrecruitment and retention tool for tribal colleges which often can't \npay the same salaries as larger institutions.\n  I am, and have been for years, a strong supporter of Montana's tribal \ncolleges as well as tribal colleges nationwide. They contribute greatly \nto our Native American communities, providing the tools for our tribal \nchildren to succeed in the world of higher education. Graduates often \ncontinue their education at Montana State or the University of Montana \nand take this knowledge and expertise back to their communities. These \nstudents strengthen and improve both our tribal communities and our \nState as a whole. They add to the social, economic, political and \ncultural fabric that is unique to Indian Country.\n  I know how hard our tribal colleges work to achieve success and to \nmaintain high standards. A talented faculty is key to those goals, but \ntoo often tight budgets for tribal colleges limit their ability to \nrecruit and retain faculty. Our tribal colleges and their students \ndeserve quality teachers, and providing loan forgiveness will help \nattract and keep good faculty in what can be very rural areas.\n  In addition to forgiveness for Perkins, direct or guaranteed loans, \nthis legislation will also provide assistance for nursing faculty at \ntribal colleges. The nursing shortage is a nationwide problem, \nparticularly in rural areas and specifically in Indian Country. \nGraduates of tribal colleges often stay near or return home, and that \nholds true for nursing graduates as well. Supporting nursing programs \nat tribal colleges addresses that shortage by training professionals \nwho are familiar with the acute medical needs and cultural differences \nin rural areas and are often willing to stay and wage the battles. This \nlegislation will provide nursing loan forgiveness to nursing \ninstructors at tribal colleges and will help strengthen a valuable \nprogram in Montana and around the country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 732. A bill to authorize funds to Federal aid highways, highway \nsafety programs, and transit programs, and for other purposes; from the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works; placed on the calendar.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am introducing today the Safe, \nAccountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005, \nSAFETEA, which the Committee on Environment and Public Works reported \nout on March 16, 2005. This bill reauthorizes the Federal aid highway \nprogram which has been operating on extensions since it expired on \nSeptember 30, 2003. The bill I am introducing today is essentially S. \n1072 as passed by the Senate in the 108th Congress, with the exception \nthat the overall funding level has been changed from $318 billion over \n6 years to reflect the President's proposed funding level of $283.9 \nbillion over 6 years.\n  Last year, this body voted 76 to 21 to adopt S. 1072. Clearly, there \nwas overwhelming support for this measure\n\n[[Page S3315]]\n\nthen, and in conversations with Members this year, I am confident that \nthere is a real desire to get this bill done. We are already to take \nthe bill up on the Senate floor just as soon as it is scheduled by the \nleadership.\n  It has been nearly 18 months since the current program, \nTransportation Equity Act for the 21 Century--TEA-21, expired. To date, \nwe have done a total of six extensions with the current extension due \nto expire on May 31. This next deadline is fast approaching, and in \naddition to completing action on the floor, we still must conference \nwith the House which has a very different formula program than proposed \nlast year. We will have more challenging issues to address and need as \nmuch time as possible to do so.\n  Briefly, as in the bill passed by the Senate last year, the bill I am \nintroducing today will address several critical issues in our \ntransportation system. Specifically, the language improves on the \nexisting program in the following areas:\n  Safety: Nearly 43,000 people died in 2002 on our Nation's highways. \nThis represents the single greatest cause of accidental death in \nAmerica. The Environment and Public Works Committee bill addresses this \nby creating a new core safety program and funding it accordingly.\n  Congestion: According to the Department of Transportation, time spent \nin congestion increased from 31.7 percent in 1992 to 33.1 percent in \n2000. Based on this rate, a typical ``rush hour'' in an urbanized area \nis 5.3 hours per day. The problem is not in just urban areas; cities \nwith populations less than 500,000 have experienced the greatest growth \nin travel delays, according to the DOT. Under this proposal, we would \naddress the congestion problem by establishing a new Transportation \nFreight Gateway program which targets bottlenecks around ports and \nintermodal facilities.\n  Environment: This bill addresses the need to reduce delays in project \ndelivery in several ways. The bill contains carefully balanced language \non incorporating environmental concerns into planning and project \nreview as early as practicable, while ensuring that disagreements over \nsuch concerns don't indefinitely delay much needed transportation \nprojects. The language on the section 4(f) process will also help \nreduce unnecessary delays by enabling projects with de minimis impacts \non 4(f) resources to proceed in a timely manner.\n  Also, the bill seeks to correct the inconsistencies between the \ntransportation planning and air quality planning that must take place \nin areas in nonattainment under the Clean Air Act. The bill \nrationalizes the schedules for developing transportation plans and \ndemonstrating conformity and aligns the length of the transportation \nplan considered under conformity with the length of the air quality \nplan.\n  Equity: The bill provides all States at least 10 percent growth over \nTEA-21 while increasing the rate of return for donor States from the \ncurrent 90.5 percent to 92 percent by 2009. We maintain the TEA-21 \nscope of 92.5 percent.\n  The longer we delay enactment of a multiyear bill, we are negatively \naffecting economic growth. According to DOT estimates, every $1 billion \nof Federal Funds invested in highway improvements creates 47,000 jobs. \nThe same $1 billion investment yields $500 million in new orders for \nthe manufacturing sector and $500 million spread throughout other \nsectors of the economy.\n  States contract awards for the 2005 spring and summer construction \nseason are going out to bid. If we fail to pass this bill soon, States \nwill not know what to expect in Federal funding and the uncertainty \nwill potentially force States to delay putting these projects out for \nbid. According to the American Association of State Highway \nTransportation Officials, AASHTO, an estimated 90,000 jobs are at \nstake. This problem is exacerbated for northern States which have \nshorter construction seasons. Many State transportation departments \nhave advanced State dollars to construct projects eligible for Federal \nfunding in anticipation of our action to reauthorize the program. \nWithout a new bill, States are essentially left ``holding the bag.''\n  Over the past 6 years under TEA-21, we have made great progress in \npreserving and improving the overall physical condition and operation \nof our transportation system; however, more needs to be done. A safe, \neffective transportation system is the foundation of our economy. We \nare past due to fulfill an obligation to this country and the American \npeople.\n  As mentioned earlier, the bill is essentially the same bill that was \npassed on the Senate floor last year--a bipartisan product of many \nmonths of hard work and compromise. It remains a very good piece of \nlegislation.\n  The most significant difference with this bill, of course, is that it \nis drafted at the $283.9 billion level over 6 years. Since 2004 is \nbehind us, the Environment and Public Works Committee bill includes \nonly years 2005 to 2009 which is effectively $283.9 minus fiscal year \n2004. S. 1072 passed the Senate last year and guaranteed all donor \nStates a rate of return of 95 percent. At a lower funding level, we \nwere able only to achieve a 92-percent rate of return but kept the 10 \npercent floor over TEA-21.\n  I am certain my colleagues share my strong desire to get a \ntransportation reauthorization bill passed and signed into law by the \nPresident. I urge the leadership to schedule consideration of this bill \nthis month so we can get it done.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 738. A bill to provide relief for the cotton shirt industry; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I seek recognition to introduce \nlegislation entitled the ``Cotton Shirt Industry Tariff Relief and \nTechnical Corrections Act.'' This legislation will strengthen our \ndomestic dress shirt manufacturers and the pima cotton growers. My bill \nis a technical correction that levels the playing field by correcting \nan anomaly from previous trade agreements that has unfairly advantaged \nforeign producers and sent hundreds of jobs offshore.\n  This legislation reduces duties levied on cotton shirting fabric that \nis not made in the United States. Currently, U.S. law recognizes this \nlack of fabric availability and grants special favorable trade \nconcessions to manufacturers in Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, the \nAndean region, and Africa. The U.S. has allowed shirts to enter this \ncountry duty-free from many other countries, while we have failed to \nreduce tariffs on those manufacturers that stayed in the U.S. and were \nforced to compete on these uneven terms. My bill will correct this \ninequity.\n  This legislation also recognizes the need to creatively promote the \nU.S. shirting manufacturing and textiles sectors, and does so through \nthe creation of a Cotton Competitiveness grant program, which is funded \nthrough a portion of previously collected duties.\n  Our country has experienced an enormous loss of jobs in the \nmanufacturing sector. It is critical that our domestic manufacturers \nare able to compete on a level playing field. In the case of the \ndomestic dress shirt industry, the problem is our own government \nimposing a tariff of up to eleven percent upon the import of fabric \nmade from U.S. pima cotton. My legislation is a concrete step that this \nCongress can take to reduce the hemorrhaging of U.S. manufacturing \njobs.\n  One group of beneficiaries of this amendment is a Gitman Brothers \nfactory in Ashland, PA. The Ashland Shirt and Pajama factory was built \nin 1948 and employs 265 workers. This factory in the Lehigh Valley \nturns out world class shirts with such labels as Burberry and Saks \nFifth Avenue that are shipped across the U.S. Currently, Gitman pays an \naverage tariff of eleven percent on the fabric it imports to make \nshirts. Their shirts are made of pima cotton that is grown in the \nSouthwestern U.S., but spun into fabric only by special mills in \nWestern Europe. Gitman must compete against Canadian shirt companies \nthat import the same fabric tariff-free and who can then ship their \nshirts into the U.S. tariff-free under NAFTA. These workers and their \nfamilies deserve trade laws that do not chase their jobs offshore.\n  This legislation enjoys the support of the domestic shirting \nindustry, UNITE, and the Pima cotton associations. I offer this \nlegislation on behalf of the men and women of the Gitman factory in \nAshland, the domestic dress shirting industry, and the pima cotton \ngrowers, so that for them free trade will indeed be fair trade as well.\n\n[[Page S3316]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/06/senate-section/article/S3280-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3280-S3316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \n        Sununu, Mr. Burns, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 714. A bill to amend section 227 of the Communications Act of 1934 \n(47 U.S.C. 227) relating to the prohibition on junk fax transmissions; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Inouye and other \ncolleagues to introduce the ``Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005.'' This \nbill will strengthen existing laws by providing consumers the ability \nto prevent unsolicited fax advertisements and provide greater \nCongressional oversight of enforcement efforts by the Federal \nCommunications Commission (FCC). This bill will also help businesses by \nallowing them to continue to send faxes to their customers in a manner \nthat has proven successful with both businesses and consumers.\n  In July of 2003, the FCC reconsidered its Telephone Consumer \nProtection Act (TCPA) rules and elected to eliminate the ability for \nbusinesses to contact their customers even where there exists an \nestablished business relationship. The effect of the FCC's rule would \nbe to prevent a business from sending a fax solicitation to any person, \nwhether it is a supplier or customer, without first obtaining prior \nwritten consent. This approach, while seemingly sensible, would impose \nsignificant costs on businesses in the form of extensive record \nkeeping. Recognizing the problems created by this rule, the Commission \nhas twice delayed the effective date, with the current extension of \nstay expiring on June 30, 2005.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to preserve the established \nbusiness relationship exception currently recognized under the TCPA. In \naddition, this bill will allow consumers to opt out of receiving \nfurther unsolicited faxes. This is a new consumer protection that does \nnot exist under the TCPA today.\n  We believe that this bipartisan bill strikes the appropriate balance \nin providing significant protections to consumers from unwanted \nunsolicited fax advertisements and preserves the many benefits that \nresult from legitimate fax communications.\n  In the 108th Congress, this legislation passed both the Senate and \nHouse but was not signed into law prior to the adjournment of Congress. \nWe hope that both the Senate and House can pass this legislation in a \ntimely manner, prior to June 30, 2005, when the FCC's stay expires.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 714\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage investment in facilities using wind to produce electricity, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today the Wind Power Tax \nIncentives Act of 2005. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Dayton, \nDurbin and Lautenburg. This legislation makes it easier for farmers and \nothers around the country to invest in wind power for commercial \nelectricity production. Wind power is a clean, economical, and reliable \nsource of renewable energy abundant on farms and in rural areas of Iowa \nand elsewhere.\n  With this legislation we can help farmers help themselves by \ndeveloping a new source of income, and help the rest of the country in \nthe production of renewable energy. Farmers are ready to take on this \nchallenge. A recent study found that 93 percent of corn producers \nsupport wind energy. They also strongly support the 2002 farm bill's \nhistoric energy title.\n  This regulation complements the farm bill's energy programs and other \nwind power initiatives currently being\n\n[[Page S3282]]\n\nconsidered by this body, and is strongly supported by the American Wind \nEnergy Association and John Deere. Our bill changes Federal tax law to \nmake the section 45 wind production tax credit more widely available to \nfarmers, farm cooperatives, and other investors. Section 45 of the \nFederal tax code provides a tax credit, currently 1.8 cents per \nkilowatt-hour, for electricity produced and sold during the first ten \nyears of the life of a wind turbine. The credit has been \nextraordinarily successful in spurring greater installation of new wind \npower capacity, making this sustainable energy source economically \nfeasible. However, certain barriers have prevented many farmers and \nother investors from qualifying for the credit, thus impeding their \nparticipation.\n  It is time to allow full participation by farmers and other investors \nin this important tax incentive. Our legislation removes barriers by \nmaking two important changes to the tax code.\n  First, under current tax law most losses, deductions, and credits \nfrom passive investments cannot affect wages or other income or reduce \ntaxes on such income. So a farmer who passively invests in wind energy \ncould not use the credits to offset taxes on farm income. This bill \ncreates an exception to passive loss restrictions for an interest in a \nwind facility that qualifies for the section 45 credit. The wind \nfacility's loss or tax credits could then offset the income or taxes \narising from the taxpayer's farming business. Existing law provides an \neven broader exception for oil and gas investments, but in contrast to \nexisting law, our proposed exception for wind investment applies only \nto those with income under $1 million, in order to avoid potential \nwindfalls or abuse.\n  Second, the bill allows cooperatives to invest in qualified wind \nfacilities and pass through the section 45 credits to cooperative \nmembers. This will allow farmers to join together and pool their \nresources in a cooperative and still take advantage of the credit.\n  When we first introduced this bill in the 108th Congress, it also \ncontained a measure providing alternative minimum tax (AMT) relief. \nThis important piece of the equation was incorporated late last year in \nthe American Jobs Creation Act, and passed into law. But there's more \nto be done.\n  The benefits of this legislation are obvious. Increased renewable \nenergy production lessens our dependence on foreign oil, provides \nenvironmental and public health gains, bolsters farm income, creates \njobs and boosts economic growth, especially in rural areas. The Nation \nmust move toward energy security, and domestically produced wind power, \nalong with other forms of renewable energy like biofuels, plays an \nimportant part in this endeavor.\n  I want to thank Senators Dayton, Durbin and Lautenburg for co-\nsponsoring this legislation with me. Their leadership in this area will \nbe instrumental to moving the bill forward. I am hopeful we can pass \nthis legislation soon to help secure a brighter renewable energy future \nfor our Nation's farmers and all citizens.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 715\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to enhance \nservices provided by vet centers, to clarify and improve the provision \nof bereavement counseling by the Department of Veterans Affairs, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Vet Center \nEnhancement Act of 2005.'' This legislation would enhance care and \nservices provided through Vet Centers. Since their establishment over \n25 years ago, Vet Centers have become a safe place in the community \nwhere more and more veterans and their families have turned for \nassistance and services. This legislation would provide resources that \nVet Centers need to serve and reach out to the growing number of \nOperation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) \nveterans and surviving family members.\n  The legislation would allow the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \nto hire an additional 50 Global War on Terror outreach coordinators, \nstrike the three-year authorization provision for these outreach \nworkers, clarify that Vet Centers can provide bereavement counseling to \nfamily members including parents, and provide more funding for the Vet \nCenter program.\n  In February 2004, VA authorized the Vet Center program to hire 50 \nOEF/OIF veterans to conduct outreach to their fellow Global War on \nTerrorism veterans. There are still many OEF/OIF veterans in need of \nreadjustment services, which requires more workers. This legislation \nwould authorize the hiring of 50 additional outreach coordinators to \nreach this underserved population of veterans. In addition, this \nlegislation would also repeal the three-\n\n[[Page S3283]]\n\nyear authorization provision placed on these positions.\n  The number of brave servicemembers who die while defending freedom \ncontinues to rise, leaving many surviving family members in need for \nhelp. Under current law, VA has the authority to provide bereavement \ncounseling to the immediate family. However, it is necessary to clarify \nthat parents of a deceased servicemember qualify for this bereavement \ncounseling and that such care could be provided at Vet Centers. This \nlegislation would make the clarifications.\n  A recent article in the Washington Post detailed a mother's \nexperience after her son was killed in Iraq and how she finally felt \nrelief at an unexpected place, a Vet Center. The article also provided \ninformation concerning the Vet Center bereavement program and discussed \nthe need for clarification of the Vet Center bereavement care program. \nThis article paints a clear picture of the distress that surviving \nfamily members endure as a result of the death of a beloved soldier. I \nask unanimous consent that the text of The Washington Post article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  As the War on Terrorism persists, the number of veterans seeking \nreadjustment counseling and related mental health services through Vet \nCenters will continue to grow. Experts predict that as many as 30 \npercent of those returning servicemembers may need psychiatric care. \nFor these returning servicemembers who have suffered psychological \nwounds, the stigma surrounding these types of wounds creates a barrier \nthat often times prevents them from seeking the care they need. Vet \nCenters, which have licensed mental health professionals, provide a \nmeans to overcome this barrier because of the center's location in the \ncommunity and because veteran staff members can relate to the \nexperiences of the veterans seeking services. In 2004, Vet Centers \ncared for 9,597 OEF/OIF veterans and 2005 projections are that Vet \nCenters will see 12,656 OEF/OIF veterans.\n  Despite increases in the number of veterans coming for care to Vet \nCenters, the budget for the program has remained stagnant. This \nlegislation would authorize funding for the program from $93 million to \n$180 million.\n  We must make the readjustment period for the returning service \nmembers and the surviving family members of deceased servicemembers as \nsmooth as possible.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 24, 2005]\n\n                 VA Program Offers Solace to Civilians\n\n                           (By David Finkel)\n\n       Her son had been killed in Iraq, and Hope Veverka needed \n     someone to talk to.\n       ``It was so horrific, the pain,'' said Veverka, the mother \n     of Army Pfc. Brandon Sapp, who died in August when he drove \n     his vehicle over a remote-controlled bomb. ``I didn't want it \n     to destroy me.''\n       Unable to sleep, Veverka, 45, tried a hospice-based program \n     for dealing with grief. Unable to stop thinking about the \n     person who was the last to see her son while deliberately \n     pushing a detonator, she talked to friends and attended a \n     support group for parents who lost children. All helped \n     somewhat, she says, but it was in an unexpected place--a \n     readjustment center for veterans--where she finally felt some \n     relief.\n       ``These guys, they have served,'' Veverka said of the \n     counselors she sees weekly at the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs' Vet Center near her home in West Palm Beach, Fla. \n     ``They get it. I can just talk, and they understand.''\n       More and more relatives of service members who died are \n     learning the same thing, that because of a new bereavement \n     program, vet centers are not just for veterans anymore. In \n     August 2003, as the number of fatalities in Iraq passed the \n     250 mark, the 206 vet centers across the United States began \n     offering counseling and bereavement services to immediate \n     relatives of anyone in the military to die while on active \n     duty.\n       The program marks the first time that non-veterans have \n     been eligible for a benefit previously restricted to \n     veterans. Before the program began, civilian family members \n     might go to a vet center as part of a living veteran's \n     counseling but had to go elsewhere if they needed counseling \n     of their own.\n       ``It's a big deal,'' said Alfonso Batres, chief of the VA's \n     Office of Readjustment Counseling. ``And the families are so \n     grateful that anything is being done.''\n       The program, which is free and allows unlimited visits, had \n     367 participants in connection with 252 deaths as of Feb. 1. \n     Eighty-six of the 367 were spouses, 119 were mothers, 64 were \n     fathers, 60 were siblings, 37 were children and one was a \n     grandparent.\n       Batres says the numbers would be higher, but privacy \n     concerns prohibit counselors from contacting people to see \n     whether they are interested in getting help. Instead, initial \n     contact must come from the family members.\n       Typically, relatives are referred to the program by \n     military casualty-assistance officers, who are the ones to \n     notify them of the death of their loved ones. A civilian \n     organization called TAPS, the Tragedy Assistance Program for \n     Survivors, which offers around-the-clock grief counseling \n     and peer support--but does not have professionally trained \n     counselors as at a vet center--also refers people to the \n     program.\n       ``It's really, really significant,'' TAPS founder and \n     chairman Bonnie Carroll said of the VA's decision to treat \n     family members. ``From our perspective, it has just been \n     revolutionary.''\n       Batres says that implementing the program has not been \n     problem-free. Especially in the early months, he says, some \n     counselors complained that they already had more to do than \n     they could handle. Others were concerned that expanding the \n     centers' mandate to non-veterans could create a bad \n     precedent.\n       The provisional status of the program has also been \n     unsettling to some. Batres says he had hoped to get the \n     program authorized by Congress, which would have given it a \n     sense of permanence, but instead it was approved as an \n     unfunded initiative at the discretion of the secretary of the \n     VA.\n       Nonetheless, Batres says, as the months have gone by, the \n     nature of the work has changed the misgivings of his staff \n     into a shared sense of mission. ``It's akin to going to a \n     disaster site'' is how he describes the work. ``This is a \n     death site. It's almost like going into a sacred place.''\n       Joe Griffis, a counselor at the vet center in Lake Worth, \n     Fla., agrees that this first venture into treating non-\n     veterans is worthwhile. ``We're here to help the veteran,'' \n     he said, ``and when they've been killed, it's the closest we \n     can get to them to give them that service.''\n       Griffis says he has treated family members connected to \n     five deaths, four of which occurred from enemy fire and one \n     by suicide.\n       ``They come in with grief, with a great sense of loss, \n     often with guilt feelings about what they could have done, \n     angry at the government, angry at God, angry at the child \n     himself,'' he said of his clients, most of whom have been \n     parents.\n       Rather than diagnosing a condition, he says, his goal is to \n     ``let them ventilate all of their feelings. Their anger. \n     Their grief. Their sadness. No matter what it's about. And \n     let them have a feeling of relief before they walk out of the \n     session.''\n       Veverka, who is one of Griffis's clients, says that is \n     exactly what has happened to her in her weekly sessions.\n       ``There was something lacking,'' she said of the support \n     groups she attended in the first days after her son's death, \n     where she found herself undifferentiated from the parents \n     whose child had died of leukemia and the parents whose child \n     had been killed crossing a street. ``It was only addressing \n     half of my emotions. I needed something with the military.''\n       Try the vet center, someone suggested.\n       ``So I went,'' she said of a place so familiar to her now \n     that counselors have hung a photograph of her son for her to \n     see every time she walks in the door, ``and it ended up being \n     the door I needed.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. McConnell, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Corzine, and Ms. \n        Cantwell):\n  S. 718. A bill to amend title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \nStreets Act of 1968 to provide standards and procedures to guide both \nState and local law enforcement agencies and law enforcement officers \nduring internal investigations, interrogation of law enforcement \nofficers, and administrative disciplinary hearings, and to ensure \naccountability of law enforcement officers, to guarantee the due \nprocess rights of law enforcement officers, and to require States to \nenact law enforcement discipline, accountability, and due process laws; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the State and Local Law \nEnforcement Discipline, Accountability, and Due Process Act of 2005, \nalong with Senator Specter, Senator McConnell, Senator Chambliss, \nSenator Dayton, Senator Murray, Senator Corzine, and Senator Cantwell.\n  These are trying times for the men and women on our front lines who \nprovide our domestic security and public safety--our Nation's law \nenforcement personnel. In fact, our men and women in blue are facing \nwhat I have called a perfect storm. First, they are being called upon \nto undertake more responsibilities than ever before. They are being \nrequired to undertake homeland security duties that weren't required \nbefore September 11, and, at the same time, the FBI is reprogramming \nits field agents from crime to terrorism\n\n[[Page S3284]]\n\ncases. While I don't disagree that this shift in resources is \nappropriate, it undoubtedly leaves a gap in law enforcement efforts to \ncombat drugs and crime, and State and local agencies must fill this \ngap. At the same time, budget shortages at the local level are forcing \npersonnel lay-offs, an increasing use of overtime to meet demand, and \nthe forced elimination of critical crime prevention programs. Local law \nenforcement is struggling to keep up with service calls. To add insult \nto injury, Federal assistance for State and local law enforcement has \nbeen reduced by billions over the last 2 years--with the proposed \nelimination of the COPS hiring program--a proven initiative that has \nbeen hailed as one of the keys to the crime-drop of the nineties. Quite \nsimply, we are asking law enforcement to do more with less, and I \nbelieve that public safety is being compromised as a result of \nCongress's unfortunate choices on the Federal budget.\n  We may argue about the Federal responsibility to provide financial \nassistance to State and local law enforcement, however, few will \ndispute the sacrifices that our men and women in law enforcement make \nfor our nation. Indeed, they face one of the most difficult work \nenvironments imaginable--an average of 165 police officers are killed \nin the line of duty every year. Our Nation's law enforcement officers \nput themselves in harms way on a daily basis to ensure the safety of \ntheir fellow citizens and the domestic security of our Nation. \nNevertheless, many times these brave officers do not receive basic \nrights if they become involved in internal police investigations or \nadministrative hearings. According to the National Association of \nPolice Organizations, ``[i]n roughly half of the states in this \ncountry, officers enjoy some legal protections against false \naccusations and abusive conduct, but hundreds of thousands of officers \nhave very limited due process rights and confront limitations on their \nexercise of other rights, such as the right to engage in political \nactivities.'' Similarly, the Fraternal Order of Police notes that, \n``[i]n a startling number of jurisdictions throughout this country, law \nenforcement officers have no procedural or administrative protections \nwhatsoever; in fact, they can be, and frequently are, summarily \ndismissed from their jobs without explanation. Officers who lose their \ncareers due to administrative or political expediency almost always \nfind it impossible to find new employment in public safety. An \nofficer's reputation, once tarnished by accusation, is almost \nimpossible to restore.''\n  The legislation that we introduce today, which is endorsed by the \nFraternal Order of Police and of the National Association of Police \nOrganizations, seeks to provide officers with certain basic protections \nin those jurisdictions where such workplace protections are not \ncurrently provided. First, this bill allows law enforcement officials \nto engage in political activities when they are off-duty. Second, it \nprovides standards and procedures to guide State and local law \nenforcement agencies during internal investigations, interrogations, \nand administrative disciplinary hearings. Additionally, it calls upon \nStates to develop and enforce these disciplinary procedures. The bill \nwould preempt State laws which confer fewer rights than those provided \nfor in the legislation, but it would not preempt any State or local \nlaws that confer rights or protections that are equal to or exceed the \nrights and protections afforded in the bill. For example, my own State \nof Delaware has a law enforcement officers' bill of rights, and those \nprocedures would not be impacted by the provisions of this bill.\n\n  This bill will also include important provisions that will enhance \nthe ability of citizens to hold their local police departments \naccountable. The legislation includes provisions that will ensure \ncitizen complaints against police officers are investigated and that \ncitizens are informed of the outcome of these investigations. The bill \nbalances the rights of police officers with the rights of citizens to \nraise valid concerns about the conduct of some of these officers. In \naddition, I have consulted with constitutional experts who have opined \nthat the bill is consistent with Congress' powers under the Commerce \nClause and that it does not run afoul of the Supreme Court's Tenth \nAmendment jurisprudence.\n  I would also like to note that I understand the objections that many \nmanagement groups, including the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice, have to this measure. I have discussed this with them, and I've \npledged that their views will be heard and considered as this bill is \ndebated in Congress. It is my view that we must bridge this gap. \nWithout a meeting of the minds between police management and union \nofficials, the enactment of a meaningful law enforcement officers' bill \nof rights will be difficult. Law enforcement officials are facing \nunprecedented challenges, and management and labor simply must work \ntogether on this issue and the numerous other issues facing the law \nenforcement community.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senators Specter, McConnell, Chambliss, \nDayton, Murray, Corzine, Cantwell, and me in providing all of the \nNation's law enforcement officers with the basic rights they deserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 718\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``State and Local Law \n     Enforcement Discipline, Accountability, and Due Process Act \n     of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the rights of law enforcement officers to engage in \n     political activity or to refrain from engaging in political \n     activity, except when on duty, or to run as candidates for \n     public office, unless such service is found to be in conflict \n     with their service as officers, are activities protected by \n     the first amendment of the United States Constitution, as \n     applied to the States through the 14th amendment of the \n     United States Constitution, but these rights are often \n     violated by the management of State and local law enforcement \n     agencies;\n       (2) a significant lack of due process rights of law \n     enforcement officers during internal investigations and \n     disciplinary proceedings has resulted in a loss of confidence \n     in these processes by many law enforcement officers, \n     including those unfairly targeted for their labor \n     organization activities or for their aggressive enforcement \n     of the laws, demoralizing many rank and file officers in \n     communities and States;\n       (3) unfair treatment of officers has potentially serious \n     long-term consequences for law enforcement by potentially \n     deterring or otherwise preventing officers from carrying out \n     their duties and responsibilities effectively and fairly;\n       (4) the lack of labor-management cooperation in \n     disciplinary matters and either the perception or the \n     actuality that officers are not treated fairly detrimentally \n     impacts the recruitment of and retention of effective \n     officers, as potential officers and experienced officers seek \n     other careers, which has serious implications and \n     repercussions for officer morale, public safety, and labor-\n     management relations and strife and can affect interstate and \n     intrastate commerce, interfering with the normal flow of \n     commerce;\n       (5) there are serious implications for the public safety of \n     the citizens and residents of the United States which \n     threatens the domestic tranquility of the United States \n     because of a lack of statutory protections to ensure--\n       (A) the due process and political rights of law enforcement \n     officers;\n       (B) fair and thorough internal investigations and \n     interrogations of and disciplinary proceedings against law \n     enforcement officers; and\n       (C) effective procedures for receipt, review, and \n     investigation of complaints against officers, fair to both \n     officers and complainants; and\n       (6) resolving these disputes and problems and preventing \n     the disruption of vital police services is essential to the \n     well-being of the United States and the domestic tranquility \n     of the Nation.\n       (b) Declaration of Policy.--Congress declares that it is \n     the purpose of this Act and the policy of the United States \n     to--\n       (1) protect the due process and political rights of State \n     and local law enforcement officers and ensure equality and \n     fairness of treatment among such officers;\n       (2) provide continued police protection to the general \n     public;\n       (3) provide for the general welfare and ensure domestic \n     tranquility; and\n       (4) prevent any impediments to the free flow of commerce, \n     under the rights guaranteed under the United States \n     Constitution and Congress' authority thereunder.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to extend Corridor O of the Appalachian Development \nHighway System from its currnet southern terminus at I-68 near \nCumberland to Corridor H, which stretches from Weston, West Virginia, \nto Strasburg, Virginia; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nadd a 35.5 mile segment of a proposed new highway, extending south of \nInterstate 68 near Cumberland, MD to Corridor H in West Virginia, to \nthe Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS). Joining me in co-\nsponsoring this legislation is my colleague Senator Mikulski.\n  The development of a north-south Appalachian highway corridor has \nlong been a priority for elected officials, community leaders and \ncitizens in the Potomac Highlands region of western Maryland, West \nVirginia and neighboring Pennsylvania counties. At least two Maryland \nState economic development task forces over the last decade have \nidentified a north-south corridor as their leading priority for the \nregion. In order to help determine the need, potential alignments as \nwell as the projected economic benefits and the social, transportation \nand environmental impacts of upgrading north-south corridors, six years \nago, I helped secure a grant from the Federal Highway Administration to \nsupport a multi-state study. That study was completed in 2001 and \nidentified two corridors as having the greatest potential for \nbenefiting Appalachian economic development the US 219 Corridor in the \nnorth from I-68 in Maryland to the Pennsylvania Turnpike and the US 220 \nCorridor in south from Corridor H in West Virginia to I-68 in Maryland. \nThe study also found that upgrading US 220 South of Interstate 68 would \nsupport the largest number of potential new jobs, 7,800-8,600 jobs, \nwith the highest relative growth--19 percent--of any of the corridors \nand have fewer impacts than the alternatives.\n  While US 220 north of I-68 is part of the ADHS, the segment south of \nthe interstate is not currently part of the system, although it serves \nAppalachia. This area in Allegany County, MD--a county that has \nexperienced some of the highest rates of unemployment and poverty in \nthe State--has been targeted for economic development and job growth in \nthe ``One Maryland'' economic development program. Major employers in \nthe area--American Woodmark, Aliant Techsystems and MeadWestvaco--as \nwell as others that might look at this region for the location of their \nnext plant currently depend on a two-lane roadway running through \nresidential neighborhoods and commercial areas. The area is well served \nby an important east and west corridor, I-68 (ADHS Corridor E), but \nNorth South transportation is inadequate and hampers the economic \nprosperity potential of Allegany and Garrett Counties and many of the \nsurrounding Pennsylvania and West Virginia communities.\n  Over the past four years, and with additional funding provided by the \nCongress in the Fiscal 2003 Transportation Appropriations bill, \nMaryland and West Virginia have been undertaking a detailed project \nplanning phase of the 35.5 mile segment of US 220 south that was \nrecommended in the feasibility study. Improvements which have been \nproposed include a four-lane divided highway, most of which would be on \na new alignment, with at-grade intersections. Fifteen miles of the \nproposed road improvements are in Maryland and 20.5 miles in West \nVirginia.\n  These upgrades would increase safety and alleviate traffic congestion \nbetween Cumberland and Keyser and provide an important link to the 83.2 \nmiles of Appalachian Development Highways in Maryland and in the system \nof 28 corridors throughout the 13 Appalachian States. The corridor \nwould interconnect several important ADHS corridors including the East-\nWest Corridors P in Pennsylvania, E (I-68) in Maryland & West Virginia, \nH in West Virginia and Virginia along with the ADHS North-South \nCorridor O and Corridor N from Pennsylvania to the North. Currently ARC \nCorridors O & N dead end at I-68, and the closest interstate quality \nroad continuing south is I-81 seventy miles east, or I-79 that is \nseventy miles to the west. The new Appalachian highway would also \nprovide important linkages to the bi-State, Maryland and West Virginia, \nGreater Cumberland Airport, rail facilities in the area, and population \ncenters of Cumberland, Maryland, Keyser, West Virginia, Romney, West \nVirginia, and Moorefield, West Virginia.\n  The Congress recognized the need to help bring the Appalachian Region \ninto the mainstream of the American economy in 1965 when it created the \nAppalachian Region Commission and authorized the Appalachian \nDevelopment Highway System. Now, some 40 years later, with the original \nADHS more than 85 percent complete or under construction, it is time to \nprovide critical linkages to the east-west ADHS corridors, population \ncenters, other inter-modal facilities such as air and rail, and the \nexisting interstate system and to further boost the region's \nopportunity to advance towards economic parity. I hope that the \nCongress will swiftly approve this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VITTER:\n  S. 721.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reduce the tax on beer to \nits pre-1991 level. In 1990, Congress raised taxes on luxury items like \nexpensive cars, fur coats, jewelry, yachts and private airplanes and \ndoubled the Federal excise tax on beer.\n  This was the single largest tax increase on beer in American history \nand resulted in some 60,000 people losing\n\n[[Page S3290]]\n\ntheir jobs in brewing, distributing, retailing and related industries. \nThe tax burden on beer is higher than the average consumer good in the \nAmerican economy, an astounding 44 percent of its retail price. As a \nresult of this tax increase the Government collects approximately seven \ntimes more in beer taxes than the Nation's brewers make in profits.\n  The doubling of the beer excise tax in 1990 was regressive, and \ntherefore unfair, because it hits lower income taxpayers the hardest. \nMost beer consumers have household incomes below $40,000. Regular beer \ndrinkers--Americans raising a family--are the people most affected by \nthe increase in the Federal excise tax on beer. Lowering the beer tax \nmeans more money in the pockets of these hard-working men and women.\n  The beer excise tax was first enacted as an emergency measure to help \nfinance the Civil War. It is an anachronism in our tax code. Since its \nenactment, dozens of corporate and payroll taxes have been imposed on \nbrewers just as they have on other businesses. Yet the beer excise tax \nremains. A rollback of just the 1990 beer tax increase would also help \nmaintain good-paying American manufacturing jobs and will create new \nopportunities and a boost to the economy. The U.S. system of alcohol \nbeverage control has been the maintenance of a domestic presence for \nthe industry with independent supplier, wholesale and retail tiers. \nBrewers, wholesalers and retailers are heavily regulated and to the \nextent the U.S. maintains a strong domestic industry, the Federal, \nState and local agencies will continue to ensure accountability and \nresponsible business practices.\n  The brewing industry has a major presence in many U.S. cities and \nprovides a significant source of manufacturing jobs. The industry \ndirectly and indirectly accounts for close to 2.5 million jobs \nnationwide--a reduction of the beer tax would help brewers maintain or \ngrow their workforce. Brewing, wholesaling and retail combined \ncontribute over 41,000 jobs to the economy of my home State of \nPennsylvania.\n  All of the other luxury taxes enacted in 1990 have been repealed. Yet \nthe beer tax increase remains in place. It is time to roll back the \nFederal excise tax increase on beer and provide another measure of tax \nrelief to America's working men and women. The Federal Government will \nstill collect almost $3.7 billion in excise taxes and the industry will \npay an additional $21 billion in Federal, State, and local taxes. This \nis a modest and reasonable measure of tax relief to a significant \nAmerican industry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Bond, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 723. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nsmall businesses to set up simple cafeteria plans to provide nontaxable \nemployee benefits to their employees, to make changes in the \nrequirements for cafeteria plans, flexible spending accounts, and \nbenefits provided under such plans or accounts, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the SIMPLE \nCafeteria Plan Act of 2005'' to increase the access to quality, \naffordable health care for millions of small business owners and their \nemployees. I am pleased that my good friend from Missouri, Senator \nBond, as well as my good friend Senator Bingaman from New Mexico have \nagreed to co-sponsor this critical piece of legislation.\n  Regrettably, our Nation's healthcare system is in the midst of a \ncrisis. Each year, more and more Americans are unable to purchase \nhealth insurance, and there are no signs that things are improving. As \nevidence, the United States Census Bureau estimates that nearly 47 \nmillion people did not have health insurance coverage for all of 2002. \nSadly, this number rose from 41.2 million uninsured persons in 2001--a \n14.6 percent increase.\n  As if these numbers on a national scale are not alarming enough, the \nresults are even more troubling when we look specifically at the small \nbusiness sector of our economy. Analysis conducted by the Employee \nBenefit Research Institute, a nonpartisan group dedicated to ensuring \nthat all workers have access to affordable health care, suggests that \nthe highest rates of uninsured occur among either self-employed workers \nor workers whose employer employees fewer than 25 persons. When \ncompared to workers in firms that employ 1,000 or more employees, where \njust 12.6 percent of those workers do not have health insurance, it \nbecomes clear that the majority of uninsured Americans work for small \nenterprises. Clearly, these numbers suggest that there is a direct \ncorrelation among those persons who do not have health insurance and \nthe size of their employer.\n  The question, then, is why are our Nation's small businesses, which \nare our country's job creators and the true engine of our national \neconomy, so disadvantaged when it comes to purchasing health insurance.\n  The main reason that small business owners are not able to offer \ntheir employees health insurance is because many small business owners \nare able to pay only a portion of their employees' health insurance \npremiums or, even worse, cannot afford to provide any health insurance \nor other employee benefits at all. As a result, many small business \nworkers must acquire health insurance from the private sector rather \nthan the work place--an unfair, and far more expensive alternative.\n  Clearly, we have a problem on our hands. While we can debate among \nourselves why this crisis exists and how we ended up here, what is not \nopen for debate is that we need to start identifying ways to fix the \nsystem because it is simply unconscionable to do nothing while more and \nmore Americans find themselves without health care.\n  As you know, I re-introduced a bill earlier this year that will go a \nlong ways towards improving the situation by creating Associated Health \nPlans for small businesses. In general, this bill would permit small \nbusinesses throughout the country to band together for purposes of \nobtaining an insurance quote from an insurance company. By pooling \nthese businesses together, they would pay lower premiums because of the \nincreased risk pool.\n  Again, this bill would increase the number of Americans that would be \nable to afford health insurance because their insurance premiums would \nbe based on a more reasonable number. The bill I am introducing today \nbuilds upon this and goes a step further by putting more small business \nowners and their employees on a level playing field when compared to \nworkers of a larger company.\n  Specifically, many large companies and even the Federal government \nenable their employees to purchase health insurance and other qualified \nbenefits with taxfree dollars. Larger companies are able to do this by \nqualifying for certain employee benefit delivery mechanisms under the \ntax code.\n  One such delivery mechanism is a cafeteria plan. As the name \nsuggests, cafeteria plans are programs whereby employers offer their \nemployees the opportunity to purchase certain qualified benefits of \ntheir choosing. The key here is that the employer provides the \nopportunity for the employee to purchase the benefit, and the employee \nis then free to chose whether to participate and which benefits to buy. \nUnder current law, qualified benefits include health insurance, \ndependent-care reimbursement, and life and disability insurance. \nTypically, employer contributions, employee contributions, or a \ncombination of the two fund these plans.\n  Cafeteria plans offer valuable benefits to employees and are popular \nfor many reasons. Specifically, they offer employees great flexibility \nin selecting their desired benefits while enabling them to disregard \nthose benefits that do not fit their particular needs. Participating \nemployees are also able to exclude any wages that they contribute to a \ncafeteria plan from their Federal taxable income, Social Security, and \nMedicare, which means they are using more valuable pre-tax dollars to \nbuy these benefits. Moreover, the employees are usually purchasing \nthese benefits at a lower cost because employers are oftentimes able to \nobtain a reduced price for the benefits through a group rate after they \nestablish a cafeteria plan.\n  Cafeteria plans also provide employers with valuable benefits, most \nnotably as a recruiting tool. It certainly stands to reason that if \nmore small business owners are able to offer their employees the chance \nto enjoy a variety of employee benefits, these owners\n\n[[Page S3291]]\n\nthen will be more likely to attract, recruit, and retain more talented \nworkers, which will ultimately increase the firm's business output. Too \noften, we hear that small businesses loose skilled employees to larger \ncompanies simply because a big firm is able to offer a more attractive \nbenefit package. Given that small businesses are responsible for a \nmajority of the new jobs created in this country, we need to reverse \nthat trend, and this bill will go a long way in rectifying this \ninequity.\n  Clearly, cafeteria plans play a critical role in our Nation's health \ncare system and economy in general. The problem, though, is that in \norder for companies to qualify for the tax benefits that cafeteria \nplans provide, they must satisfy strict nondiscrimination rules under \nthe tax code. These rules exist to ensure that the benefits offered to \nhighly compensated employees are offered to non-highly compensated \nemployees as well. The rules also strive to ensure that non-highly \ncompensated employees in fact receive a substantial portion of the \nbenefits provided under the plan.\n  Now I want to be clear when I say that these non-discrimination rules \nserve a legitimate purpose. Indeed, we need to be sure that employers \nare not able to game the tax system by implementing these cafeteria \nplans, and that the cafeteria plans that qualify for preferential tax \ntreatment are used by a majority of the employees in the company.\n  However, what I find to be unacceptable is the way the tax code \nattempts to implement this policy under the existing rules. Currently, \nmany small businesses simply cannot satisfy these mechanical rules \nbecause, through no fault of their own, they have relatively few \nemployees and a high proportion of owners or highly compensated \nindividuals. As such, were a small business to create a cafeteria plan \nand violate the non-discrimination rules, certain workers within the \ncompany would be subject to a penalty and would be required to include \na substantial portion of their contributions in their taxable income.\n  Consequently, many small companies simply do not even bother to \nimplement a cafeteria plan for fear that they will violate the non-\ndiscrimination rules. According to the Employer's Council on Flexible \nCompensation, while 38.36 million U.S. workers had access to cafeteria \nplans in 1999, only 19 percent of those workers were employees of small \nbusinesses.\n  To improve the current situation, the bill I am introducing today \nwill allow and encourage more small businesses to offer employees the \nopportunity to purchase health insurance with tax-free dollars just as \nlarger companies and the federal government do. My bill accomplishes \nthis by creating a Simple Cafeteria Plan, which is modeled after the \nSavings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) pension plan. As \nwith the SIMPLE pension plan, a small business employer that is willing \nto make a minimum contribution for all employees or who is willing to \nmatch contributions will be permitted to waive the non-discrimination \nrules that currently prevent these owners from otherwise offering these \nbenefits. This structure has worked extraordinarily well in the pension \narea with little risk of abuse, and I am confident that it will be just \nas successful when it comes to broad-based benefits offered through \ncafeteria plans.\n\n  Under the SIMPLE Cafeteria Plan, small companies will not have to \nstruggle with satisfying the burdensome non-discrimination rules that \noften prevent them from offering valuable employee benefits to their \nworkers. As a result, more small business employers will be able to \nprovide their workers with the employee benefits that are often \nreserved for larger employers and that are otherwise unavailable \nbecause of the non-discrimination rules.\n  In addition my bill will expand the types of qualified benefits that \nwill be able to be offered under ALL cafeteria plans--both those that \nqualify under existing law as well as the new SIMPLE cafeteria plans \nthat will be created. Specifically, my bill modifies the rules \ngoverning benefits offered under cafeteria plans, such as flexible \nspending accounts and dependent-care assistance plans that many larger \nemployers offer their employees. These modifications will increase the \nlikelihood that employees of small businesses will utilize the \navailable benefits and that will increase the benefits provided for all \nemployees.\n  For example, current rules impose a ``use it or lose it'' requirement \nwith respect to flexible spending arrangement contributions. This means \nthat the employee forfeits any money he or she contributes to the \naccount but does not use during the plan. My bill would change that \nrule and allow employees to carry over up to $500 remaining in their \naccount to the next plan year. The bill would also permit employees to \ncarry-over any unused funds to a retirement account such as a 401(k) \nplan.\n  In either case, any carried over contributions will reduce the amount \nthat the employee otherwise would be able to contribute to the spending \narrangement in the following year so that the carry-over option will \nnot produce a greater dollar benefit for any employee. As a result, \nmore employees are likely to participate in these spending arrangements \nbecause they will ultimately be able to use any funds that they \ncontribute without any fear of forfeiting them simply because the funds \nwere not used in the year of contribution.\n  Additionally, this legislation modifies rules that pertain to \nemployer-provided, dependent-care assistance plans. First, it would \nincrease the current $5,000 annual contribution limitation of these \nplans to $10,000 if the contributing employee claims two or more \ndependents on his or her tax return. This increase is significant \nbecause it will provide these taxpayers with an opportunity to care for \nnot only their children but also an elderly family member who is a \ndependent of an employee--a scenario that will become increasingly more \nlikely as the current baby-boomer generation continues to age.\n  Second, this bill would amend the current non-discrimination rules \nthat dependent-care assistance plans must satisfy. As is often the case \nwith the majority of small business owners who cannot, through any \nfault of their own, satisfy the non-discrimination rules for \nestablishing a cafeteria plan, these rules often prevent the owner from \noffering this valuable benefit to their employees. To remedy this \ninequity, this bill would change the current mechanical thresholds such \nthat more small businesses can provide dependent-care assistance plans \nto their employees but in a manner that does not encourage the type of \nabuse that the non-discrimination rules are intended to prevent.\n  Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy. According \nto the Small Business Administration, small businesses represent 99 \npercent of all employers, employ 51 percent of the private-sector \nworkforce, and contribute 51 percent of the private-sector output. It \nis therefore critical that small businesses owners are able to offer \ntheir employees the benefits that cafeteria plans provide so that more \nof our nation's workers have the opportunity to purchase quality \nhealthcare and provide security for their families.\n  The ``SIMPLE Cafeteria Plan Act of 2005'' achieves those objectives, \nand it does so in a manner that the employers and employees are able to \nafford. Although the use of pre-tax dollars to acquire these benefits \nreduces current federal revenues, the opportunity to provide small \nbusiness employees these same benefits to workers and their families \nrather than relying on the public sector more than justifies this \nminimal investment. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this important legislation as we work with you to enact this \nbill into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 723\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce with \nSenators Durbin and Salazar a very important piece of legislation, \n``The No Child Left Behind Reform Act.'' This legislation makes three \nbasic changes to the No Child Left Behind Act which was signed into law \nin January of 2002.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act received the support of this Senator and \neighty-six of our colleagues. Like most, if not all, of our colleagues \nwho supported this bill, I supported it because I care about improving \nthe quality of education in America for all of our children. I believed \nthat this law would help to achieve that goal by establishing more \nrigorous standards for measuring student achievement, by helping \nteachers do a better job of instructing students, and last but not \nleast, by providing the resources desperately needed by our schools for \neven the most basic necessities to help put the reforms we passed into \nplace.\n  Regrettably, the high hopes that I and many others had for this law \nhave not been realized. The law is being implemented by the \nAdministration in a manner that is inflexible, unreasonable and \nunhelpful to students. Furthermore, the law is not only failing to help \nteachers do their best in the classroom, it also reflects, along with \nother Administration policies and pronouncements, a neglect and even \nhostility towards members of the teaching profession.\n  Worse still, the Administration's promise of sufficient resources to \nimplement No Child Left Behind's much needed reforms is a promise that \nhas yet to be kept. Indeed, the current budget proposed by the Bush \nAdministration underfunds No Child Left Behind by $12 billion. Since \npassage three years ago, the law has been funded at a level that is \nmore than $39 billion below what was promised when the President signed \nthe Act into law.\n  As a result of the failures of the current Administration to fulfill \nits commitment to our nation's school children under this law, those \nchildren and their teachers are today shouldering new and noteworthy \nhardships. Throughout the State of Connecticut, for example, students, \nteachers, administrators and parents are struggling to implement \nrequirements that are often confusing, inflexible and unrealistic. And \nthey are struggling to do so without the additional resources they were \npromised to put them into place. According to a recent report put \ntogether by the Connecticut State Department of Education, through \n2008, it will cost the State of Connecticut $41.6 million over and \nabove what the Federal Government is going to supply to meet the \nrequirements of No Child Left Behind. Of that $41.6 million, $8 million \nwill need to spent on testing alone. That is a significant amount of \nmoney--a significant amount of money that is going to fall on \nConnecticut taxpayers trying to simultaneously pay for their mortgage, \nbasic health care and the rising cost of their children's tuition.\n  As I have said on numerous occasions in the past, resources without \nreforms are a waste of money. By the same token, reforms without \nresources are a false promise--a false promise that has left students \nand their teachers grappling with new burdens and little help to bear \nthem.\n\n  The legislation I am introducing today proposes to make three changes \nto the No Child Left Behind Act. These changes will ease current \nburdens on our students, our teachers and our administrators without \ndismantling the fundamental underpinnings of the law.\n  First, the No Child Left Behind Reform Act will allow schools to be \ngiven credit for performing well on measures other than test scores \nwhen calculating student achievement. Test scores are an important \nmeasure of student knowledge. However, they are not the only measure. \nThere are others. These include dropout rates, the number of students \nwho participate in advanced placement courses, and individual student \nimprovement over time. Unfortunately, current law does not allow \nschools to use these additional ways to gauge school success in a \nconstructive manner. Additional measures can only be used to further \nindicate how a school is failing, not how a school is succeeding. This \nlegislation will allow schools to earn credit for succeeding.\n  Second, the No Child Left Behind Reform Act will allow schools to \ntarget school choice and supplemental services to the students that \nactually demonstrate a need for them. As the current law is being \nimplemented by the Administration, if a school is in need of \nimprovement, it is expected to offer school choice and supplemental \nservices to all students--even if not all students have demonstrated a \nneed for them. That strikes me as a wasteful and imprecise way to help \na school improve student performance. For that reason, this legislation \nwill allow schools to target resources to the students that actually \ndemonstrate that they need them. Clearly, this is the most efficient \nway to maximize their effect.\n  Finally, the No Child Left Behind Reform Act introduces a greater \ndegree of reasonableness to the teacher certification process. As it is \nbeing implemented, the law requires teachers to be ``highly qualified'' \nto teach every subject that they teach. Certainly none of us disagree \nwith this policy as a matter of principle. But as a matter of practice, \nit is causing confusion and hardship for teachers, particularly \nsecondary teachers and teachers in small school districts. For example, \nas the law is being implemented by the Administration, a high school \nscience teacher could be required to hold degrees in biology, physics \nand chemistry to be considered highly qualified. In small schools where \nthere may be only one 7th or 8th grade teacher teaching all subjects, \nthese teachers could similarly be required to hold degrees in every \nsubject area.\n  Such requirements are unreasonable at a time when excellent teachers \nare increasingly hard to find. The legislation I introduce today will \nallow states to create a single assessment to cover multiple subjects \nfor middle grade level teachers and allow states to issue a broad \ncertification for science and social studies.\n  In my view, the changes I propose will provide significant assistance \nto schools struggling to comply with the No Child Left Behind law all \nacross America. As time marches on and more deadlines set by this law \napproach--including additional testing, a highly qualified teacher in \nevery classroom and 100% proficiency for all students--we have a \nresponsibility to reassess the law and do what we can to make sure that \nit is implemented in a reasonable manner. In doing so, we must also \npreserve the basic tenets of the law--providing a world class education \nfor all American students and closing the achievement gap across \ndemographic and socioeconomic lines. Again, no child should left \nbehind--no special education student, no English language learning \nstudent, no minority student and no low-income student. I stand by this \ncommitment.\n\n  Obviously, funding this law is beyond the scope of this bill. I would \nnote, however, that efforts to increase education funding to authorized \nlevels have thus far been unsuccessful. Despite this, I remain \ncommitted to work to change this outcome as well. Clearly, our children \ndeserve the resources\n\n[[Page S3295]]\n\nneeded to make their dreams for a better education a reality.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 724\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill a improve the Child Care Access Means Parents in \nSchool Program; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. PresIdent, I am pleased to rise today with Senators \nSnowe, Kennedy, Collins, Murray, Durbin, Clinton, Inouye, Levin, \nLautenberg and Johnson to introduce legislation which would supply \ngreatly needed support to college students struggling to balance their \nroles as parents with their roles as students. The Child Care Access \nMeans Parents in School Act (CCAMPIS) would increase access to, support \nfor, and retention of low-income, nontraditional students who are \nstruggling to complete college degrees while caring for their children.\n  The typical college student is no longer an 18-year-old recent high \nschool graduate. According to a 2002 study by the National Center for \nEducation Statistics, only 27 percent of undergraduates meet the \n``traditional'' undergraduate criteria of earning a high school \ndiploma, enrolling full-time, depending on parents for financial \nsupport and not working or working part-time. This means that 73 \npercent of today's students are considered non-traditional in some way. \nClearly, non-traditional students--older students, students with \nchildren and students with various job and life experiences--are \nfilling the ranks of college classes. Why? Because they recognize the \nimportance of college to future success. It is currently estimated that \na full-time worker with a bachelor's degree earns about 60 percent more \nthan a full-time worker with only a high school diploma. This amounts \nto a lifetime gap in earnings of more than $1 million.\n\n[[Page S3296]]\n\n  Today's non-traditional students face barriers unheard of by \ntraditional college students of earlier years. Many are parents and \nmust provide for their children while in school. Access to affordable, \nquality and convenient child care is a necessity for these students. \nBut obtaining the child care that they need is often difficult because \nof their limited income and non-traditional schedules, compounded by \ndeclining assistance for child care through other supports. Campus-\nbased child care can fill the gap. It is conveniently located, \navailable during the right hours, and of high quality and lower cost. \nUnfortunately, it is unavailable at many campuses. Even when programs \ndo exist, they are often available to only a fraction of the eligible \nstudents. That is where the Dodd-Snowe CCAMPIS Act comes in.\n  The Dodd-Snowe CCAMPIS Act increases and expands the availability of \ncampus-based child care in three ways. First, it raises the minimum \ngrant amount from $10,000 to $30,000. For most institutions of higher \neducation, $10,000 has proven too small relative to the cost and effort \nrequired to complete a federal application.\n  Second, the Dodd-Snowe CCAMPIS Act ensures that a wider range of \nstudents are able to access services. Present language defines low-\nincome students as students eligible to receive a Federal Pell Grant. \nThis language excludes graduate students, international students, and \nstudents who may be low-income but make slightly more than is allowed \nto qualify for Pell grants. CCAMPIS will open eligibility for these \nadditional populations.\n  Third, the CCAMPIS Act raises the program's current authorization \nlevel from $45 million to $75 million so that we not only expand \nexisting programs, but create new ones as well.\n  Research demonstrates that campus-based child care is of high quality \nand that it increases the educational success of both parents and \nstudents. Furthermore, recipients of campus-based child care assistance \nwho are on public assistance are more likely to never return to welfare \nand to obtain jobs paying good wages.\n  Currently, there are approximately 1,850 campus-based child care \nprograms but over 6,000 colleges and universities eligible to \nparticipate in the CCAMPIS program. Currently, CCAMPIS funds only 427 \nprograms in states and the District of Columbia. Meanwhile, the number \nof non-traditional students across America is increasing. As these \nnumbers increase, the need for campus-based child care will increase as \nwell.\n  Just last week in Connecticut, I went to Eastern Connecticut State \nUniversity where I met a number of students who would benefit from this \nlegislation. One woman is attending part-time as an accounting major. \nShe works as a restaurant supervisor and just gave birth to her first \nchild. She is balancing work, family and school. Another woman is a \njunior social work major with two children. Having already received an \nassociate's degree, she is now working towards a bachelor's degree to \nincrease her competitiveness in the job market. A third woman is \npursuing her second degree in physical and health education. A stay-at-\nhome mom prior to re-enrolling, she has three children at home. These \nare the students that need our assistance--hard working parents trying \nto improve their lot in life for the good of their children.\n  This is a modest measure that will make a major difference to \nstudents. It will offer them new hope for starting and staying in \nschool. I am hopeful that it can be considered and enacted as part of \nthe Higher Education Act. I look forward to working with my colleagues \nto move this important measure forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 725\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide tax incentives to promote the conservation \nand production of natural gas; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Natural Gas \nPrice Reduction Act of 2005 and the ``Tax Provisions for Natural Gas \nPrice Reduction Act of 2005.'' I send to the desk two pieces of \nlegislation. One is the substantive provisions of the bill and one is \nthe tax provisions of the bill.\n  Mr. President, I offer the legislation on behalf of myself and the \nSenator from South Dakota, Mr. Johnson, who is the lead Democratic \nsponsor on the legislation. I do so with appreciation to the chairman \nof our Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Chairman Pete Domenici, \nand the staff of that committee who have worked very closely with us on \nthe development of this comprehensive piece of legislation, and with \nthanks to my own staff, Sharon Segner, who has worked on it for several \nmonths.\n  This is a piece of legislation to address aggressively and \ncomprehensively the rising cost of natural gas in the United States. \nThis is legislation for the blue-collar worker, for the American \nfarmer, and for the American homeowner.\n  Natural gas prices in the United States are at record levels. We have \ngone from having the lowest natural gas prices in the industrial world \nto the highest. These high prices are threatening millions of our jobs. \nOur farmers are getting a 10-percent pay cut. Homeowners are having a \nhard time paying their heating and cooling bills because of our \ncontradictory policies.\n  Our policies boil down to this: We are restricting the supply of \nnatural gas, and we are encouraging the use of natural gas. You do not \nhave to go very far in an economics class at the University of Oklahoma \nor the University of Tennessee to know that if you restrict supply and \nencourage demand, the inevitable result is higher prices. And higher \nprices is a very serious problem for U.S. workers, U.S. homeowners, and \nU.S. farmers.\n  Only an ambitious and comprehensive approach that both increases \nsupply and controls demand can lower the price of natural gas and keep \nour economy growing. This is not a question of tweaking our natural gas \npolicy. It is time, aggressively, to revamp it. We need aggressive \nconservation. We need aggressive use of alternative fuels. We need \naggressive research and development. We need aggressive production. \nAnd, for the time being, we need aggressive importation of liquefied \nnatural gas from other parts of the world.\n  Here on this chart is an idea of where we are today. This is the \nUnited States of America: $7 per unit for natural gas--the highest in \nthe industrialized world. Until recently, we had the lowest natural gas \nprices in the world.\n  What that means is large parts of our industries--the chemical \nindustry, for example--were built on the idea of $1.50 or $2 for \nnatural gas, but today it is $7.\n  A million Americans work in those blue-collar manufacturing jobs in \nevery State in our country. Now, if they are paying $7 here, and it is \n$5.55 in Canada and $5.15 in the United Kingdom and $2.65 in Turkey and \n$1.70 in the Ukraine, where do you suppose,\n\n[[Page S3297]]\n\nthough, a million blue-collar jobs are going to be 5 years from now, if \nwe do not do something about the $7 price? They are not going to be in \nthe United States. They are going to be moving out of the United \nStates, to the United Kingdom, to Germany, to the Ukraine, to other \nparts of the world. And people are going to be writing their \nCongressmen and saying: Why didn't you do something?\n  So here is what we can do. By aggressive conservation, I mean setting \nstronger appliance and equipment standards for natural gas efficiency \nso that a commercial air conditioner will cool the same while using \nless natural gas doing it. Those standards have been generally agreed \nupon by environmental groups with the industry. If they were put in \nplace, by a rough estimate, they might save the equivalent energy that \ncould be produced by 30 or 35 powerplants.\n  By aggressive use of alternative fuels, I mean, for example, fully \ncommercializing coal gasification. Coal gasification is taking this \nabundant supply of coal we have in the United States--we are the \n``OPEC,'' the ``Saudi Arabia'' of coal; we have a 400- or 500-year \nsupply--and finding a clean way to use it instead of importing oil from \na part of the world where people are blowing each other up.\n  That means starting with support so we can have six coal gasification \nplants in this country by the year 2013. Coal gasification means, you \nburn the coal to create gas, and then you burn the gas to create power. \nIf we can do that commercially, we will not only be passing a clean \nenergy bill, we will be passing a clean air bill, because if you do \nthat, you remove most of the mercury, most of the nitrogen, most of the \nsulfur. And by additional research, we may be able to find a way to \nrecapture the carbon that is produced and put that in the ground and \nsolve the carbon problems that a lot of people are talking about around \nthe world.\n  In addition to helping ourselves, we would help ourselves by helping \nothers. China and India and other parts of the world are building \nhundreds of coal plants. We would much rather them build a coal \ngasification plant, one that is clean and does not contribute to air \npollution. Because if China and India and Brazil build dirty coal \nplants, that air blows around the world, and it blows into Tennessee \nand it blows into South Carolina. It blows into Oklahoma.\n  So aggressive alternative fuels is a part of a natural gas supply. \nAggressive research and development includes investment and research in \ngas hydrates. Gas hydrates is gas that is in the ground. Methane \nhydrates hold tremendous potential to provide abundant supplies of \nnatural gas. Hydrates are like ice solid structures, consisting of \nwater and gases, mainly methane, compressed to greater than normal \ndensities.\n  Coastal U.S. areas are rich in this resource. The United States is \nestimated to contain one-fourth of the world's supply. We need to find \na way to use that gas so we do not have $7 per unit natural gas prices. \nThat sends millions of jobs overseas. That cuts the income of farmers. \nAnd that raises home heating prices and cooling prices for residential \nAmericans.\n  Aggressive production means, among other things, allowing States to \nselectively waive the Federal moratoria on offshore production of gas \nand collect significant revenues from such production. Let me give you \nan example. Within the last few weeks, the legislature of Virginia \ndecided it might like to explore the idea of drilling for gas offshore. \nNow, why would Virginia want to do that? Because there is probably a \nlot of gas offshore. What would that mean for Virginia? Well, they \ncould put a gas rig out in the ocean, beyond 20 miles, so nobody in \nVirginia or North Carolina could see it, run a pipeline underground to \nVirginia, and take their share of the revenues. And they can lower \ntaxes in Virginia and put the rest of the money in a trust fund to \nbuild the best colleges and universities in America. That is what they \ncould do in Virginia.\n  If Tennessee had a coastline, and I were Governor of Tennessee, that \nis what I would be asking the Congress to let me do.\n  I think as other Governors and other legislatures and other people \nlook at Texas and Louisiana and Alabama and see what they are doing and \ndecide that they can in an environmentally sensitive way exercise a \nState option to drill for gas in Federal waters so far out you can't \nsee it, that they will find that a good option because it will help \nlower the price of gas. It can build up the schools and keep taxes \ndown, and it can avoid other worse forms of energy.\n  For example, you would have to have 46 square miles of windmills, \nthese things that are 100 yards tall, in order to equal one gas rig \nthat you couldn't see out in the ocean. This is a State option. \nAggressive importation of liquefied natural gas starts with giving the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission exclusive authority for siting and \nregulating what we call LNG terminals. This means importing liquefied \nnatural gas from other parts of the world. There is a lot of it around \nthe world. They freeze it and put it in tankers, and they bring it here \nand put it in our pipelines, and then we have it.\n  That seems like a pretty big waste of effort when we have plenty of \nnatural gas here in the United States that we don't have access to. But \nif we want an adequate supply of natural gas, we are going to have to \nimport some from around the world, and that means we are going to need \nterminals to which to bring it. Some of them may be offshore. They \nmight be 10, 12, 14 miles offshore. Some of them, like the four we have \ntoday, may need to be onshore. There is no silver bullet. There is no \nsingle answer. That is why we need aggressive conservation. If, for \nexample, the United States adopted the conservation attitudes towards \nnatural gas that California did a few years ago, it might equal what 50 \npowerplants could produce in the United States. If that is so, we ought \nto do it today. That would begin to bring this $7 figure down.\n  Aggressive use of alternative fuels such as coal gasification. I also \nwould say nuclear power is the most obvious alternative fuel to natural \ngas. If we had more nuclear power, we would use less natural gas. In \nour country today, what do you suppose we are using to create \nelectricity when we need more electricity even though the cost of it is \n$7 a unit, the highest in the world? Natural gas, because natural gas \nplants can be built for a few hundred million dollars, and we have \ncreated an environment where we can't use nuclear.\n  We haven't built a new nuclear plant since the 1970s, even though we \ninvented the technology, even though France has 80 percent of its power \nnow produced by nuclear power, even though Japan builds a new nuclear \nplant every year or so. We invented it. Our Navy has operated nuclear \nreactors since the 1950s without ever having a single accident. It is a \nclean, obvious alternative to $7 natural gas, and we haven't built a \nplant since the 1970s. So we need to think seriously about aggressive \nconservation, aggressive use of alternative fuels, aggressive research \nand development for solar, for methane hydrates, aggressive production, \nand that includes giving States the option of deciding whether they \nwould like to drill offshore and take some of the revenues and put some \nof the revenues into a conservation fund, and aggressive importation of \nliquefied natural gas from overseas at least for the time being.\n  In March of 2002, the Secretary of Energy requested that the National \nPetroleum Council undertake an extensive study on the natural gas \ncrisis. That advisory council produced a study. It talked about the \nresults I have described. Our Senate Energy Committee, under the \nchairman, Senator Domenici, has paid a lot of attention to that report. \nSenator Domenici hosted what we called a natural gas roundtable that \nwas well attended by Senators and went on for 3 or 4 hours. There were \nmore than 100 proposals presented.\n  I am chairman of the subcommittee of that full committee, and so my \npurpose today is to take many of the ideas that we heard that made the \nmost sense, some of which people haven't been willing to advocate, and \nput them into the discussion. Again, because I do not want to be a \nSenator who 10 years from now somebody comes up to and says: How did \nyou let farmers get a 20-percent pay cut because of $7, $8, $9 natural \ngas; how did you let millions of jobs in the chemical industry, the \nauto industry go overseas because of $7, $8, and $9 natural gas; how \ndid you let prices of natural gas for home heating\n\n[[Page S3298]]\n\nor cooling get so high that middle-income Americans can't even afford \nto heat their homes? I don't want to be that kind of Senator. So I am \nhere today with a comprehensive proposal across the board even though \nsome of the ideas will create that kind of controversy.\n  I have summarized in a few words the provisions of a 250-page piece \nof legislation.\n  We were ambushed in the United States on September 11, 2001. Even \nthough you could argue that we might have known it was coming, \nterrorism wasn't new on September 11, 2001.\n  I remember being in a meeting with Prime Minister Rabin of Israel in \n1994. At the end of a long day, I asked him: What is the greatest \nchallenge threatening the world? And he said terrorism. That was many \nyears before we were attacked. He was right. He was dead within a few \nmonths at the hands of terrorists within his own country. We didn't see \nthe terrorism coming. We were ambushed, and we have paid a terrible \nprice--in lives, in dollars. We have had to create whole new \ndepartments. We have had to interrupt the lives of thousand of national \nguardsmen and Army reservists and send them overseas, some to die and \nsome to be wounded, because of terrorism. Maybe we couldn't have seen \nexactly that act coming, but we knew it was out there.\n  We are about to have another big surprise. That is to our standard of \nliving. We are 5 to 6 percent of all the people in the world. Yet we \nproduce a third of all the money in the world. We could wake up 10 \nyears from now and that picture could be very changed. One way is if we \nlose our brainpower advantage. And we could lose it. Half of our new \njobs have been created by science and technology since the end of World \nWar II. And if we go through our budget balancing, deficit controlling \nexercise for the next 10 years and we don't double investments for the \nphysical sciences and retake the lead in advanced computing, and if we \ndon't see that we have plenty of graduate students in science and \nengineering, we are going to find most of the R will be done in other \nparts of the world. We are going to find most of the engineers who \nproduce this brainpower that creates jobs in other parts of the world.\n  They are thinking in China, and they are thinking in India. There is \nno real good reason why the United States should make a third of all \nthe money in the world every year with just 5 or 6 percent of the \npeople, and we have so little. So they are keeping their bright people \nhome. They are building up their universities. They are doing what we \nneed to keep doing. That is one place we could get a big surprise.\n  But the other is in energy. We have taken energy for granted for a \nlong time. I know I come from Tennessee. We have had the Tennessee \nValley Authority. It has sat there since the 1930s, and it has produced \nreliable, low-cost electricity. Homes that have never been lit, barns \nthat have never been lit, rural areas that have never been lit have \nenjoyed that. That is within my lifetime.\n  And then while I was Governor in the 1990s, I remember that one of \nthe big attractions for Saturn and Nissan and the automobile industry \ncoming into Tennessee was low-cost reliable power. But when I had a \nnatural gas roundtable last fall in Tennessee, there was the president \nof Saturn, the president of Nissan, the head of the Tennessee Farm \nBureau. There was the head of the University of Tennessee. They were \nall saying: We can't live in Tennessee on $7 natural gas. What do they \ndo if they can't? It is very easy what they do. They don't have to have \nthose jobs in Tennessee or South Carolina. They can move them to \nGermany, they can move them to Mexico, they can move them to Canada, \nand they are doing it every day.\n  And Tennessee Eastman in the upper part of east Tennessee, which we \nthink is just like the great Smokey Mountains, has been there so long. \nThere are 12,000 people there, real good incomes. What do they use to \nmake chemicals there? They use natural gas.\n  How long are they going to be there? If we have $7 gas and they have \n$3 and $4 gas in other parts of the world, I am afraid they are not \ngoing to be there too long. And somebody is going to say to me: What \ndid you do about it? At least my answer is I stood up on the floor of \nthe Senate and said this is not the time to tweak our natural gas \npolicy.\n  We do not need to sit around and wait for a big surprise on energy \nlike we had a big surprise on September 11 on terrorism. We need an \naggressive policy. We need a comprehensive policy. We need aggressive \nconservation. That is where we should start. We need aggressive \nalternative fuels. That means nuclear and that means coal gasification. \nWe need aggressive research and development, whether it is hydrogen or \nwhether it is solar, or whether it is methane gas hydrates. We need \naggressive production. We have lots of gas in the United States. We \nshould be using it if we have $7 gas.\n  For the time being, we need to create the terminals that will permit \nus to import enough liquefied natural gas to get that $7 price down to \n$6 or $5 or $4.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Johnson from South Dakota for joining \nme in this comprehensive aggressive approach. I thank Senator Domenici \nfor taking the lead on an energy bill. I thank Senator Bingaman, who is \nthe ranking Democrat on our committee, because I notice on our \ncommittee a greater sense of urgency, a greater sense of bipartisan \ncooperation on coming up with an energy bill this year. Our blue-collar \nworkers, our farmers, our homeowners in Tennessee and across this \ncountry expect it from us.\n  Senator Johnson's and my contribution today is to introduce this \ncomprehensive 250-page bill and to get on the table all the aggressive \nideas we can think of that make sense about how to reduce the price of \nnatural gas for workers, for farmers, and for homeowners. We hope it \ncontributes to the discussion. We hope we find lots of these provisions \nin an ambitious energy bill.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues, as I know Senator \nJohnson does, on a bipartisan basis to help lower the price of natural \ngas, keep our jobs, keep our homes cool and warm, and make it possible \nfor farmers to make a living.\n  Natural gas prices are at record levels and the highest of any \nindustrialized country. High natural gas prices are threatening our \njobs, our farms, and hurting Americans who are trying to heat and cool \ntheir homes. Only an ambitious, comprehensive approach that both \nincreases supply and controls demand can lower the price of natural gas \nand keep our growing economic recovery from becoming recent history.\n  This is not a question of tweaking our natural gas policy. It is time \nto aggressively revamp it. We need aggressive conservation, aggressive \nuse of alternative fuels, aggressive research and development, \naggressive production and for the time being, aggressive imports of \nliquefied natural gas.\n  Aggressive conservation, for example, means setting stronger \nappliance and equipment standards for natural gas efficiency so that a \ncommercial air conditioner will cool the same while using less natural \ngas to do it.\n  Aggressive use of alternative fuels, for example, means fully \ncommercializing coal gasification, starting with support for the \ndeployment of six coal gasification plants by 2013. Coal gasification \nmeans that you burn coal to produce power but get the much lower \npollution output of using natural gas.\n  Aggressive research and development includes investment in research \nof gas hydrates. Methane hydrates hold tremendous potential to provide \nabundant supplies of natural gas. Hydrates are ice-like solid \nstructures consisting of water and gases, mainly methane, compressed to \ngreater than normal densities. Coastal U.S. areas are rich in this \nresource. The U.S. is estimated to contain one-fourth of the world's \nsupply.\n  Aggressive production means, among other changes, allowing states to \nselectively waive the federal moratoria on off-shore production and \ncollect significant revenues from such production.\n  And aggressive importation of liquefied natural gas starts with \ngiving the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission exclusive authority for \nsiting and regulating LNG terminals, while still preserving states' \nauthorities under the Coastal Zone Management Act and other acts.\n  In March 2002, Secretary of Energy Abraham requested that the \nNational Petroleum Council undertake an extensive study on the natural \ngas crisis.\n\n[[Page S3299]]\n\nThat council, a Federal advisory committee to the Secretary of Energy, \nproduced in late 2003 one of the most extensive policy studies and \nrecommendations on the natural gas crisis to date. Since that time, \nother prominent groups, such as the National Commission on Energy \nPolicy, have also produced extensive studies on the natural gas crisis. \nIn October 2004, I held a roundtable on the impact of soaring natural \ngas prices on Tennessee farmers and jobs. The Senate Energy Committee \nhas held numerous hearings over the last 2 years and recently held an \nextensive natural gas roundtable on the subject on January 24, \n2005. Over 100 proposals were submitted to the Senate Energy Committee \non natural gas issues.\n\n  The conclusion of all of these forums has been clear.\n  High natural gas prices are threatening our country's economic \ncompetitiveness and costing us jobs. For example, high natural gas \nprices have been the equivalent of a 10 percent pay cut to American \nfarmers.\n  The situation is urgent.\n  There are no silver bullets. We cannot conserve our way out of this \nproblem, nor can we drill our way out of this problem. We will need to \nbe aggressive on all fronts, in order to keep our industries \ncompetitive.\n  High natural gas costs are also tied to high oil prices. We need to \naddress both natural gas and oil prices in order to lower natural gas \ncosts.\n  Our country has contradictory policies on natural gas--on one hand, \nwe encourage its use. On the other hand, we limit access to its supply. \nWe need to amend our contradictory natural gas and environmental \npolicies.\n  That's why I am introducing the ``Natural Gas Price Reduction Act.'' \nIt is an aggressive, bold approach to tackle this issue. This 250-page \nlegislation is an attempt to start a very difficult, but balanced, \nlegislative discussion in the United States Senate on natural gas \nprices. I have taken the best ideas that I have heard in these \nroundtable discussions and from the various policy studies. I have met \nwith hundreds of people in the past year discussing natural gas prices. \nThis legislation is an attempt to be more aggressive on all areas \nimpacting natural gas prices--energy efficiency and fuel diversity, \nnatural gas supply, and improved infrastructure for importation of \nliquefied natural gas.\n  Half our Nation's increase in natural gas demand in the last decade \nhas come from the power sector. So to conserve natural gas, one must \nnot only reduce consumption of gas itself, but also of electricity. \nAnd, as I noted, since oil prices affect natural gas prices, conserving \noil is also important. My bill addresses conservation in five ways.\n  The bill creates a 4-year national consumer education program on the \nurgent need for energy conservation. A statewide California effort to \neducate energy consumers resulted in savings of 10 percent at peak \nusage--the equivalent of five-and-a-half 1,000 Megawatt coal-powered \npower plants. My bill aims to take that effort to the entire nation.\n  The legislation sets higher appliance and equipment standards for \nnatural gas efficiency. These standards have been negotiated between \nconsumer and industry representatives and are codified in the bill. For \nexample, the standards would require a new kitchen oven to produce the \nsame heat while using less natural gas to do it. The American Council \nfor an Energy-Efficient Economy estimates that these standards will \nreduce natural gas use by about 125 BCF in 2010 and 525 BCF in 2020. In \naddition these standards will reduce peak electric demand by about \n33,500 MW in 2020, equivalent to 34 coal power plants of 1000 MW each, \nand will save consumers and businesses more than $60 billion.\n\n  The bill creates tax incentives and provides regulatory relief to \nenable manufacturing facilities to more easily produce their own power \nand steam from a single source--a process called cogeneration or CHP \nwhich saves money and energy while also reducing pollutants. A CHP \nsystem can produce the same electrical and thermal output at 75 percent \nfuel conversion efficiency as compared to 49 percent separate steam and \npower. This is a 50 percent gain in overall efficiency, resulting in a \n35 percent fuel savings. Large industrial plants, such as International \nPaper, Alcoa and Eastman in my home State of Tennessee all use \ncogeneration in their manufacturing processes. More companies could do \nthe same, and the bill particularly focuses on providing incentive for \nsmaller cogeneration projects.\n  The Alexander bill provides incentive for public utilities to utilize \ntheir natural gas plants based on efficiency. The process of activating \ndifferent power plants to meet demand during a given day is called \n``dispatching.'' For example, on a hot summer day in Tennessee, the \ndemand for electricity, for air conditioning, might be highest in the \nearly afternoon, so then a power company would have to dispatch the \nmost power plants to provide the energy. But during the cooler night, \nthey might dispatch less plants since less power is needed. If power \ncompanies dispatched their most efficient plants first, this would save \nus a significant amount of natural gas. As you can see, the highest \nsaving will be in the medium-term--2010-2015--but real savings continue \nfor many years.\n  Our reliance on foreign oil is the silent elephant in the room when \nit comes to high natural gas prices. My legislation includes a \nprovision that requires the President report to Congress annually on \nefforts to reduce U.S. dependence on imported petroleum 1.75 million \nbarrels a day from projected 2013 levels, almost 10 percent. As I noted \nearlier, oil and gas are usually produced together; and, typically, \nthere is a 6:1 ratio between natural gas and oil prices. Reducing \ndependence on foreign oil will help bring natural gas prices down.\n  Conservation of natural gas and related energy sources is critical to \nlowering prices and keeping our manufacturing and farming jobs here in \nthe United States. But conservation alone is not enough. The second \nfocus must be to develop alternative sources of energy. The ``Keep \nManufacturing and Farming Jobs in the United States Act'' encourages \nthe use of three alternative fuels:\n\n  The bill initiates a national coal gasification strategy. Eastman \nChemical in Kingsport, TN, has been using coal gasification with a 95% \navailability factor for the past 20 years. Tampa Electric has \nsuccessfully demonstrated large-scale coal gasification. It is time for \nthis process to be more widely used. Coal gasification is a process \nwhereby gas derived from burning coal is used as a source of energy or \na raw material. When used in a power plant, coal gasification means \nthat you burn coal but get the much lower pollution output of using \nnatural gas. My legislation provides up to $2 billion in tax or other \nincentives to support the construction of six new coal gasification \npower plants. Similarly, the legislation provides up to $2 billion in \nassistance for industrial gasification projects. The bill also provides \nstreamlined permitting for coal gasification facilities. Coal is an \nabundant resource in the United States; we should use it to produce \nclean energy and raw material for industrial applications.\n  Solar energy is another clean, alternative fuel source that could be \ndeveloped further. Solar energy can be used directly for heating as \nwell as to create electricity. To push an aggressive solar energy \nstrategy, the Alexander legislation provides tax incentives for \ninvestment in solar power generation. Specifically, it provides \nbusinesses a tax credit for investing in geothermal or solar heating \nand/or power generation--10 percent heating, 25 percent for generating \nor displacing electricity.\n  My bill also contains language to invest in new technologies to use \nhydrogen to power fuel cell vehicles. The language in this bill mirrors \nlanguage I offered in the last session of Congress on the Energy Bill \nthat would have enacted President Bush's Hydrogenl/Fuel Cell \nInitiative. When I visited Japan last year, I visited a hydrogen fuel \nstation--that looked much like a gas station--and saw fuel cell \nvehicles that range from small cars to SUVs. These cars not only allow \nus to use an alternative fuel source but are also great for the \nenvironment--their only byproduct is water vapor. The bill invests in \nresearch and development of technologies and infrastructure for 2 \nhydrogen and fuel cell vehicles.\n  Methane hydrates hold tremendous potential to provide abundant \nsupplies of natural gas. Hydrates are ice-like solid structures \nconsisting of water and\n\n[[Page S3300]]\n\ngases--mainly methane--compressed to greater than normal densities. \nCoastal US areas are rich in this resource--the U.S. is estimated to \ncontain one-fourth of the world's supply. My bill invests $200 million \nover the next 4 years in research for this promising new resource, a \nnumber consistent with recommendations from the National Commission on \nEnergy Policy.\n  Conserving natural gas and using alternative fuels will take us a \nlong way to reducing gas prices and keeping jobs here in the U.S., but \nwe must also address the other side of the equation: supply. As Energy \nCommittee members learned at our Natural Gas Roundtable, our current \npolicy encourages consumption of natural gas while restricting the \nsupply. We need to stop putting unnecessary restrictions on production \nand supply of natural gas, and my legislation does so by addressing \nproduction off-shore and in the Rocky Mountains as well as the \nimportation of liquid natural gas from abroad.\n  We have plenty of natural gas here in the U.S., we just cannot get to \nit. There are large fields off the coasts, especially the Atlantic, and \nin the Rocky Mountains. There is no reason for natural gas prices here \nin the U.S. to be so high when we have so much available here--if only \nwe would use it.\n  Today, there are two moratoria on our outer continental shelf, OCS--a \ncongressional moratorium and a Presidential moratorium. The Atlantic \nCoast--40 miles off the coast is believed to be largely natural gas-\nprone. The Pacific Coast is believed--to be mainly oil-prone. The Gulf \nof Mexico is both. Today, when production is greater than 9 miles \noffshore, a State that has oil and gas production gets zero percent of \nthe production revenues. This is radically different than onshore \nproduction; on Federal lands, States get 50 percent of the production \nrevenues. Alaska gets 90 percent of the production revenues. In order \nto have a constructive dialogue on OCS production, the right framework \nneeds to be established.\n  My legislation provides the Department of the Interior with the legal \nauthority to issue natural gas only leases. Currently, Interior can \nonly issue combination gas and oil leases. Since there is greater \nhesitation about the environmental impact of producing oil off-shore, \nissuing natural gas-only leases may alleviate some concerns.\n  It also instructs the Secretary of the Interior to draw the state \nboundary between Alabama and Florida regarding Lease 181--a disputed \narea off the coast of both states in the Gulf of Mexico in which \nAlabama may wish to permit production while Florida may not. The \nboundaries shall be drawn using established international law. Under my \nbill, portions of Lease 181, which are not in the state of Florida and \ngreater than 30 miles off of the coast of Alabama, shall be leased by \nDecember 31, 2007. However, of those portions of Lease 181 that are in \nthe State of Florida, the State of Florida may keep the moratoria. \nLeasing would not be allowed to interfere with U.S. military operations \nin the Gulf Coast.\n  Finally, under the bill, States will have the authority to request \nstudies of natural gas resources off their coasts and be permitted to \nwaive Federal moratoria on offshore production. The states shall not \nhave the authority to lift the moratoria at National Marine Sanctuaries \nor National Wildlife Refuge Area. The State of Virginia recently \nengaged on this issue, and the state ought to have the ability to \nlicense off-shore production--especially if it is far enough off-shore \nthat you cannot even see it from land. My bill also allows States to \ncollect significant revenue from such production, and designates that a \nportion of revenues also go to a conservation royalty. The conservation \nroyalty would be shared equally by the Federal land and water \nconservation fund, state land and water conservation fund and wildlife \ngrants.\n  Importing liquefied natural gas--LNG--requires the infrastructure to \nreceive it. LNG comes to the U.S. by ship, and terminals to receive \nthese ships and unload LNG must be built and appropriate infrastructure \ndeveloped to transport gas from those terminals to users across the \ncountry.\n  My bill streamlines the development of offshore liquefied natural gas \nterminals. The siting of LNG terminals has become a difficult issue \nsince we all want cheaper natural gas, but no one seems to want an LNG \nterminal in ``their backyard.'' The Alexander legislation gives FERC \nclear authority for regulating liquid natural gas terminals, but, \nunlike a related House bill, still preserves States' authorities under \nthe Coastal Zone Management Act and other acts. I hope this will \nprovide some balance so that LNG terminals can be sited, but \nenvironmental concerns will play a significant role in choosing their \nsites. In an effort to speed the siting of pipelines that allow natural \ngas to reach all parts of the country, the bill also requires that FERC \ngrant or deny a terminal or pipeline application within one year.\n  Our country is facing an energy crisis. We are consuming more and \nmore electricity. Gasoline prices are poised to reach all time highs. \nThe price of oil is up. And so, too, is the price of natural gas.\n  The bill I introduce today, the ``Natural Gas Price Reduction Act,'' \naddresses high natural gas prices. Natural gas is not just used for \nheating homes, a source of electricity, it is a raw material for \nindustries, and it is an important component in fertilizers used by \nfarmers. High natural gas prices have cost farmers a 10-percent pay cut \nand are shipping manufacturing and chemical jobs overseas. We can not \nafford to let this problem fester any longer.\n  Bold action is required, and that is what my legislation provides. \nThis bill takes a comprehensive approach to addressing the problem by \nencouraging conservation, developing alternative fuel sources, and \nreducing roadblocks to the production and importation of natural gas. I \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Warner, Mr. \n        Voinovich, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Thune, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Obama, \n        Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Talent, Mr. Cornyn, \n        Mr. Cochran, Mr. Domenici, and Mr. Coleman):\n  S. 728. A bill to provide for the consideration and development of \nwater and related resources, to authorize the Secretary of the Army to \nconstruct various projects for improvements to rivers and harbors of \nthe United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with Senators \nInhofe, Vitter, Warner, Voinovich, Isakson, Thune, Murkowski, Obama, \nLandrieu, Grassley, Harkin, Talent, Cornyn, Cochran, Domenici, and \nColeman, the 2005 Water Resources Development Act.\n  The programs administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are \ninvaluable to this Nation. They provide drinking water, electric power \nproduction, river transportation, environmental protection and \nrestoration, protection from floods, emergency response, and \nrecreation. Few agencies in the Federal Government touch so many \ncitizens and they do it on a relatively small budget. They provide one-\nquarter of our Nation's total hydropower output; operate 456 lakes in \n43 States hosting 33 percent of all freshwater lake fishing; move 630 \nmillion tons of cargo valued at over $73 billion annually through our \ninland system; manage over 12 million acres of land and water; provide \n3 trillion gallons of water for use by local communities and business; \nand have prevented an estimated $706 billion in flood damage within the \npast 25 years with an investment one-seventh that value. During the \n1993 flood alone, an estimated $19.1 billion in flood damage was \nprevented by flood control facilities in place at that time. Our ports \nmove over 95 percent of U.S. overseas trade by weight and 75 percent by \nvalue. Between 1970 and 2003, the value of U.S. trade increased 24 \nfold, and 70 percent since 1994. That was an average annual growth rate \nof 10.2 percent, which was nearly double the pace of the Gross Domestic \nProduct growth during the same period. Unfortunately, the American \nSociety of Civil Engineers grades navigable waterways infrastructure D- \nwith over 50 percent of the locks ``functionally obsolete'' despite \nincreased demand.\n  This bipartisan bill is one that traditionally is produced by the \nCongress\n\n[[Page S3301]]\n\nevery two years, however, we have not passed a WRDA bill since 2000 and \nthe longer we wait, the more unmet needs pile up and the more \ncomplicated the demands upon the bill become making it harder and \nharder to win approval. For some, this bill is too small and for \nothers, too big. For some, the new regulations are too onerous and for \nothers, the new regulations are not onerous enough. Nevertheless, I \nbelieve we have struck a balance here that disciplines the new projects \nto criteria fairly applied while addressing a great number of water \nresources priorities.\n  With the new regulations, we have embraced a common sense bipartisan \nproposal by Senators Landrieu and Cochran similar to the bi-partisan \nHouse agreement that requires major projects to be subject to \nindependent peer review and requires that necessary mitigation for \nprojects be completed at the same time the project is completed, or, in \nspecial cases, no longer than one year after project completion. This \nwill impose a cost on communities, particularly smaller communities, \nbut it is not as onerous as the new regulations proposed last year \nwhich ultimately prevented a final agreement from being reached between \nthe House and Senate.\n  The commanding feature of the bill is its landmark environmental and \necosystem restoration authorities. Nearly 60 percent of the bill \nauthorizes such efforts, including environmental restoration of the \nEverglades, Coastal Louisiana, Chesapeake Bay, Missouri River, Long \nIsland Sound, Salton Sea, Upper Connecticut, and the Illinois and \nMississippi Rivers, and others.\n  Additionally, it is important to understand the budget implications \nof this legislation in the real world. We are contending with difficult \nbudget realities currently and it is critical that we be mindful of \nthose realities as we make investments in the infrastructure that \nsupports the people in our nation who make and grow and buy and sell \nthings so that we can grow our economy, create jobs, and secure our \nfuture. This is an authorization bill. It does not spend one dollar. I \nrepeat, it does not spend one dollar. It makes projects eligible for \nfunding through the appropriations process that operates within the \nrestrictions of the budget Congress provides it. With the allocation \nprovided, the Appropriations Committee and the Congress and the \nPresident will fund such projects deemed of the highest priority and \nthose remaining will not be funded because the budget will not permit \nit. This WRDA process simply permits project consideration during the \nprocess of appropriations and I expect some will measure up and others \nwill not. I hear some suggest that we should not authorize anything new \nuntil all other previously-authorized projects are funded. That, of \ncourse, is nonsense because it assumes falsely that all projects \nauthorized five and 10 and 50 years ago are higher priority than those \nin this package. We have de-authorized a great number of projects in \nthis bill and I expect there will be more added as we proceed and then \nthe remainder will have to face the stingy budget process that will \nprioritize the rest.\n\n  While the majority of this legislation is for environmental \nprotection and restoration, a key bipartisan economic initiative we \ninclude provides transportation efficiency and environmental \nsustainability on the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers.\n  As the world becomes more competitive, we must also. In the \nheartland, the efficiency, reliability, capacity, and safety of our \ntransportation options are critical--often make-or-break. In Missouri \nalone, we ship 34.7 million tons of commodities with a combined value \nof more than $4 billion which include coal, petroleum, aggregates, \ngrain, chemicals, iron, steel, minerals and other commodities.\n  As we look 50 years into the future, and as we anticipate and try to \npromote commercial and economic growth, we have to ask ourselves a \nfundamental question: should we have a system that permits and promotes \ngrowth, or should we be satisfied to restrict our growth to the \nconfines of a transportation straight jacket designed not for 2050, but \nfor 1950 for paddle wheel boats?\n  Further, we must ask ourselves if dramatic investments should be made \nto address environmental problems and opportunities that exist on these \ngreat waterways. In both cases, the answer is, ``Of course we should \nmodernize and improve.''\n  We have a system which is in environmental and economic decline. Jobs \nand markets and the availability of habitat for fish and wildlife are \nat stake. We cannot be for increased trade, commercial growth, and job \ncreation without supporting the basic transportation infrastructure \nnecessary to move goods from buyers to sellers. New efficiency helps \ngive our producers an edge that can make or break opportunities in the \ninternational marketplace.\n  Seventy years ago, some argued that a transportation system on the \nMississippi River was not justified. Congress decided that its role was \nnot to try to predict the future but to shape the future and decided to \ninvest in a system despite the naysayers. Over 84 million tons per year \nlater, it is clear that the decision was wise.\n  Now, that system that was designed for paddlewheel boats and to last \n50 years is nearly 70 years old and we must make decisions that will \nshape the next 50-70 years. As we look ahead, we must promote growth \npolicies that help Americans who produce and employ.\n\n  We must work for policies that promote economic growth, job creation, \nand environmental sustainability. We know that trade and economic \ngrowth can be fostered or it can be discouraged by policies and other \nrealities which include the quality of our transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  So in 20 and 30 and 40 and 50 years, where will the growth in \ntransportation occur to accommodate the growth in demand for commercial \nshipping? The Department of Transportation suggests that congestion on \nour roads and rails will double in the next quarter century. The fact \nof the matter is that the great untapped capacity is on our water.\n  This is good news because water transportation is efficient, it is \nsafe, it conserves fuel, and it protects the air and the environment. \nOne medium-sized barge tow can carry the freight of 870 trucks. That \nfact alone speaks volumes to the benefits of water. If we can, would we \nrather have 870 diesel engines on the roads of downtown St. Louis, or \ntwo diesel engines on the water.\n  The veteran Chief Economist at USDA testified that transportation \nefficiency and the ability of farmers to win markets are higher prices \nare ``fundamentally related.'' He predicts that corn exports over the \nnext 10 years will rise 45 percent, 70 percent of which will travel \ndown the Mississippi.\n  Over the past 35 years, waterborne commerce on the Upper Mississippi \nRiver has more than tripled. The system currently carries 60 percent of \nour Nation's corn exports and 45 percent of our Nation's soybean \nexports and it does so at two-thirds the cost of rail--when rail is \navailable.\n  Over the previous 12 years, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have \nspent $70 million completing a six year study. During that period, \nthere have been 35 meetings of the Governors Liaison Committee, 28 \nmeetings on the Economic Coordinating Committee, among the States along \nthe Upper Mississippi and Illinois waterways, and there have been 44 \nmeetings of the Navigation and Environmental Coordination Committee. \nAdditionally, there have been 130 briefings for special interest \ngroups, 24 newsletters. There have been six sets of public meetings in \n46 locations with over 4,000 people in attendance. To say the least, \nthis has been a very long, very transparent, and very representative \nprocess.\n  However, while we have been studying, our competitors have been \nbuilding. Given the extraordinary delay so far, and given the reality \nthat large scale construction takes not weeks or months, but decades, \nfurther delay is no longer an option. This is why I am pleased to be \njoined by a bipartisan group of Senators who agree that we must improve \nthe efficiency and the environmental sustainability of our great \nresources.\n  This plan gets the Corps back in the business of building the future, \nrather than just haggling about predicting the future. More will need \nto be done later on ecosystem and lock expansions further upstream, but \nthis begins the improvement schedule underway.\n\n[[Page S3302]]\n\n  In this legislation, we authorize $1.58 billion for ecosystem \nrestoration-almost 2 times the federal cost of lock capacity expansion \nwhich we authorize on locks 20-25 on the Mississippi River and Peoria \nand LaGrange on the Illinois. The new 1,200 foot locks on the \nMississippi River will provide equal capacity in the bottleneck region \nbelow the 1,200 foot lock 19 at Keokuk and above locks 26 and 27 near \nSt. Louis. Half the cost of the new locks will be paid for by private \nusers who pay into the Inland Waterways Trust fund. Additional funds \nwill be provided for mitigation and small scale and nonstructural \nmeasures to improve efficiency.\n  As we look ahead, the locks at 14-18 will have to be addressed as \nwill further investments to ecosystem restoration efforts.\n  This effort is supported by a broad-based group of the States, farm \ngroups, shippers, labor, and those who pay taxes into the Trust Fund \nfor improvements. Of particular note, I appreciate the strong support \nfrom the carpenters, corngrowers, farm bureau, soybeans, the diverse \nmembership of MARC2000.\n  I thank my colleagues and their staff for the hard work devoted to \nthis difficult matter and I thank particularly chairman Inhofe for his \nforbearance. I believe that if members work cooperatively and aim for \nthe center and not the fringe, that we can get a bill completed this \nyear. If demands exist that the bill be away from the center toward the \nfringe, we will go another Congress without completing our work as we \nwitnessed last year.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, I would like to thank Senator Bond \nfor the leadership he and his subcommittee staff have demonstrated in \nbringing this piece of legislation together.\n  I have great hopes for getting a WRDA bill passed this session. We \nhave not enacted a WRDA bill since 2000, and the water resources are in \nmuch need of this authorization. We made great progress and were very \nclose to finishing a bill at the end of the 108th Congress. That effort \nhas provided a great stepping stone toward quick completion this year.\n  The Army Corps of Engineers has provided a valuable service to the \nNation for over 200 years. It has been instrumental in creating one of \nthe most dynamic inland waterway systems in the world. For example, the \nCorps activities have provided Tulsa, OK with one of the Nation's most \ninland ports and provides the dredging needed to keep the San Francisco \nBay navigable. There is not a State in the Union that does not reap the \nbenefits of the Army Corps.\n  I am well aware of the stacks of requests that have come in from \nevery State for projects to be included in the bill. While it is \nimportant that we insure the Corps is capable of meeting our future \nwater resource needs, it is also very important that we do not demand \nmore of the Corps than it is capable of providing. No Federal agency \ncould complete all of the projects requested by all of the Senators. \nConsidering the limited staff and budget of the Corps, an ``authorize \neverything'' approach may leave everyone with nothing. While I know \nthat each Senator has his or her own priorities, we all must understand \nthe limitations with which we reside. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to ensure that we give clear direction to the Corps to focus \non completing the highest priority and most beneficial projects.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 729. A bill to establish the Food Safety Administration to protect \nthe public health by preventing food-borne illness, ensuring the safety \nof food, improving research on contaminants leading to food-borne \nillness, and improving security of food from intentional contamination, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, a single food safety agency with authority \nto protect the food supply based on sound scientific principles would \nprovide this country with the greatest hope of reducing foodborne \nillnesses and preventing or minimizing the harm from a bioterrorist \nattack on our food supply. Right now, our food is the safest in the \nworld, but there are widening gaps in our food safety net due to \nemerging threats and the fact that food safety oversight has evolved \nover time to spread across several agencies. This mismatched, piecemeal \napproach to food safety could spell disaster if we do not act quickly \nand decisively.\n  But don't take it from me. Former HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson told \nreporters in December as he resigned that he worries ``every single \nnight'' about a massive attack on the U.S. food supply. ``I, for the \nlife of me, cannot understand why the terrorists have not, you know, \nattacked our food supply, because it is so easy to do,'' Thompson said. \n``And we are importing a lot of food from the Middle East, and it would \nbe easy to tamper with that,'' he said.\n  No wonder he feels that way. Several Federal agencies, all with \ndifferent and conflicting missions, work to ensure our food is safe. \nFor example, there is no standardization for inspections--processed \nfood facilities may see a Food and Drug Administration inspector once \nevery 5 to 6 years, while meat and poultry operations are inspected \ndaily by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that \nas many as 76 million people suffer from food poisoning each year. Of \nthose individuals, approximately 325,000 will be hospitalized, and more \nthan 5,000 will die. Factors such as emerging pathogens, an aging \npopulation at high risk for foodborne illnesses, an increasing volume \nof food imports, and people eating outside their homes more often \nunderscore the need for us to take charge and shed the old bureaucratic \nshackles that have tied us to the overlapping and inefficient ad \nhoc food safety system of the past.\n\n  That is why I come to the Senate floor today to introduce the Safe \nFood Act of 2005. My House counterpart, Representative Rosa DeLauro, is \nintroducing the bill in the other body. This legislation would create a \nsingle, independent Federal food safety agency to administer all \naspects of Federal food safety inspections, enforcement, standards-\nsetting and research in order to protect public health. The components \nof the agencies now charged with protecting the food supply, primarily \nhoused at the Food and Drug Administration and the Agriculture \nDepartment, would be transferred to this new agency.\n  The new Food Safety Administrator would be responsible for the safety \nof the food supply, and would fulfill that charge by implementing the \nregistration and recordkeeping requirements of the 2002 bioterrorism \nlaw; ensuring slaughterhouses and food processing plants have \nprocedures in place to prevent and reduce food contamination; regularly \ninspecting domestic food facilities, with inspection frequency based on \nrisk; and centralizing the authority to detain, seize, condemn and \nrecall food that is adulterated or misbranded. The Administrator would \nbe charged with requiring food producers to code their products so \nthose products could be traced in the event of a foodborne illness \noutbreak in order to minimize the health impact of such an event.\n  The Administrator would also have the power examine the food safety \npractices of foreign countries and work with the states to impose \nvarious civil and criminal penalties for serious violations of the food \nsafety laws. The Administrator would also actively oversee public \neducation and research programs on foodborne illness.\n  It is time to create a single food safety agency in this country. I \nam encouraged by a February 2005 Government Accountability Office \nreport in which government officials in seven other high-income \ncountries who have consolidated their food safety systems consistently \nstate that the benefits of consolidation outweigh the costs.\n  In this era of limited budgets, it is our responsibility to \nstreamline the Federal food safety system. The United States simply \ncannot afford to continue operating multiple redundant systems. This is \nnot about more regulation, a super agency, or increased bureaucracy. It \nis about common sense and the more effective marshaling of our existing \nresources.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S3303]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 729\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the safety of the food supply of the United States is \n     vital to the public health, to public confidence in the food \n     supply, and to the success of the food sector of the Nation's \n     economy;\n       (2) lapses in the protection of the food supply and loss of \n     public confidence in food safety are damaging to consumers \n     and the food industry, and place a burden on interstate \n     commerce;\n       (3) the safety and security of the food supply requires an \n     integrated, system-wide approach to preventing food-borne \n     illness, a thorough and broad-based approach to basic and \n     applied research, and intensive, effective, and efficient \n     management of the Nation's food safety program;\n       (4) the task of preserving the safety of the food supply of \n     the United States faces tremendous pressures with regard to--\n       (A) emerging pathogens and other contaminants and the \n     ability to detect all forms of contamination;\n       (B) an aging and immune compromised population, with a \n     growing number of people at high-risk for food-borne \n     illnesses, including infants and children;\n       (C) an increasing volume of imported food, without adequate \n     monitoring and inspection; and\n       (D) maintenance of rigorous inspection of the domestic food \n     processing and food service industries;\n       (5) Federal food safety standard setting, inspection, \n     enforcement, and research efforts should be based on the best \n     available science and public health considerations and food \n     safety resources should be systematically deployed in ways \n     that most effectively prevent food-borne illness;\n       (6) the Federal food safety system is fragmented, with at \n     least 12 Federal agencies sharing responsibility for food \n     safety, and operates under laws that do not reflect current \n     conditions in the food system or current scientific knowledge \n     about the cause and prevention of food-borne illness;\n       (7) the fragmented Federal food safety system and outdated \n     laws preclude an integrated, system-wide approach to \n     preventing food-borne illness, to the effective and efficient \n     operation of the Nation's food safety program, and to the \n     most beneficial deployment of food safety resources;\n       (8) the National Academy of Sciences recommended in the \n     report ``Ensuring Safe Food from Production to Consumption'' \n     that Congress establish by statute a unified and central \n     framework for managing Federal food safety programs, and \n     recommended modifying Federal statutes so that inspection, \n     enforcement, and research efforts are based on scientifically \n     supportable assessments of risks to public health; and\n       (9) the lack of a single focal point for food safety \n     leadership in the United States undercuts the ability of the \n     United States to exert food safety leadership \n     internationally, which is detrimental to the public health \n     and the international trade interests of the United States.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish a single agency to be known as the ``Food \n     Safety Administration'' to--\n       (A) regulate food safety and labeling to strengthen the \n     protection of the public health;\n       (B) ensure that food establishments fulfill their \n     responsibility to produce food in a manner that protects the \n     public health of all people in the United States;\n       (C) lead an integrated, system-wide approach to food safety \n     and to make more effective and efficient use of resources to \n     prevent food-borne illness;\n       (D) provide a single focal point for food safety \n     leadership, both nationally and internationally; and\n       (E) provide an integrated food safety research capability, \n     utilizing internally-generated, scientifically and \n     statistically valid studies, in cooperation with academic \n     institutions and other scientific entities of the Federal and \n     State governments, to achieve the continuous improvement of \n     research on food-borne illness and contaminants;\n       (2) to transfer to the Food Safety Administration the food \n     safety, labeling, inspection, and enforcement functions that, \n     as of the day before the effective date of this Act, are \n     performed by other Federal agencies; and\n       (3) to modernize and strengthen the Federal food safety \n     laws to achieve more effective application and efficient \n     management of the laws for the protection and improvement of \n     public health.\n\n     SEC. 3.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act takes effect on the date of enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 730. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to establish requirements \nconcerning the operation of fossil fuel-fired electric utility steam \ngenerating units, commercial and industrial boiler units, solid waste \nincineration units, medical waste incinerators, hazardous waste \ncombustors, chlor-alkali plants, and Portland cement plants to reduce \nemissions of mercury to the environment, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I again will discuss mercury \npollution and the serious and immediate health risks it poses to the \nhealth of citizens across our Nation.\n  This is not a new issue. We have known about mercury pollution for \ndecades, and it remains one of, if not the last, major toxic pollutant \nwithout a comprehensive plan to control its release. We know where the \nsources mercury pollution are, we know where the pollution deposits, \nand we definitely know what harm it causes to people and to wildlife.\n  We need to confront mercury pollution because it is a threat to \npregnant women and children. The Environmental Protection Agency's own \nscientists estimate that one of every six women of child-bearing age \nhas elevated levels of mercury in her body above safe thresholds.\n  Mercury can cause neurological harm to children exposed to increased \nmercury levels while in the womb and during the first few years of \ntheir lives, which can lead to increased risk for learning \ndisabilities, developmental delays, and other serious problems.\n  Just last year EPA scientists nearly doubled the previous estimate of \nthe number of children at increased risk from exposure to elevated \nmercury levels in their mothers' wombs from 300,000 to over 600,000. \nThis finding should alarm all of us and spur this Administration to \npromptly develop strong controls on mercury pollution from power plants \nthat meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act and that fully protect \nwomen and children.\n  Yet unfortunately, this Administration has not done that. The \nAdministration's new mercury rule and the so-\n\n[[Page S3313]]\n\ncalled ``Clear Skies'' proposal turn back progress, ignore available \nclean air technology, and will leave more toxic mercury in our air, \nwater, and fish and for a longer time than is necessary.\n  Because of this, on behalf of Senator Snowe and myself, I am \nreintroducing legislation today that will confront this problem \ndirectly and that will reduce mercury pollution from all sources.\n  Our bill will reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants \nby 90 percent by 2010. The cap-and-trade approach the Administration is \npushing for in both the mercury rule and the President's Clear Skies \nproposal would only reduce emissions by less than 50 percent in the \nnear future and possibly 70 percent over the next 15 years.\n  I introduce this legislation on the heels of two recent reports about \nthe proposed EPA mercury rule, one from the Government Accountability \nOffice and one from the EPA Inspector General. Both the IG and GAO \nreports severely criticize this Administration's mercury rulemaking \nprocess, saying it violated EPA policy, OMB guidance, Presidential \nExecutive Orders and, in some instances, important provisions of the \nClean Air Act.\n  I find this extremely troublesome. These are serious problems that \ngreatly undermine the credibility of this Administration and that led \nthem to create policies that fail to adequately protect the children in \nmy state of Vermont and those all across the country. Rather than \ndevelop unbiased science-based limits on mercury pollution, they \ninstead developed limits to fit predetermined numbers found in the \nPresident's industry friendly Clear Skies proposal.\n  The GAO found critical flaws with the economic analysis that \nbasically prevent anyone from actually verifying the supposed benefits \nof the cap-and-trade approach proposed in both EPA's rule and in the \nClear Skies plan. In simple terms you could call it another example of \nthe smoke and mirrors this Administration has used to support its \nflawed dirty air pollution policies.\n  Not only were the supposed benefits of the cap-and-trade proposal \nvirtually undocumented, they did not even bother to analyze whatsoever \nthe health benefits to women and children from controlling toxic \nmercury. If protecting the health of women and children is truly \nimportant to this Administration, then why would they skip such an \nimportant analysis?\n  Not surprisingly, the EPA Inspector General confirmed what the GAO \nfound. That EPA staff were directed to ignore the Clean Air Act and \ninstead write a mercury rule to fit the weak mercury caps in the \nPresident's Clear Skies initiative.\n  Rather than let EPA's capable scientists and engineers do their jobs, \nthey decided to play politics and bow to special interest groups. How \nelse did industry favorable policies and analyses found in memos \nwritten by industry lobbyists make it into the rule, verbatim?\n  Both the GAO and IG reports make it clear that EPA staff were \npressured to ignore parts of the Clean Air Act and to propose weaker \nmercury reductions than what are technically feasible and required \nunder the law.\n  The President's Clear Skies proposal formed the basis for the flawed \nmercury rule, so it obviously shares the same flaws. These two reports \nconfirm what many of us already suspected, that Clear Skies is based on \nbiased analyses, inadequate and faulty justifications.\n  This Administration must stop the shenanigans. They need to stop \ndownplaying the health risks of mercury pollution and stop catering to \nthe special interests of the power industry and their lobbyists.\n  The clarity and diversity of voices opposed to their poor mercury \npolicies are unprecedented in the 30-year history of EPA. Now is the \ntime for them to listen to the voices of more than 600,000 citizens and \nmore than one million sportsmen and women nationwide that sent EPA \nletters opposing the weak mercury rule.\n  Now is the time to listen to the nearly 100 national and local church \nleaders, representing dozens of denominations and millions of \ncongregants, who sent a letter to President Bush expressing ``grave \nmoral concern'' about his misleadingly titled Clear Skies Initiative.\n  I call on the Administration to take immediate action to correct the \nserious problems in EPA's proposed power plant mercury rules. Instead, \nI hope that we can begin to meet the targets set out in this bill and \nstart protecting the health of women and children.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Overview of the Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 2005\n\n         Sponsored by Senators Patrick Leahy and Olympia Snowe\n\n     What will the Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 2005 \n         do?\n       The Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 2005 \n     mandates substantial reductions in mercury emissions from all \n     major sources in the United States. It is the only \n     comprehensive legislation to control mercury emissions from \n     all major sources. It directs EPA to issue new standards for \n     unregulated sources and to monitor and report on the progress \n     of currently regulated sources. It sets an aggressive \n     timetable for these reductions so that mercury emissions are \n     reduced as soon as possible.\n       With these emissions reductions, the bill requires the safe \n     disposal of mercury recovered from pollution control systems, \n     so that the hazards of mercury are not merely transferred \n     from one environmental medium to another. It requires annual \n     public reporting--in both paper and electronic form--of \n     facility-specific mercury emissions. It phases out mercury \n     use in consumer products, requires product labeling, and \n     mandates international cooperation. It supports research into \n     the retirement of excess mercury, the handling of mercury \n     waste, the effectiveness of fish consumption advisories, and \n     the magnitude of previously uninventoried sources.\n     Section 3. Mercury emission standards for fossil fuel-fired \n         electric utility steam generating units\n       The EPA's Mercury Study Report to Congress estimated 52 \n     tons of mercury emissions occur per year from coal- and oil-\n     fired electric utility steam generating units. More recently, \n     an EPA inventory estimated 48 tons of mercury from coal-fired \n     power plants. Collectively, these power plants constitute the \n     largest source of mercury emissions in the United States. In \n     December 2000, the EPA issued a positive determination to \n     regulate these mercury emissions. But these rules will take \n     years to write and implement, and there is already vigorous \n     industry opposition. It is uncertain what form these rules \n     will take or how long they may be delayed. This section \n     requires EPA to set a Amaximum achievable control technology \n     (MACT) standard for these emissions, such that nationwide \n     emissions decrease by at least 90 percent.\n     Section 4. Mercury emission standards for coal- and oil-fired \n         commercial and industrial boiler units\n       The EPA's report on its study estimates that 29 tons of \n     mercury is emitted per year from coal- and oil-fired \n     commercial and industrial boiler units. This section requires \n     EPA to set a MACT standard for these mercury emissions, such \n     that nationwide emissions decrease by at least 90 percent.\n     Section 5. Reduction of mercury emissions from solid waste \n         incineration units\n       The EPA study estimates that 30 tons of mercury emissions \n     are released each year from municipal waste combustors. These \n     emissions result from the presence of mercury-containing \n     items such as fluorescent lamps, fever thermometers, \n     thermostats and switches, in municipal solid waste streams. \n     In 1995, EPA promulgated final rules for these emissions, and \n     these rules took effect in 2000. This section reaffirms those \n     rules and requires stricter rules for units that do not \n     comply. The most effective way to reduce mercury emissions \n     from incinerators is to reduce the volume of mercury-\n     containing items before they reach the incinerator. That is \n     why this section also requires the separation of mercury-\n     containing items from the waste stream, the labeling of \n     mercury-containing items to facilitate this separation, and \n     the phase-out of mercury in consumer products within three \n     years, allowing for the possibility of exceptions for \n     essential uses.\n     Section 6. Mercury emission standards for chlor-alkali plants\n       The EPA study estimates that 7 tons of mercury emissions \n     are released per year from chlor-alkali plants that use the \n     mercury cell process to produce chlorine. EPA has not issued \n     rules to regulate these emissions. This section requires each \n     chlor-alkali plant that uses the mercury cell process to \n     reduce its mercury emissions by 95 percent. The most \n     effective way to meet this standard would be to switch to the \n     more energy efficient membrane cell process, which many \n     plants already use.\n     Section 7. Mercury emission standards for Portland cement \n         plants\n       The EPA study estimates that 5 tons of mercury emissions \n     are released each year from Portland cement plants. In 1999 \n     EPA promulgated final rules for emissions from cement plants, \n     but these rules did not include mercury. This section \n     requires each\n\n[[Page S3314]]\n\n     Portland cement plant to reduce its mercury emissions by 95 \n     percent.\n     Section 8. Report on implementation of mercury emission \n         standards for medical waste incinerators\n       The EPA study estimates that 16 tons of mercury emissions \n     are released per year from medical waste incinerators. In \n     1997 EPA issued final rules for emissions from hospital/\n     medical/infectious waste incinerators. This section requires \n     EPA to report on the success of these rules in reducing these \n     mercury emissions.\n     Section 9. Report on implementation of mercury emission \n         standards for hazardous waste combustors\n       The EPA study estimates that 7 tons of mercury emissions \n     are released each year from hazardous waste incinerators. In \n     1999 EPA promulgated final rules for these emissions. This \n     section requires EPA to report on the success of these rules \n     in reducing these mercury emissions.\n     Section 10. Defense activities\n       This section requires the Department of Defense to report \n     on its use of mercury, including the steps it is taking to \n     reduce mercury emissions and to stabilize and recycle \n     discarded mercury. This section also prohibits the Department \n     of Defense from returning the nearly 5,000 tons of mercury in \n     the National Defense Stockpile to the global market.\n     Section 11. International activities\n       This section directs EPA to work with Canada and Mexico to \n     study mercury pollution in North America, including the \n     sources of mercury pollution, the pathways of the pollution, \n     and options for reducing the pollution.\n     Section 12. Mercury research\n       This section supports a variety of mercury research \n     projects. First, it promotes accountability by mandating an \n     interagency report on the effectiveness of this act in \n     reducing mercury pollution. Second, it mandates an EPA study \n     on mercury sedimentation trends in major bodies of water. \n     Third, it directs EPA to evaluate and improve state-level \n     mercury data and fish consumption advisories. Fourth, it \n     mandates a National Academy of Sciences report on the \n     retirement of excess mercury, such as stockpiled industrial \n     mercury that is no longer needed due to plant closures or \n     process changes. Fifth, it mandates an EPA study of mercury \n     emissions from electric arc furnaces, a source not studied in \n     the EPA's study report. Finally, it authorizes $2,000,000 for \n     modernization and expansion of the Mercury Deposition \n     Network, plus $10,000,000 over ten years for operational \n     support of that network.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Burns, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Dorgan, \n        Mr. Kohl, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Thune):\n  S. 731. A bill to recruit and retain more qualified individuals to \nteach in Tribal Colleges or Universities; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, three years ago, Senator Burns and I \nformed the bipartisan Task Force on Tribal Colleges and Universities to \nraise awareness of the important role that the tribal colleges and \nuniversities play in their respective communities as educational, \neconomic, and cultural centers. The Task Force seeks to advance \ninitiatives that help improve the quality education the colleges \nprovide.\n  For more than three decades, tribal colleges have been providing a \nquality education to help Native Americans of all ages reach their \nfullest potential. More than 30,000 students from 250 tribes nationwide \nattend tribal colleges. Tribal colleges serve young people preparing to \nenter the job market, dislocated workers learning new skills, and \npeople seeking to move off welfare. I am a strong supporter of our \nNation's tribal colleges because, more than any other factor, they are \nbringing hope and opportunity to America's Indian communities.\n  Over the years, I have met with many tribal college students, and I \nam always impressed by their commitment to their education, their \nfamilies and their communities. Tribal colleges and universities have \nbeen highly successful in helping Native Americans obtain a higher \neducation. Congress has recognized the importance of these institutions \nand the significant gains they have achieved in helping more \nindividuals obtain their education. While Congress has steadily \nincreased its financial support of these institutions, many challenges \nstill remain.\n  One of the challenges that the tribal college presidents have \nexpressed to me is the frustration and difficulty they have in \nattracting qualified individuals to teach at the colleges. Recruitment \nand retention are difficult for many of the colleges because of their \ngeographic isolation and low faculty salaries.\n  To help tackle the challenges of recruiting and retaining qualified \nteachers, I am introducing the Tribal Colleges and Universities Teacher \nLoan Forgiveness Act. This legislation will provide student loan \nforgiveness to individuals who commit to teach for up to five years in \none of the tribal colleges nationwide. Individuals who have Perkins, \nDirect, or Guaranteed loans may qualify to receive up to $15,000 in \nloan forgiveness. This program will provide these institutions with \nextra help in attracting qualified teachers, and thus help ensure that \ndeserving students receive a quality education.\n  I would be remiss if I did not recognize that former Senator Daschle \nwas responsible for spearheading this initiative for a number of years. \nThe tribal colleges lost a true champion, but I am pleased to carry \nforward his vision and support for the colleges.\n  I am pleased that Senators Burns, Johnson, Dorgan, Kohl, Domenici, \nand Bingaman are original cosponsors of this bill, and I look forward \nto working with my colleagues to pass this important legislation.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nConrad, in sponsoring legislation to provide student loan forgiveness \nto educators who commit to teaching in our tribal colleges. This \nlegislation will provide up to $15,000 in loan forgiveness--a strong \nrecruitment and retention tool for tribal colleges which often can't \npay the same salaries as larger institutions.\n  I am, and have been for years, a strong supporter of Montana's tribal \ncolleges as well as tribal colleges nationwide. They contribute greatly \nto our Native American communities, providing the tools for our tribal \nchildren to succeed in the world of higher education. Graduates often \ncontinue their education at Montana State or the University of Montana \nand take this knowledge and expertise back to their communities. These \nstudents strengthen and improve both our tribal communities and our \nState as a whole. They add to the social, economic, political and \ncultural fabric that is unique to Indian Country.\n  I know how hard our tribal colleges work to achieve success and to \nmaintain high standards. A talented faculty is key to those goals, but \ntoo often tight budgets for tribal colleges limit their ability to \nrecruit and retain faculty. Our tribal colleges and their students \ndeserve quality teachers, and providing loan forgiveness will help \nattract and keep good faculty in what can be very rural areas.\n  In addition to forgiveness for Perkins, direct or guaranteed loans, \nthis legislation will also provide assistance for nursing faculty at \ntribal colleges. The nursing shortage is a nationwide problem, \nparticularly in rural areas and specifically in Indian Country. \nGraduates of tribal colleges often stay near or return home, and that \nholds true for nursing graduates as well. Supporting nursing programs \nat tribal colleges addresses that shortage by training professionals \nwho are familiar with the acute medical needs and cultural differences \nin rural areas and are often willing to stay and wage the battles. This \nlegislation will provide nursing loan forgiveness to nursing \ninstructors at tribal colleges and will help strengthen a valuable \nprogram in Montana and around the country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 732. A bill to authorize funds to Federal aid highways, highway \nsafety programs, and transit programs, and for other purposes; from the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works; placed on the calendar.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am introducing today the Safe, \nAccountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005, \nSAFETEA, which the Committee on Environment and Public Works reported \nout on March 16, 2005. This bill reauthorizes the Federal aid highway \nprogram which has been operating on extensions since it expired on \nSeptember 30, 2003. The bill I am introducing today is essentially S. \n1072 as passed by the Senate in the 108th Congress, with the exception \nthat the overall funding level has been changed from $318 billion over \n6 years to reflect the President's proposed funding level of $283.9 \nbillion over 6 years.\n  Last year, this body voted 76 to 21 to adopt S. 1072. Clearly, there \nwas overwhelming support for this measure\n\n[[Page S3315]]\n\nthen, and in conversations with Members this year, I am confident that \nthere is a real desire to get this bill done. We are already to take \nthe bill up on the Senate floor just as soon as it is scheduled by the \nleadership.\n  It has been nearly 18 months since the current program, \nTransportation Equity Act for the 21 Century--TEA-21, expired. To date, \nwe have done a total of six extensions with the current extension due \nto expire on May 31. This next deadline is fast approaching, and in \naddition to completing action on the floor, we still must conference \nwith the House which has a very different formula program than proposed \nlast year. We will have more challenging issues to address and need as \nmuch time as possible to do so.\n  Briefly, as in the bill passed by the Senate last year, the bill I am \nintroducing today will address several critical issues in our \ntransportation system. Specifically, the language improves on the \nexisting program in the following areas:\n  Safety: Nearly 43,000 people died in 2002 on our Nation's highways. \nThis represents the single greatest cause of accidental death in \nAmerica. The Environment and Public Works Committee bill addresses this \nby creating a new core safety program and funding it accordingly.\n  Congestion: According to the Department of Transportation, time spent \nin congestion increased from 31.7 percent in 1992 to 33.1 percent in \n2000. Based on this rate, a typical ``rush hour'' in an urbanized area \nis 5.3 hours per day. The problem is not in just urban areas; cities \nwith populations less than 500,000 have experienced the greatest growth \nin travel delays, according to the DOT. Under this proposal, we would \naddress the congestion problem by establishing a new Transportation \nFreight Gateway program which targets bottlenecks around ports and \nintermodal facilities.\n  Environment: This bill addresses the need to reduce delays in project \ndelivery in several ways. The bill contains carefully balanced language \non incorporating environmental concerns into planning and project \nreview as early as practicable, while ensuring that disagreements over \nsuch concerns don't indefinitely delay much needed transportation \nprojects. The language on the section 4(f) process will also help \nreduce unnecessary delays by enabling projects with de minimis impacts \non 4(f) resources to proceed in a timely manner.\n  Also, the bill seeks to correct the inconsistencies between the \ntransportation planning and air quality planning that must take place \nin areas in nonattainment under the Clean Air Act. The bill \nrationalizes the schedules for developing transportation plans and \ndemonstrating conformity and aligns the length of the transportation \nplan considered under conformity with the length of the air quality \nplan.\n  Equity: The bill provides all States at least 10 percent growth over \nTEA-21 while increasing the rate of return for donor States from the \ncurrent 90.5 percent to 92 percent by 2009. We maintain the TEA-21 \nscope of 92.5 percent.\n  The longer we delay enactment of a multiyear bill, we are negatively \naffecting economic growth. According to DOT estimates, every $1 billion \nof Federal Funds invested in highway improvements creates 47,000 jobs. \nThe same $1 billion investment yields $500 million in new orders for \nthe manufacturing sector and $500 million spread throughout other \nsectors of the economy.\n  States contract awards for the 2005 spring and summer construction \nseason are going out to bid. If we fail to pass this bill soon, States \nwill not know what to expect in Federal funding and the uncertainty \nwill potentially force States to delay putting these projects out for \nbid. According to the American Association of State Highway \nTransportation Officials, AASHTO, an estimated 90,000 jobs are at \nstake. This problem is exacerbated for northern States which have \nshorter construction seasons. Many State transportation departments \nhave advanced State dollars to construct projects eligible for Federal \nfunding in anticipation of our action to reauthorize the program. \nWithout a new bill, States are essentially left ``holding the bag.''\n  Over the past 6 years under TEA-21, we have made great progress in \npreserving and improving the overall physical condition and operation \nof our transportation system; however, more needs to be done. A safe, \neffective transportation system is the foundation of our economy. We \nare past due to fulfill an obligation to this country and the American \npeople.\n  As mentioned earlier, the bill is essentially the same bill that was \npassed on the Senate floor last year--a bipartisan product of many \nmonths of hard work and compromise. It remains a very good piece of \nlegislation.\n  The most significant difference with this bill, of course, is that it \nis drafted at the $283.9 billion level over 6 years. Since 2004 is \nbehind us, the Environment and Public Works Committee bill includes \nonly years 2005 to 2009 which is effectively $283.9 minus fiscal year \n2004. S. 1072 passed the Senate last year and guaranteed all donor \nStates a rate of return of 95 percent. At a lower funding level, we \nwere able only to achieve a 92-percent rate of return but kept the 10 \npercent floor over TEA-21.\n  I am certain my colleagues share my strong desire to get a \ntransportation reauthorization bill passed and signed into law by the \nPresident. I urge the leadership to schedule consideration of this bill \nthis month so we can get it done.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 738. A bill to provide relief for the cotton shirt industry; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I seek recognition to introduce \nlegislation entitled the ``Cotton Shirt Industry Tariff Relief and \nTechnical Corrections Act.'' This legislation will strengthen our \ndomestic dress shirt manufacturers and the pima cotton growers. My bill \nis a technical correction that levels the playing field by correcting \nan anomaly from previous trade agreements that has unfairly advantaged \nforeign producers and sent hundreds of jobs offshore.\n  This legislation reduces duties levied on cotton shirting fabric that \nis not made in the United States. Currently, U.S. law recognizes this \nlack of fabric availability and grants special favorable trade \nconcessions to manufacturers in Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, the \nAndean region, and Africa. The U.S. has allowed shirts to enter this \ncountry duty-free from many other countries, while we have failed to \nreduce tariffs on those manufacturers that stayed in the U.S. and were \nforced to compete on these uneven terms. My bill will correct this \ninequity.\n  This legislation also recognizes the need to creatively promote the \nU.S. shirting manufacturing and textiles sectors, and does so through \nthe creation of a Cotton Competitiveness grant program, which is funded \nthrough a portion of previously collected duties.\n  Our country has experienced an enormous loss of jobs in the \nmanufacturing sector. It is critical that our domestic manufacturers \nare able to compete on a level playing field. In the case of the \ndomestic dress shirt industry, the problem is our own government \nimposing a tariff of up to eleven percent upon the import of fabric \nmade from U.S. pima cotton. My legislation is a concrete step that this \nCongress can take to reduce the hemorrhaging of U.S. manufacturing \njobs.\n  One group of beneficiaries of this amendment is a Gitman Brothers \nfactory in Ashland, PA. The Ashland Shirt and Pajama factory was built \nin 1948 and employs 265 workers. This factory in the Lehigh Valley \nturns out world class shirts with such labels as Burberry and Saks \nFifth Avenue that are shipped across the U.S. Currently, Gitman pays an \naverage tariff of eleven percent on the fabric it imports to make \nshirts. Their shirts are made of pima cotton that is grown in the \nSouthwestern U.S., but spun into fabric only by special mills in \nWestern Europe. Gitman must compete against Canadian shirt companies \nthat import the same fabric tariff-free and who can then ship their \nshirts into the U.S. tariff-free under NAFTA. These workers and their \nfamilies deserve trade laws that do not chase their jobs offshore.\n  This legislation enjoys the support of the domestic shirting \nindustry, UNITE, and the Pima cotton associations. I offer this \nlegislation on behalf of the men and women of the Gitman factory in \nAshland, the domestic dress shirting industry, and the pima cotton \ngrowers, so that for them free trade will indeed be fair trade as well.\n\n[[Page S3316]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/06/senate-section/article/S3316-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 97--COMMENDING PATRICIA SUE HEAD SUMMITT, HEAD \n  WOMEN'S BASKETBALL COACH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE, FOR THREE \n   DECADES OF EXCELLENCE AS A PROVEN LEADER, MOTIVATED TEACHER, AND \n                          ESTABLISHED CHAMPION\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. Alexander) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Res. 99\n\n       Whereas the United States has consistently worked to \n     increase protections for marine mammals, such as dolphins and \n     whales, since the enactment of the Marine Mammal Protection \n     Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.);\n       Whereas dolphins and whales are found worldwide, including \n     in both of the polar regions, throughout the high seas, and \n     along most coastal areas;\n       Whereas these unique, highly social, and intelligent \n     animals have caught the imagination of the public not only in \n     the United States, but in many nations around the world;\n       Whereas the over-exploitation of small cetaceans for \n     decades has resulted in the serious decline, and in some \n     cases, the commercial extinction, of those species;\n       Whereas each year tens of thousands of small cetaceans are \n     herded into small coves in certain nations, are slaughtered \n     with spears and knives, and die as a result of blood loss and \n     hemorrhagic shock;\n       Whereas in many cases, those responsible for the slaughter \n     prevent documentation or data from the events from being \n     recorded or made public;\n       Whereas the deficient information on hunt yields and small \n     cetacean populations indicates a lack of commitment to \n     maintaining sustainable populations and prevents scrutiny of \n     humaneness of killing methods;\n       Whereas for at least the past 4 years toxicologists have \n     issued warnings regarding high levels of mercury and other \n     contaminants in meat from small cetaceans caught off coastal \n     regions;\n       Whereas some nations that participate in small cetacean \n     slaughter are members of the United Nations Convention on the \n     Law of\n\n[[Page S3317]]\n\n     the Sea, done at Montego Bay, Jamaica, December 10, 1982, and \n     are therefore bound to honor article 65 of that Convention, \n     which declares that ``States shall cooperate with a view to \n     the conservation of marine mammals and in the case of \n     cetaceans shall in particular work through the appropriate \n     international organizations for their conservation, \n     management, and study'';\n       Whereas in 1946, 14 nations adopted the International \n     Convention for the Regulation of Whaling with schedule of \n     whaling regulations, signed at Washington December 2, 1946 \n     (TIAS 1849), which established the International Whaling \n     Commission to provide for the proper conservation of whales \n     stocks;

and\n       (ii) to ensure an ambitious conservation agenda for all \n     future meetings of the Committee; and\n       (3) the United States should make full use of all \n     appropriate diplomatic mechanisms, relevant international \n     laws and agreements, Federal laws, including the Fishermen's \n     Protective Act of 1967 (commonly known as the Pelly \n     Amendment) (22 U.S.C. 1971 et seq.), and other appropriate \n     means to implement these goals.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution to \ncondemn the inhumane and unnecessary slaughter of dolphins, porpoises, \nand small whales that occurs in certain nations around the world.\n  This resolution would send the U.S. delegation to this year's \nInternational Whaling Commission meeting with the message that the \nslaughter of these marine mammals must be stopped, and that the \ncommission must protect them. I am pleased to be joined by my \ncosponsors, Senators Levin, Sarbanes, and Lieberman.\n  Each year, more than 20,000 dolphins, porpoises, and small whales, \nwhich are collectively called small cetaceans, are slaughtered by \nmethods that are beyond inhumane.\n  These mammals are intelligent, they live in family groups, and they \nfeel pain. In many cases, they are herded together into small coves, \nwhere they are confined with nets. Once they are trapped, the slaughter \nbegins.\n  The first step is often to slice their throats with knives, causing \nthem to bleed to death. This slow and painful method is used because \ncetaceans are hard to kill, due to their natural protective layer of \nblubber.\n  Very often, processing of these mammals begins before they are even \ndead. They are wrenched from the water with cranes, loaded while in a \nstate of shock into trucks, and taken to warehouses where their flesh \nis removed to be sold as meat. All of this can occur while the animals \nare still alive.\n  Dolphins, porpoises, and small whales are some of the most advanced \nanimals in the world, on land or at sea. They can feel pain the same \nway and to the same extent humans can.\n  I find this treatment of these remarkable animals abhorrent and \ninhumane. However, the process I have described is also objectionable \nfor several other reasons.\n  The meat of these animals is sold as food, often mislabeled as \n``whale meat,'' which to many people suggests open-ocean large whales \nthat are still hunted by several nations despite a worldwide \nmoratorium.\n  However, the meat of small cetaceans is not large whale meat. Small \ncetacean meat can be very unhealthy. These small animals are more \nlikely than large whales to live along the coast, and they are higher \nup in the food chain, so their bodies are often contaminated with \nmercury and other pollutants. Levels of contaminants in some of this \nmeat are often much higher than what is recommended by the nations \nwhere it is sold.\n  Another problem is that many of these small cetacean populations are \nbeing threatened by the loss of large numbers of animals. Over-\nexploitation of small cetaceans has resulted in the serious decline and \neven the commercial extinction of some populations.\n  Unfortunately, it is difficult to track the take and the populations \nof these animals, as the people who slaughter them don't allow full, \nand in some cases any, documentation of the killing. Their failure to \nkeep accurate information indicates that they lack a commitment to \nmaintaining sustainable populations.\n  The International Whaling Commission (IWC) has passed at least 5 \nresolutions condemning these types of small cetacean slaughters. Our \nresolution will send the United States delegation to the next IWC \nmeeting with the message that this issue is not forgotten.\n  It will also ensure that the U.S. delegation works to clarify the \nIWC's mission to manage and protect small cetaceans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/06/senate-section/article/S3317-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3317-S3318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 100--DISAPPROVING THE REQUEST OF THE PRESIDENT FOR \n   EXTENSION UNDER SECTION 2103(C)(1)(B)(I) OF THE BIPARTISAN TRADE \n  PROMOTION AUTHORITY ACT OF 2002, OF THE TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITIES \n                             UNDER THAT ACT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mr. Byrd) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                              S. Res. 100\n\n       Resolved, That the Senate disapproves the request of the \n     President for the extension, under section 2103(c)(1)(B)(i) \n     of the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002, of \n     the trade authorities procedures under that Act to any \n     implementing bill submitted with respect to any trade \n     agreement entered into under section 2103(b) of that Act \n     after June 30, 2005.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution to \ndisapprove of the extension of ``trade promotion authority,'' better \nknown as ``fast track,'' for trade agreements.\n  In 2002, the U.S. Congress decided to tie its hands behind its back \nwhen it comes to international trade.\n  The Constitution, at Article I, Section 8, gives the Congress the \npower to regulate foreign commerce. But in 2002 we handed that \nauthority to the President, and effectively gave him a blank check. We \ngave the President the authority to negotiate trade agreements in \nsecret, and to bring those agreements back to the Senate for a vote, \nwithout the possibility of a single amendment being offered.\n  What was the result? We saw the signing of agreements like the \nCentral American Free Trade Agreement, or CAFTA. This is an agreement \nthat would integrate our economy with those of Costa Rica, El Salvador, \nGuatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic.\n  Do the American people think this is a good idea? Not on your life, \ncertainly not after what they've seen with the NAFTA deal with Mexico. \nCAFTA promises more of the same: U.S. jobs going overseas, as companies \ntry to take advantage of low-wage labor in countries with no \nenvironmental controls.\n  If we were able to offer amendments to CAFTA, we could, for instance, \nhave meaningful prohibitions on child or sweatshop labor, or pollution \nby overseas factories. Provisions that would protect American workers \nfrom having to compete with children working in filthy factories for \npennies a day.\n  But that's not the kind of CAFTA agreement that big business wants.\n\n[[Page S3318]]\n\nThey want to pole vault over basic labor and environmental laws in our \ncountry, and just move their factories to countries like Guatemala or \nHonduras.\n  I am going to lead the fight against CAFTA in the U.S. Senate. But I \nwant to make sure that we get rid of this fast track authority that \nhelped create this awful agreement in the first place.\n  Well, the legislation that gave fast track authority to the president \nin 2002 said that Congress would get to decide in 2005 whether to \nextend fast track. Any Senator can come to the floor of the Senate and \noffer a resolution saying that we should not extend fast track. And I \nam availing myself of that opportunity today.\n  But there is a catch. The supporters of fast track authority buried a \nprovision in the 2002 bill, which says that the Senate does not get to \nvote on this resolution unless the Finance Committee first approves it. \nAnd the staff of Chairman of the Finance Committee has indicated that \nthere is no way they are going to allow the Senate to vote on such a \nresolution.\n  I don't want to see any more agreements like CAFTA being negotiated \nin secret, and then brought to the U.S. Senate without the possibility \nof even a single amendment. So I am offering today a resolution of \ndisapproval for extension of fast track, in accordance with the law.\n  And I am going to do everything I can to see to it that the Senate \ngets a chance to vote on this resolution, one way or another.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/06/senate-section/article/S3318-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 101--RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \nDEVELOPMENT OF THE SALK POLIO VACCINE AND ITS IMPORTANCE IN ERADICATING \n                         THE INCIDENCE OF POLIO\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM (for himself and Mr. Specter, and Mr. Lautenberg) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Economists estimate the \n     yuan to be undervalued by between 15 percent and 40 percent \n     or an average of 27.5 percent.\n       (2) The undervaluation of the yuan provides the People's \n     Republic of China with a significant trade advantage by \n     making exports less expensive for foreign consumers and by \n     making foreign products more expensive for Chinese consumers. \n     The effective result is a significant subsidization of \n     China's exports and a virtual tariff on foreign imports.\n       (3) The Government of the People's Republic of China has \n     intervened in the foreign exchange markets to hold the value \n     of the yuan within an artificial trading range. China's \n     foreign reserves are estimated to be over $609,900,000,000 as \n     of January 12, 2005, and have increased by over \n     $206,700,000,000 in the last 12 months.\n       (4) China's undervalued currency, China's trade advantage \n     from that undervaluation, and the Chinese Government's \n     intervention in the value of its currency violates the spirit \n     and letter of the world trading system of which the People's \n     Republic of China is now a member.\n       (5) The Government of the People's Republic of China has \n     failed to promptly address concerns or to provide a \n     definitive timetable for resolution of these concerns raised \n     by the United States and the international community \n     regarding the value of its currency.\n       (6) Article XXI of the GATT 1994 (as defined in section \n     2(1)(B) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. \n     3501(1)(B))) allows a member of the World Trade Organization \n     to take any action which it considers necessary for the \n     protection of its essential security interests. Protecting \n     the United States manufacturing sector is essential to the \n     interests of the United States.\n       (b) Negotiations and Certification Regarding the Currency \n     Valuation Policy of the People's Republic of China.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding the provisions of title I \n     of Public Law 106-286 (19 U.S.C. 2431 note), on and after the \n     date that is 180 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, unless a certification described in paragraph (2) has \n     been made to Congress, in addition to any other duty, there \n     shall be imposed a rate of duty of 27.5 percent ad valorem on \n     any article that is the growth, product, or manufacture of \n     the People's Republic of China, imported directly or \n     indirectly into the United States.\n       (2) Certification.--The certification described in this \n     paragraph means a certification by the President to Congress \n     that the People's Republic of China is no longer acquiring \n     foreign exchange reserves to prevent the appreciation of the \n     rate of exchange between its currency and the United States \n     dollar for purposes of gaining an unfair competitive \n     advantage in international trade. The certification shall \n     also include a determination that the currency of the \n     People's Republic of China has undergone a substantial upward \n     revaluation placing it at or near its fair market value.\n       (3) Alternative certification.--If the President certifies \n     to Congress 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act \n     that the People's Republic of China has made a good faith \n     effort to revalue its currency upward placing it at or near \n     its fair market value, the President may delay the imposition \n     of the tariffs described in paragraph (1) for an additional \n     180 days. If at the end of the 180-day period the President \n     determines that China has developed and started actual \n     implementation of a plan to revalue its currency, the \n     President may delay imposition of the tariffs for an \n     additional 12 months, so that the People's Republic of China \n     shall have time to implement the plan.\n       (4) Negotiations.--Beginning on the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with \n     the United States Trade Representative, shall begin \n     negotiations with the People's Republic of China to ensure \n     that the People's Republic of China adopts a process that \n     leads to a substantial upward currency revaluation within 180 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act. Because various \n     Asian governments have also been acquiring substantial \n     foreign exchange reserves in an effort to prevent \n     appreciation of their currencies for purposes of gaining an \n     unfair competitive advantage in international trade, and \n     because the People's Republic of China has concerns about the \n     value of those currencies, the Secretary shall also seek to \n     convene a multilateral summit to discuss exchange rates with \n     representatives of various Asian governments and other \n     interested parties, including representatives of other G-7 \n     nations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 310.

fortunate citizens of \n     Iran.\n       (3) Iran and the United States were allies following World \n     War II, and through the late 1970s Iran was as an important \n     regional ally of the United States and a key bulwark against \n     Soviet influence.\n       (4) In November 1979, following the arrival of Mohammed \n     Reza Shah Pahlavi in the United States, a mob of students and \n     extremists seized the United States Embassy in Tehran, Iran, \n     holding United States diplomatic personnel hostage until \n     January 1981.\n       (5) Following the seizure of the United States Embassy, \n     Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, leader of the repressive \n     revolutionary movement in Iran, expressed support for the \n     actions of the students in taking American citizens hostage.\n       (6) Despite the presidential election of May 1997, an \n     election in which an estimated 91 percent of the electorate \n     participated, control of the internal and external affairs of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran is still exercised by the courts \n     in Iran and the Revolutionary Guards, Supreme Leader, and \n     Council of Guardians of the Government of Iran.\n       (7) The election results of the May 1997 election and the \n     high level of voter participation in that election \n     demonstrate that the people of Iran favor economic and \n     political reforms and greater interaction with the United \n     States and the Western world in general.\n       (8) Efforts by the United States to improve relations with \n     Iran have been rebuffed by the Government of Iran.\n       (9) The Clinton Administration eased sanctions against Iran \n     and promoted people-to-people exchanges, but the Leader of \n     the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Militant \n     Clerics' Society, the Islamic Coalition Organization, and \n     Supporters of the Party of God have all opposed efforts to \n     open Iranian society to Western influences and have opposed \n     efforts to change the dynamic of relations between the United \n     States and Iran.\n       (10) For the past two decades, the Department of State has \n     found Iran to be the leading sponsor of international \n     terrorism in the world.\n       (11) In 1983, the Iran-sponsored Hezbollah terrorist \n     organization conducted suicide terrorist operations against \n     United States military and civilian personnel in Beirut, \n     Lebanon, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of Americans.\n       (12) The United States intelligence community and law \n     enforcement personnel have linked Iran to attacks against \n     American military personnel at Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia \n     in 1996 and to al Qaeda attacks against civilians in Saudi \n     Arabia in 2004.\n       (13) According to the Department of State's Patterns of \n     Global Terrorism 2001 report, ``Iran's Islamic Revolutionary \n     Guard Corps and Ministry of Intelligence and Security \n     continued to be involved in the planning and support of \n     terrorist acts and supported a variety of groups that use \n     terrorism to pursue their goals,'' and ``Iran continued to \n     provide Lebanese Hizballah and the Palestinian rejectionist \n     groups--notably HAMAS, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the \n     [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General \n     Command]--with varying amounts of funding, safehaven, \n     training and weapons.''\n       (14) Iran currently operates more than 10 radio and \n     television stations broadcasting in Iraq that incite violent \n     actions against United States and coalition personnel in \n     Iraq.\n       (15) The current leaders of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \n     and Hashemi Rafsanjani, have repeatedly called upon Muslims \n     to kill Americans in Iraq and install a theocratic regime in \n     Iraq.\n       (16) The Government of Iran has admitted pursuing a \n     clandestine nuclear program, which the United States \n     intelligence community believes may include a nuclear weapons \n     program.\n       (17) The Government of Iran has failed to meet repeated \n     pledges to arrest and extradite foreign terrorists in Iran.\n       (18) The United States Government believes that the \n     Government of Iran supports terrorists and extremist \n     religious leaders in Iraq with the clear intention of \n     subverting\n\n[[Page S3326]]\n\n     coalition efforts to bring peace and democracy to Iraq.\n       (19) The Ministry of Defense of Iran confirmed in July 2003 \n     that it had successfully conducted the final test of the \n     Shahab-3 missile, giving Iran an operational intermediate-\n     range ballistic missile capable of striking both Israel and \n     United States troops throughout the Middle East and \n     Afghanistan.\n\n     SEC. 2932. DECLARATION OF CONGRESS REGARDING UNITED STATES \n                   POLICY TOWARD IRAN.\n\n       Congress declares that it should be the policy of the \n     United States--\n       (1) to support efforts by the people of Iran to exercise \n     self-determination over the form of government of their \n     country; and\n       (2) to actively support a national referendum in Iran with \n     oversight by international observers and monitors to certify \n     the integrity and fairness of the referendum.\n\n     SEC. 2933.

Now, he's no longer giving the guidance he \n     did by telephone, for obvious reasons, but the messengers \n     still go back and forth. And so he still is a cloud that \n     hangs over much of what we do.''\n       Whereas the job of promoting regional peace and security \n     cannot be completed until Mr. Taylor appears before the \n     Special Court for Sierra Leone to answer to the charges \n     against him.\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) the United States shall use its voice and vote at the \n     United Nations Security Council to bring about the transfer \n     of Charles Taylor to the Special Court for Sierra Leone.\n       (B) The actions called for in subsection (A) include \n     supporting a Chapter VII Security Council resolution that \n     would provide for the immediate transfer of Charles Taylor.\n       (2) the Senate urges the United States government to \n     formulate a comprehensive, inter-agency strategy, consistent \n     with section 585 of Public Law 108-447, aimed at bringing \n     about the transfer of Charles Taylor well before the Liberian \n     elections scheduled to occur in fall, 2005.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 324.

FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) That a child, for the full and harmonious development \n     of his or her personality, should grow up in a family \n     environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love, and \n     understanding.\n       (2) That intercountry adoption may offer the advantage of a \n     permanent family to a child for whom a suitable family cannot \n     be found in his or her country of origin.\n       (3) There has been a significant growth in intercountry \n     adoptions. In 1990, Americans adopted 7,093 children from \n     abroad. In 2001, they adopted 19,237 children from abroad.\n       (4) Americans increasingly seek to create or enlarge their \n     families through intercountry adoptions.\n       (5) There are many children worldwide that are without \n     permanent homes.\n       (6) In the interest of children without a permanent family \n     and the United States citizens who are waiting to bring them \n     into their families, reforms are needed in the intercountry \n     adoption process used by United States citizens.\n       (7) Before adoption, each child should have the benefit of \n     measures taken to ensure that intercountry adoption is in his \n     or her best interests and prevents the abduction, selling, or \n     trafficking of children.\n       (8) In addition, Congress recognizes that foreign born \n     adopted children do not make the decision whether to \n     immigrate to the United States. They are being chosen by \n     Americans to become part of their immediate families.\n       (9) As such these children should not be classified as \n     immigrants in the traditional sense. Once fully and finally \n     adopted, they should be treated as children of United States \n     citizens.\n       (10) Since a child who is fully and finally adopted is \n     entitled to the same rights, duties, and responsibilities as \n     a biological child, the law should reflect such equality.\n       (11) Therefore, foreign born adopted children of United \n     States citizens should be accorded the same procedural \n     treatment as biological children born abroad to a United \n     States citizen.\n       (12) If a United States citizen can confer citizenship to a \n     biological child born abroad, then the same citizen is \n     entitled to confer such citizenship to their legally and \n     fully adopted foreign born child immediately upon final \n     adoption.\n       (13) If a United States citizen cannot confer citizenship \n     to a biological child born abroad, then such citizen cannot \n     confer citizenship to their legally and fully adopted foreign \n     born child, except through the naturalization process.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to ensure that intercountry adoptions take place in the \n     best interests of the child;\n       (2) to ensure that foreign born children adopted by United \n     States citizens will be treated identically to a biological \n     child born abroad to the same citizen parent; and\n       (3) to improve the intercountry adoption process by making \n     it more citizen friendly and focused on the protection of the \n     child.\n\n     SEC. 903.
