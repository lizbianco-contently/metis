Mr. President, I do want to briefly comment on a very \nshort trip I took on Sunday, when I visited Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, along \nwith Senator McConnell and Senator Specter.\n  It was my first visit to the detainee facility there. We received \nextensive briefings over the course of the day from Admiral Harris and \nother base administrators. We took that opportunity to tour five of the \ndetainee camps, as well as visit the medical facilities and visit with \nthe health personnel there.\n  Bottom line, I left there very impressed with the care and the \nrespect our military affords the detainees kept at Guantanamo. As most \nof my colleagues know who have visited there--and I am glad to report \nthat many have visited there over the last several years--each detainee \nreceives a copy of the Koran. Arrows in each of the detainees' cells \npoint to Mecca. You see arrows throughout the prison grounds. That \nmakes it easier, and it is a reminder that these individuals have that \nopportunity to practice their faith, with prayer time occurring five \ntimes every day, where everything stops, and that time is set aside so \nthat prayer can be offered.\n  It was interesting from a health standpoint. The meals themselves are \nnutritious meals. And I looked at a lot of the charts, aggregate \ncharts, and, indeed, detainees gain weight from these meals. They get \nregular exercise. It might be as much as 2 hours a day--but 1 to 2 \nhours a day. They receive mail from their families. They visit \nprivately with their lawyers. They have medical care, which again was \namazing to me, which is 24/7, acute care as well as preventive care \nliterally 24 hours a day.\n  When the camp first opened, much of the medical care was centered \naround\n\n[[Page S9322]]\n\nthe treatment of acute care or injuries that may have occurred in the \nbattlefield or the like. Prosthetics were made. I think they said 22 \nprosthetics had been made for the detainees who have been at the \nfacility.\n  The nature of health care has shifted a bit. There is still acute \ncare 24 hours a day, in which surgical procedures, everything, can be \nperformed right there in the detainee camps, but as those wounds healed \nand as the detainees got further and further away from acute injuries, \nthere has been increasing emphasis on preventative care. Indeed, the \nimmunization rate there is higher than in the United States of America.\n\n  I think the report is they have had fewer than 500 detainees, but all \nhave been immunized appropriately. Things such as screening for cancer \nhave taken place there. Colonoscopies--a procedure which, as we all \nknow, is used commonly in this country to screen for colon cancer--are \nperformed there on a routine basis.\n  The health personnel-to-detainee ratio is 1 to 4--remarkably high. \nThat is all health personnel who are there. And I guess, as I left this \nbriefing and the opportunity to talk to the doctors and the nurses and \nthe psychologists and the psychiatrists, I left with an impression that \nhealth care there is clearly better than they received at home and as \ngood as many people receive in the United States of America.\n  Also, I have to comment on the courageous men and women who are our \nmilitary personnel there, working every day, 24 hours a day. They are \ndoing a tremendous job. I commend them for it. As you walk through the \ncells, it is clear they are at least verbally abused in just walking \nthrough those cells. I know they are under a great deal of stress in \ncarrying out their activities every day.\n  Our men and women, in spite of that sort of verbal abuse--and clearly \nat risk of physical assault--remain focused on their mission to provide \nthe detainees there safe and humane treatment but, at the same time, \nsimultaneously protecting Americans from the deadly plots that have \nbeen hatched by many of those detainees who are there.\n  As we all know from the President's comments and speeches over the \nlast week or so, on that island today are some of the world's most \nhardened enemy combatants, terrorists. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is there, \nthe man the 9/11 Commission described as the ``principal architect of \nthe 9/11 attacks.'' The fact that we have the presence of them--we did \nnot see them, we did not even ask to go to their facility--but the fact \nthat they are there is a vivid reminder that the detainees at \nGuantanamo do remain locked up for a critical purpose: to protect \nAmericans. We were reminded of that again and again as we listened to \nthe stories about the backgrounds of the types of people who are there. \nI left there with no question in my mind that many would return to what \nthey were doing before they were captured; that is, plotting new ways \nto attack us. We know some who have been released have, indeed, \nreturned to the battlefield. And that has been well documented.\n  There has been a lot of debate recently on how we should prosecute \nthese terrorists, these enemy combatants. Soon we will be addressing \nthat issue once again on the floor of the Senate, as we should. But I \nthink we should all be very clear in our own thinking that these men \nare dangerous terrorists who remain a threat to the safety and well-\nbeing of every American. They are militant extremists whose goal in \nlife is to kill Americans, is to destroy our freedom and security.\n  Mr. President, as we were reminded through remembrances and through \nthe ceremonies of yesterday and through the discussions yesterday, 9/11 \nshattered our longstanding illusions of safety and security in this \ncountry. As we learned then and have since learned--on no less than 11 \noccasions--safety and security are not static states, but they are \ndynamic, they are constantly changing, in constant flux. That means we \ncannot just enact a bill and then move on and say that is sufficient. \nWe have to continuously, in this body, take stock of where we are, \nassess and reassess and implement changes when necessary.\n  We have done just that over the last 5 years. As of August, we passed \n71 laws and other bills related to the war on terror. The next step is \nthe bill we are debating today; that is, the Port Security Improvement \nAct. It provides additional authorities and tools critical to improving \nour port security and our maritime security--and to foil plots to \ninjure us or to destroy our ports, to the detriment of hard-working \nAmericans and to the detriment of our economy.\n  Very soon we will take up legislation that strengthens and modernizes \nour foreign intelligence surveillance laws, as well as legislation that \nauthorizes military commissions to prosecute terrorists for war crimes, \nsuch as those who are currently detained at Guantanamo Bay.\n  Without these tools, we simply cannot guarantee the safety and \nsecurity of the American people. That is why they are being addressed \non the floor right now. That is what hangs in the balance: the safety \nand security of the American people. On this floor, we are not going to \nalways agree on the approach, but it is a goal I believe every one of \nmy colleagues shares.\n  As we move forward in this body over the next couple weeks, I hope we \ndo remain focused on that goal, ensuring the safety and security of the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/12/senate-section/article/S9322-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S9322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr12se06-157]                         \n\n\n\n \n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I was honored to join with President Bush \nand others at the Pentagon yesterday to commemorate the fifth \nanniversary of 9/11. I was pleased, also to join my colleagues on the \neast steps of the Capitol last evening in an emotional tribute to those \nwho died on that fateful day 5 years ago.\n  Mr. President, 9/11 was one of the darkest days of this Nation's \nhistory. It brought America together. We were inspired by the bravery \nof our fellow Americans. We stood shoulder to shoulder with the \nPresident. And when he stood upon the mound of rubble at Ground Zero, \nwith a bullhorn in hand, he spoke for all of us.\n  Last night, however, the President, in his address to the Nation, \nspoke for himself, for his administration, and not for the Nation. No \nbullhorn, only the bully pulpit of his office, which he used to defend \nan unpopular war in Iraq and to launch clumsily disguised barbs at \nthose who disagree with his policies.\n  By focusing on Iraq in the manner he did, the President engaged in an \nall-too-familiar Bush administration tactic: conflate and blur the war \nin Iraq with the response to 9/11.\n  Despite definitive and repeated findings that there were no ties \nbetween Iraq and al-Qaida--a finding most recently echoed by the \nRepublican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee--the President \ncontinued to deliberately lump and blur al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, \nIraq, and 9/11 together.\n  This is a political move designed to tap the overwhelming public \nsentiment to destroy al-Qaida as a way to bolster sagging public \nsupport for the war in Iraq.\n  Despite the President's best efforts, the American people can see \nthrough this ploy--as we have seen with the pundits' comments following \nhis speech and editorials all across the country today. The American \npeople understand that Iraq is largely a sectarian struggle and that \nthe longer we are bogged down in the streets of Baghdad, the easier it \nis for al-Qaida and its affiliates to reconstitute in places such as \nAfghanistan and Somalia.\n  Americans understand that this administration's ``stay the course'' \nstrategy is hurting our security and moving Iraq in the wrong \ndirection. Unemployment in Iraq is high. It is 40 to 50 percent \nunemployment, at least. Some places, it is 70 and 80 percent.\n  News accounts today say that inflation is now 75 percent in Iraq. An \naverage of a thousand Iraqis are dying each month in Iraq. Is that a \ncivil war? I think so. News accounts, the last couple of days--one, in \nfact, today said: ``Iraq conflict worsens.'' The General Accounting \nOffice, the watchdog of Congress, a nonpartisan organization, said that \nthe Iraq conflict worsens.\n  We heard two days ago an Army general saying that the Anbar province \nis lost. We have a general, even before he\n\n[[Page S9323]]\n\nis retired, saying that Secretary Rumsfeld said he would fire anyone \nwho tried to develop a plan after the soldiers went into Iraq. He would \nfire them. There was no planning as to how the peace would take place.\n  The American people deserved better last night. They deserved a break \nfrom the politics that honored the spirit of 9/11, a chance to reclaim \nthat sense of unity, purpose, and patriotism which swept through our \ncountry 5 years ago--feelings only the Commander in Chief could have \ninspired, that he should have tried to inspire. He didn't. Last night \nwas not the time for a political partisan speech. Sadly, it was a \nmissed opportunity for President Bush, who obviously was more consumed \nby staying the course in Iraq and playing election year partisan \npolitics than changing the direction for this wonderful country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/12/senate-section/article/S9323-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S9323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr12se06-159]                         \n\n\n\n \n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor in sadness. \nThe President of the United States gives an address about the condition \nof our country 5 years after the events of 9/11. He gives an address \nand lays out the scope of the problem we are confronting. There are \npeople all across this world who subscribe to a radical, perverted form \nof Islam and want to destroy everything we believe in. That is the \nenemy we are confronting. We are in an active war with our military \nagainst them in Afghanistan and Iraq. That is the reality.\n  The minority leader just referred to it as sectarian violence. What \nis that word? Religious? Religious violence. Radical Islam violence--\nsome Sunni, some Shia, but both are radical in their nature, and they \nare fighting us. That is the reality of the enemy today. The very \npeople who planned the attacks are the people who are in Iraq. Al-Qaida \nis in Iraq causing that sectarian violence. Should we ignore that? I \nask the Senator from Nevada, should we just ignore that, pretend they \nare not there, not talk about that last night, pretend al-Qaida is not \nin Iraq? Is this not part of the mission we are trying to accomplish?\n  It is sad. We are at war against an enemy that I happen to believe is \nthe most dangerous enemy ever to confront this country, and we play \npetty politics constantly here on the floor of the Senate--even after a \nsolemn day of remembrance for the valued people who died on September \n11. It is chilling. We just cannot get past the politics around here, \njust cannot get past the partisan advantage around here. We cannot face \nthe reality that we have a dangerous enemy out there who wants to \ndestroy everything we hold dear, an enemy who is very clear about what \nthey want to accomplish. How clear? They say it--not to Mike Wallace on \n``60 Minutes,'' I might add. No, when you are spinning in English in \nAmerica, you put on the nice face, you put on the happy face that we \nwant peace and want to live together in brotherhood and all this \nwonderful stuff.\n  But that is a lie. When they go back and speak in Arabic and Farsi, \nthey give a very different story. It is a consistent story, I might \nadd. It is the destruction of the State of Israel, and it is the \nsubmission of the infidels to what they believe in. That is the enemy \nwe confront. It is real. We can play politics about it and say it is \nnot real. We can say it is a trumped-up war. They are at war with us. \nWe may not want to be at war with them, but they are at war with us--\nnot just in Afghanistan and Iraq, not just in southern Lebanon, not \njust in Great Britain, but here. They want to defeat us. Their intent \nis to defeat us. They are motivating people in the Middle East and \naround the world to join their ranks and attack us.\n  One of the things I learned from my days in Little League, and in \neverything else I have ever engaged in, is that one of the ways to lose \nanything you are engaged in with an opponent is not to take your \nopponent seriously, not to look at what they are really about, and not \nlook at their capability. I remember early that in this war many were \ncalling the terrorists cowards, as if these people were weak and they \nhad no real resolve. These people are not weak. They are misguided--\nhorribly misguided--but they are not weak. They are a dangerous enemy. \nThey are a dangerous enemy that has an ideology that is motivating \npeople, and they have a tactic that is uniquely effective against us.\n  As Osama bin Laden says, ``We will defeat you because you love life; \nwe love death.'' And we do love life in this country because we have a \nlot to live for. We have great freedom, great material wealth. We have \na wonderful culture. They, on the other hand, for the most part have \nnone of those. They love death because they see death as better than \nlife. They are willing to die. In fact, they want to die. We have never \nfought an enemy like this. We have never fought an enemy who wanted to \ndie as part of the victory for them. We always fought enemies who saw \ndeath as a tragic consequence of war, and their objective was an \nearthly kingdom. Not this enemy. This enemy says death is part of the \nwar--a desire for those entering into this battle--and their kingdom is \nnot one they want to build here but one they want to achieve after \ndeath. This is an enemy who wants a nuclear weapon in Iran, not because \nthey want to stave off attacks, no, but because they want to use it to \npursue their messianic vision of the return of the 12th Imam, or Hidden \nImam.\n  I give speeches all across Pennsylvania and lay out for the people of \nmy State this vision of President Mahmud Ahmadi-Nejad and the rulers of \nIran, the vision of the 12th, or Hidden, Imam, who is to return at the \nend of time. That is what the Shias believe. But President Ahmadi-Nejad \nand the rulers of Iran believe different than most Shias, thank God. \nThey believe it is their obligation to bring about the end of time by \nthe destruction of the State of Israel and by world chaos in which \nIslam is suppressing the infidels, and only at that time will this \nHidden Imam return and the actualization of their religion come to \npass.\n  This is a serious enemy, an enemy with resources. This is an enemy \nwith growing technology, and this is an enemy with fervent disciples \nwho are willing to go around and kill themselves in pursuit of this \nobjective. This is not something to be played politics with. This is \nnot something to ignore and pass off as sectarian violence that we \nbrought about because we happen to be there. These people have been at \nwar with us for 20 years, and we have chosen to ignore them. We paid a \nvery high price.\n\n  So what is our lesson? If you listen to the Democratic leader, it is: \nLet's continue to ignore them. Let's continue to play politics. Let's \nput domestic politics ahead of the security of this country.\n  That is his message--that this is not real, this is trumped up, and \nif we leave them alone, they will leave us alone. Oh, really? Do you \nreally believe that? If we leave these people alone, do you believe \nthat somehow we would be safe here? We can just garrison America, make \nall public buildings like we have here at the Capitol--put Jersey \nbarriers around everything and have police on every corner. We can \nprotect ourselves from these people. Is that the America in which we \nwant to live? Not me.\n  We are at war--the most serious war this country has ever faced \nagainst an opponent like none we have ever faced. Yet we play politics. \nWe ignore the reality. We can pretend they are just not there--at least \nuntil November, at least until we can get control. Then maybe we will \ncome to our senses and recognize the grave threat that confronts our \ncountry.\n  No, the President did not give a political speech last night. He \nspoke of\n\n[[Page S9324]]\n\nthe reality of the conflict that is before us. It is not popular to do \nso, I know. It is not popular to stand up and support a conflict that \nis difficult to deal with every day. But understand that is exactly \nwhat they have in mind.\n  Did you ever wonder why they don't kill 3,000 people in 1 day? They \nhave the capability of doing so. You just send out, instead of 1 every \nday or 2 every day, you send out 200 in 1 day. Why not? Why don't they \njust have one mass, huge offensive? It is because that is not what they \nare all about. That is not a terrorist tactic.\n  The terrorist tactic is to cause death every single day. It doesn't \nmatter who but just cause death. So why? To defeat the military? No, \ntheir objective isn't to defeat the military or drive back the lines of \nour troops or to control more area. No, those deaths are not aimed at \nour military, they are aimed at us. Every day they want to make it \nharder for you and you and you and you to open the paper, to turn on \nthe television, to see more death.\n  This is the steady drumbeat of the psychological war of terror being \ninflicted on the American public. They will keep up the drumbeat every \nsingle day--not in big conflagrations but every day--to make it \npainful, to make it hard.\n  They want one thing out of us. They know our military, and I am going \nto submit for the Record an assessment from a serviceman who wrote me \nwho provided his experience in Iraq of success, I might add.\n  Our military knows they must win this war, and they are succeeding at \nsome level. They are not attacking our military. They are attacking us \npsychologically every single day until finally they get us to say one \nword--enough. Enough. We have had enough. We can't take this anymore. \nIt is just too hard.\n  They believe we will say ``enough'' because they believe we are weak. \nThey believe we and the modern world just don't have the stomach to \nfight and die for what we believe in anymore. We like our ``things'' \ntoo much, and so we will just leave them alone until they get stronger \nand stronger and in a position to do more and more damage to our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  The President is right. This is our hour. We can play politics with \nthe hour, we can seek political advantage to win the next election with \nthis hour, or we can confront the reality of this hour and do something \nabout it.\n  On my watch, even though I am facing what many consider to be a \ndifficult time back in Pennsylvania, I am going to confront the reality \nof the threat to me, to this country, and to our children and \ngrandchildren. It is too important to walk away and play politics to \nget reelected. It is too important to the future of this country to \nminimize the threat that we are engaged in and play politics with it.\n  It may win or lose elections. Matters not to me. It matters not to \nme. What matters is defending our country when it needs to be defended, \nnot putting personal politics above what is in the best interest of the \nnational security of this country.\n  I believe the President, given all the mistakes that this \nadministration has made in the conduct of this war--and they certainly \nare numerous--the President has it right. This is the greatest threat \nfor our generation, and I pray we have the courage to confront it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the assessment from \n1LT Jeremy Burke in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                               My Mission\n\n       Foreign Military Advising by Military Transition Teams, \n     MiTTs, is currently the Main Effort for the U.S. Military in \n     Iraq. The current objective of CENTCOM is to build and train \n     the Iraqi Security Forces in order that they can take over \n     control of the security in their battlespace. MiTT teams \n     advise on everything from logistical planning, operational \n     management and command & control (C2) of their units. I was \n     an advisor for the 3rd Brigade of the 3rd Division, Iraqi \n     Army.\n       Overall assessment: I believe we have been extremely \n     successful in our efforts to secure peace and freedom in \n     Iraq. Many people in Iraq are now enjoying freedoms that they \n     never could before. For those born during Saddam's reign of \n     terror, they are tasting freedom for the first time. All over \n     Iraq we are turning over control of security to Iraqi \n     Security Forces like the Army, Border Police and the regular \n     Police. Our presence there as American military is to backup \n     the Iraqis when they need help. They are finally standing on \n     their own two feet. Now we're just letting them get balanced.\n\n\n                    Areas of Success with Iraqi Army\n\n       (1) Control of Security: We started out August 2005 and our \n     Iraqi counterparts were assessed at being able to take over \n     control of their battles pace no earlier than 18 months. 10 \n     months later, in June 2006, they completed their validation \n     exercise and we transitioned battle space authority over to \n     Iraqi Army control.\n       (2) Communications: At onset of our mission our Iraqi \n     counterparts were severely limited in communications and they \n     could not talk between 2 of their 3 battalions nor their \n     Brigade rear location. We needed to locate the appropriate \n     equipment for them and get it issued out. Then we had the \n     task of training them how to utilize all their commo gear and \n     put it into use.\n       Now they have a Codan radio base station set up at their \n     Brigade (BDE) Headquarters, BDE rear and at each Battalion \n     location. Each location is now capable of communicating \n     across their entire battle space, 16,000 sq KM.\n       Their vehicles now have mobile Codan radios to communicate \n     between their maneuver elements and their headquarters.\n       They now have Internet access to send status reports to \n     Division headquarters and to receive and send information \n     from their battalions.\n       Command & Control: When we arrived in August of 2005 they \n     had no functioning Tactical Operations Center (TOC) in which \n     to manage subordinate units, track convoys, manage \n     information flow and oversee operations.\n       After months of training and preparation, we helped them \n     open the first Iraqi Army Brigade TOC on January 15, 2006.\n       All IA BDE communications are handled out of their TOC.\n       A representative from the S2 (Intelligence) and S3 \n     (Operations) is working in this TOC all day and in the \n     evening. At night there are two enlisted soldiers manning the \n     radios and acting as a runner.\n       The S3 is tracking units on the ground with large wall \n     sized maps that we provided for them. The S2 tracks enemy \n     activity or a long period of time on an exact replica of the \n     operations map.\n       As the Coalition Forces Liaison Officer (LNO), I worked 7 \n     days a week in their TOC providing classes on: map reading, \n     Intelligence Analysis, and reporting.\n       Now that our IA counterparts have taken over control of \n     their battle space a U.S. LNO will work in their TOC as a \n     means of bridging communications between the IA units on the \n     ground and U.S. units providing support. Examples of this \n     function are when an Iraqi convoy is hit with an IED attack \n     they call back to their TOC, then the Iraqi officer in charge \n     would request assistance and I would call in a MEDEVAC \n     request to the U.S. Headquarters in the area.\n       Pay & Promotions: At the beginning of our mission, \n     approximately 75 percent of the IA Brigade we advised had \n     some sort of pay or promotion issue. The most common example \n     of this was a soldier was promoted but the Ministry of \n     Defense, MOD, had yet to recognize the promotion so they were \n     still being paid at their old pay grade.\n       When I left Iraq, the Brigade's pay issues were down to 4 \n     percent.\n       The Brigade S1 and the Division G1, Personnel, now work \n     closely together and get actively involved in resolving pay \n     issues to include traveling to Baghdad to meet directly with \n     the Personnel Department at MOD.\n       MOD still has problems recognizing promotions when they \n     come but at least now the soldier might only have 1-2 months \n     to wait for it to be resolved as opposed to years as it was \n     before.\n       (3) Vehicle Maintenance: This is still a difficult problem \n     for the Iraqis but they are slowing making headway. They are \n     facing a difficult task with maintenance because their \n     culture has not adopted the idea of operator maintenance as a \n     personal responsibility. The wealthy would just abandon a \n     vehicle if it died on the road. The lower classes simply use \n     a Duct Tape resolution to solve maintenance issues. One of \n     their problems now is that since they didn't conduct \n     periodic maintenance on their vehicles they have a lot of \n     work to catch up on as they get more involved. Upon our \n     arrival in August 2005, they had dozens of deadlined, \n     inoperable, vehicles just strewn about their bases, which \n     made their motor pools look more like junkyards.\n       U.S. advisors in Baghdad worked with MOD to set up a \n     National Maintenance Contract for the Army's vehicles. For \n     our unit they bring all their vehicles back to the Division \n     base where the maintenance facilities are and can get any \n     kind of repair done they need--to include newly issued \n     HUMMWVs.\n       In December of 2005 we started sending soldiers from our \n     Brigade to the maintenance course also run by the NMC group. \n     Soldiers become qualified to perform various levels of \n     maintenance on their vehicles. After the course they spend \n     time at the maintenance facility to get ``on the job'' \n     training before returning to their units.\n       (4) Logistics: Logistical support, in my mind, is now their \n     biggest obstacle to being a successful, self-sustaining \n     military.\n       MOD has not come up with appropriate plan to provide fuel \n     for the Iraqi Security Forces, ISF. Currently the U.S. \n     supplies some fuel to the ISF but that is being cut off--\n     probably by August 2006.\n\n[[Page S9325]]\n\n       Life Support Contracts are set up and managed by MOD but \n     there is no MOD rep to monitor them locally except for an \n     army officer. In some cases this has led to corruption, in \n     other cases it has allowed local vendors to operate with no \n     quality control.\n\n\n                 overall sentiment of the iraqi people\n\n       Generally the people of Iraq are appreciative of the United \n     States, want our Military to stay as long as possible to \n     ensure their safety and security.\n       Some portions of the population are happy that we can \n     provide for their safety and are grateful that we ousted \n     Saddam. But they will be equally as happy when we leave. This \n     is more of an Arab cultural thing. Arab culture is driven by \n     pride and shame. These people might be embarrassed that they \n     could not secure their freedoms themselves and now would like \n     us to leave so they can take over from here. And some simply \n     don't want Westerners controlling their future.\n       When we traveled to various villages we were typically well \n     received. Kids run out to the convoy in hopes that they'll \n     get candy or water. Village leaders come out to greet us and \n     invite us in to sit and talk while we drink Chai. When we \n     entered a village and people looked away or closed their \n     doors to us, it almost always meant that they were being \n     intimidated by the terrorists. It was these villages that we \n     spent more time. We'd come back as often as possible, \n     bringing clothes, food, and commanders of all levels from the \n     Iraqi Army and the Coalition to meet with tribal \n     leadership. When we caught Saddam Hussein, there were \n     celebrations at every village we went to. People were both \n     relieved and overjoyed. And they thanked us in whatever \n     way they could. When U.S. forces killed Abu Musab Zarqawi, \n     people celebrated in the streets firing their guns in the \n     air, they offered us food and gifts when we visited \n     villages. These were true inspiring patriotic moments for \n     Iraq.\n       When a suicide bomber attacks an Army or Police recruiting \n     station and kills many people, the following day the lines \n     waiting to join up are 3-4 times larger. People are looking \n     for jobs and they see joining the Iraqi Security Forces as a \n     great opportunity to make a living and do their part in \n     getting rid of the terrorism rampant in their region of the \n     world.\n       We are seeing lots of economic expansion everywhere. Strip \n     malls are being constructed, businesses are expanding and \n     franchises are popping up. New homes are being constructed \n     all over the country. And people are spending money, looking \n     for new types of goods to buy and they desire goods and \n     services that are currently available throughout the rest of \n     the world. Satellite TV has been a big help with this.\n\n\n                               obstacles\n\n       Fuel--Currently fuel is a major crisis not only for the \n     Iraqi Security Forces but for the general population as well. \n     The issue is not for a lack of oil, but a lack of functioning \n     refineries--2 shut down in November. It has started to limit \n     the ability of the Iraqi Security Forces to conduct long-\n     range operations.\n       Border Crossings--Foreign Fighters and Terrorist support \n     still continues to flow across the Syrian Border. Smuggling \n     of fuel, cigarettes and other goods is commonplace and put a \n     big strain on the ability of the Border Police to shut down \n     the border. Lack of fuel has reduced the number of border \n     patrols that are conducted. Long lines at the Point of Entry \n     have caused many people to come across illegally. Some \n     smuggling is being conducted as a direct support mechanism \n     for terrorists.\n       Corruption: Very problematic in all areas of the Iraqi \n     Security Forces. But it is also misunderstood. Some levels of \n     corruption are generally accepted in Arab culture. It is the \n     way they have done business and government for so long that \n     they have come to allow it--to an extent. Some of the areas \n     of corruption that we've seen are when soldiers or police at \n     checkpoints or border crossings do not check cars as they \n     come through. They will sometimes take payments in order to \n     speed a vehicle through the checkpoint. We began cracking \n     down on this during Spring of 2006. There are also kickbacks \n     with contractors--this is very typical and also very \n     accepted.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I came to the Capitol yesterday on the \nfifth anniversary of September 11. I looked out the window, down the \nMall on the west side, and I couldn't help but remember what we saw on \n9/11. On that morning as we met in a small room on the west side of the \nCapitol and watched the television broadcast and first heard of a plane \ncrashing into the World Trade Center, I thought: What a freak accident. \nI hope a lot of people won't die.\n  Then as we watched incredulously, a second plane hit the World Trade \nCenter. The scales fell from our eyes and we knew exactly what was \nhappening. This was no accident. This was intentional. America was \nunder attack.\n  We met in this meeting a few minutes longer. Someone walked into the \nroom and said they were evacuating the White House. We looked down the \nMall on 9/11 and saw black, billowing smoke, and then the word came \nacross that there was some explosion at the Pentagon. We weren't sure \nwhat had happened. A bomb? It turned out it was a plane.\n  As that black smoke billowed across the Mall, as we looked on that \nbright sunlit day at this horrible, disgusting display of destruction, \nwe were told to evacuate this building, to leave the U.S. Capitol for \nour lives as quickly as we could.\n  We raced down the steps, all of us, thousands of us, and gathered \noutside. We stood on the grass not sure where to turn or where to go. \nWe heard a loud boom. Many of us thought it was another explosion. It \nturned out it was the scrambling of our fighter planes over the \nNation's Capital to protect us.\n  Finally, after dismissing our staff, telling them to go home and find \na safe place, I walked a few blocks away from the Capitol Building and \nsat, as most Americans did, for the rest of the day hearing the news \nreports, watching the television scenes from New York.\n  Then late that evening, after that wrenching day, Members of Congress \ngathered on the steps outside the Capitol in a rare, heartening display \nof bipartisanship or nonpartisanship, said a prayer, and sang ``God \nBless America.''\n  In the weeks that followed, there was a mood on Capitol Hill unlike \nanything we had seen for a long time. The President came to us within \nhours and said: We are now declaring war on those responsible for 9/11. \nHe proposed that we mobilize the strength of America, all of us, and \nstrike back at those who had killed 3,000 innocent people on that day. \nThe President's plea was answered with unequivocal support on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  I have often said that in the years I have served here, there is no \nmore difficult vote than a vote to go to war. We know that with that \nvote, people will die. The enemy, brave Americans, and innocent people \nwill die, and you must take that seriously. But I didn't hesitate to \nvote for that war against al-Qaida. I didn't hesitate to vote for that \nwar in Afghanistan. America had to stand and defend itself against \nthose who would kill innocent people, as they did on 9/11.\n  Yesterday, on the fifth anniversary of 9/11, there was an effort to \nrekindle that feeling.\n  The President made important visits to New York, to the site of the \nWorld Trade Center, to Pennsylvania where United flight 93 crashed into \nthe ground when the brave passengers took control of the plane away \nfrom the terrorists and, in the process, may have saved my life. Many \nbelieve that plane was destined for Washington, destined for this \nbuilding, this important symbol of America. Those brave passengers took \ncontrol of that plane and gave their lives in the process. The \nPresident visited that rural setting to remember their heroism.\n  Then he came to the Pentagon, and I was honored to join him as he \nlaid a wreath at the corner of the new section of the Pentagon that was \nrebuilt after 184 people in that building died on 9/11.\n  We gathered again on the steps yesterday, a bipartisan gathering of \nthe House and Senate, for a moment of prayer, a moment of reflection, \nand to sing ``God Bless America.'' It was a time when we tried to \nrecapture that spirit of unity, that spirit of determination, and many \nof us felt we were moving our Nation again in the right direction.\n  But what is it that divides us? We heard the speech of my leader and \nfriend, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, and the speech of the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, again at odds in debating about our policy. What \ndivides us is clearly another war--not the war in Afghanistan but the \nwar in Iraq. Twenty-three of us on the floor of this Senate, when given \na chance, voted against the authorization of force to go to war in \nIraq.\n  As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I knew from closed \ndoor sessions, which I was sworn not to disclose, I knew from those \nsessions that many of the things that were being told to the American \npeople as reasons to go to war against Saddam Hussein and Iraq were \njust plain wrong.\n\n  This last week, the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a bipartisan \nreport, made it public for the record, for\n\n[[Page S9326]]\n\nhistory, for all to see, that the American people were misled into this \nwar in Iraq--statements about weapons of mass destruction that didn't \nexist, statements about nuclear weapons that didn't exist, statements \nabout connections between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida which were \nfabricated. Those reasons were told to the American people to justify a \nwar which is now in its fourth year.\n  Unlike the war in Afghanistan where our mission was clear to go after \nthose who were responsible for 9/11, to go after al-Qaida, in Iraq we \nare in our fourth year. The official report from the Pentagon this \nmorning is 2,671 of our best and bravest soldiers have died in that \nwar; more than 19,000 have returned wounded, serious wounds--\namputations, blindness, burns, traumatic brain injury. We have spent \nmore than $320 billion on that war. And last night, as the President \nspoke to America, he went beyond that spirit of unity that brought us \ntogether for the war in Afghanistan and against al-Qaida to discuss \nthis war in Iraq.\n  It is part of an offensive by this administration. We saw it on \nSunday with Condoleezza Rice, our Secretary of State, and with Vice \nPresident Cheney's appearance on television. We saw and heard the \nstatements they made to justify a war in Iraq, a war which, \nunfortunately, is not going well.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania objected to Senator Reid saying that we \nwere involved in some sort of sectarian violence in Iraq. Those are not \noriginal words of the Senator from Nevada. He made reference to the \nGeneral Accountability Office which released its report yesterday in \nwhich it said:\n\n       Iraq's political process has sharpened the country's \n     sectarian divisions, polarized relations between its ethnic \n     and religious groups, and weakened its sense of national \n     identity.\n\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania criticized the Democratic leader for \nbeing political and partisan in saying these words. But the same words \nwere used by the General Accountability Office. It is a fact. We can't \nignore it. The situation in Iraq has worsened.\n  Mr. President, do you know what the GAO reported in terms of violence \nin Iraq? The figures are startling. I read the report:\n\n       The Pentagon said enemy attacks against coalition and Iraqi \n     forces increased by 23 percent from 2004 to 2005. The number \n     of attacks from January to July 2006 were 57 percent higher \n     than during the same period in 2005.\n\n  The GAO published a graph yesterday. The number of attacks rose from \naround 100 in May of 2003 to roughly 4,500 in July of 2006. Is it \npolitical or partisan to note the obvious, the GAO report to which \nSenator Reid made reference? That is not political partisanship; that \nis a reality, and we should face that reality because Iraq does \ncontinue to slip into civil war despite the billions that we have spent \nand the thousands of American lives which have been lost in that \nbattle.\n  There is another political reality. Osama bin Laden is still on the \nloose. Al-Qaida's membership, estimated at 20,000 on 9/11, is now \nestimated by our intelligence agencies at 50,000. Instead of shrinking \nand disappearing, they are growing geometrically.\n  And there is another reality. The Taliban is gaining ground again in \nAfghanistan. They have set up shop in Pakistan where that Government \nhas agreed to have a safe haven for some of these terrorist forces. \nThat is unfortunate, and it is disastrous when you think of our long-\nterm war on terrorism.\n  Sitting at home in Springfield, IL, over the weekend, I listened to \nVice President Cheney when he appeared on ``Meet the Press.'' He said \nthat those of us who make these speeches about the reality of the war \nin Iraq are not showing the kind of resolve that we should. We are \nsomehow validating terrorism. We are weakening America's efforts to \nfight terrorism.\n  I couldn't disagree more. If Members of Congress--if the American \npublic cannot stand up and speak when they disagree with the policies \nof this administration, we have lost sight of the values of this \ndemocracy and how important they are. Despite the Intelligence \nCommittee's disclosure of how we were misled into the war in Iraq, and \ndespite the situation on the ground today, when Vice President Cheney \nsays he would do it all again, it is a reminder that this \nadministration is resolute in continuing on a path that does not make \nus safer and, in fact, endangers our troops even as we stand and speak \ntoday. It strikes me as odd that this Vice President, after the \nIntelligence Committee report, did not show even a hint of \nembarrassment for some of the things he said before the invasion of \nIraq and not even a word of regret for misleading the American people.\n  Well, we have a different vision. We believe there are things we can \ndo to make America safe and strong. Let's take the 9/11 Commission \nreport. Let's take their recommendations and make them reality--100 \npercent of them. Instead of a failing grade, let's have an A+ so that \nAmerica can take these recommendations and move forward.\n  The budget of the Bush administration has continued to cut these \nrecommendations, has refused to fund the things that will make us \nsafer, whether it is a stronger National Guard, a better communications \nsystem, stronger port facilities, more surveillance and security of \nchemical plants and nuclear powerplants, better security on Amtrak, on \nmass transit--these are things the Democrats on this side of the aisle \nbelieve should be our highest priority in making America safe.\n  We need to strengthen our ports and our nuclear powerplants in my \nState and across the Nation. We need to cut our dependence on foreign \noil so that we aren't indirectly subsidizing terrorism and indirectly \nsubsidizing those who are killing our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nAnd we need to push to change course in Iraq. We need a responsible \nredeployment of troops so that the Iraqis understand this is their \nbattle, this is their war, this is their country. There has to come a \ntime, in this fourth year of a war that has lasted longer than the \nKorean war, when the Iraqis stand and fight for their own country, when \nAmerican troops are replaced and can come home.\n  Last week, the administration sent 5,000 more troops to Iraq. There \nis no end in sight. The President said we must stay the course. I think \nwe need to change the course. We need to start the redeployment of \nAmerican troops--not precipitous, immediate withdrawal; that would be \nwrong, but to start the redeployment of American troops so the Iraqis \nstand and fight for their own nation, so that our troops, having served \nus so well and so honorably, can come home safely.\n  The sad reality in Afghanistan is if we don't put more force in place \nthere, we are not going to see the results for which we fought for so \nlong. Afghanistan is tough territory. Many have learned that. The \nBritish Empire learned it. The Soviet Union learned it as well. If we \nare not going to become victims of the same fate, we need to make \ncertain that our commitment to NATO and Afghanistan is real. That is \npart of the war on terrorism.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania said of Senator Reid that he didn't \ntake our opponents seriously. The Senator from Pennsylvania is wrong. \nSenator Reid understands terrorism, as we all do. He understands that \nwe need to stand together, on a bipartisan basis, to make America safe \nand to fight the right war in the right place, to win a victory that \ncounts. That is why he spoke today. We should never forget, according \nto the Senator from Pennsylvania, that we are fighting an enemy that \nwants to die. He said that has never happened before.\n  I think a brief study of history would tell him it has. The Japanese \nKamikaze fliers had the same death wish as those who are suicide \nbombers today. It has happened before. It doesn't make it any less of a \nthreat, but the fact is, we have faced it before and we have overcome \nit.\n  It is interesting that as we listen to our military experts, they \ntell us we cannot win in Iraq militarily no matter how many troops we \nput in place; we have to win politically. We have to stop and reflect \non the fact that there is a large swath of this world that doesn't \nunderstand who we are and what we stand for. They continually are told \nthe wrong thing about America. They continue to be misled. So as we are \nstrong militarily, as we must be, as we must defend America at home, we \nmust also reach out and spread the word about what America's values \nare, what we are willing to stand for, so that we are better understood \nin this world and so that this new\n\n[[Page S9327]]\n\ngeneration, looking for an impression of the United States, doesn't \ncome up with the wrong impression.\n\n  As we consider what we face today in the closing weeks of this \nsession, let's make sure we do stand together in a bipartisan fashion \nfor defending America as our homeland. Let's put the resources in place \nto make us safer. We continue to stand behind our troops, but let us \nnot be so bull-headed that we won't consider any change in tactic or \nstrategy that might start to bring our troops home safely, with their \nmission truly accomplished this time, and let's not give up on \nAfghanistan. We cannot allow the Taliban to have a resurgence of power \nand give al-Qaida another place to gather forces to launch against the \nworld. That is our mission. That is our responsibility.\n  As we gathered yesterday, it was a reminder that at one time not that \nlong ago we stood together in that effort.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this morning the Senate is considering a \nvery important bill, the port security bill, which many Members have \ncome to the floor to talk about. I am proud to be an original sponsor \nof this bill and have been working on it for a number of years; in \nfact, since five years ago, after September 11, when I was the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee chair. At that time I began \nto bring stakeholders together to talk about how we can make sure the \ncargo containers that are coming into this country are secure. It is a \nvery complex issue. It is very difficult to do. We have a tremendous \nbalancing act of making sure that cargo containers are safe when they \ncome into our ports but also that we don't halt our economy as we move \nforward with this initiative.\n  I have been very proud to work with a number of Senators in getting \nus to this point, and I am hoping this bill will move forward in an \nexpeditious manner. Obviously, there will be a number of amendments \nthat come before us, and I look forward to working with other Senators \non both sides of the aisle to move them forward.\n  The bill that is now before the Senate has one major hole. The \noriginal bill we have been working on with all of the committees \ncontained a funding source for this bill that some Members had some \nconcerns about. The original bill that we offered had tariff fees as \nthe funding source. The Finance Committee has objected to that. They \nwere concerned about that. I understand that concern. Because of that \nobjection, the bill that has come before us is an important bill, but \nit lacks the ability to put in place a secure system. It is essentially \nan empty shell without a funding source.\n  That is why I have sent to the desk right now an amendment we have \nbeen working on together with a number of people to make sure this bill \nis not just about rhetoric but actually has the funding behind it. If \nwe pass this bill without funding it, we will not have done our job. \nThe amendment I sent to the desk extends two existing Customs user fees \nfor 1 year to fund this bill. Those are fees that are collected today \nthat are going to expire, and all we are doing is extending the \ncollection for an additional year.\n  The fees we are extending are the merchandise processing fee and the \npassenger conveyance fee. Extending those for just 1 year will produce \nclose to $2.5 billion in revenue and will importantly provide a \ndedicated funding stream to pay for the new security initiatives \nauthorized in this bill. By voting for this amendment, this Senate will \nput money behind the rhetoric of port security. This Senate will put \nmoney behind the rhetoric. That is absolutely critical in today's \nworld.\n  I sit on the Appropriations Committee. I sit on the Department of \nHomeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee. If we do not put a \ndedicated source of funding behind this bill, we will simply put port \nsecurity in contention with all of the other functions of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. We will be looking at Coast Guard \nmoney, FBI money, all of the important functions that we need to have \nwithin this bill, and port security will be just another issue that \ndoesn't get funded. That is why this funding amendment is so absolutely \ncritical.\n  The funding for this amendment is going to be used to hire new \nCustoms and Border Protection officers. We can't just simply require \nour Customs and border officials to do more. They are important \npositions. Their eyes on the containers and their eyes on the tracking, \ntheir eyes on the containers as they are loaded and secured is \nabsolutely critical. Without putting new Customs and Border Patrol \nagents in place to do the functions we are asking for in this bill, we \nsimply will be sending an empty promise to America.\n  The funding also will improve the tracking and data collection of \nevery container coming into our ports. That is essential funding which \nwill make sure what we put into those containers is sealed, that \nsomeone is watching to make sure they haven't been tampered with, that \nno one has gotten into them, and that those containers have not gone \nsomeplace they are not supposed to. Just putting a tracking seal on it \nisn't going to make sure we know a container has not been tampered \nwith. We need the personnel in place to do\n\n[[Page S9328]]\n\nthe tracking. That is an important item for funding in this bill. The \ncurrent bill doesn't have the funding for it. The amendment I am \noffering will make sure we have eyes on those tracking systems.\n  The funding will also establish incentive programs for shippers who \nvoluntarily agree to these standards. That is the GreenLane section of \nthis bill that is very important to make sure we know we can reduce the \nnumber of cargo containers coming into our ports that could produce a \ndanger for American citizens and for America's economy.\n  The funding will also establish protocols for the resumption of cargo \nshipments after a disruptive incident. We put in place a system which \nassures, should an incident occur on one of our ports, that we have a \nresumption strategy in place so we know which cargo, which containers \ncan begin to move off of our ports in an expeditious manner. The reason \nthis is so important is if we don't have a protocol in place, it will \ntake weeks, if not months, to get that cargo moving again. That will \nhave a tremendous impact on our economy not just in our port cities but \nthroughout the Nation, as stores would not have any retail goods on \ntheir shelves. The economic impact of that has been outlined in this \ndebate, but it would be devastating. We absolutely need to have a \nprotocol in place, and this funding stream will assure it is not just \nempty rhetoric but actually a funding source.\n  Finally, the funding is important for authorizing and appropriating \nmoney for a grant system for our ports, critical funding infrastructure \nfor gates, for fencing, for making sure people are in place to know who \nis coming onto our ports--critical infrastructure that we have known is \nlacking and needs a real funding stream, not just rhetoric saying we \nare requiring it.\n  I am very pleased to bring this amendment to the Senate, and I hope \nit is agreed to overwhelmingly because it is critical that we put in \nplace not just an authorizing bill to tell the American public we are \nputting in place a port security bill but that we actually have the \nfunding so we can accomplish what I think everyone believes is an \nimportant goal.\n  I have presented this amendment and ask for its consideration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Washington I be \nadded as a cosponsor of her amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank Senator Murray for her efforts to reconcile what \nwe believe to be the most glaring vulnerability of this bill--how to \npay for it.\n  As I noted in my opening statement, authorizing security programs for \nour ports and supply chain is the first step. We also must provide the \nactual funding to implement these new initiatives. While we have rushed \nto debate this security bill this week as the country remembers those \nwho lost their lives 5 years ago, the Homeland Security Appropriations \nSubcommittee is in conference struggling to find the necessary funds to \npay for existing programs. The security enhancements we are debating \nthis week provide our constituents no benefit if we do not give the \nagencies we have tasked with these new responsibilities the necessary \nfunds to do their job.\n  Despite a vulnerable maritime system and a very real threat to the \nphysical and economic security of all Americans, the President has \nprovided little support to help secure our Nation's ports from \nterrorist attacks. Even though the Congress has enacted two port \nsecurity laws, the White House has included limited port security \nfunding in their annual budget requests, proving their support for port \nsecurity has been all talk and no action.\n  In 2003, when the President's budget failed to provide a fraction of \nthe funding necessary for port security programs, Democrats offered an \namendment to the Budget Resolution to provide $1 billion per year for 2 \nyears to help ports meet the new security mandates. The amendment \nclosely followed the Coast Guard's estimates on the immediate, first \nyear costs for ports to meet the mandates. The amendment received \nunanimous approval in the Senate. During the conference committee's \nconsideration of the budget resolution, the Republican leadership \neliminated the provision.\n  Recognizing this inadequacy and lost opportunity to deliver funds to \nthe ports quickly, the Democrats offered an amendment to add $1 billion \nto the 2003 supplemental again to help ports meet the new security \nmandates. Despite unanimous approval in the Senate 3 weeks earlier, \nwhen it came time to put the real dollars behind the budget commitment, \nthe amendment was opposed by the administration and defeated on the \nSenate floor on a party-line vote.\n  Unfortunately, this year we saw history repeat itself. A Democratic \namendment offered by Senator Byrd to increase funds for port security \nprograms by $648 million was offered and agreed to by unanimous consent \nduring committee consideration of the fiscal year 2006 supplemental \nappropriations bill. Yet again when it came time to put real dollars \nbehind their commitment to port security programs to make them a \nreality, the additional funds were opposed by the administration and \nwere eliminated in conference.\n  If history is any guide, the additional funding provided by the \nSenate in the fiscal year 2007 Department of Homeland Security \nAppropriations bill is likely to be eliminated again during this \nongoing conference.\n  It has become evident that only by identifying a revenue source other \nthan appropriated funds to pay for the new initiatives authorized in \nthis Port Security Improvement Act can we truly overcome this cycle of \nall talk and no action. And that is exactly what the Murray amendment \ndoes.\n  The Murray amendment raises $2.5 billion by extending customs fees. \nIt goes a long way toward covering the costs for the $3.2 billion \nauthorized in this legislation. This is a tremendous step in the right \ndirection to pay for more than 78 percent of the authorized levels in \nthe underlying bill. I hope my colleagues will join with me in \nsupporting this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the pending \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Murray amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. I understand that other Senators may be coming to speak on \nthe amendment. But I wish to speak in general in support of the bill \nitself.\n  Mr. President, yesterday, Monday, September 11, 2006, marked the \nfifth anniversary of the terrorist attacks of our country, on September \n11, 2001. It was an emotional day for all of us. There were feelings of \nremembering the unity that it brought to all of us even here in this \ninstitution after that dreadful day. It was a day of mourning and \nsadness and a lot of mixed emotions. But I also think it reminded us \nonce again that the terrible threat we saw come to fruition on that \nfateful day is still with us and we have more work to do.\n  I think it is important for those of us in Congress to point out that \nwe have done a lot to address the terrorist threat to try to make our \ncountry safer from a variety of security vulnerabilities since then. I \ndon't think we talk enough about what we do. But I remember very well \nthe months after September 11, 2001, the fall of that year on into the \nnext year, for a period of weeks--yes, even months--when we worked \ntogether. We put aside partisanship, we put aside political interests, \nand we decided we were going to do what was right for our country. It \nwas a great time.\n  I note that the approval rating of the Congress during that period \nwent to the highest level it has ever been before or since. The people \nliked it when they saw us working together and doing the right thing \nfor our country. Of course, I should note that it has probably fallen \nsteadily ever since then. But we have more to do.\n\n[[Page S9329]]\n\n  I took the time last month to go to the west coast and look at ports, \nto look at ships that come in and their cargo, how the targeting works, \nhow the random selection works, how the scanning works, how the \nintermodule systems work. It is an incredible thing to see, all the \ncargo coming into and going out of our west coast port--in fact, all of \nour ports.\n  I represent ports that serve the Gulf of Mexico and, of course, we \nhave our very important east coast ports, too. It is a phenomenal thing \nto see where good progress has been made, but more needs be done.\n  I do not know if it is fiscally possible or physically possible to \nguarantee that our ports are secure. But we have done some, and we need \nto do more.\n  I point out that we passed the Maritime Transportation Security Act \nof 2002. This was major legislation. And I was very pleased we were \nable to get it done. It has made a difference. It has a number of \nprovisions in it that have helped us to move toward more sophisticated \nanalysis of cargo shipment data; cooperative arrangements between \nforeign ports and businesses involved; targeted deployment of \nnonintrusive scanning and radiation detection equipment. Great progress \nis being made in this area.\n  The next generation of these scanners is ready to come onto the \nmarket. I took a look at how one of them works. It scans a container in \n12 seconds. You can pick up something as small as a pistol snuggled \namong the cargo. You can pick it out because I saw it. If I picked it \nout, just about anybody can pick it out.\n  But that was a good piece of legislation. Now we have this next step, \nthe Port Security Act of 2006. I thank the chairman of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Collins of Maine, \nand her ranking member, Senator Lieberman. They deserve great credit \nfor having produced a good bill--and then they took it beyond that. \nThey worked with the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, on \nwhich I serve, to address concerns of that committee and some of their \njurisdictional interests.\n  Then we had to go another step and work with the Finance Committee. \nGood work has been done. It has been done by three different committees \nand in a bipartisan way.\n  Now we have an opportunity to do something good and something that is \nneeded, but more is needed. There is no question about that.\n  This bill will improve security at our seaports by including waterway \nsalvage operations in port security plans. It calls for unannounced \ninspections of port facilities to verify the effectiveness of facility \nsecurity plans.\n  I want to reemphasize I was a little surprised and impressed at what \nI saw at the Ports of Seattle and Tacoma--the security operation, the \nway the port officials work with Government officials and work with our \nsecurity officials, DEA and Customs, and all the rest of them where \nthere is a maze of entities that are involved. It seems to be working \npretty well, I say to the Senator from Washington State. I went out \nthere, frankly, not expecting much, and I was surprised and relatively \npleased.\n  Am I still concerned and nervous? When you look at the Port of \nSeattle, as the Senator said on the floor, you have a city, two \nstadiums right there in a pretty compact area. You have ships coming in \nfrom all over the world at a steady stream. The risk of danger is \nunsettling, to say the least.\n  We need to do more. This legislation provides additional direction on \nthe implementation of the Transportation Worker Identification Card \nProgram. We can do that. In fact, they have already done it in the \nprivate sector. It is just the Government that is lagging behind.\n  It mandates the establishment of interagency operation centers to \ncoordinate the security activities of the many Federal, State and local \nagencies.\n  I get a little nervous because I have dealt with this, too, where you \nhave a major event. I remember one time when we had a drug cargo coming \ninto my hometown. A pretty good fracas broke out about what was going \nto be the lead agency and take the credit. Was it going to be the local \nsheriff, was it going to be port authority, FBI, Customs or DEA?\n  Here is my answer: Who cares? Somebody needs to get the job done. \nQuit squabbling over who is the lead agency or who gets the credit or \nwho gets the blame and make sure it is done seamlessly and effectively. \nI think we do that with this bill.\n  This bill mandates the establishment of interagency operations \ncenters to coordinate the security activities of all these different \nagencies.\n  It mandates the establishment of an exercise program to test \ninteragency cooperation.\n  It establishes a training program for ports and their workers.\n  It improves security in the international supply chain. That is what \na lot of people say: Wait a minute, once it gets to Seattle, it is too \nlate. Right. So what is happening at the port of embarcation? Who is \nlooking at the situation there?\n\n  The bill ensures that following any maritime transportation security \nincident there will be an orderly resumption of cargo movement through \nour ports. It authorizes the Container Security Initiative, which \nexamines containers at foreign ports prior to their shipment to the \nUnited States. It authorizes the Customs-Trade Partnership Against \nTerrorism Program to improve information sharing and cooperation \nbetween the private sector and the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Everything I was concerned about, while I was looking at these ports \nand ports in my hometown and gulf ports and other ports, I think this \nlegislation addresses or moves in the right direction.\n  Now, I admit, some of it will include pilot programs or we are going \nto study this or that, and we waste so much money and so much time with \nthat sort of thing. But when you are talking about very sophisticated, \nintegrated, voluminous programs, like what is going on in our ports, a \nlittle thought might be a good idea.\n  Now, my complaint would be, why did we not do that a year ago, two \nyears ago, three years ago? Well, sometimes the problem is us. We have \nto legislate. We have to do something. It is not enough that we just \nstand around and complain about our concerns, and then, when we have a \nchance to do something, we cannot follow through.\n  So I urge the leaders of these committees to press forward. Do it \nnow. Let's not drag this out. There will be some good amendments that \nwill be offered. Probably we ought to take them. Some of them are \nalready being considered. Some of them have already been taken. There \nwill be some amendments, really, that are just grandstanding.\n  Hey, that is our right. We are Senators. But I would just say we need \nto get this done. There is not a lot we can take credit for in terms of \nsecurity in this particular Congress. This would be good. And besides \nthat, I would hate to be the Senator who dragged this bill out or voted \nagainst this bill when an incident occurs.\n  This is a plus for the institution. When you do the right thing for \nthe American people, there is plenty of credit to go around. Let's get \nthis legislation passed and let's do it now. We do not need to be \nworking on this at 6 o'clock Thursday night. We can finish this tonight \nor tomorrow. And then let's move on because it is well considered. It \nis bipartisan. There are some legitimate amendments. Let's take them \nup. Let's deal with them, and then let's go to another subject.\n  But overall, I feel good about the work that has been done on this \nbill, and I think we need to do more, and we need to do it very \nquickly. This will be a step in that direction.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, I congratulate the individuals \nresponsible for bringing this bill to the floor. No one is more \nresponsible than the senior Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray. She \nhas talked about this for years. This was a difficult bill because it \nhad multiple jurisdictions--the Homeland Security Committee, the \nFinance Committee, and the Commerce Committee. The bill is here and I \nam glad it is here. It is long overdue. But this is a small slice of \nwhat we need to do to make America safe. We need to do much more. Five \nyears after 9/11,\n\n[[Page S9330]]\n\nAmerica is not as safe as it could be and should be. In my opinion, \nfailures by this White House and inaction by this Republican-dominated \nCongress have left our ports and borders vulnerable, our chemical \nplants open to attack, our nuclear power facilities unsafe, our mass \ntransit systems unsecure, and our military stretched to levels not seen \nsince Vietnam. We need a new direction to keep America safe, and we \nneed it now.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4936\n\n  (Purpose: To provide real national security, restore United States \n leadership, and implement tough and smart policies to win the war on \n                                terror)\n\n  Today, I intend to offer the Real Security Act of 2006 as an \namendment to the port security bill. The Real Security Act provides an \naggressive plan to make America safe. It takes nothing away from the \nport security legislation before this body. It is based on the real \nlessons of 9/11, more than 5 years ago, that occurred, lessons that for \ntoo long have been ignored by this Congress. This Democratic amendment \nwould get serious about all facets of security--not only on port \nsecurity but also on rail, aviation, and mass transit.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk tough about \nnational security. Today we will see if they are serious about taking \nthe required steps to actually keep America safe by joining with us in \nsupporting a tough and smart plan to protect our families.\n  This Real Security Act would, first of all, implement all 41 \nrecommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission.\n  In a report card last year, the 9/11 Commission gave Republicans in \nCongress and the Bush administration D's and F's in implementing its \nrecommendations. The amendment would provide the adequate resources for \nfirst responders, improve intelligence oversight and homeland security \nfunding, and improve our tracking of material that can be used in \nnuclear weapons.\n  An additional section would equip our intelligence community to fight \nagainst terrorists. With all the tough talk from this Republican \nCongress about terrorism, it is striking, stunning to find that for the \nfirst time in 27 years, this Congress did not authorize the \nIntelligence bill for our intelligence community--the first time in 27 \nyears. This year, again, there is no authorization, and we have 18 days \nremaining in this session of Congress. This Real Security Act would, in \nfact, adopt the Intelligence authorization bill that needs to be \npassed.\n  Third, the amendment will secure not only our ports but our rails, \nour airports, and our mass transit systems. In addition to that, it \nwould protect our chemical plants. And this is real money here to \nprotect our chemical plants, real money to protect our nuclear power \nfacilities. Our nuclear generating facilities--it is no secret--have \ntheir independent security systems. Some have referred to them as \n``rent-a-cop'' programs. What they do is put out the security of these \nnuclear power facilities to the lowest bidder. We have to have standard \nprotection for our nuclear power facilities. That would be done with \nthis amendment which we are going to offer.\n  As I indicated, this legislation will do some good things, in section \n3, that I have talked about.\n  Customs and Border Protection, which we talk about a lot--this would \nactually give a half a billion dollars, $571 million, for necessary \nexpenses for border security, including for air asset replacement and \nair operations facilities upgrade, the acquisition, lease, maintenance, \nand operation of vehicles, construction, and radiation portal monitors \nthat Border Patrol tells us are absolutely essential, and they do not \nhave them after 5 years.\n  It would give $87 million to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \nServices. As I have indicated, it would give an additional $55 million \nfor air cargo security, including cargo canine teams and inspectors. It \nwould give $250 million for aviation security, including--very \nimportantly--after all these years after 9/11, we still do not have \nexplosives monitoring equipment. The Coast Guard would be given $184 \nmillion--these are real dollars; these are not authorized dollars--for \nnecessary expenses for the Integrated Deepwater Systems Program. The \nCoast Guard says this is essential. This section is important, as I \nhave indicated, for making our country safer.\n  The fourth provision of this amendment would focus resources on the \nwar on terror. Bin Laden's trail has gone cold, as we have seen in the \npapers in recent days. The administration has taken its eye off the war \non terror and gotten our country bogged down in Iraq. This amendment \nwill change this by increasing substantially our special forces \noperations to capture terrorists, to kill terrorists. It would improve \nour relationships with the Muslim world so we can help stop recruitment \nof new terrorists.\n  Fifth, the amendment would provide better, updated tools to bring \nterrorists to justice. We have a sense of the Senate on FISA. As we \nspeak, there is good bipartisan work being done on domestic \nsurveillance. Senator Feinstein and others have worked on a bipartisan \nbasis. It is my understanding she has, on the Judiciary Committee, at \nleast two Republican Senators who will support her amendment. That is \nimportant.\n  As to the Hamden decision, the Supreme Court said we need to do \nsomething. And we do need to do something. Senators Levin and Warner \nand others have worked on a bipartisan basis to do something about \nthat. It would bring terrorists and detainees in Guantanamo Bay and \nother places to justice by listening to our military experts and \nhelping to create tough tribunals that will lock up terrorists while \nrespecting the Constitution and maintaining America's integrity. It is \nimportant we do this.\n  Finally, this amendment would change the course in Iraq. Our \namendment would include the Levin-Reed resolution to move in a new \ndirection in Iraq. There would be a transition of the U.S. mission in \nIraq to counterterrorism, training, logistics, and force protection. No \nimmediate withdrawal, nothing like that. It would begin a phased \nredeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq before the end of this year, as \ncalled for by some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. We \nwould work with Iraqi leaders to disarm the militias and develop a \nbroad-based and sustainable political settlement, including amending \nthe Iraqi Constitution to achieve a fair sharing of power and \nresources.\n  We would convene an international conference--which has been called \nfor by Senator Biden for years now, and others--and contact group to \nsupport a political settlement in Iraq, preserve Iraq sovereignty.\n  It is very important that this amendment be adopted. We have talked a \nlot about terrorism, homeland security, talked about doing something \nabout what is going on in Iraq and Afghanistan. This amendment would do \nthat. I would hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would \nallow us to adopt this amendment. I believe it is essential. We have \nwaited too long. It needs to be done.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment that is now \npending be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I call up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4936.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  I now yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am going to offer an amendment. I will \nask that the pending amendment be set aside in a moment. I am not able \nto debate my amendment at this point because there is a large group of \nfarmers who are in town to talk about disaster relief, and I am \nexpected to be with them at 11:30. I am going to offer the amendment, \ngo over and be a part of what they are doing, and then come back.\n  But before I offer this amendment, I want to say, just for a moment, \nthis morning the new trade deficit figures were released. The highest \ntrade deficit in America's history was announced\n\n[[Page S9331]]\n\nthis morning: $68 billion. That is the highest trade deficit in our \nhistory: $68 billion for 1 month.\n  This is the most incompetent, unbelievably dangerous trade strategy, \nand yet all we get from anybody is this talk about free trade, free \ntrade, how wonderful it is. Well, this last month alone, we are up to \nour necks in $68 billion of debt, the majority of which is held by the \nChinese and the Japanese. If this month's trade deficit does not \npersuade some people to finally decide the current trade strategy is \nnot working, then I guess nothing ever will.\n  But let me just, from this 1 month, extrapolate what our yearly trade \ndeficit is with these various countries. We are running a trade deficit \nat a $240 billion-a-year level with China. Our trade deficit with the \nEuropean Union is at a $140 billion-a-year level; OPEC, $120 billion a \nyear; Japan, $90 billion a year; Canada, $70 billion a year; Mexico, \n$60 billion a year. It is unbelievable what is happening--$68 billion a \nmonth in trade deficits.\n\n  Now, I understand there are a lot of people who vote for all these \ntrade agreements and think this is wonderful. This is not wonderful. It \nis undermining this country's economy, it will injure our economic \nfuture, and I think it will consign our children to an economic future \nand opportunities that are much less than we have experienced. I would \nexpect and hope that one of these days this Congress and this President \nwill wake up and decide that this trade strategy isn't working. We are \nchoking on trade debt, moving millions of jobs overseas, and tens of \nmillions more are poised to go.\n  If this doesn't persuade people to decide to stand up for this \ncountry's economic interests, I guess nothing ever will. At this point, \nwe need, on an emergency basis, the understanding that we should create \na fair trade commission in this country that leads us toward trade \nbalance, getting rid of deficits, and standing up for American jobs and \nAmerican interests. That hasn't been the case for a long time.\n  This morning's announcement simply underscores once again the \ndramatic failure of this trade strategy, the failure of this Government \nto stand up for this country's economic interests. I will talk about \nthat more later.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4937\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4937.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit the United States Trade Representative from \nnegotiating any future trade agreement that limits the Congress in its \nability to restrict the operations or ownership of United States ports \n        by a foreign country or person, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF PORTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--On and after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the United States Trade Representative may not \n     negotiate any bilateral or multilateral trade agreement that \n     limits the Congress in its ability to restrict the operations \n     or ownership of United States ports by a foreign country or \n     person.\n       (b) Operations and Ownership.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term ``operations and ownership'' includes--\n       (1) operating and maintaining docks;\n       (2) loading and unloading vessels directly to or from land;\n       (3) handling marine cargo;\n       (4) operating and maintaining piers;\n       (5) ship cleaning;\n       (6) stevedoring;\n       (7) transferring cargo between vessels and trucks, trains, \n     pipelines, and wharves; and\n       (8) waterfront terminal operations.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this amendment is simple. It relates to \nthe issue of port security, which is the bill we are on. As you know, \nearlier this year we had a substantial amount of controversy about port \nsecurity, at a time when the Bush administration gave the green light \nfor Dubai Ports World, which was a government-owned company in the \nUnited Arab Emirates, to have the opportunity to take over management \nof seaports in our country--in New York, New Jersey, Baltimore, \nPhiladelphia, New Orleans, and Miami, among others.\n  In February of this year, the Bush administration said that was fine \nfor a company called Dubai Ports World to take over the management of \nthese ports. It had been given official sanction to do so, and the \nPresident indicated that if the Congress didn't like it, and if the \nCongress passed legislation to do something about it, he would veto any \nbill Congress might approve to block the agreement that would allow the \nUnited Arab Emirates-owned company to manage American seaports.\n  Well, the UAE then indicated it was going to back away, and Dubai \nPorts World has now moved to try to find a way to sell its interest to \nothers. My understanding is that it has not yet done so. But the \ncircumstances are that the Oman Free Trade Agreement, which will come \nto the floor of the Senate this week we are told by the majority \nleader, includes a provision--I will describe it in greater depth \nlater--that would prevent the Congress from interfering in any way with \na foreign company from Oman from managing our ports.\n  My amendment is very simple. It would say that trade officials would \nbe prohibited from agreeing to any trade agreement that would preclude \nthe Congress from blocking a takeover of U.S. port operations by \nforeign companies. In recent trade agreements they have actually \nincluded--which we have negotiated with other countries--the \nopportunity for those countries and their companies to come in and run \nAmerica's ports.\n  When we are talking about port security, don't tell me about security \nif we decide we are going to allow other countries, and companies owned \nin many cases by countries, to take over the management of America's \nports. That is not port security and not, in my judgment, improving the \nsecurity interests of this country.\n  We went through this debate about Dubai Ports World and United Arab \nEmirates. That issue is not resolved. It is being raised again in every \ntrade agreement that is being negotiated and is included in the one \nwith Oman that will be debated later this week. The majority leader \nwishes to take up that trade agreement. I believe there is a 20-hour \nrequirement or debate provision with respect to that agreement.\n  I intend to talk at some length about what that agreement provides \nwith respect to this provision. The provision in this trade agreement \nonce again is that it is going to be just fine for foreign interests to \ncome in and provide management and many other functions at America's \nseaports. Tell me how that will make this country more secure.\n  I don't think anybody can talk about security when at the same time, \nin trade agreements, we are saying we want other countries, and \ncompanies that are owned by these countries, in fact, to come in and \nmanage America's seaports. That is a recipe for disaster, in my \njudgment.\n  I will speak more about it later. I wanted to at least lay the \namendment down and have the opportunity to be in line after lunch and \ntalk about this amendment at greater length.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, everyone in this Chamber understands \nthat we are in a political season. And that means we are going to be \ntaking political votes. The amendment offered by the Senator from North \nDakota is indeed one of those votes.\n  Now, Senator Dorgan is a friend of mine. We have worked together on a \nnumber of important issues. But let's face it. This amendment doesn't \nreally do anything. It creates the appearance of a problem and then \npurports to resolve that illusory problem. So there really isn't any \npoint to the amendment. But we also know, that no Member wants to be \nportrayed in a 3O-second television commercial as having voted against \nU.S. ownership of port operations. So I recommend to my colleagues that \nthey support this do-nothing amendment.\n  Let me explain why this amendment doesn't really do anything. This \namendment says that after the date of enactment, the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative may not negotiate any bilateral or multilateral trade \nagreement that limits the Congress in its ability to restrict the \noperations or ownership of\n\n[[Page S9332]]\n\nU.S. ports by a foreign country or person. But the fact is, our trade \nagreements do not prevent Congress from legislating on any matter, \nincluding ports.\n  First off, Congress can always override an international agreement by \npassing subsequent legislation. That is an elementary principle of \nconstitutional law. Moreover, our standard implementing legislation for \ntrade agreements expressly states that if a provision of a trade \nagreement is inconsistent with any provision of U.S. law, then that \nprovision in the trade agreement shall not have effect. In other words, \nin the event of an inconsistency between a trade agreement and U.S. \nlaw, Federal law prevails over the trade agreement. Yet this amendment \nsuggests that the U.S. Trade Representative can somehow transcend our \nConstitution and Federal law by negotiating a trade agreement.\n  That is ridiculous. It is false. But as I said, we are in a political \nseason. So I suggest we accept this do-nothing amendment, recognizing \nit for the political act that it is, and we move on. It is critical \nthat we move this important legislation through the Senate as soon as \npossible and avoid getting bogged down in politics.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment, and I call up my amendment, which I believe is at \nthe desk, No. 4930.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4930.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To improve maritime container security by ensuring that \n foreign ports participating in the Container Security Initiative scan \n      all containers shipped to the United States for nuclear and \n                  radiological weapons before loading)\n\n       On page 5, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n       (9) Integrated scanning system.--The term ``integrated \n     scanning system'' means a system for scanning containers with \n     the following elements:\n       (A) The container passes through a radiation detection \n     device.\n       (B) The container is scanned using gamma-ray, x-ray, or \n     another internal imaging system.\n       (C) The container is tagged and catalogued using an on-\n     container label, radio frequency identification, or global \n     positioning system tracking device.\n       (D) The images created by the scans required under \n     subparagraph (B) are reviewed and approved by the Secretary, \n     or the designee of the Secretary.\n       (E) Every radiation alarm is resolved according to \n     established Department procedures.\n       (F) The information collected is utilized to enhance the \n     Automated Targeting System or other relevant programs.\n       (G) The information is stored for later retrieval and \n     analysis.\n       On page 43, strike lines 11 through 14 and insert ``enter \n     into agreements with the governments of foreign countries \n     participating in the Container Security Initiative that \n     establish criteria and procedures for an integrated scanning \n     system and shall monitor oper-''.\n       On page 44, line 5, strike ``and''.\n       On page 44, line 9, strike the period at the end and insert \n     the following: ``; and''.\n       On page 44, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n       (5) shall prohibit, beginning on October 1, 2008, the \n     shipment of any container from a foreign seaport designated \n     under Container Security Initiative to a port in the United \n     States unless the container has passed through an integrated \n     scanning system.\n       On page 60, strike lines 9 through 15.\n       On page 62, lines 7 and 8, strike ``As soon as practicable \n     and possible after the date of enactment of this Act'' and \n     insert ``Not later than October 1, 2010''\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to talk about one of the most \ncritical gaps in our homeland security, and that is port security. This \nweek, everyone in my home State of New York--certainly there but also \neverywhere in America--is asking if we are safer since 9/11. I have to \nsay, if you look at port security, the answer is an unfortunate no.\n  In this week of remembering the attacks on 9/11, I am pleased that \nthe critical issue of port security is under consideration by the \nSenate. I think the Port Security Act of 2006 is a good start. I \ncommend my colleagues, and particularly my friend from Washington \nState, who worked so long and hard on this issue. But I also want to be \nsure the legislation we pass provides real teeth and resources for port \nsecurity.\n  The United States is the leading maritime trading Nation in the \nworld. At any given moment our seaports are full of container ships, \nwarships, cruise ships, and oil tankers. Every one of these ships is an \nopportunity for terrorists to strike at our industry, our \ninfrastructure, and our lives. We know these enemies will wait \npatiently and plan carefully in order to create maximum panic and \ndamage.\n  Our greatest risk is that a terrorist could easily smuggle a nuclear \nweapon through our ports, God forbid, and bring it into the United \nStates. Once it gets out of the port, it will be gone, and we would not \nknow about it until it is too late.\n  Yet, unfortunately, our vulnerable seaports have long been neglected \nby the administration. Programs to screen for nuclear materials are \ndelayed and delayed and delayed. I have been pushing amendments such as \nthis for years and, frankly, the administration, in lockstep with my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, generally talks the talk, \nbut they do not walk the walk. They do not say we should not do \nresearch to guard against nuclear weapons being smuggled into our \ncountry, but then when it comes time to allocate resources to get it \ndone, when the need is $500 million, they might allocate $50 million or \n$35 million. That is what has happened in years past. That is a \ndisgrace. That is letting our guard down.\n  Mr. President, we need to fight the war on terror overseas, no \nquestion about that. But as any high school basketball coach will tell \nyou, to win a game--in this case, a war on terror--you need both a good \noffense and a good defense. We have woefully neglected the defense. An \nexample is the spending by this administration, DHS, and by the Senate \nand this Congress on port security.\n  By the end of this month, DHS will have provided $876 million in port \nsecurity grants since 9/11. This is a fraction of what we have spent on \naviation security, and it is far less than what is needed.\n  Maritime trade is booming. The Coast Guard estimates port owners will \nneed $7.2 billion over the next 10 years to bring ports in line with \nFederal security requirements, and we need to give more funding and \nmore attention to vulnerable seaports. If we ever needed convincing \nthat this administration is asleep at the switch when it comes to port \nsecurity, turn back the clock a few months to the fiasco over Dubai \nPorts World. That company, a government company from the United Arab \nEmirates, was cleared to take over operations at more than 20 ports \nalong our eastern and gulf coasts without any serious review.\n  It was hard to believe. And then when the President learned there \nwasn't serious review, he still said we don't need it. Now that shows a \nprofound and very disturbing unawareness of what we need for port \nsecurity.\n  The Dubai Ports World takeover almost snuck under the radar, after \ngetting scanty review from the CFIUS committee. There is only one bit \nof good that came from this Dubai Ports World fiasco. It revealed how \nlittle we had done to protect our ports and focused the Nation, and \nhopefully this administration, on bolstering port security in the \nUnited States and around the world.\n  I am inclined to support the Port Security Improvement Act of 2006, \nbut I am also very concerned that this bill does not go nearly far \nenough toward securing our seaports and shipping vessels, especially \nagainst the unspeakable danger of a nuclear weapon.\n  This is our great nightmare. God forbid--God forbid--a nuclear weapon \nis shipped into this country and exploded. Nothing could be worse.\n  So instead of doing little baby steps, instead of saying this is a \n10- or 15-year\n\n[[Page S9333]]\n\nproject, why aren't we moving with alacrity to make ourselves safer \nagainst the greater danger we could face?\n  I know my colleague from Connecticut, who has just walked in, has \nbeen very active on this issue and has been very helpful to me when I \nhave offered amendments in this regard.\n  We need to do much more to guard against nuclear weapons being \nsmuggled into our country by sea, and we can't have any holes in our \ndefenses. Today I am offering two amendments that will strengthen port \nsecurity improvement in these key aspects.\n  The first amendment is the amendment that is pending, No. 4930. This \namendment secures our ports by screening all cargo containers that \nreach our shores to make sure they do not contain a nuclear or \nradiological weapon.\n  More than 9 million cargo containers enter the country through our \nports each year, and as we all know--it is sad, it is woeful--only 5 \npercent of these containers have been thoroughly screened by Customs \nagents. That is nothing short of an outrage. It would truly be a \nnightmare scenario if one of these unchecked containers had a nuclear \nweapon smuggled in by a terrorist group.\n  The latest I heard from some on the other side is: We can't guard \nagainst every single terrorist act. We don't have the resources or the \nfocus to do it.\n  I disagree. But even if one believed in that philosophy, one would \nhave to put nuclear weapons and the danger of them being smuggled into \nthis country at the very top of the list of dangers. So even if one's \nview is we can't do everything, we certainly should do everything we \ncan to prevent this nightmare scenario.\n  Terrorists, unfortunately, could detonate a nuclear bomb in a port or \nthe bomb could be loaded on a truck or railcar and be sent anywhere in \nour country or terrorists could combine radioactive material with \nconventional explosives to make a so-called dirty bomb.\n  Any attack of this kind would cause unspeakable casualties, \ndestruction, and panic. We know our enemies are ruthless and determined \nenough to plan this type of attack. Yet the administration has waited \nyears and years, and I have been trying to importune them to take \nsignificant action on port security.\n  We know terrorists have tried to purchase nuclear materials on the \nblack market, and we know that any shipping container could be used as \na Trojan horse to smuggle deadly radioactive material into our country. \nBut this country has not stepped up to the plate to fund port security \nat the levels that are necessary or to pass laws with real teeth.\n  This amendment will end this shocking state of affairs and make \nAmerica safer by requiring that within 4 years, every container coming \ninto the United States will pass an advanced nuclear detection system \nknown as integrated scanning.\n  Integrated scanning is used now. I have visited--and so has my \ncolleague; I visited, with my colleague from South Carolina, Lindsey \nGraham, Hong Kong about 6 months ago. It is an amazing system. The \ncontainers are not slowed down. They simply are required to drive \nthrough a portal with two detection devices, each on a side, that do \ntwo things: They first check for nuclear weapons and nuclear materials. \nThe only good news is--they are terrible and dangerous--they emit gamma \nrays which pass through just about anything but lead. Even if they are \nhidden in an engine block, the detection device works.\n  At the same time, because lead may cover them, there is a scanning \ndevice that will reveal large chunks of lead. Once these trucks go \nthrough the devices with these containers, we will know if they have \nnuclear weapons or nuclear radiation, nuclear materials or, \nalternatively, a significant enough amount of lead that could shield \nthose, and we could then inspect the container.\n  An integrated scanning system works. I have seen it with my own eyes. \nI salute the firm of Hutchison Wampoa, the largest shipping company in \nthe world, for on their own instituting this system in the Port of Hong \nKong. They do the checks using nonintrusive imaging technology. Then it \nis checked with a tracking device, as well as, of course, the nuclear \ndevice. And if the checks don't match up, Customs inspectors know \nsomething is wrong and can stop the container.\n  Isn't it a shame that China and Hong Kong have better port security \nthan we have in the United States? Integrated scanning for nuclear \nweapons is a model of what it means to make a true commitment to port \nsecurity.\n  We don't need to study this any more. My amendment sets firm \ndeadlines for containers entering the United States to meet this mark. \nIf it is working in Hong Kong, there is no reason why America shouldn't \nhold other ports that handle our commerce to the same high standard of \nsafety.\n\n  There are some critics who say this is an unrealistic deadline; let's \nstudy it some more. It is working. It is there. It has been working for \na year without flaws. Why do we have to study it when the danger is so \ngreat and the technology is there?\n  The Department of Homeland Security has wasted enough time securing \nour ports. It is time for Congress to hold DHS accountable and time for \nus to demand real security at our seaports.\n  Under this pending amendment, by October 2008, integrated scanning \nmust be used to check all containers that arrive on U.S. shores from \nforeign ports participating in what is known as CSI, the Container \nSecurity Initiative.\n  There are 40 ports in the CSI in 22 countries. U.S. Customs agents, \nunder the program, work directly to inspect containers bound for \nAmerica.\n  But it is not enough to extend integrated scanning only to the ports \nin the voluntary CSI program. So my amendment also sets a deadline of \nOctober 2010 for every single container entering the United States to \npass an integrated scan.\n  We have waited long enough for port security to receive the attention \nit deserves. While the Department of Homeland Security drags its feet, \nit is time to put our safety first by voting for a measure that will \nactually stop nuclear weapons before they ever get near the United \nStates.\n  This does not cost the taxpayers a plug nickel. We simply require the \nshipping companies to do it. When Senator Graham and I visited Hong \nKong--and Senator Coleman, who has been very interested in this issue, \nwill confirm it--they told us it costs about $8 to scan a container; \nwhereas, the cost of shipping that container from Hong Kong to the west \ncoast is $2,000. That is .2 percent.\n  Shipping companies will have to put these scanners in. They will then \nhave to pass along the costs to their customers. But I doubt the U.S. \nconsumer would see any increase, the amount is so small and competition \nin the shipping industry is so large.\n  I support this amendment and urge bipartisan support so we can once \nand for all say we are keeping our world safe.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4938\n\n  I have another amendment which I am not going to ask to call up at \nthe desk right now because we don't have anyone on the other side, and \nthey haven't seen it yet. I don't think there will be any objection to \ncalling it up, but I am going to talk about it now, and then we can get \nunanimous consent to call it up. It is amendment No. 4938. Let's talk \nabout that.\n  This is the Apollo project amendment. Here is what it does.\n  Forty-four years ago today, John Kennedy vowed to put a man on the \nMoon by the end of the decade. That was a bold and visionary promise. \nNASA succeeded with time to spare because it was backed by the full \nextent of American resources and ingenuity. John Kennedy called for us \nto do it, and we went forward and did it. It was a bold and visionary \npromise.\n  Now it is time for Congress to make the same bold commitment to \nhomeland security. Too often since 9/11 we have said this has to be \ndone; here is $5 million when the job takes $100 million. As a result, \n5 years after the attacks on our country, we are still far behind where \nwe need to be. We must stop shortchanging port security.\n  This amendment dedicates $500 million over the next 2 years in \ncompetitive grants to public and private researchers who have \ninnovative and realistic ideas for nuclear detection devices that will \nkeep us ahead of our enemies. The funding is sorely needed.\n\n[[Page S9334]]\n\n  We have to develop better portal monitoring devices. We need devices \nthat can be positioned on cranes. We need devices that can be placed \nunder water. In all of these areas, we need devices accurate and \neffective enough to keep commerce moving smoothly.\n  The model Hong Kong uses will work for big ports, but it may not work \nfor small ports. In all these areas, we need the devices to be accurate \nenough and effective enough not only to detect radiation but to not \nhave so many false positives that they interfere with commerce.\n  So many times in the past, this Congress has authorized \nappropriations for port security. They are simply hollow promises and \ndo not go anywhere. This amendment is different. It makes a meaningful \nand long-term commitment of a worthy goal of keeping our seaports safe. \nFunding for the grant process will come from a port-related user fee \nthat will be a dedicated source of revenue. It is only fair to ask \nthose who will benefit most from port security improvements to \ncontribute to this task.\n  We have spent $18 billion on aviation security in the past 5 years. \nMr. President, $500 million is not too much to devote against the \nhorrifying threat of a nuclear attack on our soil. The first amendment \ndoesn't cost us any money. This amendment does. I imagine that is why \nthere is a temporary holdup on the other side to offering it.\n  The bottom line is the leaders of the 9/11 Commission called a \nnuclear weapon being smuggled into this country ``the most urgent \nthreat to the American people.'' Congress has done far too little for \nfar too long in this area. We are running a marathon against a ruthless \nenemy. We haven't taken any more than a few halting steps. We can no \nlonger afford to fail in securing our ports.\n  I ask my colleagues to support both amendments, when we have a chance \nto vote on them, to strengthen this important bill.\n  Once again, she wasn't here earlier. I praise my colleague from \nWashington for the good work she has done on this bill, a bill I am \nstrongly inclined to support.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the overall bill \nbefore the Senate to express my strong support for it and to say I am \nproud to be an original cosponsor of the Port Security Improvement Act \nof 2006 and its predecessor, the GreenLane Cargo Act.\n  Seeing that the clock is reaching noon, I ask unanimous consent we \nextend the time for the scheduled vote by 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I rise to express my \nsupport for the bill and say I am proud to be a cosponsor with Senator \nCollins, Senator Murray, and Senator Coleman. This is a comprehensive, \nbipartisan port security bill. I would also like to thank Senator \nStevens and Senator Inouye of the Commerce Committee, and Senator \nGrassley and Senator Baucus of the Finance Committee, for their hard \nwork, leadership, and commitment to passing a port security bill this \nCongress. This is really important. In the midst of a Congress and a \nCapitol that has become all too reflexively and destructively--I might \nsay self-destructively--partisan, and that partisanship getting in the \nway of us getting anything done, this is a bill on which members of our \nHomeland Security Committee and the other relevant committees have \nrisen above partisanship and focused on a real threat to our security, \na terrorist threat that would come to us in containers moving through \nour ports or in terrorist acts at our ports.\n\n  I know there will be many amendments offered this week. I hope we \nwill consider them in the fullness of debate that is part of the Senate \nbut that we always ask ourselves the question: Will this amendment \nstand in the way of this bill passing and making it through conference \ncommittee to be signed by the President? This is urgent and this bill \nresponds comprehensively to the urgent terrorist threat that we face.\n  Ninety-five percent of our international trade flows through our \nports. Prior to 9/11, the main goal was to move these millions of tons \nthrough our ports efficiently, quickly, for reasons obviously of \ncommerce, jobs, and employment. Since 9/11, we have realized that we \nneed to bring security into the equation but without inflicting on \nourselves the precise economic harm that the terrorists intend to do to \nus. This is a difficult but imperative balance we must achieve.\n  The 9/11 Commission report said that ``major vulnerabilities still \nexist in cargo security,'' and that, since aviation security has been \nsignificantly improved since 9/11, ``terrorists may turn their \nattention to other modes. Opportunities to do harm are as great, or \ngreater, in maritime and surface transportation''--i.e. ports.\n  Just last month, RAND's Center for Terrorism Risk Management Policy \npublished a report entitled ``Considering the Effects of a Catastrophic \nTerrorist Attack'' that considered the effects of a nuclear weapon \nsmuggled in a shipping container sent to the Port of Long Beach in \nCalifornia and detonated on a pier. This is chilling.\n  But I remember that the 9/11 Commission, in its conclusions, said one \nof the great shortcomings we had prior to 9/11 was a failure of \nimagination. Imagination is usually thought to be a wonderful thing, \nbut what they meant by that is our inability to imagine how brutal, \ninhumane, and murderous terrorists could be.\n  The potential short- and long-term effects of a nuclear weapon \nsmuggled in a shipping container sent to the Port of Long Beach and \ndetonated on a pier are devastating. The report estimated that up to \n60,000 people might die instantly from the blast or radiation \npoisoning, with 150,000 more exposed to hazardous levels of radiation.\n  The blast and fires could completely destroy both the Port of Long \nBeach and the Port of Los Angeles and every ship in the port. As many \nas 6 million people might have to be evacuated from the Los Angeles \narea, and another 2 to 3 million people from the surrounding area might \nhave to relocate due to the fallout. Gasoline supplies would quickly \ndry up because one-third of all the gas used on the west coast is \nprocessed at the refineries of the Port of Long Beach.\n  Short-term costs for medical care, insurance claims, workers' \ncompensation, and evacuation and reconstruction could exceed $1 \ntrillion. By comparison, the cost in similar categories resulting from \nthe attacks on America on September 11, 2001 were between $50 billion \nand $100 billion. Besides damage to the United States, the attack would \ncause economic effects that would ripple across the globe.\n  That is devastating and chilling. I hesitate to even speak it on the \nfloor of the Senate, and yet it is the world in which we live, and the \nthreat is real.\n  The unsettling fact is, we still have too little idea about the \ncontents of thousands of containers that are shipped into and across \nthe heart of America every day. It is strange to say, but perhaps the \ncontroversy over the Dubai Ports World incident raised the collective \nconsciousness of the American people and Members of Congress to the \nvulnerabilities that we face at our ports. Following that incident, the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee marked up the \nGreenLane bill, and later Senators Collins, Murray, and I started \nworking with the Senate Commerce and Finance Committees to craft the \ncomprehensive port security legislation that is before the Senate \ntoday.\n  The Port Security Improvement Act of 2006 builds on these foundations \nfor homeland security by strengthening key port security programs by \nproviding both direction and much-needed resources. I would like to \nfocus my colleagues' attention on a few critically important parts of \nthe bill.\n  First, the bill moves us closer to the goal of inspecting all of the \ncontainers entering the United States through our ports. The \nlegislation requires DHS to establish a pilot program to inspect 100 \npercent of all containers bound for the U.S. from three foreign ports \nwithin 1 year and then report to Congress on how DHS can expand that \nsystem.\n  There is legitimate concern that inspecting 100 percent of containers \nwould be so burdensome that it would bring commerce to a halt. However, \ntechnology companies have been working for several years to build more \nefficient inspection systems. The Port of Hong Kong is currently \ntesting an integrated inspection system to scan every\n\n[[Page S9335]]\n\ncontainer entering the two largest terminals at that port, while the \nresearch and development offices of DHS have begun work on developing \nautomated systems to analyze this data. We should move towards 100 \npercent inspection as fast as we can get there, understanding that we \ncan not afford to bring commerce to a halt. This legislation will \nprovide us critical information about how soon we can achieve this \ngoal.\n  Second, this bill authorizes comprehensive and robust port security \ngrant, training, and exercise programs, with a $400 million grant \nprogram available to all ports. Third, this legislation requires DHS to \ndeploy both radiation detection and imaging equipment to improve our \nability to find dangerous goods and people being smuggled into the \nUnited States.\n  DHS has committed to deploying radiation portal monitors at all of \nour largest seaports by the end of 2007. Unfortunately, this \n``solution'' is, in fact, only half of the equation. To provide real \nport security, radiation detection equipment capable of detecting \nunshielded radiological materials, as these portal monitors do, must be \npaired with imaging equipment capable of detecting dense objects, like \nshielding.\n  This legislation requires DHS to develop a strategy for deploying \nboth types of equipment, and the pilot program for screening 100 \npercent of containers at three ports similarly requires that both types \nof equipment be used.\n  Fourth, this bill requires DHS to develop a strategic port and cargo \nsecurity plan, and it creates an Office of Cargo Security Policy in DHS \nto ensure Federal, State, and local governments and the private sector \ncoordinate their policies.\n  Currently, the Coast Guard is responsible for the waterside security \nof our ports. U.S. Customs and Border Protection regulates the flow of \ncommerce through our ports. The Transportation Security Administration \nis responsible for overseeing the movement of cargo domestically. And \nthe Domestic Nuclear Detection Office has been working with the Defense \nDepartment and the Department of Energy to strengthen our ability to \ndetect radiological materials anywhere in the country.\n  It is imperative that these agencies, offices, and departments are \nworking closely with each other, as well as State and local government \nand the private sector to develop and coordinate port security policies \nand programs.\n  Lastly, this bill requires DHS to develop a plan to deal with the \neffects of a maritime security incident, including developing protocols \nfor resuming trade and identifying specific responsibilities for \ndifferent agencies.\n  This is critically important to ensuring the private sector and our \nglobal partners have enough confidence in our system, so that we can \nmitigate any economic disruption and foil a terrorist's plan to hurt \nour economy.\n  Moving the Port Security Improvement Act of 2006 forward will take us \none giant step closer to where we ought to be by building a robust port \nsecurity regime, domestically and abroad, and provide the resources \nnecessary to protect the American people.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with Senators Collins, Stevens, \nInouye, Grassley and Baucus, and our colleagues in the House, to \nfinalizing meaningful port security legislation.\n  Yesterday was a day of remembrance and requiem. Today is a day to \nresolve that we will do everything in our capacity to make sure that no \nterrorist attack against our country and our people succeeds in the \nfuture. That is the intention of this bill. I urge Members of the \nSenate to adopt it by this week's end.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 12 p.m. \nhaving arrived, the Senate will proceed to a vote on amendment No. 4921 \noffered by Senator DeMint, as amended.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, I rise today to encourage my colleagues \nto join Senator Isakson and me in supporting a resolution \ncongratulating the 2006 Little League World Series Champions, the \nColumbus Northern Little League team of Columbus, GA.\n  On August 28, 2006, the Columbus Northern Little League team defeated \nthe Kawaguchi Little League of Japan by a score of 2-1 and concluded \ntheir season with an impressive record of 20 wins and only 1 loss. And \nwhen you consider the fact that more than 7,000 Little League all-star \nteams took the field in July, you realize the magnitude of this \naccomplishment.\n  Their talent, hard work, and sportsmanship allowed them to become the \nsecond team from the State of Georgia to win the Little League World \nSeries, and in doing so they captured the hearts of people across \nGeorgia and in many parts of the Nation who love the game of baseball.\n  As a former Little League coach during the years that Julianne and I \nwere raising our children in Moultrie, I was so proud to participate in \nthe longstanding tradition of Little League Baseball as a coach for my \nson's team--the Destiny Dawgs. There is no question that this great \narena of sportsmanship, founded in 1939, builds confidence, \ndetermination, and hard work in youth.\n  And since the inception of the Little League World Series in 1947, it \nhas grown to encompass not only national teams, but teams from all \naround the globe.\n  I would like to recognize the 11 young men of the Columbus Northern \nTeam individually for their great accomplishment: Matthew Hollis, Ryan \nLang, Mason Myers, Matthew Kuhlenberg, Patrick Stallings, Josh Lest, \nBrady Hamilton, Cody Walker, J.T. Phillips, Kyle Rovig, and Kyle \nCarter, who became the only pitcher in Little League Baseball World \nSeries history to win four games in one series. Their manager Randy \nMorris and their coach Richard Carter deserve strong recognition for \nguiding these young players to victory.\n  And I would be remiss if I didn't recognize the teachers and students \nof these young men's schools, and the fans who represented their \ncommunity and the State of Georgia with such enthusiasm and support.\n  It is with great pride that I extend my heartfelt congratulations to \nthe\n\n[[Page S9336]]\n\nColumbus Northern Team and their families. Columbus, the city that \nproduced Major Leaguers Frank Thomas and Tim Hudson, now has a few more \nheroes to celebrate. I am extremely proud of them and their \naccomplishments and wish them great success in the future. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Chambliss, in support of the resolution honoring the Columbus \nNorthern Little League, the Little League World Series champions for \nthe year 2006.\n  I am particularly honored to pay tribute to them because this is deja \nvu all over again for me; in 1983 another Georgia team, the East \nMarietta team, where I live, was the first Georgia team to win the \nLittle League World Series. So now, in just 60 years, 2 of the 60 \nchampions have come from our great State.\n  Saxby and I had the chance to meet these fine young men with the \nPresident of the United States just last week on Thursday on the tarmac \nat Dobbins Air Force Base. They were poised, they were excited, and \nthey were proud.\n  I also pay tribute to the parents of these young men. If you watched \nthe championship game against the State of New Hampshire when they won \nthe American title, before they went on to play Japan, you saw the \nparents of these young men, right before the game, sharing their \nbaskets of Georgia peaches with the parents of the New Hampshire team, \njust as they did with the Japanese team 2 days later. The parents \nshowed the sportsmanship and good will and the care and the compassion \nthat makes Little League Baseball so special.\n  These are special young men: Matthew Hollis, second baseman and \ncenter fielder; Ryan Lang, right fielder; Mason Meyers, right field and \nthird base; Matthew Kuhlenberg, left field; Patrick Stallings, third \nbase; Josh Lester, second base and shortstop; Brady Hamilton, first \nbase, outfield, and pitcher; Cody Walker, catcher; Kyle Carter, \npitcher; J. T. Phillips, shortstop and pitcher; and Kyle Rovig, left \nfield and pitcher. And there was the management and leadership brought \nby manager Randy Morris and coach Richard Carter.\n  These fine young men played wonderful baseball all the way through \nthe tournament. But in those final two games against New Hampshire and \nJapan, they soared and played like true professionals--young men who \nhad been taught well, who were respectful, and who knew how to pay the \nprice for victory.\n  Columbus Northern is our State's second team to win the Little League \nWorld Series. Kyle Carter, the pitcher, made history by striking out 11 \nbatters and became the first pitcher in history to win 4 times in the \nLittle League World Series.\n  We cannot forget Cody Walker's hitting--with the pitch and where it \nwas pitched--and knocking a two-out pitch over the fence in right field \nfor the two runs that won the game over Japan, nor can we forget the \ngreat second baseman workmanship of Josh Lester nor any of these fine \nyoung men who brought great pride to their State, great pride to their \nparents, and great pride to the great city of Columbus, GA.\n  I am pleased to rise today on the floor of the Senate and join \nSenator Chambliss in acknowledging the great achievement of these young \nmen and encourage the Senate to unanimously adopt this resolution of \nrecognition and appreciation for the Columbus Northern Little League \nteam.\n  Mr. President, I yield back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/12/senate-section/article/S9336-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S9336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr12se06-166]                         \n\n\n\n \n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to discuss my \namendment to create a rural policing institute within the Federal Law \nEnforcement Training Center. I thank Senator Chambliss, Senator \nIsakson, and Senator Pryor for cosponsoring this very important \nlegislation. Law enforcement matters should be nonpartisan, so I am \nparticularly pleased to see my friends from both Arkansas and Georgia \non this amendment.\n  I want to acknowledge the tremendous work done by the 800,000 State \nand local law enforcement officials and first responders throughout our \nNation. They are at the forefront today of our efforts to make sure our \nhomeland is more secure. In Colorado alone, there are 14,000 of these \nlaw enforcement officers. Too often, these heroes are on their own when \nit comes to help from the Federal Government. This is especially true \nwhen it comes to rural America. This is wrong because our law \nenforcement officials and first responders are at the forefront of the \neffort to not only protect our communities but to ensure our homeland \nis secure.\n  Mr. President, along with some of my colleagues on the Senate floor, \nI have often referred to these rural communities as ``the forgotten \nAmerica.'' Indeed, rural America is the backbone of our country, but it \nis too often neglected by Washington and political figures who have \nlost touch with the people in the heartland. Nowhere is this neglect \nfelt more acutely than in the small-town law enforcement agencies of my \nState and of every State in the country. These are small communities \nthat have been confronted with decreased funding, with increased\n\n[[Page S9337]]\n\nhomeland security responsibilities, and with the great toll of the meth \nepidemic that is devastating rural America.\n  Many people don't realize that most American law enforcement agencies \nserve rural communities or small towns in very large proportions. \nIndeed, of the nearly 17,000 police agencies in the United States, 90 \npercent of them serve a population of under 25,000 people. And of \nthose, most of them operate with fewer than 50 sworn officers and, in \nmany cases, with 3, 4, or 5 officers.\n  I am well aware of the difficulties these small-town law enforcement \nagencies face day to day. As attorney general in Colorado, I had the \nhonor of working with 14,000 of some of America's finest law \nenforcement officers. Many of them are from rural Colorado--sheriffs \nsuch as Jerry Martin, from Dolores County, and the other sheriffs in my \nState. These people are always asked to do a lot more with a lot less. \nTheir pressure is great. The growing demands on rural law enforcement \nand shrinking budgets have hit training programs particularly hard. \nMany rural law enforcement agencies simply don't have the budget to \nprovide officers with adequate training. Furthermore, even those \nagencies that can come up with the money cannot afford to take police \nofficers off the street to get additional training.\n  As attorney general and chairman of the Colorado Peace Officers \nStandards and Training Board a few years ago, one of my proudest \naccomplishment was working on a bipartisan basis to help establish a $1 \nmillion annual training fund for Colorado's 14,000 peace officers, with \nthe focus on the smaller law enforcement agencies in Colorado.\n  That is where our amendment on the floor today comes in. FLETC does a \nfantastic job in training Federal, State, and local law enforcement in \nour Nation. But FLETC doesn't have enough resources dedicated \nspecifically toward training rural law enforcement officers. The rural \npolicing institute would do the following:\n  First, evaluate the needs of rural and tribal law enforcement \nagencies throughout our Nation, so that we know exactly what the \nchallenges are that we are facing in those rural communities.\n  Secondly, it would develop training programs designed to address the \nneeds of rural law enforcement agencies, with a focus on combating \nmeth, domestic violence, and school violence.\n  Third, it would export those training programs to rural and tribal \nlaw enforcement agencies.\n  Fourth, it would conduct outreach to ensure that the training \nprograms reach rural law enforcement agencies.\n  As attorney general, I learned that a small investment in law \nenforcement can pay great dividends.\n  Mr. President, when we look at 9/11 today and the fact that we are \nall united in this effort to try to make America safer, and we look at \nwho it is within our country who ultimately will be out there to stop \nthe next attack on America, I would submit there is a very good chance \nit is going to be the deputy sheriff in a small county somewhere in \nAmerica or a member of the police force in some small community making \nsure that a water tank is not contaminated with some kind of biological \ncontamination or it is going to be somebody else who understands that \nsome kind of a network has come together to try to take the fertilizer \nthat our farmers use in rural America and make a bomb out of it. It is \ngoing to be rural law enforcement that is going to make sure they are \ngoing to help us prevent those kinds of attacks on America. When we \nthink about the 800,000 men and women in law enforcement across \nAmerica, they are on the frontlines, in terms of making sure we have a \nmore secure homeland.\n  I cannot think of a more important amendment than to establish a \nrural police training institute under the auspices of FLETC, to ensure \nthat these 800,000 men and women have the right kind of training so \nthat through their eyes they can help us in our march and our efforts \nto make America more secure. We have a long way to go. I hope our \ncolleagues will support this bipartisan amendment to establish a rural \npolice training institute.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4940\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I \nask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4940.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (Purpose: To provide that the limitation on the number of \nTransportation Security Administration employees shall not apply after \n       the date of enactment of this Act, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ------. CERTAIN TSA PERSONNEL LIMITATIONS NOT TO APPLY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any provision of law to \n     the contrary, any statutory limitation on the number of \n     employees in the Transportation Security Administration, \n     before or after its transfer to the Department of Homeland \n     Security from the Department of Transportation, does not \n     apply after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Aviation Security.--Nothwithstanding any provision of \n     law imposing a limitation on the recruiting or hiring of \n     personnel into the Transportation Security Administration to \n     a maximum number of permanent positions, the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security shall recruit and hire such personnel into \n     the Administration as may be necessary--\n       (1) to provide appropriate levels of aviation security; and\n       (2) to accomplish that goal in such a manner that the \n     average aviation security-related delay experienced by \n     airline passengers is reduced to a level of less than 10 \n     minutes.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I wish to talk about the current \nhiring limit on TSA screeners at our Nation's airports. That is what \nthis amendment deals with--to eliminate the current hiring. One can \nask: Why can't we just add more funding to TSA's budget and let them \nhire the personnel they need?\n  Unfortunately, it is not that simple. Each year, in the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill, the House Republican leaders tie the \nhands of TSA officials by setting an arbitrary limit on the number of \nscreeners they can hire.\n  This cap has no basis in security. It is not what the security \nexperts at TSA want. This cap only undermines our security, while \nforcing Americans to wait in longer security lines at airports.\n  This arbitrary cap currently restricts the TSA screener population to \n45,000. Now, 45,000 is a large number, until you consider that 2 \nmillion people fly within the United States every day. In our \ndiscussions with TSA officials, it is clear that we need more than \n45,000 screeners.\n  Mr. President, we are at a point in time, I am told by the managers \nof airports, particularly at Newark Liberty Airport, that we are likely \nto be exceeding the gross travel numbers in aviation that were achieved \nin the year 2000. So here we are with more people traveling, more \nconcern about terrorist invasions of our country and particularly in \naviation.\n  So why do we have this cap? Well, it is not for security, it is not \nfor efficiency. Believe it or not, it is based on ideology.\n  Conservatives in the House want this cap to limit the growth of a so-\ncalled big Government workforce. But do you know what? The American \npeople want this workforce, and they want it fully staffed, as I do; we \nshould all want it fully staffed.\n  The result of this ill-advised cap is the shortage of screeners. We \nwitnessed this last month when British and U.S. authorities foiled a \nplot to attack airliners headed to our shores using liquid explosives.\n  In the days following the British threat, DHS raised the security \nalert level and overworked screeners at American airports. They had to \ndoublecheck bags, conduct random searches at gates, and help calm \nanxious crowd fears. At Newark Liberty Airport in New Jersey, screeners \nworked 12-hour shifts and 60-hour weeks for several weeks after the \nLondon incident. There were reports of exhausted screeners falling \nasleep at x-ray machines. One screener said that his colleagues ``can't \nmaintain these\n\n[[Page S9338]]\n\n12-hour days.'' Remember, this work is on your feet. You are mandated \nto look at every little detail in front of you. It is exhausting work. \nOverstretching this workforce puts the American people at risk, and \nthat is unacceptable.\n  Now, with my amendment, TSA will be able to hire enough well-trained, \nalert screeners to give us the safety and efficiency we deserve. Since \n9/11, long lines have been the rule rather than the exception at our \nNation's airports. Each year, 760 million people fly in the United \nStates, and by 2015, we will hit 1 billion passengers a year.\n  Anyone who has traveled by air in the last few years has seen this \ncongestion at airport security checkpoints. To give an example, this is \nOrlando Florida International Airport. The lines are waiting to go \nthrough security. We see the same thing throughout the country. This is \nDenver, a very efficient airport, but one cannot get through security \nin time enough, in many cases, to reach the flights. It is an \nunacceptable condition. This is the international airport in Nashville, \nTN--lines and lines. We see it wherever we travel in almost any part of \nthe country.\n  The Senate accepted an amendment I offered in July to the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill to eliminate this arbitrary cap, but the \nRepublican majority in the House of Representatives wanted to remove my \namendment in the final bill that will be sent to the President. They \nwant to keep the 45,000-worker cap rather than letting TSA decide what \nits workforce needs are. Security cannot be based on arbitrary numbers. \nConservative ideology must not trump commonsense security needs.\n  Americans stuck in long security lines at airports don't care about \nideology. They want to get through, and they want to get through on \ntime. The mission for our system to operate efficiently is to have no \nlonger than 10-minute waits, and we can only accomplish that if we have \nthe people and the equipment to review this baggage as it comes to \nthem.\n  The American people want to know that they and their families are \nsafe when they fly. This body needs to go on record on this issue so it \ncan scrap this limit once and for all. I hope my colleagues will look \ncarefully at this amendment. Listen, remember, it might be their family \nwho is on an airplane, it might be their friends who are on a \nparticular airplane, it might be anybody who is entitled to feel secure \nwhen they are in an airplane. But judge it by one's personal attitude \nand say this is a responsibility we have as Senators to want enough \npeople to assure security wherever we can get it. One way to do that is \nto have enough of these screeners working these lines, fully awake, \nable to handle their jobs, and reduce what we find is significant \ngrowth in sick days among the screener population. There are a lot of \nabsences.\n  Perhaps we will hear: We have a 45,000-person limit, but we only have \n43,000 people working. The problem is we will always have some \nabsentees. We will always have some job turnovers. These are not easy \njobs. So we are going to have a difference between the number hired and \nthe number at work at a given time. We should raise the limit so we \nknow we are increasing the likelihood that all of the places will be \ncovered, that the flying public will be able to get through their \nsecurity check within a 10-minute timeframe.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. How many do we need, Mr. President, for the yeas and \nnays?\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I understand the Lautenberg amendment is \nthe pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this would lift the TSA's current \nscreener cap of 45,000 persons. The cap is at 45,000, but currently the \nresources available to TSA allow for only 43,000 screeners, and \ncurrently there are only 41,000. The reason is there is such an \nenormous turnover in screeners. They work for a small period of time \nand then move on to other jobs.\n  We have enhanced screening technology and improved staffing models \nthat have helped maximize the workforce currently available. We have a \nstrong security system with minimal passenger line waits. They have \nbeen reduced considerably.\n  I do believe the Lautenberg amendment is not necessary. The current \ncap of 45,000 screeners helps us maintain the pressure on the TSA to \nemploy new screening technology. I personally met in a classified \nbriefing with the head of the TSA to discuss this problem last week. It \nwas classified because of some of the technology that is involved and \nnew models being pursued. One of the comments that was made to me was \nthat the cap really helps us maintain the pressure to secure the new \nscreening technology and reduce the redundancy in the workforce. The \nworkforce is only relevant to the extent the technology does not do the \njob. We believe we should have more and quicker screening, and that is \ngoing to be brought about by new technology. That is where we have put \nour money this year.\n  Unless my friend wants to make any further comments, I intend to move \nto table this amendment. I still have the floor. Does my friend wish to \nhave some time on the amendment?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I wish to ask the Senator from Alaska a question, if \nI might, in relation to his comments.\n  Is it not possible that with the increased passenger volume we are \nseeing--and it is about to break the record held since the year 2000 in \nterms of volume of people traveling--is the manager, the committee \nchairman, aware of the fact that TSA has said that in order to have a \n10-minute wait or less, they need more screeners than they have? They \nneed as many as 48,000.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I say to the Senator, in answer to the question, I \npersonally talked with the head of TSA. He told us they have never been \nable to reach the cap yet because of unavailability of people to take \nthese jobs under the circumstances that they must be screened and \nchecked themselves before they are employed. The delay in getting the \nclearances for screeners is one of those things that hold people up. It \nis not the limited resources or the cap that is the problem; the \nproblem is getting people who will take these jobs who can fit through \nthe screening process they face before they become a screener.\n\n  As I said, the current cap is 45,000. There are 41,000 right now with \nfull-time employment and people trying to find more screeners. The \nanswer isn't to raise the cap; the answer is to keep the pressure on \nthe system so we use more technology, not more screeners. More \nscreeners is more delay. The technology processes these inspections \nfaster than individual screeners can.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, if I may ask the Senator from Alaska \nanother question, and that is, if we had a higher cap and were able to \npersuade the management of TSA to search for a larger pool of people, \nmight we have more people available presently to serve? My experience \nfrom my corporate life tells me that you never quite reach the level \nyou have. We see that in our staffing here.\n  I urge the Senator from Alaska to respond to whether the Senator \nthinks we can improve our population of screeners who are readily \navailable if we search a little bit harder, train a little bit better, \nreduce the fatigue factor which now occurs and causes so many sick \ndays, so many absences, and so much turnover because the job, at 60 \nhours a week, as many of our people are working, is a strain on them \nand they just can't take it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I say to my friend again that the \nworkforce right now is approximately 41,000 in number. The turnover \nrate is enormous because they don't want to stay in these jobs. They \nare not exactly the kind of full-time jobs some people want to pursue. \nIt is not a career.\n  The real problem is we already are capped at 45,000. There is room \nfor 4,000 more right now. They are looking for\n\n[[Page S9339]]\n\nthem. But as we speak, there are more people leaving than we can add to \nthe force. The reason is the problems associated with this type of \nactivity. It is the screening, as we all know, as we go through these \nlines and through the detection systems at the airports. The people who \nhave the jobs just don't like to stay on that kind of a job. We have \ndiscussed how we get around it. I don't know, but increasing the number \nwill not solve the problem. Increasing the cap is what the Senator \nwants to do. The concept of lifting that cap is not a solution. The \nsolution is to try to find some way to make the job more attractive, \nmaybe pay them more, whatever it takes.\n  The two limitations involved right now are the 45,000 cap and the \nbudget resources that are available now. We tried to increase that, but \nwe have not been able to get additional moneys yet for this purpose in \nterms of the screeners.\n  The TSA budget resources currently, as I said, allow for only 43,000. \nBut still that is 2,000 more than are actually on duty right now, and \nthe cap is still 4,000 above that. They can go to a 10-percent increase \nunder the existing circumstance. Lifting the cap is not the answer is \nwhat I tell my friend.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have so much respect for the Senator from Alaska. \nHe is on top of the issues of security, as well as aviation. But is the \nSenator aware that many of the screeners are on military duty or \nmedical leave because of exhaustion? Shouldn't we try to improve the \npool of people from which we can choose? We have as much as 10 percent \nof the workforce out at a time. If it is 10 percent of 48,000, that is \n4,800. That is quite different from having a population that is short \non the job. We don't have enough time.\n  I can simply add that at Newark Airport, we are about 10 percent \nshort of the number we need, something over a thousand. We can't get \nthem. The recruiters can't search for them because they will be bumping \nup against the cap. I think and I hope the Senator will reconsider. I \nbelieve--and I throw this in for the Senator's consideration with my \nquestion; that is, aren't we better off taking the limit off and trying \nto find a way--we are talking about security of the people. The Senator \ndoesn't need any lecture from me. But aren't we better off knowing that \neverybody who can make a connection can get through in 10 minutes, \nthoroughly screened, and having a population that is equal to the \ngrowing population of those who want to travel by air?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from New Jersey. \nHe is really trying hard, and I am trying hard, to work on this \nproblem. Let me tell the Senator this: 37.5 percent of the screeners at \nDulles turned over last year; 37.5 percent left. The reason is they are \nhandling bags; they don't like the hours, as you mentioned; they work \nhours in accordance with the shifts based on the number of flights, not \nin terms of--it is not a steady workload is what I am saying. So they \nmight be there 10 hours, but they are working 6 of that 10 hours and \nvery hard in those 6 hours. The turnover rate is enormous.\n  I do think the difficulty is not in the cap; the difficulty is in the \nmoney. We have to impress on our people in the appropriations process \nto provide more money. We are trying to see if we can find some way to \njustify higher salaries. In some places, the salaries are enormous for \nsmall airports. In others where you deal with the numbers of passengers \nat Dulles or New York airports or Los Angeles, those airports are \ntotally overworked, and the turnover in those big airports is enormous, \nalmost 40 percent a year. You have to consider the fact that these \nreplacements have to be cleared under the clearance process with regard \nto security. They have to be cleared people; they cannot be people who \njust walk in off the street. It takes months to clear one of them. You \ncan lift the cap all you want, but you are not going to get any more \nthan 45,000 in the next year.\n  Mr. President, let me tell my colleague this: We will just accept the \namendment because it won't make any difference in terms of the number \nof screeners who are available. That is what my staff just told me. Why \nam I arguing? Because no matter what the ceiling is, we won't have any \nmore screeners.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, is the Senator aware of the fact that \nthis was an amendment which was already there, it was already \nconferenced and was dropped in conference? The Senator is certainly \naware of the process here. If you don't like it, accept it; it will die \nof its own weight.\n  For the Senator's information, before the screeners were federalized, \nthe turnover rate was 400 percent and we were ignoring the risks we \nwere putting people under. That was a porous thing. You could walk \nthrough there with almost anything.\n  What we want to do is get a stable workforce of screeners who have \npassed the vetting, who work normal hours, who have--and by the way, \nthe Senator is absolutely right about the improvement in equipment so \nthe baggage lifting doesn't have to be as strenuous as it is.\n  So I would ask the Senator whether we can have a vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Have a vote on it?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. And when we meet with the House, let the conferees, \nwhen the issue goes to conference, look at the issue and review what it \nis that is keeping them from----\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will give you a vote and move to table. I will tell my \nfriend, this isn't a solution to the problem. The solution is in more \nmoney and finding a way that we can get people who are cleared to take \nthe job and keep it. You can't put just anybody in there handling those \nbags. If you get a terrorist in there, they could add something rather \nthan see whether there is something in the bags. So they all have to be \ncleared. This ceiling is not an issue.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, if I may respond to say I am so \npleased that the Senator is asking for more money for screeners, and we \nwill try to convince the appropriators jointly to increase the funding \nfor those workers.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator just let us take it to conference and \nsee what we can work out? I don't see that the number makes any \ndifference. The problem is the process and who is hired and what are \nthe restrictions and how much money is available, not the numbers. You \ncould put the number at 90,000 and we will still have 41,000 people \nnext year.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we obviously don't agree. I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there is a series of meetings going on in \nthe Capitol right now pertaining to national defense issues, and I \nwould like to see----\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I still have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I want to work this out with my friend to have the time \nfor a vote that he wishes to have. Could we have this vote at 5 \no'clock? Is that all right? We will ask for the yeas and nays with the \nunderstanding that we will vote at 5 o'clock.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I join him in requesting the yeas and nays and ask \nunanimous consent that the vote take place at 5 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is. \nWithout objection, the unanimous consent request is agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4931\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, \namendment No. 4931, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \npending amendment is set aside.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4931.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To strengthen national security by adding an additional 275 \n     Customs and Border Protection officers at United States ports)\n\n       On page 76, line 1, strike ``725'' and insert ``1000''.\n\n[[Page S9340]]\n\n       On page 77, strike lines 17 through 21 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(A) $130,000,000 for fiscal year 2008.\n       ``(B) $239,200,000 for fiscal year 2009.\n       ``(C) $248,800,000 for fiscal year 2010.\n       ``(D) $258,700,000 for fiscal year 2011.\n       ``(E) $269,000,000 for fiscal year 2012.''.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, my amendment would increase the number \nof U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers by 275. This would bring \nthe total of new U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers in this \nbill to 1,000.\n  In my State of Texas, the Customs and Border Protection officers are \nassigned in the Houston region are responsible for the seaports along \nthe Texas coast from Port Arthur to the Port of Corpus Christi. Some of \nthese officers are also assigned to Houston's George Bush \nIntercontinental Airport. The CBP officers work at the Port of Houston \nin the morning and leave the port in the afternoon to go work at the \nHouston Intercontinental Airport. Sharing these U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection officers between port duties and airport duties is \nunacceptable.\n  With increased security demands being placed on our Nation's ports \nand the desire to increase the number of containers inspected as they \nenter the United States, local port officials have long expressed the \nneed for additional personnel in order to carry out the tasks that are \nso critical to our Nation's economy. With an unprecedented 11 million \ncontainers entering the United States annually, cargo doesn't stop when \nthere isn't a Customs agent there to inspect the incoming shipments. \nWhat happens, of course, is that the cargo is not inspected. So I hope \nwe can pass my amendment.\n  I believe the Port Security Improvement Act of 2006 is a very good \nbill, and I particularly commend the leaders of the respective Senate \ncommittees for working together to bring all of the port security bills \nthat have been introduced in Congress into one comprehensive bill so \nthat we can address this issue.\n  In the last 5 years, we have significantly strengthened our national \ndefense. I think we saw yesterday that so many things have been done to \nkeep our country safe and secure, because yesterday, of course, was the \n5-year anniversary of the attack of 9/11. We have engaged the enemy \nbefore they have reached America since 9/11 of 2001. We have improved \nour homeland security. We have passed the PATRIOT Act to give law \nenforcement officials the tools they need and the resources necessary \nto protect our Nation. We must remain vigilant in pursuing terrorists \nwho seek to harm our country. An integral aspect of our national \ndefense and our economy is the security of our ports.\n  Our Nation has more than 360 federally regulated, thriving ports, any \none of which could be a target for our enemies. One terrorist incident \nat a U.S. port could impact an entire coast, and the financial impact \nof closing one of these ports could be devastating.\n  Texas is home to 29 ports, including 4 of the 10 busiest in the \nNation. The Port of Houston is one of the most important ports in the \nworld. It ranks first in the United States in foreign waterborne \ntonnage, second in total tonnage, and is the sixth largest in the \nworld. It is also home to one of the biggest petrochemical complexes in \nthe world. It is also part of our Nation's U.S. Strategic Petroleum \nReserve, the world's largest oil stockpile. Due to the volume of \nhazardous materials, a terrorist attack in the Port of Houston would be \nan enormous disaster. An attack in the Port of Houston could also \ndisrupt our Nation's energy supply, delivering a blow to our economy at \na time when we cannot afford such a disruption.\n  For years, I have worked with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle for more stringent port security. In the 107th Congress, my \ncolleagues, Senators Feinstein, Kyl, Snowe, and I introduced the \nComprehensive Seaport and Container Security Act of 2002. This bill \ncalled for container seals and tracking numbers for goods being shipped \nto the United States. It also called for a plan to increase inspection \nof merchandise at foreign facilities as well as for a shipment \nprofiling plan to track containers and shipments of merchandise \nimported into the United States that could be a threat to security.\n  In the 107th Congress, we passed the Maritime Transportation Security \nAct. This bipartisan bill was landmark legislation that closed a large \nhole in our national security. I was an original cosponsor of this bill \nas well. However, when it passed the Senate, I made the point of saying \nthe legislation only laid the foundation for port security and more \nneeded to be done.\n  The following year, I introduced the Intermodal Shipping Container \nSecurity Act in both the 108th and 109th Congresses. This was \ncomprehensive legislation, and I am pleased that many of the key \nprovisions in that bill, such as the random inspection of containers, \nthe establishment of minimum standards and procedures for securing \ncontainers in transit to the United States, and the implementation of \nan improved container targeting system, have been incorporated into the \nlegislation before us today. I thank Chairman Stevens and Cochairman \nInouye for working with me in the Commerce Committee on these \nprovisions.\n  In addition, Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman have added so much \nto make this bill even more powerful and more helpful in our overall \ngoal of securing the ports in our country.\n  This legislation calls for the Department of Homeland Security to \ndevelop and implement a plan for random inspection of containers in \naddition to any targeted or preshipment inspection. This significant \nprovision would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop \nand implement a plan to conduct random searches of containers in \naddition to any targeted or preshipment inspection of the containers as \nrequired by law. This would allow the U.S. Customs inspectors to do \nmore at the point of embarkation with the random sampling of different \ncargo that has been inspected.\n  Another important provision in this legislation is the establishment \nof minimum standards for securing containers in transit to the United \nStates. The Secretary of Homeland Security is encouraged to promote and \nestablish those minimum standards for the security of containers moving \nthrough the entire international supply chain. This is a key element \nand I am hopeful the Secretary will take this action. We cannot inspect \nevery piece of cargo, or our international commerce as we know it today \nwould come to a grinding halt. However, if we have better technology, \nsuch as a seal which is tamper-proof, we will know when the contents of \nthe cargo have been altered.\n  My amendment would add to the numbers of Customs and Border \nProtection officers. A thousand new officers, when you have more than \n360 federally regulated ports in this country, is not asking a lot.\n  We must do more. We must do more at the point of embarkation, the \npoint of origin, at the point where ships come into our U.S. waters, \nand at the ports themselves. We need more inspectors to be authorized \nin order to do that.\n  I am asking that my colleagues support my amendment to raise this \nnumber to 1,000. We cannot afford, as we are passing this major \nlegislation, not to do it right, not to authorize everything we need \nand give the Department of Homeland Security the tools they need to do \nthe job of securing our ports.\n  We have done a lot. We have passed maritime security laws since 2001, \nsince our country was attacked. But this bill adds to the measures that \nwe know are lacking in the system today. We are taking more steps every \nweek, every month, and every year to secure our country.\n  I thank Chairman Stevens and Cochairman Inouye, Chairman Collins and \nRanking Member Lieberman, Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus \nfor their leadership in this area. I appreciate that they have come \ntogether. It is very difficult in this Congress, when more than one \ncommittee has jurisdiction over a major part of the Government of this \ncountry. In homeland security we find that the Commerce Committee and \nthe Homeland Security Committee do have overlapping jurisdiction.\n  This bill could have been brought down with in-fighting among the \ncommittees, but it has not been brought down because of the leadership \nof the committees on a bipartisan basis. I appreciate what we are doing \ntoday. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Is there a sufficient second?\n\n[[Page S9341]]\n\nAt this time there is not a sufficient second.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, while we are awaiting representation on \nthe other side of the aisle in order to get the yeas and the nays, let \nme respond to the Senator from Texas about her amendment.\n  First, let me acknowledge the work of the Senator from Texas on port \nsecurity issues over the past few years. Her amendment would increase \nthe minimum hiring of Customs and Border Protection officers in the \nresource allocation model of the legislation before us from 725 to \n1,000. As the Presiding Officer is aware, our bill requires the \nDepartment to do a resource allocation model, really take a hard look \nat how many CBP officers are needed at which port.\n  One reason we believed that was necessary was the experience of \nHouston's ports and airports. The Senator from Texas has told me of the \nproblems that Houston has experienced, where CBP agents actually are \nbeing transferred from the port to the airport to deal with incoming \nflights and then are sent back to the port. Clearly that is a situation \nthat cries out for more agents so they do not have to be constantly \nshifting back and forth from a busy port to a busy airport.\n  I think the Senator is correct that she has a real problem with \nunderstaffing in the Houston seaport and airport and that we do need to \nhave more agents allocated. But I also want to point out to my \ncolleagues that we do specifically require the Department to do this \nresource allocation plan. There may be some seaports or airports that \nactually have more staff than they need. Those could be allocated to \nbusier seaports and airports. But clearly the situation in Houston \ncries out for more agents so we do not have this constant choice of \nwhere they should be.\n  I do support the amendment of the Senator. I will assist her in \ngaining the yeas and nays when we have representation from the \nDemocratic side. I hope that will be shortly.\n  I also suggest that we stack the vote on the amendment of the Senator \nat 5 o'clock, after the vote on the Lautenberg amendment, in order to \nmake it more convenient for our colleagues.\n  Once we get the yeas and nays, I will be making a unanimous consent \nrequest that the vote occur immediately after the vote on the amendment \noffered by the Senator from New Jersey, with 4 minutes of debate \nequally divided prior to the vote. But I am withholding that unanimous \nconsent request until we have representation from the minority on the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, while we are waiting, I would like to \nrespond to the Senator from Maine and thank her. She and I have had a \nconversation about the situation at the Port of Houston. It is \nparticularly dire, in that it is such a busy port and one that has so \nmany unique features. I think the fact that she is supporting the \namendment will go a long way toward getting us to the point we need to \nbe.\n  I think her point is very well taken that giving the Secretary of \nHomeland Security the capability to reallocate personnel within this \nmandate that we are giving is also the right thing to do, just as we \nshould be allocating our resources for homeland security based on \nterror threats, based on needs, not based on politics or anything else. \nWe need to secure our homeland, and we need to do it in a professional \nway. I think this bill goes a long way in a very bipartisan spirit \ntoward giving our Department of Homeland Security the tools it needs to \ndo the job. I am very hopeful we will be able to agree to my amendment \nand go forward to conference and send this bill to the President very \nshortly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I think we are now ready to order the \nyeas and nays.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment No. 4931.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. We are still not ready for the timing on that, but we \nhave ordered the yeas and nays, and I hope we will be able to stack the \nvote to occur immediately after the conclusion of the vote on the \namendment of the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, before I make my statement, which will \nbe on the Reid amendment, I would like to congratulate Senator Collins, \nSenator Inouye, Senator Murray, and all of the Members who worked in \ncommittee on this bill. Although one doesn't often tell tales of what \nhappened in a Democratic caucus, I would like to quote Senator Murray \nin that caucus. She said, ``This bill will make a difference.''\n  I think that is a very dispositive, definitive, and positive \nstatement. So I would like to offer my congratulations to the chairman \nof the committee and all who worked on it and thank them very much.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4936\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak about this very long Reid \namendment which has been offered to be part of this bill. The \namendment, much like the Real Security Act introduced last week, is a \ncomprehensive package of ways to strengthen our national security \nthrough improved intelligence, military, diplomatic, and homeland \nsecurity tools. But in particular I would like, as a member of both the \nJudiciary Committee and the Intelligence Committee, to address the \nissue of electronic surveillance to identify and prevent terrorist \nattacks.\n  All Democrats support giving the President the tools he needs to find \nthe terrorists before they have a chance to strike us again. This \ncannot be said too many times in too many ways. It is a fact, and I \nhave never heard anything to the contrary.\n  We also agree, though, that these intelligence tools, especially \nelectronic surveillance of telephone content--the content of a phone \ncall or wiretapping of a phone call--can and should be done in a way \nthat protects constitutional and privacy rights of all Americans, \nbecause whatever is done here will go on for decades and because \nwhatever is done here will likely impact tens of thousands of persons \nin the United States.\n  I am pleased that the minority leader has endorsed these concepts, as \nthey are the key pillars of legislation that Senator Specter and I have \nintroduced. That is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Improvement \nand Enhancement Act. I thank the minority leader for ``Rule 14'ing'' my \nbill, which now appears as the Feinstein-Specter bill as hotlined, S. \n3877.\n  Tomorrow in Judiciary we will be marking up FISA bills. This same \nbill but under a different bill number, namely S. 3001, will be subject \nto markup along with the other bills. Senator Specter's Administration \nbill, Senator DeWine's bill, and a bill by Senator Schumer will be \nmarked up tomorrow morning and Thursday morning.\n  My legislation, which is pretty simple and pretty limited, is aimed \nat providing our intelligence agencies with more authority, more \nresources, and more flexibility to conduct electronic surveillance. In \ndoing so, the legislation reaffirms that the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act of 1978, or FISA, is the exclusive means for \nconducting electronic surveillance to collect foreign intelligence in \nthe United States. I believe this is very important.\n  We have had hearings in Judiciary. The Attorney General has \ntestified. The head of the NSA program has testified. It is pretty \nclear to me that this terrorist surveillance program can be fit into \nthe confines of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act passed in \n1978. What has to be done is a streamlining of the process leading up \nto it and some revised provisions for emergency hot pursuit. So what I \nhave tried to do is take what the Attorney General has said to the \ncommittee were obstructions to using FISA and solve those obstructions \nbut keep FISA because it is so important.\n\n[[Page S9342]]\n\n  The legislation that I have introduced would recognize that further \nchanges are needed in this shadowy world of asymmetric terror. That is \nwhy the legislation would give the executive branch the authority to \nlisten in to conversations between terrorists and their conspirators \ninside and outside the United States.\n  At the same time, we preserve the cornerstone of FISA, and that is \nthat it is by warrant, that a Federal judge reviews and approves every \nindividual warrant request for content to ensure the Government is not \nspying on innocent Americans.\n  I think it is useful to remind ourselves why this body wrote and \nenacted FISA in the first place. In 1976 a committee headed by Frank \nChurch, which became known as the Church committee, provided a report \nto the Select Committee to Study Government Operations with Respect to \nIntelligence Activities.\n  There are three books just like this, on what went on in our Nation \nprior to 1976. It is startling. I will get to it in a moment. But it \nwas the genesis for the 1978, very carefully considered Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act.\n  This committee reported--and please read it, Members--on a series of \nexcesses and abuses that had taken place in the intelligence community. \nThese included some of the worst civil rights violations our Government \nhas ever committed, such as the secret campaign to smear Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr., and domestic targeting of Americans peacefully \nadvocating civil disobedience in areas such as civil rights and \nopposition to the Vietnam war.\n  The Church committee found these abuses stemmed from a lack of \noversight and checks on Government power. Watch lists were established \non people whose views ranged from Joan Baez on the left to members of \nthe John Birch Society on the right.\n  The Church committee's report led not only to FISA but also to the \nestablishment of the Permanent Intelligence Committees in both Houses \nof the Congress. It was a historic report.\n  So discussions today that the President has the authority to go \naround FISA and doesn't need court approval should cause Members of \nthis great body serious concern. It was a surprise to almost every \nSenator to learn last December that the President had authorized the \nNational Security Administration to electronically surveil U.S. persons \nwithout following the law.\n  As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I have received many \nbriefings on the President's program. There are still some unanswered \nquestions, and the administration has a responsibility to provide \nCongress with answers. But basically the Senate Intelligence Committee \nhas been briefed on the program in the main.\n  But from what I have learned to date, I am convinced of two things: \nFirst, the work that NSA is doing is important to prevent terrorists \nfrom attacking us again--and I support it. Second, the surveillance \nthat is done under the ``terrorist surveillance program'' can be done \nunder FISA's framework with some changes. As a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, I participated in the hearings, and I thank my chairman, \nSenator Specter, for holding these hearings.\n  The conclusion I draw from them, and from the briefings, is that \nfairly modest changes can be made to FISA which would remove the \nbarriers standing in the NSA's way while also restoring the FISA Court \noversight that is necessary to protect a citizen's constitutional \nright.\n  Let me briefly tell you what we have done.\n  We have expanded hot pursuit. Currently, the law states that during \nspecified ``emergency'' periods surveillance can proceed without a \nwarrant for 72 hours. At the recommendation of former FISA judges, we \nhave extended the time for hot pursuit to 7 days. So if something \nhappens and the NSA wants to immediately wiretap someone, they can, \nprovided they notify the Attorney General within 24 hours that it is \nhappening, and then go to the FISA Court.\n  Attorney General Gonzales testified to us that he personally has to \napprove applications before they go to the FISA Court. That was a \nproblem. So we created additional flexibility to handle the increased \ncaseload by allowing the Attorney General to delegate this authority to \ntwo Senate-confirmed officials: the Deputy Attorney General, and the \nAssistant Attorney General for National Security.\n  Wartime authority: Currently, FISA provides the President with \nauthority to wiretap without a warrant for 15 days after a declaration \nof war. That is a good thing, I believe.\n  Our bill would expand Presidential authority by allowing the \nPresident to also order wiretaps without a warrant for 15 days \nfollowing a congressional authorization to use military force and a \nterrorist attack on the United States.\n  Additional resources: The staff and court need additional resources, \nand Members have expressed concern about a backlog of FISA \napplications. We would authorize additional judges as necessary, \nadditional OIPR assistant United States attorneys as necessary, and \nadditional NSA and FBI staff as necessary, so that this problem would \nbe taken care of.\n  Then we clarify ``foreign to foreign.'' It has often been said that \nin the 28 years since FISA was written changes in technology have made \nthe law outdated. Communications that start and end outside of the \nUnited States but may switch through the United States--communications \nthat FISA never attempted to cover--are now regularly put before the \nFISA Court.\n  General Alexander expressed his frustration that foreign-to-foreign \ncommunications impede the FISA process.\n  This bill--which again has been ``Rule 14'd''--would explicitly \nexempt these telephone calls and e-mails from FISA while preserving the \nexisting process for the appropriate handling of communications \ninvolving a U.S. party that were inadvertently wiretapped.\n  We believe these provisions will go a long way. We also would mandate \nthat briefings on electronic surveillance conducted for foreign \nintelligence purposes be given to the full Intelligence Committee of \nboth the House and the Senate, really to prevent what was happening, \nwhich was the beginning of a major wiretapping program where only eight \nMembers of Congress knew very early on about the program, and therefore \nthere was virtually no congressional oversight that was meaningful in \nany way, shape, or form.\n  In this bill is a two-page sense of the Senate beginning on page 313 \nof the Reid amendment and going through pages 314 and 315. Essentially, \nit states up front that the U.S. Government should have the legal \nauthority to engage in electronic surveillance of any telephone \nconversation in which one party is reasonably believed to be a member \nor an agent of a terrorist organization.\n  It goes on to say that absent emergency or other appropriate \ncircumstances, domestic electronic surveillance should be subject to \njudicial review in order to protect the privacy of law-abiding citizens \nor Americans with no ties to terrorism.\n  I strongly support the Reid amendment. I support the Sense of the \nSenate. And I look forward to being able to debate the bill which \nSenator Reid has agreed to cosponsor, as well as Senator Specter--it is \na bipartisan bill--at the appropriate time when bills to change the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act are before the body.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. Once again, I indicate my very \nstrong support for the bill before the U.S. Senate today.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a vote in \nrelation to the Hutchison amendment No. 4931 occur following the vote \non the Lautenberg amendment, No. 4940, with no second degrees in order \nto either amendment prior to the votes, and 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided between the managers or their designees before each vote, and \nthat this occur at 5 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9343]]\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up the Murray amendment No. 4929.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the pending amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, is my amendment now pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is already pending.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4929\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 4929), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. COBRA FEES.\n\n       (a) Extension of Fees.--Subparagraphs (A) and (B)(i) of \n     section 13031(j)(3) of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1985 (19 U.S.C. 58c(j)(3)(A) and \n     (B)(i)) are amended by striking ``2014'' each place it \n     appears and inserting ``2015''.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this is an agreed-upon modification to \nthe amendment I spoke to this morning regarding the funding for port \nsecurity.\n  As I said this morning, it makes sure that we have adequate resources \nto implement the port security bill, and that is essential to its \nsuccess. We have worked out an agreement with Finance, and that \namendment is pending. I hope we can move quickly and agree to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Murray's \namendment. I commend her for offering it. Each year, U.S. Customs and \nBorder Protection collects more than $24 billion in Customs duties and \nfees.\n  The amendment would extend the merchandise processing fee and \npassenger conveyance fee for an additional year, and our hope is that \nthat money will then be targeted to pay for this bill. This makes \nsense. In many ways, it is a user fee. It makes a great deal of sense. \nIt will help ensure that there is a dedicated funding source for the \nsecurity measures.\n  I point out again that the amendment has been cleared with the \nFinance Committee. Senator Murray has worked hard with Senators \nGrassley and Baucus to find the source of funding. I commend her for \nher efforts. I fully support the amendment and I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4929), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4936\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss Senator Harry Reid's \namendment, the Real Security Act. This is a comprehensive plan for \nmaking our Nation safer and making true progress in the war on terror.\n  I would argue that despite continued upbeat assessments by the \nPresident, there is growing evidence that we need to change course--not \ncut and run, but change course, regroup, and reassess our progress in \nIraq, in the global war on terror, and in the area of homeland \nsecurity. I believe an evaluation would lead to the realization that \nchanges need to be made and that a step in the right direction would be \nto implement measures that are included in Senator Reid's amendment.\n  I would like to focus on just a couple of aspects of Senator Harry \nReid's proposal, which is entitled the ``Real Security Act,'' those \ndealing particularly with Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  Reports indicate that we may be losing ground in Afghanistan, the \ninitial proper focus of the war on terror. Afghanistan was the locale \nof the Taliban. They were aiding and abetting al-Qaida and bin Laden, \nand we, by unanimous approval of this Congress and the Senate, gave the \nPresident the authority to launch offensive operations there. Those \noperations were successful. But then, before the entire success was \nsecured, the focus of this administration turned away to a pre-\n9/11 project: regime change in Iraq.\n  In the intervening years, we have lost ground in Afghanistan. The \nTaliban has regrouped and rearmed, and this spring they mounted the \ntoughest resistance since 2001. Suicide attacks, which once were \nunknown in Afghanistan, have more than doubled this year.\n  Almost 5 years after the U.S. invasion, only half the money pledged \nby the international community to rebuild Afghanistan has been \ndelivered and effectively spent. As Afghanistan's Ambassador to the \nUnited States has said:\n\n       We will not be able to stabilize the country if we don't \n     build up the domestic security forces and have development in \n     the countryside. Had we invested more in development, we \n     would have less security problems today.\n\n  I have traveled to Afghanistan on a number of occasions. One of the \nproblems we have is moving outside of Kabul, the capital, and creating \na governmental presence, an Afghani governmental presence, in the \ncountryside. We are trying vigorously to disrupt the production of \npoppies and opium, but that is hard in a society in which that cash \ncrop is easy to move around, and it is quite lucrative. It is harder to \nmove around other agricultural staples because there are no roads and \nirrigation is difficult.\n  If we had, as the Ambassador suggested, focused more resources and \nattention more promptly on development, we might have a much more \nbenign climate in which to deal with a resurgent Taliban.\n  Without viable alternatives, there are scores of problems in \nAfghanistan. Sixty percent of the country is still without electricity, \n80 percent is without potable water, and the unemployment rate is 40 \npercent. These are features which tend to support angry, disappointed \nyoung men, particularly, who are easy targets for those fanatics who \nwould try to sway them into attacking security forces of both the \nAfghani Government and the United States. Without viable alternatives \nin terms of jobs and economic progress, it is easy to see how some turn \nto growing poppies, to providing support for this underground economy. \nAccording to the United Nations, Afghanistan just produced a record \npoppy crop, enough for 6,100 tons of opium--one-third more than the \nworld's demand for heroin. These harvests fund the Taliban fighters who \nfuel the fighting in Afghanistan and terrorists around the world.\n\n  Section 301 of Senator Harry Reid's amendment calls for a long-term \ncommitment to Afghanistan, focusing on economic and developmental \nassistance, along with security assistance. That is the right plan.\n  I have had the occasion to visit with our commanders in the field, \nand we asked them about additional forces, and we asked them about \nadditional military hardware. They will say: We could use that, but I \ncan tell you something we know we need right now; that is, economic \ndevelopment to give the people of Afghanistan confidence in their \nGovernment and hope for the future. Confidence and hope is one of the \nbest anecdotes to the kind of regime the Taliban is trying to impose \nagain in Afghanistan.\n  Last night, as he addressed the Nation, President Bush stated:\n\n       The safety of America depends on the outcome of the battle \n     in the streets of Baghdad.\n\n  Two weeks ago in Salt Lake City, the President said:\n\n       America has a clear strategy to help the Iraqi people \n     protect their new freedom and build a democracy that can \n     govern itself and sustain itself and defend itself. . . . We \n     will stay the course.\n\n  Yesterday, the Government Accounting Office, in testimony before the \nHouse Committee on Government Reform, provided a grim assessment of the \nIraq security situation. GAO found, in their words:\n\n       Since June 2003, the overall security conditions in Iraq \n     have deteriorated and grown more complex, as evidenced by \n     increased numbers of attacks and Sunni/Shia sectarian strife \n     which has grown since the February 2006 bombing in Samarra. \n     Attacks against\n\n[[Page S9344]]\n\n     the coalition and its Iraqi partners reached an all-time high \n     during July 2006. The deteriorating conditions threaten the \n     progress of U.S. and international efforts to assist Iraq in \n     the political and economic areas.\n\n  A New York Times story yesterday entitled ``Deal on a Constitution \nfor Iraq is Teetering'' details how Shia and Sunnis failed once again \nover the weekend to reach an agreement on changes to the Constitution \nwhich would allow for a truly inclusive government.\n  Also yesterday, the Washington Post reported that on August 16, COL \nPete Devlin, the Marine Corps chief of intelligence in Iraq, filed a \nclassified report about Iraq's Al Anbar Province, which includes the \ncities of Fallujah and Ramadi. This province borders Saudi Arabia and \nSyria.\n  Colonel Devlin has been stationed in Iraq for 7 months and is \nconsidered by his fellow officers to be one of the best who is \n``careful and straightforward.'' An army officer in Iraq familiar with \nthe report says he considers it accurate. ``It is best characterized as \n`realistic,' '' he said.\n  This report, while one of the first negative reports filed by a \nmilitary officer, echoes several years of pessimistic CIA assessments \nof the province. The report is classified, so there are no direct \nquotes; however, those who are familiar with the report state that the \nassessment is dire. As the Washington Post summarized:\n\n       One Marine officer called it ``very pessimistic.'' Another \n     person familiar with the report said it describes Anbar as \n     beyond repair; a third said it includes that the United \n     States has lost in Anbar.\n\n  The document reportedly states that there are no functioning Iraqi \nGovernment institutions in Anbar, leaving a vacuum that has been filled \nby the insurgent group al-Qaida in Iraq, which has become the \nprovince's most significant political force.\n  One Army officer summarized the situation in Anbar province with the \nfollowing:\n\n       We haven't been defeated militarily, but we have been \n     defeated politically--and that's where wars are won and lost.\n\n  I visited Fallujah in March 2005 with General Abizaid. At that time, \nthere was one State Department official there and no representatives \nfrom other agencies. That State Department official was tired and \noverworked. He was doing a remarkable job, both in terms of exposing \nhimself to dangers and working tirelessly to try to give a political \nmentoring to the Iraqi authorities. He was desperate for assistance. At \nthat time, he said he didn't think there was another big fight in Iraq \nunless the politics broke down and that it was a big year for politics. \nClearly, more civilian assistance was key. My first visit was in 2005. \nI revisited the province this July. That same State Department official \nwas still there, still doing a remarkable job, and still weathering the \ndangers and putting in the long hours to try to make a difference. \nSixteen months since my last visit, and he was still the only civilian \nrepresentative in Fallujah. He was even more tired. He said he believes \nthe Marines have accomplished all they can reasonably be expected to \naccomplish. They are quickly running out of a mission. He felt it was \ntime to see if the Iraqi forces could perform without the Marines, if \nthe Iraqi Government could support their troops in the field and \nwhether sectarian divisions were so acute that they would prevent the \nIraqis from forging even minimal political cohesion. In his view, the \nUnited States was currently in a holding pattern, delaying the \ninevitable day when the Iraqis must step forward and, in the meantime, \nour forces are suffering additional casualties.\n\n  These are the views of those on the ground in Fallujah, and they are \nrepresentative of a larger problem this administration has had since \nthe beginning of the war in Iraq. There was simply no postwar planning. \nWhile this administration has been focused exclusively on our military \nforces in Iraq, the reconstruction of the Iraqi infrastructure and \neconomy has been virtually ignored. Iraqi reconstruction funds have \nbeen depleted with only a fraction of needed projects completed. The \nability of the United States to aid in ministerial capacity building is \nhobbled by the lack of U.S. civilian experts in Iraq. In fact, because \nof the shortage of appropriate civilian advisers, the military is \nproviding personnel on a case-by-case basis to help mentor civilian \nministries.\n  Clearly, the lack of emphasis on reconstruction is having a dire \neffect on progress in Iraq. Tired of 3 years without adequate security \nor services, Iraqi professionals are leaving the country. Those who \nremain do not trust or feel invested in the new Government. Frustration \nwith services and lack of employment opportunities means angry young \nmen join militias instead of supporting their Government. Lieutenant \nGeneral Chiarelli, Commanding General of the Multi-National Corps of \nIraq, told me in July that unless we devote renewed attention and \nadditional resources to the economic reconstruction of Iraq and the \ndevelopment of governmental capacity, the emergence of capable Iraqi \nforces will not be decisive. We can train an Army, but unless we have \nthe ministries to support that Army, unless we have a police system and \na judicial system that can give individual Iraqis a sense of both \nsecurity and the hope of justice, simply having an Iraqi Army in the \nfield will not be decisive to the ultimate challenge of stabilizing \nIraq.\n  I, and many of my colleagues, have made it clear to the \nadministration that several steps can and should be taken immediately \nto address this situation.\n  The administration should secure fulfillment of international pledges \nto provide economic support to Iraq. We are spending billions and \nbillions of dollars a month. The American people cannot indefinitely \nspend this kind of effort without support from our international \npartners. We cannot meet all of the demands for reconstruction. In \nfact, we should insist, and this Government should be effective, in \nsecuring the already pledged funds, so that at least we have another \nchance--and maybe we can do it right this time--to rebuild the \ninfrastructure of Iraq to a point at least that individual Iraqis feel \nthey will have a minimal amount of electricity, hopefully, more than \nthat; that they will feel secure in terms of access to health care and \nto those things that give them the sense that their Government can \nsucceed, and they should risk, in some cases, their lives to make that \nGovernment succeed. That is not the situation today in Iraq.\n  The administration should work with Iraqis to create a master list of \nnecessary reconstruction projects with estimated funding and timelines. \nFunding for such projects should be a priority in the President's \nbudget. We invested a lot of money, and we made a lot of contractors \nrich by building huge projects. General Chiarelli has been quoted \nseveral times talking about a huge water project in Sadr City was a \nmodel of engineering. There was only one problem: There was no \ndistribution system, so it became the largest and most expensive water \nfountain in the world. He took his own resources, as a division \ncommander, took some PVC piping and at least got some water out into \nthe neighborhoods. That is the type of project that will make progress \nin Iraq.\n  Time is running out. We have to refocus ourselves on these types of \nefforts. We should assign these projects to the military, the Army \nCorps of Engineers, USAID, and private contractors, but we have to make \nsure that these private contractors are willing to go out and do the \nwork, not simply to bill for the work. We have examples where scores of \nhealth clinics were supposedly built, and it has been discovered that \nthose health clinics have not been built, and those that have, the few, \nare inadequate. In fact, I have seen films, videos of raw sewage in the \noperating rooms of the supposedly new and improved health clinics.\n  The administration should work with the Iraqis to establish target \nefforts to increase employment in order to provide young men an \nalternative to joining the militia. One of the things that is being \ndone now on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis under the leadership \nof General Chiarelli is, after securing the neighborhood, now we are \nmoving in, searching, taking out the weapons, trying to disrupt the \ncells of terrorists and others but then putting people to work with \nsimple tasks, such as picking up trash and giving them some money, \ngiving them a sense of hope, and improving the environment in these \ncommunities. We have to do more of that: putting people to work.\n\n[[Page S9345]]\n\n  The administration should provide increased incentives and funding to \nattract large numbers of volunteers from the Department of State, \nAgriculture, Justice, and Commerce to serve in Iraq. The President is \nfond of reminding the American people that we are a country at war. But \nthis is not an administration at war; it is a Department of Defense at \nwar. We are seeing soldiers and marines sent back to Iraq for the third \ntime and some for the fourth time. But where is the mobilization of all \nof our power, our State Department experts, our agriculture experts, \nour Justice Department experts? That is the great fight we are facing \ntoday in Iraq. The military, through the loss of lives and through the \nwounded of so many Americans, are buying this Government the time to \nwork with the Iraqi Government to build capacity, to build \ninfrastructure. But we are not using that time because, once again, \ndespite the President's claim that this is a Nation at war, this is not \nan administration at war. And until we mobilize all of our resources, \nwe are not going to be able, I think successfully, to meet the \nchallenges of stabilizing Iraq.\n\n  Last year, the Secretary of State talked about provincial \nreconstruction teams which would be spread throughout Iraq. So far, we \nhave not fully deployed sufficient numbers of these teams to do the \njob. It made for a good speech line last fall. It hasn't happened yet, \nand it is overdue.\n  Section E of Senator Reid's amendment calls for a new direction for \nIraq and expresses the sense of Congress that Iraq should work for an \ninclusive government and disarm the militias, diffusing the sectarian \nviolence. These militias are becoming a critical and dangerous aspect \nof the situation in Iraq, and unless the Iraqi Government is able to \ndeal with these militias successfully, the Iraqi Government will be \ncompromised and incapable of effectively governing their country.\n  Today, and for the last 2 days, we have been looking at a situation \nwhere the Iraqi Assembly is debating whether they want to regionalize \nthe country--break it up. Shia representatives, led by Hakim and the \nBadr organization, are pushing for a legislative approach that will \nessentially provide the southern part of Iraq and the northern part of \nIraq with their autonomy, leaving the center autonomous but desperately \npoor. It is raising the fears of the Sunni community. But the battle is \nbetween not just Sunnis and Shias but within the Shias because, on the \nother side, Moqtada al-Sadr and his militia are urging that the \nregionalization plan be dropped. This is what is going on in Iraq. It \nis not international terrorists plotting to attack us from there; it is \nthe sectarian struggle for power of who will run that country, and we \nare caught in the middle of it.\n  That is why Senator Harry Reid's proposal is so sensible. It talks \nabout redeploying our forces, reinvesting again and is perhaps the last \nchance we will get to provide the Government of Iraq with the tools and \nthe mentoring so that they can provide their people with basic services \nand basic security.\n  I hope we can rally around and support this amendment because it \nrepresents not only a strong policy for America but a smart policy for \nAmerica. I hope that when Senator Reid's proposal comes up for a vote, \nit is supported. It is one thing to go around the country and make \nspeeches about staying the course, and it is something else to provide \nthe resources, to provide the support, to provide the relief for our \nmilitary that will give them a chance to succeed and give the Iraqis a \nchance to succeed. So I urge passage, when it is called for a vote, of \nthe Harry Reid amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate is now considering a long \noverdue--a long overdue--authorization bill to address the security of \nour ports--yes, our ports. I applaud the efforts of Senators Lieberman, \nStevens, Inouye, Murray, Collins, and many others for their steadfast \ncommitment to address this vulnerability.\n  The administration has let the issue of port security languish for \nfar too long--far too long. Oh, yes, the President has made a series of \nspeeches in recent days about the threat to the homeland and the great \ndesire and capabilities that al-Qaida possesses to attack us--yes, to \nattack us, the United States. Yet when one reviews the President's \nhomeland security budget, gaping holes can be found in funding to \naddress known vulnerabilities. After 9/11, we learned that our first \nresponders could not communicate with one another. How about that. We \nlearned that our first responders could not communicate with one \nanother. How awful that was. The cost was lives, human lives.\n  It now appears that we have a similar problem in the White House, \nwhere the administration's speech writers and its budget writers don't \ncommunicate. They operate in alternate worlds--worlds far apart.\n  In his speech last Friday at Georgetown University, Homeland Security \nSecretary Chertoff urged Congress to pass this port security \nlegislation. He said that passing the bill:\n\n       Would be not only a fitting tribute to the fifth \n     anniversary of 9/11, but would also be an important set of \n     tools that we can use in achieving the goal that we have set \n     for ourselves over the next couple of years.\n\n  Now, this is the very same rhetoric and, if I may say, it is the very \nsame hot air that we have been listening to and we have been hearing \nfor 5 years--5 years. Yes, we have been listening to it for 5 years, \nthe same rhetoric, the same hot air that is used for lifting balloons, \nlifting balloons into the heavens.\n  The administration, time and time again, uses tough talk when it \ncomes to homeland security, but, sadly, that tough talk rarely is \nfollowed up with real money, cash on the barrelhead.\n  This month the majority leadership is once again playing a clever \nrhetorical game with homeland security. The port security bill that is \nbefore the Senate authorizes $400 million for port security grants. \nThese grants would provide essential resources to our most vulnerable \nports for building fences, deploying cameras and sensors, training \nsecurity personnel, and for verifying the identity of the thousands of \nport workers who access our ports every day.\n  The House-passed bill which authorized the same $400 million level \nwas adopted by a vote of 421 to 2. But, I ask my colleagues, where, oh \nwhere is the $400 million? Where is it? Right now, the Senate and House \nare conferencing the Homeland Security appropriations bill for fiscal \nyear 2007. The Senate-passed version of the bill includes an amendment \nthat I offered with the support of my illustrious, inimitable chairman, \nJudd Gregg, which provides an additional $648 million for port \nsecurity. The amendment would appropriate the full $400 million \nauthorization for port security grants along with critical funds for \ncargo container inspection equipment, for Coast Guard ships and planes, \nand for increased cargo inspections at foreign and domestic ports. That \nis real port security, but--oh, there is that conjunction here--but, \nregrettably, the House majority has refused to make the $648 million \navailable to the conference. What a sad state of affairs.\n  Our citizens watching the Senate today are being led to believe that \nthis bill will secure our ports. Here it is:\n\n       H.R. 4954, an Act to Improve Maritime and Cargo Security \n     Through Enhanced Layered Defenses, and for other purposes.\n\n  They believe this bill will secure our ports. Here is the bill. It \ndoesn't weigh very much, but it means security for our ports. However, \nit will be a charade if the port security funds are not appropriated. \nHow about that? Money. What does the Bible say about money? The love of \nmoney, what does it say about it?\n  Did the White House step to the plate? How about it? ``Hey, Mr. \nPresident--hello there, down at the White House.'' Did the White House \nstep up to the plate to address security risks at our ports? No. No. \nOne of the hardest words in the English language to say: No.\n  If the administration were really serious about port security, it \nwould have voiced support for the $400 million in the Senate bill for \nsecurity grants. Yet there was not one mention of port security in the \nadministration's letter--not one mention. It has been more than 3\\1/2\\ \nyears since the Coast Guard estimated that the security cost at our \nports would be $5.4 billion.\n  Senator Collins, bless your heart, to date not a cent of that amount \nhas been funded despite the fact that U.S. seaports handled over 95 \npercent of U.S. overseas trade.\n\n[[Page S9346]]\n\n  Last year, the Department of Homeland Security was able to fund only \n24 percent of the critical projects requested by the port authorities. \nThese funds are critical, absolutely critical for ports to improve \ncommunications, access control systems, and provide waterside security. \nWhere, oh where has the administration been? ``Where, oh where has my \nlittle dog gone?'' Where has the administration been?\n  Of the $816 million the Congress appropriated since 9/11 for port \nsecurity, only $46 million was requested by the President. Did you get \nthat? Let me say it again. Of the $816 million the Congress \nappropriated since 9/11 for port security, only $46 million was \nrequested by the President. There is an odd disconnect at the White \nHouse when it comes to port security funding.\n  While I applaud the efforts of my colleagues today for moving this \nauthorization legislation forward, and hopefully to the President's \ndesk, authorizations of funding are not worth a hill of beans unless we \nprovide real money, real dollars to fund them. That funding is in \njeopardy. Why? That funding is in jeopardy due to an irresponsible \nindifference from the White House and objections from the House \nmajority.\n  I challenge the White House--yes, come on now--I challenge the White \nHouse and the majority, not only to talk the talk on port security but \nalso to walk the walk by supporting the funding that will actually make \nus safer. Our ports are seriously vulnerable to a terrorist attack. \nPotentially, thousands of American lives are at stake. Think about it. \nIf we are truly determined to tighten security at our ports, we should \nsend the Homeland Security appropriations bill to the President with \nthe $648 million to fund port security.\n  My amendment includes the funding to address many of the provisions \nin this bill that are being debated today. In addition to port security \ngrant funding, my amendment includes $40 million to hire 354 additional \nCustoms and Border Protection officers to conduct cargo container \ninspections at our seaports and $211 million to purchase additional \nnonintrusive inspecting equipment for U.S. seaport and rail border \ncrossings.\n  There you have it. Currently, only 5 percent of the 11 million \ncontainers entering the United States are physically inspected by \nopening--take a look at it by opening the containers. Only 5 percent of \nthe 11 million containers entering the United States are physically \ninspected by opening the containers.\n  The Coast Guard has only 34 inspectors to review security plans at \nforeign ports. Of the 144 countries that conduct maritime trade with \nthe United States, the Coast Guard has assessed security at only 59.\n  I have to say that again. I have a duty to say that again. Of the 144 \ncountries that conduct maritime trade with the United States, the Coast \nGuard has assessed security at only 59--59 out of 144. At the current \nrate of inspections, U.S. inspectors will visit countries that trade \nwith the United States only once every 4 years. Does that make you feel \nsafer? Think about that tonight when you are laying your head on the \npillow. Think about that.\n  My amendment includes $23 million to double the presence of \ninspectors at foreign ports and increase security compliance checks at \ndomestic ports.\n  Finally, my amendment includes $184 million for Coast Guard deepwater \nassets that are critical to securing our ports and surrounding \nwaterways. These funds will allow the Coast Guard to address an \nimmediate shortfall in boats and planes needed to patrol our ports and \nadjacent waterways. The President and Members of Congress may applaud \neach other and congratulate themselves for protecting lives with this \nport security authorization bill, but the truth of the matter is that \nthis bill will do little to secure our ports if the President and those \nsame Members of Congress do not provide the money--there you go again--\nthe money to actually scan for dirty bombs, inspect containers, and \nimplement the security systems that are so desperately needed. What on \nEarth is wrong?\n  Can we please stop playing these dangerous political games with \nhomeland security and actually come together to protect the precious \nlives of people?\n  Unless we provide the funding authorized in this bill, we will be \nplaying fast and loose with the security of our people.\n  Hear me. Hear me now. I say it again.\n  Unless we provide the funding authorized in this bill, we will be \nplaying fast and loose with the security of our people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4937\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I previously offered an amendment to the \npending bill. My understanding is it will likely be accepted. I did not \nhave a chance to speak at any length on the amendment. I want to do so \nnow. I recognize we have a vote in about 10 minutes. I will be mindful \nof that.\n  The amendment which I offered says that our U.S. trade officials will \nbe prohibited from agreeing to any future trade agreement that would \npreclude the Congress from blocking the takeover of a U.S. port \noperation by a foreign company. I offered this amendment in the shadow \nof this morning's announcement that our monthly trade deficit--get \nthis--was the highest in U.S. history. It was announced this morning--\n$68 billion in 1 month.\n  If anyone needs additional information about the failure of our trade \nstrategy and the failure of this so-called ``free trade'' nonsense we \nhave been hearing around here, take a look at this morning's \nannouncement--$68 billion trade deficit in 1 month.\n  Mr. BYRD. Shame.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This is not money we owe to ourselves. That is money we \nowe largely to Japan, and China, and other countries and will be repaid \nsomeday with a lower standard of living in this country.\n  I offer this amendment dealing with trade as a backdrop to this \nmorning's announcement of the highest trade deficit in history, a trade \nstrategy fraught with error--and this is injuring this country.\n  Let me describe the need for this amendment.\n  You might recall that earlier this year it was announced that Dubai \nPorts World was going to begin to manage a number of ports in this \ncountry. Dubai Ports World, in February of this year, indicated that \nthey were going to manage ports in America in New York, New Jersey, \nBaltimore, Philadelphia, New Orleans, Miami, and some others. Dubai \nPorts World is a company that is operated by the United Arab Emirates.\n  In February of this year, the Bush administration gave the green \nlight to Dubai Ports World, a company owned by the United Arab \nEmirates, to manage these American ports. The President said that he \nfelt it was fine for our ports to be managed by a company owned by the \nUnited Arab Emirates.\n  In fact, when a firestorm erupted over this issue, here is what the \nPresident said, brushing aside objections from Republicans and \nDemocrats alike. President Bush endorsed the takeover of shipping \noperations in six major U.S. seaports by a state-owned business in the \nUnited Arab Emirates. The President pledged to veto any bill Congress \nmight approve to block the agreement.\n  Even more than that, the head of Homeland Security, Mr. Michael \nChertoff, strangely enough said this: Homeland Security Secretary \nMichael Chertoff reported yesterday that the proposed takeover of \nterminal operations at five U.S. ports by Dubai Ports World would give \nU.S. law enforcement a better handle on security at U.S. terminal \noperations.\n  Here is a member of the Cabinet in this country saying that if we \nturn our port management over to a foreign company, it will actually \nimprove security.\n  I don't know what he might have had for breakfast that morning, but I \nam telling you it didn't agree with his thinking process. It is going \nto improve security to turn the management of American ports over to a \ncompany that is owned by the United Arab Emirates? I don't think so.\n\n  There was a firestorm of protest. The President said he would veto \nany legislation that we would provide that\n\n[[Page S9347]]\n\nstopped this takeover of management of these American seaports. Despite \nthat, at some point, it was quite clear the Congress was going to say \nto the President--Republicans and Democrats--we are sorry. It doesn't \nmatter what you threaten with respect to a veto, we will pass \nlegislation that prohibits this.\n  We believe the security of our seaports is best maintained by not \nturning the management of our seaports over to a company owned by the \nUnited Arab Emirates. Dubai Ports World, at some point, announced that \nthey were going to find another way to do this and sell their \ninterests. My understanding is that has not yet been done. But in any \nevent, the administration backed away.\n  However, the trade agreements that we are negotiating now include it. \nPast agreements have included it. I don't intend to interrupt that with \nthis amendment. If I could, I would. But I don't have the votes to do \nthat.\n  But the trade agreements say this, including the Oman agreement, \nwhich I am told will be brought to the floor of the Senate on Thursday \nof this week. I intend to speak at some length on that agreement. I am \nopposed to it. But it includes this provision, and other trade \nagreements have included the same provision. U.S. port operations that \nwe couldn't block Oman from acquiring under the FTA, under our Free \nTrade Agreement with Oman, we would be prohibited from blocking an \nagreement that included landside aspects of foreign activities, \nincluding operations and maintenance of docks, loading and unloading of \nvessels, directly to or from land, marine cargo handling, ship \ncleaning, et cetera. In point of fact, we are negotiating trade \nagreements that include provisions which say we are not able to block a \nforeign company owned by a foreign country from coming in and managing \nour seaports.\n  That is what we are doing in trade agreements. Most of our trade \nnegotiators have been fundamentally incompetent from the start.\n  It was Will Rogers who said many decades ago that the United States \nof America has never lost a war and never won a conference. He surely \nmust have been talking about our trade negotiators. They don't wear \nuniforms so they do not remember whom they represent. I have often \nthreatened to buy them jerseys so they can look down and see whom they \nrepresent--the good old U.S.A.--just like Olympic athletes represent \nthe U.S.A.\n  We negotiate trade agreements that we are told will strengthen this \ncountry, and month after month and year after year we sink deeper into \nthis abyss of red ink, with now a $68 billion trade deficit in the last \nmonth alone.\n  Is it surprising then that the same incompetence that has led to the \nlargest trade deficit in history--the same incompetence that lead to \nthat--led them to do this, to undermine the very debate we had in \nFebruary of this year about the management of American ports by a \nUnited Arab Emirates-controlled company, Dubai Ports World?\n  Just as an aside, let me describe the incompetence. Let me describe \none example. I could give a hundred. Next year, according to a report, \nwe will be getting imports of Chinese cars into this country because \nthe country of China is now beginning a substantial automobile export \nindustry. They have announced they will begin exporting cars from China \nto the United States next year. So we will be able to see Chinese cars \ndriving up and down the streets of America. Guess what. Our trade \nnegotiators agreed that when Chinese cars come into our country, we \nwill impose a 2.5-percent tariff on Chinese cars that come into the \nUnited States.\n  We also agreed that any U.S. cars we could sell in China, they could \nimpose a 25-percent tariff.\n  A country with which we had a $200 billion trade deficit, we agreed \nthey could impose a tariff on automobiles 10 times higher than the \ntariff we would impose.\n  Is that brain dead? It is where I come from. Is that incompetence? It \nis incompetence in my hometown.\n  That doesn't represent our country's interests.\n  We come back to the point. I could give you a hundred examples \nsimilar to that, where soft-headed foreign policy is masquerading as \ntrade policy.\n  We come back to the newest trade agreements, including Oman, which we \nwill have on the floor of the Senate next Thursday which includes this \nprovision. It is identical to provisions that are included in previous \nagreements as well.\n  I say we ought to block this from ever occurring in any future free \ntrade agreement. This provision undermines the entire position that we \nhave taken with respect to deciding that it is not in our country's \nsecurity interests to have the United Arab Emirates engaged in the \nmanagement of our seaports.\n  For that reason, I believe we ought to pass the amendment I am \nproposing, prohibiting this from happening in the future. I would like \nto go back, frankly, and undo that which was done in previous trade \nagreements.\n  There is a little thing that people outside of this congressional \nsystem don't recognize very easily. It is called fast track. Fast track \nsounds so innocuous--just fast track.\n  Fast track means Congress has decided to give up its opportunity, \nwhich exists in the Constitution, to be engaged in trade activities so \nthat when a trade agreement comes to the Congress, this Congress has no \nopportunity to review it with the understanding of wanting to amend it.\n  Fast track means we have put ourselves in the straight jacket and no \namendments.\n  That is why, when a trade agreement comes to the floor of the Senate \nsuch as Oman--and there will be others. We are now negotiating nine \nadditional trade agreements with nine additional countries right now. \nThe House of Representatives announced they will take up two additional \ntrade agreements in November. When those agreements come to the floor \nof the Senate, because the Congress, in its lack of wisdom, decided to \nput itself in a straight jacket, no one can offer an amendment to strip \nout this kind of provision of a trade agreement. It surely escapes my \nline of reasoning why the Congress would want to decide to limit its \ncapability to improve a trade agreement, but it has.\n  Some will say, notwithstanding what trade agreements say, \nnotwithstanding all the other issues, the President can, for national \nsecurity reasons, decide to back an agreement such as this. Yes, that \nis true.\n  It was this President who said: I agree that we ought to allow the \nUnited Arab Emirates and Dubai Ports World to come in and manage \nseaports. I agree that we should do that. We have already evaluated it. \nIt makes sense.\n  He is wrong about that, of course. His Secretary of Homeland Security \nsays not only does it make sense, but it will make America safer if we \nhave the management of America's seaports being done by a foreign \ncompany through a foreign country.\n  That is the most absurd thing I ever heard. Yet in this country, in \nthis town, it passed with thoughtful debate. Again, it doesn't meet the \ntest of thoughtful debate in my hometown cafe.\n  I am offering this amendment. My understanding is it will likely be \naccepted, for which I am very appreciative. I will speak more about the \ngeneral subject when we have the opportunity to talk about the free \ntrade agreement with the country of Oman. My understanding is it may be \nthis Thursday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the amendment offered by Senator Dorgan \nis a restriction on the U.S. Special Trade Representative's authority \nin negotiations. As such, it is under the jurisdiction of the Senate \nFinance Committee. However, it is my understanding that the chairman \nand the ranking member of the Finance Committee have no objection to \nacceptance of the amendment.\n  I urge acceptance of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4957) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S9348]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4940\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided on the Lautenberg amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, based on the debate that occurred \nearlier, I believe the distinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee \nhas decided to accept this amendment and was willing to do it without a \nrollcall vote. However, the distinguished Senator from New Jersey wants \na rollcall vote, so we are going to have a rollcall vote.\n  I do not know whether the Senator from New Jersey is on his way. I \nsee that he is in the Chamber, so I yield the floor to the Senator from \nNew Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President as we are now prepared to consider the \namendment, in the minute I have--which I assume is the time--I would \nlike to tell everybody that the purpose of this amendment is to ask \nthat we take the cap off the number of TSA screeners we can hire. The \ncap is 45,000. We have had it in legislation before, but the House \ninsisted on the cap being continued. It is silly, when passenger volume \non airlines, as of this point in the year is almost at the alltime \nhigh, and it is expected this year we will see the largest number of \nairline passengers in the history of the country.\n  We have these constant reviews to protect ourselves from terrorist \nattack from those who want to sabotage an airplane. So it is simple. \nJust remove that cap. Remove it and let the TSA figure out what to do \nwith it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment. It increases the number of Customs and Border Protection \nofficers by 275 for a total of 1,000.\n  In my home State of Texas, where the Port of Houston is the sixth \nlargest port in the world, we have officers who have to leave the port \nat noon and go out to the airport. Because of this, we don't have \nenough officers to cover our ports.\n  This amendment will add just 275 officers for a total of 1,000 new \nofficers.\n  I think this is an amendment that is very important to add for the \noverall security of our ports. I urge everyone to vote for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate resumes action on the bill on Wednesday, the time until 12:15 be \nequally divided in the usual form and that at 12:15 the Senate proceed \nto a vote in relation to the Reid amendment No. 4936, with no second \ndegrees in order prior to the vote.\n  Before the Chair rules, we anticipate a budget point of order against \nthis amendment, and therefore this vote is likely to be on the motion \nto waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Therefore, Mr. President, although we are going to \nconsider two more amendments tonight, there will be no more rollcall \nvotes tonight.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4935\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment proposed by the Senator from Colorado, Mr. \nSalazar. My colleague from Georgia, Senator Isakson, and I are \ncosponsors and strong supporters of this measure which I believe \nfulfills a great need in rural America.\n  The amendment creates a policing institute that would be administered \nby the Office of the Federal Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, GA.\n\n[[Page S9349]]\n\nThe creation of this office provides training for those who may not \ncurrently have access to it because it sends folks who are going to \ntrain our local law enforcement personnel directly into our rural \nareas. Our local communities have fewer resources and fewer folks on \nthe payroll, so they really can't afford to do without men and women \nwho may be called away for an extended period of time to undergo \ntraining.\n  There is no question--and I hear this whenever I travel around the \nState--that our local law enforcement in rural areas are called upon \nday in and day out in providing the nuts and bolts of criminal \ninvestigations and law enforcement. In many areas, increased crime and \nthe scourge of methamphetamine drug trafficking have placed severe \npressures on rural law enforcement capabilities. If we're going to call \nupon folks to do more, then we have to provide them with the resources \nthey need to carry out their duties--and as a strong supporter of the \ncriminal justice system this includes giving them access to the vital \ntraining they need.\n  In addition, these dedicated and hard-working professionals are also \nasked to prepare for different types of threats in our changing \nsecurity environment. This amendment will greatly assist in their \nefforts.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this common sense, bipartisan \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the \nSalazar amendment--and I thank Senator Collins and Senator Murray for \nagreeing to accept the Salazar amendment--which authorizes a new Rural \nPolicing Institute within the Office of State and Local Training at the \nFederal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, GA. I am joined on \nmy side by Senator Chambliss and others as cosponsors and very much \nappreciate the acceptance of this important amendment.\n  Modeled after existing programs within the office, the rural policing \ninstitute would evaluate the needs of local law enforcement located in \nrural areas, and develop expert training programs designed to assist \nlaw enforcement in training regarding combating methamphetamine \naddiction and distribution, domestic violence, law enforcement response \nrelated to school shootings, and other topics.\n  By having a program whereby we can send instructors to these police \ndepartments rather then have them come to FLETC itself, we maximize our \ntraining capabilities and ensure that these officers are able to \nreceive on the job training without reducing manpower.\n  This is a win-win for our law enforcement personnel, FLETC, and the \nAmerican taxpayer. I urge passage of the amendment.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the managers on this side unanimously \napprove this measure and seek its support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am unclear whether the Salazar \namendment No. 4935 is actually pending.\n  I do support the amendment offered by the Senator from Colorado, and \nthe managers on this side are also pleased to recommend its acceptance.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the Salazar amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4935) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4956\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby], for himself and Mr. \n     Sarbanes, proposes an amendment numbered 4956.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the amendment that \nhas just been referenced on behalf of myself and Senator Sarbanes to \nthe Port Security Improvement Act of 2006. This amendment is virtually \nidentical to the Public Transportation Terrorism Prevention Act that \nthe Banking Committee unanimously reported in November of 2005. In \nfact, the Senate passed an almost identical bill in the 108th Congress. \nI am hopeful that as we consider port security today, we can include \nthis critically important legislation designed to help address the \nsecurity vulnerabilities of our Nation's public transportation system.\n  The national dialog has appropriately been focused on aviation post-\n9/11, and this week port security is at the top of this agenda here in \nthe Senate. In addition to these key areas, I believe it is imperative \nthat we make transit security a priority, too. We know full well from \nthe occurrences in Great Britain, India, and Spain that our buses, our \nsubways, and rail systems across the country are attractive targets for \nterrorist attacks. The Public Transportation Terrorism Act before us \nnow is an appropriate first step to address widespread needs, and it \npaves the way toward making transit safer for the traveling public.\n  The language in this amendment was carefully crafted and is a result \nof several hearings on this topic, review of two comprehensive studies \nby the American Public Transportation Association and the Government \nAccountability Office, and negotiations with key industry leaders. This \namendment authorizes $3.5 billion in capital investment grants, \noperation security assistance, and research. While this is short of the \n$6 billion worth of needs identified by the industry, it is an \nimportant and necessary first step.\n  I thank those who have worked hard over the course of several years \nto produce a sound piece of legislation that will result in safer \npublic transportation systems, particularly my colleague on the Banking \nCommittee and former chairman, Senator Sarbanes, as well as the \nchairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Housing and \nTransportation, Senators Allard and Jack Reed. I also thank Chairman \nStevens and Senator Inouye with the Commerce Committee for their \nsteadfast support in this effort. In addition, I thank Chairman Collins \nand Senator Lieberman with the Homeland Security Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Allard, Bennett, Schumer, and \nBoxer be added as cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, at the proper time I will urge adoption of \nthe amendment, but I think Senator Sarbanes wishes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of the \namendment offered by the able chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs Committee. While the need for improved security at \nour Nation's ports is clearly evident, we must not forget the other \nareas of our Nation's multimodal transportation network. The amendment \nChairman Shelby has offered would provide grants to our Nation's public \ntransportation systems to help protect the millions of riders who use \nsubway trains, commuter rail, and buses every single day.\n  This amendment is based on legislation that passed the Senate \nunanimously in the 108th Congress and legislation that has been \nreported out again by the Banking Committee in the 109th Congress. We \nmust not wait any longer to pass this needed legislation.\n  If there is any question as to whether transit is at risk, one need \nonly look at recent events. Less than 2 months ago, 7 coordinated bomb \nblasts devastated commuter trains in Mumbai, India, leaving over 200 \ndead and 700 injured. Last year, the London subway system was the \ntarget of a tragic attack that left 50 people dead, and in 2004, almost \n200 people were killed when bombs exploded on commuter trains in \nMadrid.\n  Here, this past May, the Department of Homeland Security issued a \nspecific warning to transit systems to remain alert against possible \nterrorist attacks. The warning said that four people had been arrested \nin separate incidents involving videotaping of European subway stations \nand trains or similar activity, which the Department noted\n\n[[Page S9350]]\n\nprovides ``indications of continued terrorist interest in mass transit \nsystems as targets.''\n  The threat is clear. In response, both the Federal Transit \nAdministration and the Department of Homeland Security have worked with \ntransit systems to identify steps that can be taken to help prevent and \nmitigate attacks. In fact, the greatest challenge to securing our \nNation's transit systems is not a lack of knowledge of what to do, but \nrather, a lack of resources with which to do it. In the words of the \nGovernment Accountability Office, ``Obtaining sufficient funding is the \nmost significant challenge in making transit systems as safe and secure \nas possible.''\n\n  In an editorial published shortly after the London subway bombings, \nthe Baltimore Sun stated that, ``Since September 11, 2001, the Federal \nGovernment has spent $18 billion on aviation security. Transit systems, \nwhich carry 16 times more passengers daily, have received about $250 \nmillion. That is a ridiculous imbalance.''\n  I commend Chairman Shelby and Senator Reed of Rhode Island and \nSenator Allard of Colorado. We have all worked together on the Public \nTransportation Terrorism Prevention Act. As I mentioned, this \nlegislation has now twice come out of the Banking Committee. It \nauthorizes, as the chairman mentioned, $3.5 billion over 3 years in \nsecurity grants for our Nation's public transportation systems. The \nmoney will be available for projects designed to resist and deter \nterrorist attacks, including surveillance technologies, tunnel \nprotection, chemical, biological, radiological and explosive detection \nsystems, perimeter protection, employee training, and other security \nimprovements.\n  Let me give one example of a critical need right here with respect to \nWashington's Metro. Their greatest need is a backup operations control \ncenter. This need was identified by the Federal Transit Administration \nin its initial security assessment and then identified again by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security in a subsequent security assessment. \nThis amendment would authorize the funding to make this and other \nurgently needed security upgrades to transit systems around the \ncountry.\n  We know transit systems are potential targets for terrorist attacks. \nWe know the vital role these systems play in our Nation's economic and \nsecurity infrastructure. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment, which is designed to address the critical security needs of \nAmerica's transit systems.\n  I thank Chairman Collins and Senator Lieberman for their acceptance \nof this amendment, and Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye. This is a \nmajor step forward.\n  Mr. President, I would like to add as cosponsors on our side--I \ndidn't pick up all the names Chairman Shelby read, but I have Senator \nReed of Rhode Island, Senator Menendez of New Jersey, Senator Clinton \nof New York, Senator Lieberman, Senator Boxer, and Senator Schumer.\n  Ms. STABENOW. If the Senator will yield, I ask to add my name as a \nmember of the committee.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And Senator Stabenow of Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I urge adoption of the amendment if there is no further \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I commend the Senators for their initiative. The \nhorrific terrorist attacks in London and Madrid demonstrate that \nterrorists are willing and able to attack transit systems. Our systems \nin the United States remain vulnerable.\n  Just today, the Homeland Security Committee held a hearing looking at \nthe next 5 years and what challenges face us. The witness, the deputy \ncommissioner for counterterrorism from New York City, specifically \npointed out the vulnerabilities of our transit systems and also the \ninequities in funding. I believe the statistics he gave us were that \nthere was a ratio of 9:1 in the amount of money that had been spent on \naviation security versus other forms of transportation security. So I \nthink there is an imbalance. I believe this is a vulnerability and that \nthis amendment would allow for the authorization of significant \ntransportation security improvements. I am pleased to join my \ncolleagues in support of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Is there further debate? The \nSenator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the managers on this side are very pleased \nto support this bipartisan amendment and urge its immediate adoption.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment. The amendment (No. 4956) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I commend my chairman and the ranking \nmember of the Banking Committee for all their hard work. This has been \na wonderful bipartisan effort, and I am pleased it is included in the \nunderlying bill. I commend the leadership of Senators Collins and \nMurray on the underlying bill.\n  I wish to speak about a piece of security that is so critical for us \nthat I will be offering tomorrow, an amendment to provide our first \nresponders with the interoperable communications equipment they need to \neffectively respond to emergencies. Whether it is port security, rail \nsecurity, whether it is our local police and firefighters, we know that \nhaving radios that can actually talk to each other, actually work to be \nable to actually communicate with the Department of Homeland Security \nor the Department of Defense or be able to speak to our armed services \nis absolutely critical.\n  We also know, in fact, right now that the system is not what it \nshould be.\n  I also want to thank Senators Lieberman, Levin, Schumer, Durbin and \nBoxer for cosponsoring the amendment that will be offered tomorrow.\n  My amendment would finally give our first responders the resources \nthey needs to be able to quickly communicate and respond to a terrorist \nattack or other kind of national emergency.\n  It would provide a dedicated source of funding for our communities by \ncreating a 5-year $5 billion grant program for interoperable \ncommunications.\n  My amendment is based on the interoperability communications program \nincluded in the bipartisan Lieberman- Collins bill, S. 1725, which \npassed out of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee \nwith strong bipartisan support. Unfortunately, this has languished on \nthe Senate floor for almost a year. There has to be a sense of urgency \nabout this issue and getting the resources to our local communities so \nthey, in fact, can respond.\n  My amendment authorizes, as I said, $5 billion in grants. It is \nslightly more than the $3.3 billion in the Lieberman-Collins bill but \ncertainly very close in terms of our approach.\n  I think it is important to provide more funding in the early years so \nthat communications can finally address this issue and be able to do \nwhat they need to do as quickly as possible.\n  Yesterday, we observed the 5-year anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. We \ntook time to remember the victims and their families and to recount the \nevents of that horrible day. Many of these victims were our brave \nfirefighters and police officers who gave their lives to save others.\n  Every day, first responders all across our country, and certainly in \nmy great State of Michigan, put their lives on the line to make our \ncommunities safer, a job they do bravely and with honor. Now is time \nfor us in Congress to do our job and finally make sure they have the \nresources and the equipment they need in coordinated national efforts \nso they can respond and can communicate in case of a terrorist attack \nor other national emergencies.\n  Almost 2 years after the attacks, the 9/11 Commission Report outlined \nthe numerous communications problems first responders had as they tried \nto save lives. The report details the problems police officers and \nfirefighters in New York faced because they were on different radio \nsystems. Over 50 different public safety organizations from Maryland, \nVirginia, and DC reported to\n\n[[Page S9351]]\n\nthe Pentagon that they couldn't talk to each other.\n  This makes absolutely no sense. People running into buildings, into \nthe World Trade Center, into the Twin Towers, when they should have \nbeen running out because they did not know what was happening. The \nradios did not work.\n  The 9/11 Commission concluded that ``the inability to communicate was \na critical element at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and the \nSomerset County, Pennsylvania, crash site, where multiple agencies and \nmultiple jurisdictions responded.''\n  They went on to say, ``The occurrence of this problem at three very \ndifferent sites is strong evidence that compatible and adequate \ncommunications among public safety organizations at the local, State, \nand Federal level remain an important problem.''\n  The 9/11 Commission published its final report in July of 2004, 2 \nyears ago, that the men and women in the first responder community knew \nthe communications difficulties even before \n9/11, 2001. Unfortunately, the Federal Government has not yet made a \nsubstantial commitment to solve this problem. It has been 2 years since \nthe 9/11 Commission gave its report.\n  In fact, 10 commissioners gave Congress a failing grade, an F, for \nnot yet providing adequate radio spectrum for first responders and not \naddressing the problem where our local communities are stretched too \nthin and have too many urgent and competing priorities to effectively \nand completely solve the problem by themselves.\n  We addressed the issue of the radio spectrum, in part, in the year \n2006 budget reconciliation bill, which set a February 17, 2009, \nhandover date and providing $1 billion in funding for interoperable \ncommunications for first responders in advance of the handover.\n  I support these positive steps. But now we have to build on that to \nprovide a guaranteed stream of funding to resolve this overall crisis \nabout radios not being connected, not being able to talk to each other.\n  The 9/11 Commission is not alone in the assessment of this critical \nproblem. In June of 2004, a U.S. Conference of Mayors survey found that \n94 percent of our cities do not have interoperable capability between \nthe police departments, the fire departments, and emergency medical \nservices--unbelievable, 94 percent. And 60 percent of cities do not \nhave interoperable capability with the State emergency operations \nsystems.\n  This is unacceptable. There needs to be a sense of urgency about \nchanging that, and we have to be a major part of that solution.\n  The most startling finding was that 80 percent of our cities don't \nhave interoperable communications with the Department of Homeland \nSecurity or the Department of Justice.\n  Imagine if there were a terrorist attack and 80 percent of our cities \ndid not have the capacity for interoperable communications with \nHomeland Security.\n  This vulnerability was again exposed over 1 year ago with the \nHurricane Katrina disaster, where we know the New Orleans Police \nDepartment and three nearby parishes were on different radio systems. \nFirst responders were unable to communicate with each other as they \nattempted to rescue people trapped in New Orleans.\n  When I visited the gulf, I was very proud of seeing Michigan people \nthere. I remember sitting for lunch outside the New Orleans Convention \nCenter with a young man from the Michigan Coast Guard on one side and a \nyoung man from the Michigan National Guard on the other. I asked them: \nDo you have radios? They said: Of course. I said: Can you talk to each \nother on the radios? They said: No. How are you rescuing people? How \nare you communicating when you are out on the beat? Hand signals, was \nthe response.\n  We can do better in 2006 than hand signals when we have a national \nemergency or a terrorist attack. How many more disasters need to happen \nbefore we fix this problem?\n  In May of 2006, Michael Chertoff, Secretary of Homeland Security, \nsaid: ``The fact of the matter is we cannot effectively manage an \nincident if we do not, and if we cannot, talk to one another.''\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  He went on to concede that it is still the case that too many \nemergency responders are not able to talk to their counterparts, to \ntheir own organizations or to their companion organizations, let alone \ncommunicate with agencies in neighboring cities, counties or States \nduring a crisis.\n  On the fifth anniversary of the September 11 attacks, I believe it is \nshameful that we have made so little progress on interoperable \ncommunications.\n  It is unacceptable that there is not a sense of urgency about getting \nthis done now--frankly, about having not done it now. We should have \ngotten it done 4 years ago, 3 years ago, 2 years ago, 1 year ago.\n  I believe that our constituents would be stunned to learn that the \nFederal Government has not yet dedicated funding to specifically \naddress this problem.\n  How many times do we have to hear this is an issue? How many experts, \nhow many bipartisan reports before we do what we need to do urgently \nand to the maximum extent that we can?\n  We know that the lack of interoperable communications for America's \nfirst responders puts them and our communities in danger. Too many of \nour police, fire and emergency medical services and transportation \nofficials cannot communicate with each other, and our local departments \nare not able to link their communications with State and Federal \nemergency response agencies--way too many.\n  Our first responders are making do with less and less each year which \nmakes no sense. And they should not have to choose between \ncommunicating with each other and critical training and other means.\n  I think people would be shocked to know that there are fewer police \nofficers on our streets today than on 9/11/2001. In Michigan alone, \nover 1,500 fewer police officers are on our streets because of cutbacks \nin law enforcement funding. This makes no sense.\n  In the 5 years since the 9/11 attacks, one of the too many requests \nfor support that I receive every year from communities is for \ninteroperability communications equipment. Every time I meet with \npolice officers and firefighters and emergency responders and local \nmayors, others who are leaders in their communities, the issue comes up \nabout the radios, about the lack of ability to communicate. I have done \neverything I can to help. I have come to this floor many times urgently \nrequesting that we move forward in an aggressive way to address this \nissue.\n  I am pleased to be able to put together specific grants to be able to \nsupport individual communities, and that is a step in the right \ndirection. But what we need is a comprehensive national approach. We \nneed to make a commitment that we are not going to accept anymore any \ncommunity in this country not having the ability to talk to each other, \nthe neighboring communities, the folks at the State and the Federal \nGovernment. That is intolerable.\n  This is the fourth time I have stood on the Senate floor and offered \nan amendment to provide the dedicated stream of funding to address our \nfirst responders' interoperable communication problems.\n  I am very hopeful that now will be the time that we come together \nright after this fifth anniversary of 9/11 and agree that we are going \nto turn that F, given by the 9/11 Commission, into an A, by finally \ncoming together and solving this problem so in case of whatever the \nemergency is in the future, folks will not walk away and say part of \nthe reason we lost lives, part of the reason we couldn't respond was \nbecause the radios didn't work. We have the ability to fix that in \nrelationship to this important bill. I hope we do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold his request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withdraw his suggestion of \nthe absence of a quorum?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I withdraw my suggestion of the absence of a quorum.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nClinton as a cosponsor to my amendment No. 4929.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator\n\n[[Page S9352]]\n\nSchumer as a cosponsor to the Dorgan amendment No. 4937.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, we are here on the floor of the Senate this evening \ntalking about the maritime cargo security bill. This is an extremely \nimportant piece of legislation. I have been working on this issue since \nSeptember 11, 5 years ago, when I recognized, as did others, that we \nhave an extreme vulnerability in our port cargo container system when \nit comes to our Nation's security.\n  We have been working since that time to put together legislation. I \ncommend Senator Collins and her staff, Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, \nthe Finance Committee, and numerous Senators who have worked together \nto get us to this point.\n  As I said earlier on the floor of the Senate, this measure is \nextremely important. For the first time, when this bill is passed and \nit goes to the President's desk, we will assure that every cargo \ncontainer coming into this country has a much higher level of security. \nWe also will put in place what is called the GreenLane bill, which will \nallow an even higher point of security for companies that voluntarily \nopt to make sure that when their cargo containers are loaded overseas, \nthey are secured, that we know what is in them, we know who is handling \nthem, and we know if they have been diverted. They will be tracked \nacross the ocean, and before they ever come into our ports we will know \nthat they are safe.\n  Those cargo containers with that higher level of scrutiny will then \nmove off of our ports in a much more efficient and quick manner, \nleaving behind those containers that will still need to have a higher \ndegree of inspection.\n  Finally, our bill will make sure we have a way to resume cargo \nhandling quickly and efficiently should a terrible incident ever occur \nat our ports.\n  This bill balances the need of making sure our ports and our \ncontainers and the people who live and work around those containers, as \nwell as the cargo there, are secured. It balances that with the \nimportant economic activity that occurs at ports across our country.\n  When this bill was brought to the floor of the Senate earlier last \nweek, it lacked one critical component, and that was a dedicated \nfunding stream. As I shared with my colleagues, I was deeply concerned \nthat if we did not fund this bill, we would leave an empty shell and an \nempty promise to the people of America that we were securing our ports.\n  That is why today I was very happy the Senate agreed to my amendment \nto have a funding stream and to put that into this bill to make sure, \nas it moves forward, we will have the personnel we need to make sure \nthe regime we have put in place actually occurs, that we will have the \ninfrastructure that will be needed to make sure we can assure a secure \nsystem of cargo containers this country relies on for its economic \nactivity.\n  That amendment was adopted, and with that I believe this bill is one \nwe can all be proud of. Within a few days, as we work through the rest \nof the amendments, I, for one, will finally be able to sleep at night \nknowing we have made a major move forward.\n  So there are still amendments to be brought forward to the Senate. I \nknow we are going to work our will through them. But I commend all of \nour colleagues for stepping up to the plate on this important issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nfour editorials that talk about the need for funding.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               (From the Everett Herald, Sept. 10, 2006)\n\n               Fully Fund Murray's Bill on Port Security\n\n       Five years after terrorists seared feelings of \n     vulnerability deep into the American consciousness, much has \n     been done to improve our security. Airport security has been \n     enhanced by more than $20 billion in federal spending. \n     Locally, first responders are more capable of dealing \n     effectively with a disaster, natural or manmade.\n       But public safety leaders here and elsewhere worry about a \n     potential terrorism target they believe is still neglected: \n     our seaports. Only a tiny percentage of the approximately 10 \n     million containers that enter our ports are inspected, \n     leaving gaping holes that terrorists could exploit with a \n     radioactive bomb or other weapon. And costs for many of the \n     physical upgrades in port security since Sept. 11, 2001, have \n     been borne by local ports rather than the federal government.\n       On Thursday, Congress sent a signal that it may be ready to \n     give port security the serious attention it needs. Senators \n     announced an agreement on bipartisan legislation that Sen. \n     Patty Murray (D-Wash.) introduced shortly after the 9/11 \n     attacks and has been pushing ever since. It's expected to get \n     a floor vote this week, then go to a conference committee \n     that will iron out differences with a similar bill already \n     passed by the House.\n       What's still needed, though, is dedicated funding. Murray's \n     bill calls for $835 million annually for a program that will \n     create higher levels of cargo security, allow cargo to be \n     inspected and tracked from the time it leaves the factory \n     floor overseas, and implement a plan to resume trade quickly \n     after an attack to minimize its impact on the economy. `` The \n     bill also calls for $400 million in security grants to local \n     ports.\n       ``I've been very clear with everyone that I can't support \n     another NCLB (No Child Left Behind) bill,'' Murray said \n     Friday, referring to the federal education bill that \n     educators complain was far heavier on mandates than money. \n     ``We have to provide the funding or it will never be fully \n     implemented.''\n       The bill originally sought to use money from tariffs on \n     imported goods, but members of the Finance Committee \n     objected, arguing that if tariffs were lowered, funding would \n     dry up. Murray concedes that point, and said she'll offer an \n     amendment this week that would tap existing customs fees that \n     aren't related to duties.\n       A fully funded bill will mean a more secure Puget Sound, \n     which has major ports in Seattle and Tacoma and a growing \n     container operation at the Port of Everett. Ship activity in \n     Everett has increased roughly tenfold in the past two years, \n     and as, business continues to grow in Seattle and Tacoma, \n     even more figures to come north.\n       Five years after terrorists proved their desire to hurt us, \n     our ports remain a huge potential target. Congress mustn't \n     wait any longer to act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       In Our View--Secure Ports\n\n                    (By Columbian editorial writers)\n\n       Five years after 9/11, Senate should take action on \n     Murray's GreenLane bill, because the horror of 9/11 was \n     orchestrated in the air, the logical immediate concern was in \n     air-travel security. But five years after 9/11 it is \n     frightening to see what little the United States has done to \n     enhance port security.\n       The intransigence and complacency is especially alarming in \n     Washington state, the nation's most trade-dependent state.\n       There's good news, though. Thanks largely to U.S. Sen. \n     Patty Murray, D-Washington, Congress is finally paying proper \n     attention to port security. Murray's GreenLane bill co-\n     authored with Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine has been approved \n     by the House and passed by the Senate Homeland Security \n     Committee. Last Thursday, senators announced agreement on \n     port security legislation, and they are expected to vote on \n     the measure this week.\n       Even if approval is expedited and it should be this \n     congressional footdragging is inexcusable. We're glad Murray \n     has kept forcing Congress to pay attention. The GreenLane \n     offers five desperately needed components:\n       It would create tough new standards for inspecting and \n     approving all maritime cargo.\n       It offers the Greenlane option, a faster and even higher \n     level of security for companies that agree to have their \n     cargo tracked and monitored from the time it leaves a factory \n     overseas until it reaches the United States.\n       The bill offers a plan for quickly resuming maritime trade \n     after any incident, minimizing the economic impact of \n     terrorism.\n       Port security grants would allow ports to strengthen their \n     perimeter security.\n       The Department of Homeland Security would be held more \n     accountable for port security, in part by establishing an \n     Office of Cargo Security Policy.\n       Locally, Port of Vancouver Executive Director Larry Paulson \n     said Friday that he has been frustrated by the congressional \n     foot-dragging. But he is confident about his port's security. \n     ``It's less of an issue here because the emphasis is on \n     containers, and we handle very few containers,'' Paulson \n     said. ``The greater concern for port security in our state is \n     in Seattle and Tacoma.''\n       In a speech Friday, Murray enlisted a RAND Center for \n     Terrorism and Risk Management Policy report that presented \n     this horrifying scenario: Terrorists put a 10-kiloton nuclear \n     bomb inside a cargo container and detonate it at the Port of \n     Long Beach, Calif. According to the report, up to 60,000 \n     people would be killed instantly, 15,000 more would be \n     injured, 6 million people would flee the area and economic \n     losses would be about $1 trillion.\n       In Seattle and Tacoma, ports are close to downtowns and \n     Interstate 5. Imagine how enticing that is to an evil mind \n     that wants to kill Americans and cripple our economy.\n       Murray also pointed to the 2002 closure of several ports on \n     the West Coast. It cost the U.S. economy about $1 billion a \n     day. She said one study estimates that if all U.S. ports were \n     closed for nine days, it would cost the national economy \n     about $58 billion. Of course, the greater concern of port \n     security is preventing deaths and injuries. Five years\n\n[[Page S9353]]\n\n     even five months is far too long. The Senate should expedite \n     passage and implementation of the GreenLane bill for \n     enhancing port security.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the Oregonian, Sept. 12, 2006]\n\n                  Time To Land Tightened Port Security\n\n       A bill that addresses the vulnerability of U.S. shipping \n     fetches up in the Senate, but still needs to be brought to \n     shore\n       The most impressive thing about the port security \n     legislation that the Senate begins debating today isn't the \n     bill's boldness or its thoroughness. It's the five years it \n     took the bill to get to this point.\n       Talk about a slow boat from China.\n       Five years after what was supposed to be a new reality, \n     after constant warnings about the vulnerability of U.S. ports \n     that inspect only about 6 percent of incoming cargo \n     containers, the bill raises some new barriers against a \n     seagoing Sept. 11. Ports ``were extremely vulnerable,'' says \n     Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who has been pushing the bill, \n     ``on the fact that five years after 9/11 they've failed to \n     address homeland security issues.''\n       This bill may not entirely address those issues, but at \n     least it finally raises them.\n       It requires the Department of Homeland Security to set \n     minimum container security regulations, sets up an Office of \n     Cargo Security Policy to coordinate federal and local port \n     policy, and makes some federal money available.\n       Maybe most usefully, it sets up a ``Green Lane'' program to \n     swiftly move cargoes already inspected at their point of \n     departure. Most containers will still remain uninspected, but \n     sending already-checked containers through will, in Murray's \n     phrase, ``reduce the size of the haystack where we're trying \n     to find the needle.''.\n       Even after last week's: carefully negotiated deal among \n     three Senate committees, the bill faces serious hazards to \n     navigation. The Senate has rejected the House's way of \n     financing the programs, without completely agreeing on its \n     own. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., wants to attach to it a major \n     rail security program, an excellent idea by itself that could \n     send port security off the tracks.\n       In a Congress with minimal accomplishments and a swiftly \n     dwindling number of days to manage any, a bill with real \n     prospects can be a magnet to any idea that any legislator \n     wants to slip across, even if the weight of the additions \n     ends up sinking the bill.\n       Our strong feelings about getting serious about maritime \n     security may be basic strategic thinking, or may be mostly \n     slack-jawed astonishment at how long this process has taken. \n     It might even be the touchy sensitivity coming from living in \n     a city that not only includes a major port, but is named \n     after it.\n       There are legitimate points to debate about this bill, and \n     the Senate has two days to debate them.\n       Let's just hope Congress isn't still debating them next \n     year, which would make it six years after action should have \n     happened.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 12, 2006]\n\n                               Safe Ports\n\n       The brief session of Congress that just convened is \n     distinguished in part for what is absent from its agenda--\n     immigration and lobbying reform, for example. A notable \n     exception, though, is a serious bill that has just. emerged \n     from the Senate Commerce, Finance and Homeland Security \n     committees: the Port Security Improvement Act of 2006.\n       The bill contains several common-sense proposals It \n     requires the Department of Homeland Security to develop a \n     strategy to rapidly resume trade after an incident at one of \n     the nation's ports, in order to limit economic slowdown. It \n     codifies a number of good programs in law, including the \n     Container Security Initiative, which, if it operates \n     properly, will target suspect cargo for inspection in foreign \n     ports before it gets close to the United States. And it \n     establishes deadlines for Homeland Security to complete \n     critical infrastructure projects--including installing \n     radiation portal monitors in the nation's 22 biggest ports by \n     the end of next year.\n       Two things distinguish this moderate legislation from the \n     irresponsible rhetoric on port security that has marred \n     debates on the subject for years. First, it does not call for \n     100 percent of containers arriving at U.S. ports to be \n     individually inspected for all dangerous materials. The \n     ``inspect all containers'' mantra is a red herring that \n     exploits Americans'' fears about what might slip through in \n     order to score political points, ignoring the fact that there \n     are much more cost- and time-effective ways of keeping \n     dangerous cargo out of the country.\n       To her credit, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), one of the \n     bill's key sponsors, recognizes that the tithe and money it \n     would take to inspect all 11 million containers that come \n     into the country every year would be prohibitive with the \n     technology available today, and she has committed to vote \n     against it if such a provision is added. Instead, the bill \n     calls for a pilot program in which the feasibility of \n     individually inspecting all containers leaving three overseas \n     ports will be gauged, which should test promising next-\n     generation technologies without significantly slowing the \n     pace of trade to the United States.\n       Second, while providing five years of steady funding for \n     port security projects, the bill does not dedicate money for \n     port security in perpetuity. The initial costs of making \n     essential improvements such as buying radiation detectors, \n     putting up fencing around ports and coordinating inspection \n     procedures with ports overseas will require a fair amount of \n     steady start-up cash. But a half-decade of grants for \n     improving port security ought to be enough. After that, port \n     security should have to compete for federal money with other \n     worthy projects.\n       With those sensible checks in place, the Senate should pass \n     this bill.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, in 1 last minute on this day, I want to \npause to pay tribute to a great Georgian and a great American, an \nindividual we all lost last Friday morning in Statesboro, GA.\n  On Friday morning of last week, 80-year-old Erskine Russell, former \nassistant head coach at the University of Georgia and later head coach \nat Georgia Southern University, died of a stroke leaving the 7-11 near \nhis home on the way to his beloved Snooky's Restaurant in Statesboro, \nGA. Erskine Russell was a football coach, but he was far more than a \nfootball coach. He changed the lives of countless young men in Georgia \nand changed the attitude of the people of our State about higher \neducation.\n  Erskine Russell was a man who led the University of Georgia and its \ndefense in 1980 to the national championship. Then, a few years later, \nhe got the opportunity at a fledgling Georgia college--Georgia \nSouthern--to establish a football team. He went there and went to the \nlocal sporting goods store and bought a football. He took a drainage \nditch that ran by the field and named it the ``wonderful, beautiful \nEagle Creek,'' and slowly but surely he recruited young men to come to \nGeorgia Southern to play football.\n  Within a few years, Georgia Southern went from just having a program \nto being a national champion. And he repeated that national \nchampionship again. But more importantly, all through his life, Erskine \nRussell did what only he could do: he led by example, not by lecture, \nwhat was right about America, what was right about living by the rules, \nwhat was right about playing by the rules, and what was right about \nmoral character.\n  Two thousand people appeared at Paulson Stadium last Sunday to pay \ntheir last respects to Erskine Russell--a man who will be missed not \njust for a short period of time but for the lifetime of all those whose \nlives he touched.\n  In conclusion, talking about the lives he touched, when my son Kevin \nwas in the 11th grade at Walton High School in Marietta, GA, he was \ntragically injured in an automobile accident. He was a junior football \nplayer there. Erk Russell took the time to write him a personal note \nwhen it was questionable as to whether he might ever play football \nagain or even walk normally again. It was Erk Russell's inspiration and \nhis caring, his challenging someone to overcome adversity, that led to \nKevin's complete recovery and a year later his competition on the \nfootball field once again.\n  That is just one vignette. It is just one cameo in a lifetime of \nservice to young people.\n  I pay tribute tonight to Erk Russell, to his family, and to all those \nwho knew him, all those who loved him, and to all of us who will always \ntreasure the fact that he was our friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/12/senate-section/article/S9354-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S9354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr12se06-170]                         \n\n\n\n \n                 TRIBUTE TO MR. MORTON J. HOLBROOK, JR.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndistinguished Kentuckian, Mr. Morton J. Holbrook, Jr., for his \ndedicated service to the Commonwealth and his commitment to the \npractice of law and higher education.\n  Last month, Mr. Holbrook, a resident of Owensboro, passed away. He \nwas a pre-eminent attorney in Kentucky and will be remembered for the \npermanent impression he left on Kentucky's legal system. He helped \nmodernize the courts' rules of procedure and was instrumental in \npushing for sweeping changes to the State's judicial system.\n  On August 30, 2006, the Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer published an \neditorial highlighting Mr. Holbrook's legal brilliance, his \ncontributions to the judicial system, and his duty to public service. I \nask unanimous consent that the full editorial be printed in the \nCongressional Record and that the entire Senate join me in paying \nrespect to this beloved Kentuckian.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer, Aug. 30, 2006]\n\n                 State Better Place Because of Holbrook\n\n       Because Morton Holbrook Jr.'s accomplishments were so many, \n     his love for his community so strong, his quest for knowledge \n     so persistent and his zest for life so complete, penning a \n     tribute to his life invites inadequacy.\n       Holbrook, who died Friday at the age of 91, was a Daviess \n     County icon who mixed a legal career as a Harvard-trained \n     lawyer with a lifetime of public service, gaining fame in \n     both arenas. Twice his leadership helped completely change \n     the face of Kentucky's legal system. Closer to home, there \n     might not be an Owensboro Community & Technical College \n     without his point work in the 1980s.\n       Whenever and wherever Holbrook decided to take a stand, he \n     usually became an irresistible force for progress and change. \n     Slight of build and not tall, Holbrook was nevertheless \n     formidable, thanks to his agile mind, gifted and eloquent \n     speaking ability and compelling personality.\n       For 56 years Holbrook practiced law and would have been \n     admired for his legal abilities alone. One colleague called \n     him the greatest attorney he ever knew. But Holbrook strayed \n     far beyond private practice, to Kentucky's lasting benefit. \n     In 1948 he was appointed to a state judicial committee that \n     totally revised the state courts' rules of procedure. Two and \n     a half decades later he helped push through an in-toto reform \n     of Kentucky's judicial system, which required changing the \n     state Constitution.\n       Holbrook's other passion was higher education. He was a \n     member of the Kentucky Council on Higher Education for 10 \n     years. OCTC can trace its origins to his involvement in the \n     early 1980s.\n       Holbrook received many awards and recognitions through the \n     years. Perhaps the most fitting came on his 90th birthday in \n     September 2004 when Daviess Fiscal Court named the county's \n     judicial center in his honor--the Morton J. Holbrook Jr. \n     Judicial Center.\n       Morton Holbrook--a delight and truly one of a kind--will be \n     deeply missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/12/senate-section/article/S9354-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9354-S9355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S9354-S9355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr12se06-171]                         \n\n\n\n \n                     REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to remember the horrifying \nterrorist attacks that took away so many innocent lives 5 years ago.\n  As a rule, tragedies of the magnitude we saw on 9/11 do not have \nsilver linings. On that day, we were left only with an aching sense of \nloss, a sadness that seemed endless, and a bitter rage toward those who \nhad brought chaos to our doorstep.\n  And yet it is undeniable that amidst one of the worst moments in our \nhistory, an ordinary goodness emerged in America. You could see it in \nthe rescue workers and firefighters who rushed toward the rubble, in \nthe scores of young people who signed up to serve their country, and in \nthe quiet candlelight vigils held by millions of people for those they \nhad never met and never would.\n  In our politics, too, there was a brief moment where it seemed as \nthough the crass partisanship of the nineties would give way to a unity \nof purpose among Republicans and Democrats that would refocus our \nefforts on attacking the terrorists, not each other. We saw this in the \nimmediate support given to President Bush, in the near unanimous vote \nto go after the Taliban and al-Qaida in Afghanistan, and in the \nformation of an independent, bipartisan commission that would tell us \nhow and where to strengthen our homeland security.\n  Five years after 9/11, the days of that unity are long gone. In the \nlast two elections, the Republican Party has used national security as \na political weapon to attack and beat opponents, while the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission float further and further from \nthe front pages. Now, as we approach another election season, the party \nin power has announced again that it intends to ``run on'' the issue of \nnational security, with some going so far as to say that the terrorists \nare just waiting for Democrats to take over so that they can attack.\n  I realize that in this day and age, it is naive to think that \npolitics would stop at the water's edge. But I refuse to believe that \nwe cannot find the will or the resources to implement a series of \nrecommendations that an independent panel of Democrats and Republicans \nagree would keep our country safer from terrorist attack.\n  In a report card delivered last year by the 9/11 Commission, the \ncountry's security efforts received mediocre to failing grades--17 Ds \nand Fs in 41 areas of homeland security.\n  To this day, our first responders still do not have the \ncommunications equipment they need to coordinate a rescue in the event \nof an attack. We still inspect only 5 percent of the 9,000,000 \ncontainers that enter this country every year. We are still spending \nonly 2 percent of what we need to secure our railroads and subways, and \nnot nearly enough on baggage and cargo screening at our airports. We \nstill have only\n\n[[Page S9355]]\n\n10,000 border patrol agents to guard 8,000 miles of land borders, and \nonly 1 agent to guard every 3 miles of border with Canada. And we are \nleaving some of America's most vulnerable targets--including chemical \nplants with toxic substances that could kill millions--with the most \nminimal security.\n  If on the day after 9/11 you had told anyone in America that these \ngaps in our security would still exist 5 years later, they might have \nthought you were crazy. And yet since then attempt after attempt to \ncorrect these problems--from efforts to fully fund rail, transit, and \nport security to the legislation I have introduced to protect chemical \nplants--have been rebuffed by the administration and the Republican-\ncontrolled Congress.\n  This cannot go on. National security cannot be something we only \ndiscuss on 9/11 or when terrorists try to blow up planes over the \nAtlantic or when it suits our political interests on election day. It \nis an every day challenge, and it will take Americans of every \npolitical persuasion to meet it.\n  Like most Americans, the effect of September 11 felt profoundly \npersonal to me. It wasn't just the magnitude of the destruction that \naffected me or the memories of the 5 years I had spent in New York, but \nthe intimacy of imagining those ordinary acts which 9/11's victims must \nhave performed in the hours before they were killed, the daily routines \nthat constitute life in our modern world--boarding a plane, grabbing \ncoffee and the morning paper at a newsstand, making small talk on the \nelevator.\n  For so long, these acts represented the concrete expression of our \nbelief that if we just exercised, wore seatbelts, and avoided needless \nrisks, our safety was assured, our families protected. Certainly, the \nprospect of mass violence on American soil seemed remote.\n  Five years later, we know that world is gone--that we must better \nunderstand our fragility and better secure ourselves from those who \nhave the will and the way to do us harm. This means a change in \npriorities, yes, but it also means a change in our politics--a \nwillingness to put aside the petty, if just for a moment, so that we \nmay rise together to meet one of the greatest challenges of our time. \nHistory has shown this will not be easy, but if the ordinary goodness \nthat emerged from that rubble 5 years ago is any indication, I still \nbelieve it is imminently possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/12/senate-section/article/S9355-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9355-S9357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S9355-S9357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr12se06-172]                         \n\n\n\n \n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                   Sergeant Lonnie Calvin Allen, Jr.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.

According to his family, he was expected to \nwrap up his Iraq tour in July and wanted to enter law enforcement as a \ncareer.\n  While serving with the 2nd Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment, 10th \nMountain Division in Baghdad, Iraq, Sergeant Allen was killed when an \nimprovised explosive device detonated near his military vehicle on May \n18, 2006.\n  Sergeant Allen is survived by his wife, Birgit, who lives in \nBellevue, NE; his parents, Lonnie and Sallie Allen, also of Bellevue; \nand his brother, Nuru Allen, of St. Louis, MO.\n  My prayers go out to the family and friends of Sergeant Allen as they \nface this difficult tragedy.

Following his service, Lieutenant Avery dreamed of helping war \norphans.\n  While serving with the 101st Airborne Division stationed south of \nBaghdad, Lieutenant Avery and two fellow soldiers were killed when a \nroadside bomb exploded on February 1, 2006.\n  Lieutenant Avery is survived by his wife, Kayla, who lives in \nClarksville, TN.

His deployment was to last 7 months, and the family hoped to \nsee him home safe around mid-September. At the time of his death, Lance \nCorporal Codner was one among a group of marines traveling in an \narmored personnel carrier conducting security and stability operations \nin Anbar province, Iraq.\n  Lance Corporal Codner was liked by all who knew him; he was involved \nin his church and in his community, and he was a selfless part of the \nmilitary who knew the worth of life. Codner's family remembers him \nsaying, ``Freedom isn't free.''\n  The loss of this outstanding marine is felt by all Nebraskans, but \nhis example will remain as an inspiration for his survivors, a devoted \nfriend, fiancee, son, and grandson, and we extend our thoughts and \nprayers to them in condolence.\n\n\n             Army National Guard Sergeant Germaine L. Debro\n\n  Mr. President, today I honor Nebraska Army National Guard SGT \nGermaine L. Debro of Omaha, NE.\n  Sergeant Debro was a loyal son, brother, friend, and soldier. \nSelflessly placing his friends and their families before his own life, \nhe volunteered for his last assignment to Iraq so others could stay \nhome with their loved ones. ``He put his friends and loyalty first. He \ncouldn't have lived with himself if one of his friends with kids went \nover there and died. My brother is a better man than me,'' said \nSergeant Debro's brother, Alvin Debro, Jr.\n  Sergeant Debro was born into the military, as his father, Alvin Debro \nSr., served in the Air Force. He first attended Omaha Benson High \nSchool; then in 1991, he graduated from high school in Arkansas, where \nhe played football.

He always wanted to serve his country,'' said Mrs. \nWallace.\n  While serving with the 42nd Field Artillery based at Fort Hood, TX, \nSergeant First Class Wallace was killed when a roadside bomb hit his \nhumvee in Taji, Iraq, on June 27, 2006. He had served several \nassignments abroad, including locations in the Middle East, but this \nwas his first tour of duty in Iraq.\n  In addition to his wife, Sergeant First Class Wallace is survived by \nhis 2-year-old daughter, Raven; his parents, James Jr. and Marry \nWallace, of Winnsboro, LA; his twin brother, Jerry Wallace, and several \nother brothers and sisters, also of Winnsboro.\n  I know I join all Nebraskans in grieving the loss of Sergeant First \nClass Wallace. He will be remembered for the selfless hero he was and \nfor being a devoted and compassionate husband, son, and brother. \nSergeant First Class Wallace's family and friends remain in our \nthoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                      Lance Corporal Brent Zoucha\n\n  Mr. President, today I honor LCpl Brent Zoucha of Clarks, NE.\n  Being a dedicated athlete at High Plains Community School, Zoucha had \nalready attained much of what he needed to be a good marine: \ncommitment. Knowing he wanted to serve, Zoucha, 19, enlisted in the \nMarines while still in high school.\n  Serving with the 1st Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine \nDivision, I Marine Expeditionary Force, in Twentynine Palms, CA, \nCorporal Zoucha passed away on June 9, 2006, due to injuries sustained \nin an explosion while conducting combat operations in Al Anbar, Iraq. \n``He died doing what he wanted to do: fighting for his country,'' said \nfriend David Beck.\n  Corporal Zoucha is survived by his mother, Rita Zoucha, of Clarks, \nNE; his sister, Sherri Krueger, of Duncan, NE; and two brothers, \nDominic Zoucha of Clarks, NE, and Corporal Dyrek Zoucha, currently \nserving in Iraq.\n  All Americans admire the dedication LCpl Brent Zoucha exhibited as he \ndefined what a true soldier should be. The family and friends of \nCorporal Zoucha are in our thoughts and prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/12/senate-section/article/S9357-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9357-S9358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S9357-S9358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr12se06-173]                         \n\n\n\n \n                         DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to give my support to the \n2007 Defense appropriations bill which passed the Senate last week by a \nunanimous vote of 98 to 0. The bill provides $469.7 billion in \ndiscretionary spending authority for the Department of Defense and will \nsupply critical funding to many Connecticut defense companies that \nprovide our Nation's military with the cutting edge technology, \nweaponry, and equipment it needs.\n  It includes $2.5 billion for the construction of another Virginia \nclass submarine, which will be built at Connecticut's submarine base in \nNew London. It also includes $54 million for submarine research. This \nfunding will support the significant work of our submarine designers \nand engineers in New London and will enable important cost-cutting \nimprovements to the Virginia class. Eight million dollars of that \nfunding is targeted for advanced submarine research, which will allow \nour designers and engineers in New London to begin the early steps of \ndesigning a new class of nuclear attack submarines. In aircraft \nprocurement, the bill contains funding for 12 additional Black Hawk \nhelicopters for a total of 94 aircraft and 12 C-17 transport aircraft, \nalso produced in Connecticut. Finally, I am particularly heartened by \nthe inclusion of funding for several of our smaller defense companies \nand contractors in Connecticut, which provide our troops with \nsophisticated technological support. Fuel cell development, sonar \ntechnology, clotting agents for troops wounded in battle, mobile \nmilitary health units, and laser machine tool systems are all products \nof the high-tech defense industry in Connecticut, and I am proud that I \nwas able to secure funding for this burgeoning sector of my State's \neconomy.\n  There were several important amendments proposed to the Defense \nappropriations bill. Senator Kennedy offered an amendment that would \nhave required the Pentagon to provide information about whether a civil \nwar has developed in Iraq as part of the Defense Department's already \nmandated quarterly reports. Senator Menendez's proposed amendment \nprohibited the use of funds for a public relations program designed to \nmonitor news media in the United States and the Middle East to create a \ndatabase of news stories to promote positive coverage of the Iraq war. \nBoth of these amendments were prevented from being considered \nexplicitly by procedural votes on the Senate floor. If I had voted on \nthose motions, I would have supported both amendments, which would have \nmeant voting against both motions to table. Unfortunately, both \namendments were set aside, and my vote would not have changed the \nprocedural outcome in either instance, nor prevented their defeat in a \nparty-line vote.\n  As I have stated earlier, I will be spending much of my time before \nthe\n\n[[Page S9358]]\n\nNovember election in Connecticut. I believe it is important for me to \nspend time with people in Connecticut, listening to their ideas and \nconcerns. These next 2 months will provide me with a good opportunity \nto learn more about their views on how we can move forward to solving \nour Nation's most pressing problems. That being said, I plan to return \nto the Senate for votes when my presence is a deciding factor and \nimportant committee business in which my participation is crucial. The \ntask of representation is truly a two-way street, and I value those \ntimes, such as during campaigns, when citizens and their elected \nrepresentatives can engage in a democratic dialogue. I am looking \nforward to continuing to participate in that process and also \ncontinuing to represent the people of Connecticut in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/12/senate-section/article/S9358-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S9358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr12se06-174]                         \n\n\n\n \n                         HONORING GARY STEVENS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

This summer, Idaho Governor Jim Risch named a \nweek in Gary's honor, to spotlight this accomplished jockey's ties to \nIdaho.\n  On behalf of thousands of Idahoans who are proud of him and his Idaho \nroots, I say congratulations to Gary Stevens for a lifetime of \noutstanding achievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/12/senate-section/article/S9358-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9358-S9359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S9358-S9359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr12se06-175]                         \n\n\n\n \n               LET US LOOK UPON THE OCEAN WITH REVERENCE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, during the August recess, one of my \nconstituents, Michael Mulroy, of Fairhaven, wrote a very thoughtful \narticle that was printed in the New Bedford Standard-Times on August 15 \nin its ``Your View'' feature. Mr. Mulroy's article eloquently describes \nthe restorative and wondrous nature of the ocean and questions the \nwisdom of placing wind farms and other large-scale industrial projects \nat sea. He urges us to ``look upon the ocean with reverence.''\n  As someone who is committed to preserving the natural beauty of \nMassachusetts and its magnificent coastal waters, I was moved by Mr. \nMulroy's inspiring article, and I believe many of our colleagues will \nbe inspired by it as well. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the New Bedford Standard-Times, Aug. 15, 2006]\n\n   ``Your View: Let's Look Upon Ocean With Reverence, Unobstructed''\n\n                          (By Michael Mulroy)\n\n       After years of reading about and listening to the debate \n     over the proposed wind farm off the coast of Cape Cod, I felt \n     compelled to weigh in on the subject after reading David \n     Kibbe's article in The Standard-Times.\n       As a child growing up in one of the tenement neighborhoods \n     in New Bedford, I loved it when my parents would take my \n     sister and me to one of the area beaches for the day. \n     Sometimes we would stop to get ice cream afterwards, or maybe \n     have some clam cakes at one of the small clam shacks that \n     dotted the coast. When it was too cold for swimming, we would \n     still go down to the shore and walk the beach looking for \n     shells or whatever treasure the tide may have washed ashore. \n     In the winter, we would simply take a drive along the \n     seashore and enjoy the scenery. One of the greatest joys for \n     me was looking out at the ocean and being able to see \n     unobstructed to the horizon--there were no tenements or \n     telephone poles or wires or factories to spoil the vista. The \n     ocean was to my mind a blank canvas, I was free to paint my \n     imagination across it, and I dreamed of whaling ships and \n     merchants of days long ago.\n       Later, when I was first married, one of our first \n     apartments was in Fairhaven. I used to ride my daughter \n     around town in a carrier seat on the back of my bicycle. \n     Wherever else we went, we always went down to Fort Phoenix, \n     and out onto the Hurricane Barrier, and looked out upon the \n     ocean. My grandfather was a construction worker who helped \n     build the barrier, and so it made our visits there all the \n     more special.\n       Life being what it is, we could not afford to buy a home in \n     Fairhaven at the time, and so we moved back to New Bedford. \n     As time went by, I was eventually divorced from my first \n     wife. Saddled with debt, I was forced to file for bankruptcy. \n     Through hard work and determination, I was able to restore my \n     credit and eventually bought a fine tenement on the same \n     street where I grew up. I went to the beach, I took drives by \n     the shore, but I also worked; I worked hard.\n       I am now remarried and once again live in Fairhaven. We \n     have easy access to the beach, and I ride my bicycle by the \n     shore. Through all the changes in my life, one thing that has \n     never changed is the ocean. I can still gaze out upon the \n     open sea and look unobstructed to the horizon. I am humbled \n     at the awesome power that lies there. The sheer vastness of \n     the sea amazes me, and I cannot help but think of our great \n     Creator every time I look upon it. Surely this is a holy \n     place! I can imagine how the first people to set eyes upon \n     this wonderful site must have felt, and I feel that as I am \n     able to see what they first saw, I can share their \n     experience.\n       At first I felt guilty for not wanting to see a wind farm \n     off the coast. After all, this would be a great source of \n     energy. Clean, renewable, it might even lessen our dependence \n     on foreign oil, even if it's only a little bit, I would feel \n     patriotic. I felt like one of the NIMBY (not in my backyard) \n     people, but it just didn't feel right. Some people say that \n     the only argument against the project is that some rich folks \n     on Nantucket and Cape Cod don't want to spoil their view. \n     Rep. Bob Koczera calls it ``reasons of aesthetics and really \n     nothing else.'' I've got news for you, Bob, the grandeur of \n     the world's natural wonders are not ``aesthetics!'' \n     Aesthetics are in your living room! That's like calling the \n     Grand Canyon ``just a hole,'' or Mount Everest ``a big hill \n     and really nothing else.''\n       The ocean is our last wild place on this Earth. We are a \n     throwaway society, and we are too lazy, or too cheap, to \n     bother to clean up the messes we have made on land, and so \n     now we are looking to the sea. Rep. Frank Smizik of Brookline \n     states ``We're relying on dirty power plants'' and urges us \n     to ``get away from that.''\n       Well, Frank, why not hold the Bush Administration to their \n     responsibility, and stop letting them relax pollution \n     standards for these filthy polluters? Why not force them to \n     clean up their act? I, for one, am sick to death about \n     hearing these corporations whine about the cost! Too bad! \n     Record profits for Big Oil sound familiar? All the while, the \n     public is being gouged at the gas pump!\n       Why do we have to have this wind farm in the ocean when \n     there are many existing wind farms in areas that are not near \n     the ocean? The answer is simple: It is easier, and cheaper! \n     Cape Wind wants to locate here because they feel this is the \n     best location for them. What is best for an energy \n     corporation is not necessarily what is best for the Earth or \n     for our people. It is time we start to think of ourselves as \n     people of the Earth, and not as people who belong to \n     corporations. It is time we listen to the ancestors of our \n     native peoples. Since time began, they have known that the \n     Earth does not belong to us, we belong to the Earth. We are \n     here as her caretakers. They have been telling us this since \n     the white people first came here. It's time we open our ears, \n     our eyes, and our hearts, and listen.\n       It is time to use self-restraint and set limits for \n     ourselves. We must take responsibility for our actions, and \n     clean up the mess we have made upon our lands, and not expand \n     our careless ways to the sea. Let us look upon the ocean with \n     reverence, and let us see to the horizon, unobstructed, and \n     let it be our inspiration to take back our Earth from \n     unbridled development. Let us say, ``Stop!'' Enough is \n     enough! We have the technology to develop alternative energy \n     sources without this project. This is not a ``do or die'' \n     issue. Why not explore other options? Cape Wind would have us \n     in fear of not supporting them now. Who says they are the \n     only energy development corporation on the horizon? Rep. \n     Matthew Patrick wants to ``let the process go forward, and if \n     Cape Wind survives based on its merits, it should not be \n     subject to the arbitrary whims of the governor.'' If? If it \n     survives? Well what Matthew, pray tell, will befall us if it \n     doesn't survive? Who will pay to dismantle it? Or would you \n     rather it just stay out there, a rusting hulk, as a monument \n     to our failure, until it finally collapses into the sea? If \n     that happened, what then would be the danger to navigation? \n     What would be the environmental impact then? Has anyone \n     thought about this? And what about the diesel fuel stored \n     there for the generators?\n       The sea and its creatures are a precious resource. Today, \n     our fishermen are paying the price for the sins of our \n     fathers. Exploitation of fish stocks since pre-Colonial times \n     has left them depleted to the point of disaster. We cannot \n     think that human invasion of this delicate environment will \n     have little or no impact. I cannot help but think that if we \n     allow this wind farm, that they will want to expand in the \n     future, or that others will want to follow. Will we ask \n     our children to pay forever for our sins?\n       I am not rich, but this is not about being rich. It is \n     about a deep respect and reverence for our earth, and yes, it \n     is about my vista. When I look out upon the ocean, it is, to \n     me, as if I am looking upon the face of God, so I would say \n     to you: Yes, I would be happy to\n\n[[Page S9359]]\n\n     have a wind farm in my backyard, as long as it stays where it \n     belongs, on land, and not in the middle of one of the most \n     beautiful places on earth, the ocean.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/12/senate-section/article/S9359-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S9359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr12se06-176]                         \n\n\n\n \n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 RAPID CITY WEED AND SEED ORGANIZATION\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the hard \nwork and amazing results of the Weed and Seed organization of Rapid \nCity, SD.\n  The Rapid City group will cease operations later this month after \nnearly a decade of tireless efforts to rehabilitate a significant \nportion of the residential and business area in the community.\n  In partnership with organizations that included the Rapid City Police \nDepartment, the Center for Restorative Justice, Volunteers of America, \nthe Project Safe Neighborhood/Gunwise Program, and Good Housekeeping, \ndozens of individuals came together to address neighborhood crime, \nabuse, housing, and aesthetic issues.\n  Primarily focused on the East North and East Boulevard neighborhoods, \nthe Rapid City Weed and Seed organization worked with the Rapid City \nPolice Department on a zero-tolerance policy with an aggressive police \npresence in areas that were beset with crime, homelessness, and urban \nblight issues.\n  The group worked with Rapid City leaders to aggressively enforce city \ncodes involving housing. Vacated and rundown homes and businesses were \ntorn down and replaced with new and thriving businesses and new homes. \nOther businesses, homes, and apartment complexes were expanded and \nrenovated during this timeframe. Efforts to revitalize Roosevelt Park \nresulted in the construction of a new ice arena and indoor swimming \npool, as part of the city's 2012 economic development program. A \nbusiness association was formed to bring together local business owners \nto discuss relevant issues of importance. The Weed and Seed \norganization also developed an adopt-a-creek program with 21 sections \nof Rapid Creek adopted by local companies, organizations, and families. \nThe first major cleanup of Rapid Creek since the tragic 1972 flood \nresulted in the collection of 18 tons of trash, including debris from \nthe 1972 flood event.\n  Four townhall meetings were conducted with local residents, and \nannual picnics were sponsored to develop a sense of camaraderie and \nconnection between neighbors.\n  As a result of these efforts, the East North and East Boulevard areas \nhave once again become a source of pride for the community. This sense \nof pride is now reflected in the residents and businesses located in \nthe area. These results are due in large part to the collective work of \nthe Rapid City Weed and Seed organization and the partnerships that \nwere developed with city officials, law enforcement agencies, and the \nlocal businesses.\n  Funded through a 5-year Weed and Seed grant of $1.025 million, the \nlocal organization will cease operations later this month. I wish to \nrecognize the vision and hard-working efforts of the dozens of Rapid \nCity citizens and officials who have provided tireless efforts to \nrehabilitate and renovate a key part of the community.\n  I wish to recognize the help of executive director Patricia Pummel \nand board members Wayne Asscherick, Phyllis Boernke, Dave Bussard, Jim \nCastleberry, Patrick Clinch, Cynthia Clinch, Linda M. Colhoff, Richard \nCooper, Darcy Dennison, Lee Dennison, Ken Edel, Fred Eisenbraun, Lawren \nErickson, Dan Island, Adeline Kalmbeck, Jim Kinyon, Craig Kirsch, \nEileen Leir, Burt Lang, Carol Lang, State legislator Alice McCoy, Jim \nMcCoy, Dave Morgan, Lou Morgan, Sharon Oney, Kenneth Palmer, Gloria \nPluimer, Alys Ratigan, Kerri Severson, Mickey Snook, Roberta Stevens, \nBetty Strobel, Raymond Summers, Pat Trumble, Holli Vanderbeek, Jerry \nWalenta, Lieutenant David Walton, Les Wermers, Dexter Wittman, Rapid \nCity mayor Jim Shaw, former mayor Jerry Munson, and Connie Ewing.\n  Thanks to the efforts of these individuals, other concerned and \ncommitted citizens, and officials in Rapid City, the East North and \nEast Boulevard areas of Rapid City have been effectively rehabilitated. \nThe efforts of this organization may serve as a model for other Weed \nand Seed organizations in the country. Although ceasing operations, the \nvision and tireless efforts of individuals in the Rapid City Weed and \nSeed organization will be maintained. I commend the energetic and \ninnovative work of the Rapid City Weed and Seed organization and the \nindividuals involved in their great work over the past several \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/12/senate-section/article/S9359-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S9359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr12se06-177]                         \n\n\n\n \n         CENTENNIAL OF THE FOUNDING OF STRATFORD, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

A latecomer in \ninclusion into Brown County, Stratford sprung up rapidly in just weeks.\n  Stratford was founded 100 years ago on the Minneapolis and St. Louis \nrailways. Stratford was a convenient commuter system to many of its \nneighboring cities at the time. In just 5 years, Stratford reached its \npeak population of 600.\n  Stratford is one of South Dakota's classic small towns. It has been \nthe home of industry and farm-related businesses and has been served by \na volunteer fire department since 1911. The Baribeau Honey Company, \nwhich processes about a million pounds of honey annually, was \nestablished in 1955 and is still a booming business. The post office \nand BS Bar and Grill are open to this day.\n  A hundred years after its founding, Stratford continues to be a vital \ncommunity and a great asset to South Dakota.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nsunset the sustainable growth rate formula as of January 1, 2009, in \norder to expedite Congressional action in establishing a new physician \npayment system that would appropriately reimburse physicians by keeping \npace with increases in medical practice costs and providing stable, \npositive Medicare updates; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the ``Fix and \nImprove Reimbursement (FAIR) for Physicians Act of 2006'' today with \nthe support of the Michigan State Medical Society and the Michigan \nOsteopathic Association.\n  Over 20,000 M.D.'s and D.O.'s in Michigan provide more than 1.4 \nmillion seniors and people with disabilities with high-quality medical \nservices under the Medicare program. Our Michigan families have \nreceived fantastic care, from fantastic doctors.\n  But will they continue to? Not unless we do something about the \npayment system used to reimburse physicians for Medicare services. \nBeginning January 1, 2007, the Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) \nformula will cut payments to physicians and health care professionals \nby 5.1 percent. What does that mean in dollar terms? Medicare payments \nin Michigan alone will be cut by $137 million in 2007; the average cut \nfor a physician in Michigan would be $34,000 per year.\n  That doesn't make any sense. Medical costs are going up. How can \ndoctors provide the same high-quality care when costs are going up and \ntheir payments are going down?\n  It makes even less sense when you realize physicians and other health \ncare professionals have been struggling with this payment system for \nyears. The SGR formula resulted in significant payment cuts in 2002, \nand would have resulted in payment cuts in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 \nhad Congress not intervened.\n  And it won't stop with the cut in 2007. According to the Medicare \nPayment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) and the Board of Trustees of the \nFederal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary \nMedical Insurance Trust Fund, the Medicare SGR formula will result in \nsubstantial payment cuts to physicians and health care professionals \nthrough at least 2015.\n  The cuts are scheduled to total 40 percent by 2015, costing Michigan \ndoctors in excess of $8 billion between 2007 and 2015.\n  Can doctors absorb these kinds of cuts and continue to serve all \nMedicare beneficiaries with high-quality care? Absolutely not. The cuts \nwould be particularly devastating for primary care doctors, the very \ndoctors that, according to MedPAC, many Medicare beneficiaries rely on \nfor important health care management. MedPAC states in their March 2006 \nreport that they ``are concerned that such consecutive annual cuts \nwould threaten access to physician care services over time, \nparticularly primary care services.'' They go on to say that ``payment \npolicies that may discourage medical students and residents from \nbecoming primary care physicians raise particular concern''.\n  A recent survey conducted by the AMA suggests that if the scheduled \ncuts go into effect, 45 percent of doctors will decrease the number of \nMedicare patients they accept--and this at a time that the Medicare \npopulation is burgeoning! Further, 50 percent of doctors will defer \npurchase of health information technology, 37 percent of doctors \npracticing in rural communities will be forced to discontinue rural \noutreach services, and 43 percent of physicians will decrease the \nnumber of new TRICARE patients they suggest.\n  This is not a new issue. MedPAC considers the Medicare SGR formula a \nflawed, inequitable mechanism for controlling the volume of services \nand first recommended repeal of the Medicare SGR formula in 2001. Since \nthen they have consistently recommended repealing the formula.\n  But what has Congress done? Have we repealed the SGR? No. Instead, \neach year since 2003 Congress has acted to override the formula \ntemporarily. While these actions have prevented cuts since 2002, nobody \ncan believe this is a good way of going about business. Congress tends \nto act very late in the year--or AFTER the cuts have actually gone into \neffect--which results in instability and unpredictability for \nphysicians, health care professionals, seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  Further, annual Congressional actions to override SGR don't solve the \nlong-term problem as the formula extracts the added spending in future \nyears by imposing even more drastic cuts.\n  We know what we need to do. A Medicare physician payment system that \nwill provide stable, positive payment updates is critical to preserve \nMedicare beneficiaries' access to high-quality care and allow doctors \nto invest in health information technology and quality improvement \nprograms.\n  While a new system is being developed, we know we need to adopt \nMedPAC's recommendation to update payments for physicians' services \nunder the Medicare program by the projected change in input prices less \nMedPAC's expectation for productivity growth. The ``Preserving Patient \nAccess to Physicians Act of 2005'', which I introduced last year with \nSenator Kyl, would do just that. It would have provided physicians with \na 2.7 percent update in 2006 and would provide a 2.8 percent update in \n2007.\n  When I introduced that legislation I said that it was just the \nbeginning. I said that our bill was necessary to provide updates for a \ncouple of years but that we cannot continue to use stop-gap measures, \nand must replace the SGR with a payment system that actually makes \nsense and reflects the costs of providing physician care to Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  This bill--the ``Fix and Improve Reimbursement (FAIR) for Physicians \nAct of 2006''--takes the next step. The purpose of the ``FAIR for \nPhysicians Act'' is to sunset the Medicare sustainable growth rate \nformula in order to expedite Congressional action in establishing a new \nphysician payment system under the Medicare program that would \nappropriately reimburse physicians by keeping pace with increases in \nmedical practice costs and providing stable, positive Medicare updates.\n  The ``Fair for Physicians Act'' would repeal the SGR formula as of \nJanuary 1, 2009. I continue to believe that we must adopt MedPAC's \nrecommendation for updates in 2007 and 2008 to give seniors access to \nhigh-quality care while giving Congress time to develop an alternative \npayment system.\n  To help Congress with developing the new payment system, the ``Fair \nfor Physicians Act'' establishes a new, 17 member ``Physician Payment \nUpdate Commission'', the ``Physician Commission''. The members of the \nPhysician Commission will include members with a wide variety of \nexpertise in the delivery and financing of health care, but--and I \nbelieve this is critical--individuals who are physicians and other \nhealth professionals shall constitute a\n\n[[Page S9364]]\n\nmajority of the membership of the Commission.\n  The new Physician Commission will study all matters relating to \npayment rates under the Medicare physician fee schedule, and develop \nrecommendations on the establishment of a new system that would \nappropriately reimburse physicians by keeping pace with increases in \nmedical practice costs.\n  We need to do this right, but we also need to get it done soon. Our \nphysicians and health care professionals, and our Medicare \nbeneficiaries, have been dealing with an unworkable, unsustainable \nsystem for too long.\n  Therefore, the Physician Commission must report to the appropriate \nCongressional Committees and MedPAC by December 1, 2007. MedPAC then \nhas a month to review the recommendations of the Physician Commission \nand submit a report to the appropriate Committees. MedPAC's report must \ninclude a review of the recommendations, including the reasons for \ntheir support if they support their recommendations and, if they do not \nsupport the recommendations, the reasons for that, and their own \nrecommendations.\n  I know we need to get this done by January 1, 2009 and I know we can \nget this done by January 1, 2009. My bill would repeal the SGR formula \nas of that date, and establish a new Commission to develop a new \npayment system by that time, to ensure that our Nation's 42 million \nMedicare beneficiaries continue to have access to high quality \nphysician care.\n  In the meantime, we must provide updates based on MedPAC's \nrecommendations.\n  The Medicare program is one of the most successful federal programs \nof all time. It has lifted countless seniors out of poverty, and it has \nensured access to necessary, affordable, quality medical care for our \nmost vulnerable citizens for the last 40 years.\n  We can--and must--fix the physician payment formula to maintain \nMedicare's record of success in providing access to high-quality \nMedicare services for all of our seniors and people with disabilities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 3889. A bill to enhance housing and emergency assistance to \nvictims of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma of 2005, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the gulf coast \nHousing Accessibility Act to address some of the challenges facing \nsurvivors of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita a year after the hurricanes \nstruck the gulf coast. Two weeks ago, we commemorated the anniversary \nof Hurricane Katrina and honored those who lost their lives and those \nwho lost their livelihoods last year. A year later, the people of New \nOrleans and the gulf coast continue to deal with an unfortunate \nreality--that in a lot of neighborhoods, it looks like the hurricanes \nhit a week ago, not a year ago.\n  Over the past year, I have heard from a number of Wisconsinites upset \nwith the Federal Government's response to Katrina. They have made \npowerful pleas to not forget about the people who lost their homes, \ntheir communities and their way of life.\n  In July, I visited some neighborhoods in the New Orleans area that \nwere ravaged by Hurricane Katrina. The painful realities about life \nthere were everywhere--abandoned businesses, and homes and \nneighborhoods that were totally destroyed by the hurricane and its \naftermath. The challenge of rebuilding is enormous. But what's even \ntougher is trying to rebuild in a way that helps everyone come back, \nnot just people with access to more resources and different options. It \nis the responsibility of all levels of government to help those who \nwant to come back regardless of their income level. We must ensure that \nthe rebuilt gulf coast reflects the same cultural diversity that made \nit an American gem before the hurricanes struck. This legislation seeks \nto meet some of that responsibility by providing low income individuals \nand families with immediate and long term housing assistance as they \nrebuild their lives and move back to the gulf coast.\n  There are so many ways that gulf coast communities still need help--\ncreating jobs, rebuilding the school systems, and gutting damaged homes \nso that they can be rebuilt. And, when you see those blocks and blocks \nof neighborhoods that were destroyed--with no sign of reconstruction--\nit's clear just how much help the people of New Orleans and the gulf \ncoast need to find affordable housing.\n  Housing has to be affordable so that the gulf coast can get back to \nwork. So many of the people who are the lifeblood of the tourism \nindustry--like hotel and restaurant workers--want to call New Orleans \nhome again, but they can't move back if they can't afford any place to \nlive.\n  It's a testament to the strength of these communities that so many \npeople want to come back, at every income level. You can't do that if \nyou were working a minimum wage job that doesn't exist anymore, and you \nwere renting an apartment that ended up engulfed in flood water.\n  There are a lot of barriers to moving back for homeowners, but it's \nalso tough for gulf coast citizens who were renting when the hurricane \nhit. In the year since the hurricane struck, rents in the gulf coast \nregion have skyrocketed, which makes it even more difficult for low \nincome renters to return to their homes. With a significant percentage \nof renters in the New Orleans area before Katrina, we need to ensure \nthat the housing assistance in the gulf coast is aimed at helping \nrenters, as well as homeowners, rebuild their lives.\n  We've got to do something to help displaced residents--particularly \nlow-income individuals--who want to move back to New Orleans. I have \nput together a few different ideas into one bill, building on some \nreally good work on housing issues by some of my colleagues in the \nSenate. This bill doesn't tackle every problem, but it will help \naddress some of the tough housing issues facing New Orleans and the \ngulf coast. It includes housing vouchers to help make rents affordable \nfor the lowest income people and families. It also makes housing like \nthe Katrina cottages--which are more like homes, and less like \ntrailers--more available to those who want them. There have been a lot \nof problems with the FEMA trailers, so it's important to give people \nthe option of living in a more permanent home. And finally it allows \nHUD to handle temporary rental assistance programs from here on out, \ninstead of FEMA, which isn't equipped to handle housing issues like \nthese for the long haul.\n  Not only does this legislation address the needs of current Katrina \nsurvivors, but the changes it makes to the Stafford Act to allow FEMA \nto provide permanent and semi-permanent housing, as well as allowing \nHUD to provide temporary housing assistance instead of FEMA, apply to \nfuture disasters also. The importance of this cannot be stressed \nenough--we in government must learn from our past mistakes and work to \nprevent such a horrible government response to future disasters.\n  A year after Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita, there is so much \nthat we can still do--and that Congress can do--to help the gulf coast \nrecover. We need to have serious conversations about the persistent \npoverty that still exists in the gulf coast and around our nation, for \nthis poverty magnified the disaster of Hurricane Katrina. We need to \ndevelop solutions to address this poverty that exists in cities and \nrural communities throughout our country. We need to work to ensure the \nlevees are built correctly. We need to better protect the diminishing \nwetlands of the gulf coast. But we also have to focus on the here and \nnow--what people are facing on the gulf coast today. As we look at the \nimages of the hurricanes a year later, and we remember what people went \nthrough, we also have to recognize how far we have to go, and \nrededicate ourselves to helping the people of the gulf coast make it \nhome again.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3889\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Gulf Coast Housing \n     Accessibility Act of 2006''.\n\n[[Page S9365]]\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to enhance and improve the energy security of the \nUnited States, expand economic development, increase agricultural \nincome, and improve environmental quality by reauthorizing and \nimproving the renewable energy systems and energy efficiency \nimprovements program of the Department of Agriculture through fiscal \nyear 2012, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Rural Energy \nfor America Act of 2006. This legislation will strengthen and expand \nthe renewable energy and energy efficiency program established in \nsection 9006 of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 by \nincreasing its overall funding, creating a new rebate) program, \nproviding new grant options for wind energy projects, allowing rural \nschools to qualify for the program and fostering the administration of \ndirect\n\n[[Page S9366]]\n\nloans. I am very pleased to have Senators Lugar, Durbin, Hagel and \nNelson as co-sponsors.\n  The section 9006 Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency \nImprovements program--to be re-named under this legislation as the \nRural Energy for America Program (REAP)--provides farmers, ranchers, \nand rural small businesses with financial support for installing \nrenewable energy systems and making energy efficiency improvements.\n  I authored section 9006 in 2002 as Chair of the Senate Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition and Forestry with the strong support of Senator \nLugar, the Ranking Member at that time and a long-time ally in \nadvocating for renewable energy production. This has proven to be one \nof the most important provisions we included in the 2002 farm bill's \nfirst-ever energy title.\n  During its first three years, the Renewable Energy Systems and Energy \nEfficiency Improvements program has distributed $63.9 million and \ncatalyzed the development of 412 renewable energy and energy efficiency \nprojects in 37 states. The awards have leveraged an additional $699 \nmillion, bringing the total program-related investment in clean energy \nsystems for farms, ranches and rural communities to $763 million. Thus, \nthis program has had remarkable success in stimulating investments that \nincrease reliance on clean, domestic energy systems and enhance energy \nefficiency in our agricultural and rural business sectors.\n  Developing and expanding homegrown renewable energy is a key part of \nour national energy security strategy. Section 9006 provides grant \nsupport for many different forms of renewable energy, including solar, \nwind, biomass, geothermal and renewable hydrogen.\n  Prior to 2003, there were fewer than 30 locally-owned wind farms in \noperation. As a direct result of the section 9006 program, over 80 new \ncommunity wind projects were awarded grants by the end of 2005. When \ncompleted, these projects will have a capacity of over 300 megawatts of \nwind power and provide new income for American farmers and cleaner air \nfor all of us.\n  Section 9006 successfully promotes on-farm anaerobic digesters, which \ncapture and use methane gas from livestock and poultry manure. Before \n2003, there were fewer than 10 digesters in operation in the United \nStates. Under the section 9006 program, 15 new digester projects are \nnow operational and an additional 59 projects are under development. \nThese projects provide new sources of farm income and help farmers deal \nwith manure in a more environmentally sound manner.\n\n  The program also has funded bioenergy production and the adoption of \nenergy efficiency technologies and practices. As a result, 124 million \ngallons of ethanol and biodiesel production capacity are coming online, \nand energy saving improvements have been installed at 160 farms, \nranches and rural small businesses, resulting in a savings of 250 \nbillion BTUs/year and millions of dollars in reduced electricity, \ndiesel fuel, natural gas and propane expense.\n  Together, these renewable energy projects produce 16.9 trillion BTUs/\nyear in the form of fuels, electricity and thermal energy. The \ncombination of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects also \nwill reduce carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere by 4 million \nmetric tons a year, showing that our rural communities can be a part of \nthe solution to global warming.\n  It is clear that the section 9006 program has been extraordinarily \nsuccessful. However, we have only begun to tap into the potential for \nAmerican ingenuity in homegrown clean energy production and energy \nefficiency measures. The demand for rural renewable energy and energy \nefficiency assistance far outpaces the program's resources. Today, the \ndemand is almost triple the available program funding.\n  Our legislation will strengthen and expand the program to help \nagricultural producers and rural small businesses cope with high energy \nprices, move our rural economies forward and protect the environment. \nIn addition to increasing overall program funding, this bill will allow \nrural schools to apply for REAP funding. Schools have been eager to \nparticipate in the section 9006 program since its inception. Allowing \nschools to qualify will help them mitigate high energy costs and help \nteachers educate our youth about the many benefits of energy efficiency \nand clean alternative energy sources.\n  This legislation further promotes wind energy expansion by giving \nfarmers and other eligible developers an additional financing option. \nCurrently, most of the funds granted for wind power projects under \nsection 9006 are used to purchase and install wind turbine systems. \nUnder Federal tax rules, however, grants used for such acquisition and \nconstruction costs have the potential to significantly reduce important \ntax credits for the project.\n  To avoid such counterproductive tax impacts, the legislation \nauthorizes USDA in appropriate circumstances to structure grants as \nproduction incentives instead of equipment purchase or construction \ngrants, thereby reducing the risk of negating the tax credit benefit. \nThe need for such a change was highlighted in a recent report written \nby Berkeley National Lab entitled ``Avoiding the Haircut: Potential \nWays to Enhance the Value of the USDA's Section 9006 Program.''\n  This legislation also includes a new rebate program providing the \nlesser of $10,000 or 50 percent of project costs for energy efficiency \nimprovements and the purchase of renewable energy systems. Similar \nstate-run rebate programs are recognized as effective mechanisms for \npromoting small-scale development projects. This rebate program will \nenable small and medium-sized farmers and rural small businesses to \nobtain rapid and long-lasting relief from high energy prices through a \nsimple and proven mechanism. Grants for this purpose would be limited \nto no more than 20% of the total REAP funding.\n  This bill also urges USDA to initiate the use of direct loans to \ncomplement the REAP program grants, by expressing the sense of the \nSenate that USDA should implement the direct loan provisions of section \n9006. Although the original legislation in section 9006 called for the \nestablishment of a program of ``grants, loans and loan guarantees,'' \nUSDA has not yet established a direct loan program. Our legislation \nurges USDA to move a direct loan initiative forward.\n  The bill also allows USDA to provide grants for feasibility studies. \nFeasibility studies can ensure that projects are thoroughly assessed \nthrough technology and systems' analysis in their early stages, thus \npromoting successful and cost-effective projects. The amount of funds \nfor feasibility studies would be capped to ensure that the majority of \nREAP funding continues to focus on deployment of renewable energy \nsystems and energy efficiency improvements.\n  Farm-based energy initiatives encompass a wide range of proven \ntechnologies to produce or save energy. The unique and successful \nsection 9006 program has been instrumental to adoption of renewable \nenergy and energy efficiency systems in the agricultural and rural \nsmall business sectors. The record to date signals an opportunity for \nvastly expanding these alternative energy and energy efficiency \nbenefits in rural America.\n  We have broad agreement in our country on moving farm-based renewable \nenergy and energy efficiency forward. Let's help do that by updating \nand improving the section 9006--Rural Energy for America Program--for \nthe future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Lautenberg, and \n        Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 3891. A bill to extend the time for filing certain claims under \nthe September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with Senators \nClinton, Lautenberg, and Schumer to introduce the James Zadroga Act. \nThis bicameral and bipartisan legislation would reopen the September 11 \nVictims Compensation Fund, VCF, to provide financial assistance to \nvictims and first responders of the attacks of \n9/11 who became ill, in addition to their respective family members.\n  James Zadroga was a New York Police Department, NYPD, detective and \nNew Jersey resident, who when he died earlier this year was the first \n9/11 responder to have his death directly attributed to exposure to the \ntoxins of\n\n[[Page S9367]]\n\nGround Zero. He became ill just weeks after working at Ground Zero, but \nbecause he retired in 2004, the NYPD determined that his four-year-old \ndaughter Tylerann could only receive a disability pension, instead of \nthe full death benefit to which she should be entitled.\n  That is why in April, I authored a letter with my colleagues Senators \nLautenberg, Clinton, and Schumer that called on New York officials to \nenact legislation that would provide full benefits to Tylerann and \nother beneficiaries like her.\n  In August, New York enacted three new laws, including one that would \nallow those recovery workers who have retired from public service to \nhave their retirement status reclassified as accidental disability if \nthey later become ill due to their efforts at Ground Zero. That action \nby the State of New York is vitally important, because we unfortunately \nknow that Detective Zadroga's death will not be the last to be suffered \nby the brave Americans who rushed to Ground Zero in the hours and days \nafter September 11.\n  As our Nation continues to heal from the wounds inflicted by the 9/11 \nterror attacks, there are many first responders whose wounds have yet \nto heal from the aftermath of that day. We as a nation must care for \nthose who cared for America in its time of need. We cannot let \nbureaucratic red tape stand between those who helped America pick up \nthe pieces and the compensation they deserve.\n  Today, by introducing this legislation we take the next step in \nworking to ensure that the heroes who sacrificed their health--and in \nDetective Zadroga's case, his life--will be justly compensated. I \nbelieve we owe them nothing less.\n  This legislation reopens the fund created to care for the families of \n9/11 victims and for those injured or who became ill as a direct result \nof the attacks. Unfortunately, many who should have received \ncompensation from the VCF never did because their illnesses did not \ndevelop or have become significantly worse since the original filing \ndeadline of December 22, 2003. In other instances, original guidelines \nprohibited the VCF to make awards if injuries were sustained more than \n96 hours after the attacks.\n  Specifically, the ``James Zadroga Act'' would: Reopen September 11 \nVictims Compensation Fund for individuals who became ill or did not \nfile before the original December 22, 2003 deadline;\n  Allow for adjustment of previous awards if the Special Master of the \nfund determines the medical conditions of the claimant warrants an \nadjustment; and\n  Amend eligibility rules so that responders to the 9/11 attacks who \narrived later than the first 96 hours could be eligible if they \nexperienced illness or injury from their work at the site.\n  Congress needs to pass this bill--we need to stand up for these \nAmerican heroes and their families. I urge my colleagues to join with \nus in this important effort by cosponsoring this piece of legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3891\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001 was \n     established to provide compensation to individuals (or \n     relatives of deceased individuals) who were physically \n     injured or killed as a result of the terrorist-related \n     aircraft crashes of September 11, 2001.\n       (2) The deadline for filing claims for compensation under \n     the Victim Compensation Fund was December 22, 2003.\n       (3) Some individuals did not know they were eligible to \n     file claims for compensation or did not know they had \n     suffered physical harm as a result of the terrorist-related \n     aircraft crashes until after the December 22, 2003, deadline.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This chapter may be cited as the ``Faster and Smarter \n     Funding for First Responders Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 1112. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In order to achieve its objective of preventing, \n     minimizing the damage from, and assisting in the recovery \n     from terrorist attacks, the Department of Homeland Security \n     must play a leading role in assisting communities to reach \n     the level of preparedness they need to prevent and respond to \n     a terrorist attack.\n       (2) First responder funding is not reaching the men and \n     women of our Nation's first response teams quickly enough, \n     and sometimes not at all.\n       (3) To reform the current bureaucratic process so that \n     homeland security dollars reach the first responders who need \n     it most, it is necessary to clarify and consolidate the \n     authority and procedures of the Department of Homeland \n     Security that support first responders.\n       (4) Ensuring adequate resources for the new national \n     mission of homeland security, without degrading the ability \n     to address effectively other types of major disasters and \n     emergencies, requires a discrete and separate grant making \n     process for homeland security funds for first response to \n     terrorist acts, on the one hand, and for first responder \n     programs designed to meet pre-September 11 priorities, on the \n     other.\n       (5) While a discrete homeland security grant making process \n     is necessary to ensure proper focus on the unique aspects of \n     terrorism preparedness, it is essential that State and local \n     strategies for utilizing such grants be integrated, to the \n     greatest extent practicable, with existing State and local \n     emergency management plans.\n       (6) Homeland security grants to first responders must be \n     based on the best intelligence concerning the capabilities \n     and intentions of our terrorist enemies, and that \n     intelligence must be used to target resources to the Nation's \n     greatest threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences.\n       (7) The Nation's first response capabilities will be \n     improved by sharing resources, training, planning, personnel, \n     and equipment among neighboring jurisdictions through mutual \n     aid agreements and regional cooperation. Such regional \n     cooperation should be supported, where appropriate, through \n     direct grants from the Department of Homeland Security.\n       (8) An essential prerequisite to achieving the Nation's \n     homeland security objectives for first responders is the \n     establishment of well-defined national goals for terrorism \n     preparedness. These goals should delineate the essential \n     capabilities that every jurisdiction in the United States \n     should possess or to which it should have access.\n       (9) A national determination of essential capabilities is \n     needed to identify levels of State and local government \n     terrorism preparedness, to determine the nature and extent of \n     State and local first responder needs, to identify the human \n     and financial resources required to fulfill them, to direct \n     funding to meet those needs, and to measure preparedness \n     levels on a national scale.\n       (10) To facilitate progress in achieving, maintaining, and \n     enhancing essential capabilities for State and local first \n     responders, the Department of Homeland Security should seek \n     to allocate homeland security funding for first responders to \n     meet nationwide needs.\n       (11) Private sector resources and citizen volunteers can \n     perform critical functions in\n\n[[Page S9375]]\n\n     assisting in preventing and responding to terrorist attacks, \n     and should be integrated into State and local planning \n     efforts to ensure that their capabilities and roles are \n     understood, so as to provide enhanced State and local \n     operational capability and surge capacity.\n       (12) Public-private partnerships, such as the partnerships \n     between the Business Executives for National Security and the \n     States of New Jersey and Georgia, can be useful to identify \n     and coordinate private sector support for State and local \n     first responders. Such models should be expanded to cover all \n     States and territories.\n       (13) An important aspect of terrorism preparedness is \n     measurability, so that it is possible to determine how \n     prepared a State or local government is now, and what \n     additional steps it needs to take, in order to prevent, \n     prepare for, respond to, mitigate against, and recover from \n     acts of terrorism.\n       (14) The Department of Homeland Security should establish, \n     publish, and regularly update national voluntary consensus \n     standards for both equipment and training, in cooperation \n     with both public and private sector standard setting \n     organizations, to assist State and local governments in \n     obtaining the equipment and training to attain the essential \n     capabilities for first response to acts of terrorism, and to \n     ensure that first responder funds are spent wisely.\n\n     SEC. 1113.

Such report shall include--\n       (1) a certification by the Attorney General that such \n     recommendations have been implemented and such policy goals \n     have been achieved; or\n       (2) if the Attorney General is unable to make the \n     certification described in paragraph (1), a description of--\n       (A) the steps taken to implement such recommendations and \n     achieve such policy goals;\n       (B) when the Attorney General expects such recommendations \n     to be implemented and such policy goals to be achieved; and\n       (C) any allocation of resources or other actions by \n     Congress the Attorney General considers necessary to \n     implement such recommendations and achieve such policy goals.\n       (b) Termination of Duty to Report.--The duty to submit a \n     report under subsection (a) shall terminate when the Attorney \n     General submits a certification pursuant to subsection \n     (a)(1).\n       (c) GAO Review of Certification.--If the Attorney General \n     submits a certification pursuant to subsection (a)(1), not \n     later than 30 days after the submission of such \n     certification, the Comptroller General shall submit to the \n     relevant congressional committees a report on whether the \n     recommendations described in subsection (a) have been \n     implemented and whether the policy goals described in \n     subsection (a) have been achieved.\n\n     SEC. 1212. PRIVACY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES OVERSIGHT BOARD.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``9/11 \n     Commission Civil Liberties Board Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On July 22, 2004 the National Commission on Terrorist \n     Attacks Upon the United States issued a report that included \n     41 specific recommendations to help prevent future terrorist \n     attacks, including details of a global strategy and \n     government reorganization necessary to implement that \n     strategy.\n       (2) One of the recommendations focused on the protections \n     of civil liberties. Specifically the following recommendation \n     was made: ``At this time of increased and consolidated \n     government authority, there should be a board within the \n     executive branch to oversee adherence to the guidelines we \n     recommend and the commitment the government makes to defend \n     our civil liberties.''.\n       (3) The report also states that ``the choice between \n     security and liberty is a false choice, as nothing is more \n     likely to endanger America's liberties than the success of a \n     terrorist attack at home. Our History has shown that the \n     insecurity threatens liberty at home. Yet if our liberties \n     are curtailed, we lose the values that we are struggling to \n     defend.''.\n       (4) On December 17, 2004, Public Law 108-458, the National \n     Intelligence Reform Act, was signed into law. This law \n     created a civil liberties board that does not have the \n     authority necessary to protect civil liberties.\n       (5) The establishment and adequate funding of a Privacy and \n     Civil Liberties Oversight Board was a crucial recommendation \n     made by the 9/11 Commission.\n       (6) In its Final Report on 9/11 Commission Recommendations, \n     the Commission noted ``very little urgency'' and \n     ``insufficient'' funding as it relates to the establishment \n     of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.\n       (7) While the President's budget submission for fiscal year \n     2006 included $750,000 for the Privacy and Civil Liberties \n     Oversight Board, the President's budget submission for fiscal \n     year 2007 does not contain a funding line for the Board.\n\n[[Page S9386]]\n\n       (c) Making the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board \n     Independent.--Section 1061(b) of the Intelligence Reform and \n     Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 is amended by striking \n     ``within the Executive Office of the President'' and \n     inserting ``as an independent agency within the Executive \n     branch''.\n       (d) Requiring All Members of the Privacy and Civil \n     Liberties Oversight Board Be Confirmed by the Senate.--\n     Subsection (e) of section 1061 of the Intelligence Reform and \n     Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(e) Membership.--\n       ``(1) Members.--The Board shall be composed of a full-time \n     chairman and 4 additional members, who shall be appointed by \n     the President, by and with the advice and consent of the \n     Senate.\n       ``(2) Qualifications.--Members of the Board shall be \n     selected solely on the basis of their professional \n     qualifications, achievements, public stature, expertise in \n     civil liberties and privacy, and relevant experience, and \n     without regard to political affiliation, but in no event \n     shall more than 3 members of the Board be members of the same \n     political party. The President shall, before appointing an \n     individual who is not a member of the same political party as \n     the President consult with the leadership of that party, if \n     any, in the Senate and House of Representatives.\n       ``(3) Incompatible office.--An individual appointed to the \n     Board may not, while serving on the Board, be an elected \n     official, officer, or employee of the Federal Government, \n     other than in the capacity as a member of the Board.\n       ``(4) Term.--Each member of the Board shall serve a term of \n     six years, except that--\n       ``(A) a member appointed to a term of office after the \n     commencement of such term may serve under such appointment \n     only for the remainder of such term;\n       ``(B) upon the expiration of the term of office of a \n     member, the member shall continue to serve until the member's \n     successor has been appointed and qualified, except that no \n     member may serve under this subparagraph--\n       ``(i) for more than 60 days when Congress is in session \n     unless a nomination to fill the vacancy shall have been \n     submitted to the Senate; or\n       ``(ii) after the adjournment sine die of the session of the \n     Senate in which such nomination is submitted; and\n       ``(C) the members initially appointed under this subsection \n     shall serve terms of two, three, four, five, and six years, \n     respectively, from the effective date of this Act, with the \n     term of each such member to be designated by the President.\n       ``(5) Quorum and meetings.--The Board shall meet upon the \n     call of the chairman or a majority of its members. Three \n     members of the Board shall constitute a quorum.''.\n       (e) Subpoena Power for the Privacy and Civil Liberties \n     Oversight Board.--Section 1061(d) of the Intelligence Reform \n     and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 is amended--\n       (1) so that subparagraph (D) of paragraph (1) reads as \n     follows:\n       ``(D) require, by subpoena issued at the direction of a \n     majority of the members of the Board, persons (other than \n     departments, agencies, and elements of the executive branch) \n     to produce any relevant information, documents, reports, \n     answers, records, accounts, papers, and other documentary or \n     testimonial evidence.''; and\n       (2) so that paragraph (2) reads as follows:\n       ``(2) Enforcement of subpoena.--In the case of contumacy or \n     failure to obey a subpoena issued under paragraph (1)(D), the \n     United States district court for the judicial district in \n     which the subpoenaed person resides, is served, or may be \n     found may issue an order requiring such person to produce the \n     evidence required by such subpoena.''.\n       (f) Reporting Requirements.--\n       (1) Duties of board.--Paragraph (4) of section 1061(c) of \n     the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 \n     is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(4) Reports.--\n       ``(A) Receipt, review, and submission.--\n       ``(i) In general.--The Board shall--\n\n       ``(I) receive and review reports from privacy officers and \n     civil liberties officers described in section 212; and\n       ``(II) periodically submit, not less than semiannually, \n     reports to the appropriate committees of Congress, including \n     the Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives, the Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs of the Senate, the Committee on \n     Government Reform of the House of Representatives, the Select \n     Committee on Intelligence of the Senate, and the Permanent \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n     Representatives, and to the President.\n\n     Such reports shall be in unclassified form to the greatest \n     extent possible, with a classified annex where necessary.\n       ``(ii) Contents.--Not less than 2 reports the Board submits \n     each year under clause (i)(II) shall include--\n\n       ``(I) a description of the major activities of the Board \n     during the preceding period;\n       ``(II) information on the findings, conclusions, and \n     recommendations of the Board resulting from its advice and \n     oversight functions under subsection (c);\n       ``(III) the minority views on any findings, conclusions, \n     and recommendations of the Board resulting from its advice \n     and oversight functions under subsection (c); and\n       ``(IV) each proposal reviewed by the Board under subsection \n     (c)(1) that the Board advised against implementing, but that \n     notwithstanding such advice, was implemented.\n\n       ``(B) Informing the public.--The Board shall--\n       ``(i) make its reports, including its reports to Congress, \n     available to the public to the greatest extent that is \n     consistent with the protection of classified information and \n     applicable law; and\n       ``(ii) hold public hearings and otherwise inform the public \n     of its activities, as appropriate and in a manner consistent \n     with the protection of classified information and applicable \n     law.''.\n       (2) Privacy and civil liberties officers.--Section 1062 of \n     the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 \n     is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 1062.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Omnibus \n     Nonproliferation and Anti-Nuclear Terrorism Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 1322. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Loose nuclear weapons and materials in the former \n     soviet union.--\n       (A) There are in the world today enormous stockpiles of \n     nuclear weapons and the materials required to make them. \n     Counting materials both in assembled warheads and in other \n     forms, worldwide totals are estimated to encompass some 1,900 \n     tons of highly enriched uranium (enough for 143,000 nuclear \n     weapons) and 1,855 tons of plutonium (enough for 330,000 \n     nuclear weapons).\n       (B) The Russian Federation alone is estimated to have over \n     1,000 tons of highly enriched uranium (enough for over 80,000 \n     nuclear weapons) and 140 tons of plutonium (enough for over \n     30,000 nuclear weapons).\n       (C) The United States has been working for over a decade to \n     eliminate stockpiles of loose nuclear weapons and materials \n     in the former Soviet Union, but the Department of Energy \n     acknowledges that there is still a need to properly secure \n     about 460 tons of weapons-usable Russian nuclear material \n     (outside of warheads), enough for more than 35,000 nuclear \n     weapons.\n       (D) A recent report by the Central Intelligence Agency \n     faulted the security of nuclear arsenal facilities in the \n     Russian Federation and assessed that ``undetected smuggling \n     has occurred.''\n       (E) There are at least 18 documented incidents of \n     ``proliferation significant'' fissile material trafficking \n     from facilities in the former Soviet Union between 1991 and \n     2001. In one incident in 1998, an inside conspiracy at a \n     Russian nuclear weapons facility attempted to steal 18.5 \n     kilograms of highly enriched uranium. In another incident, 2 \n     kilograms of highly enriched uranium taken from a research \n     facility in Sukhumi, Georgia, has never been recovered.\n       (F) In May 1994, German police found a small but worrisome \n     quantity of supergrade plutonium in the garage of Adolf \n     Jackle. Extremely expensive to produce, this rare item was \n     likely stolen from one of Russia's two premier nuclear \n     weapons laboratories.\n       (G) Comprehensive security upgrades are not yet completed \n     at 90 percent of Russian nuclear warhead bunkers for Russia's \n     Strategic Rocket Forces.\n       (H) Border security in the former Soviet Union is \n     inconsistent at best. Existing infrastructure helps at the \n     outer borders of the former Soviet Union but many borders \n     internal to the former Soviet Union, such as the border \n     between Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation, exist only on \n     a map.\n       (2) Loose nuclear materials around the globe.--\n       (A) Dangerous caches of weapons-usable nuclear materials, \n     much of it poorly secured and vulnerable to theft, exist in a \n     multitude of facilities around the world. For example, there \n     are over 130 research reactors in over 40 countries that \n     house highly enriched uranium, some with enough to \n     manufacture an atomic bomb. In total, about 40 tons of highly \n     enriched uranium, enough for over 1,000 nuclear weapons, is \n     estimated to remain in civilian research reactors.\n       (B) Over the last 50 years, the United States is known to \n     have exported about 27.5 tons of highly enriched uranium to \n     43 countries to help develop nuclear power production or \n     bolster scientific initiatives. In 1996, the United States \n     began an effort to recover the more than 17.5 tons of the \n     nuclear material that was still overseas, but has recovered \n     only about 1 ton, according to the Department of Energy and \n     the Government Accountability Office.\n       (C) It is especially important to keep highly enriched \n     uranium out of terrorists' hands because, with minimal \n     expertise, they could use it to make the simplest, gun-type \n     nuclear weapon--a device in which a high explosive is used to \n     blow one subcritical piece of highly enriched uranium from \n     one end of a tube into another subcritical piece held at the \n     opposite end of the tube.\n       (D) To Osama bin Laden, acquiring weapons of mass \n     destruction is a ``religious duty''. Al Qaeda and more than \n     two dozen other terrorist groups are pursuing capability to \n     use weapons of mass destruction.\n       (E) Osama bin Laden's press spokesman, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, \n     has announced that the group aspires ``to kill 4 million \n     Americans, including 1 million children,'' in response to \n     casualties supposedly inflicted on Muslims by the United \n     States and Israel.\n       (F) Al Qaeda documents recovered in Afghanistan reveal a \n     determined research effort focused on nuclear weapons.\n       (3) Security standards for all nuclear weapons and \n     materials.--\n\n[[Page S9391]]\n\n       (A) There are no international binding standards for the \n     secure handling and storage of nuclear weapons and materials.\n       (B) Making a nuclear weapon requires only 4 to 5 kilograms \n     of plutonium or 12 to 15 kilograms of highly enriched \n     uranium.\n       (C) In October 2001, the United States Government became \n     very concerned that Al Qaeda may have smuggled a 10-kiloton \n     Russian nuclear warhead into New York City. If placed in \n     lower Manhattan, such a device would probably kill 100,000 \n     people instantly, seriously injure tens of thousands more, \n     and render the entire area uninhabitable for decades to come.\n       (4) Russia's nuclear expertise.--\n       (A) Employment at the large nuclear facilities in the \n     Russian Federation's 10 closed nuclear cities is estimated to \n     be in the range of 120,000 to 130,000 people, of whom \n     approximately 75,000 were employed on nuclear weapons-related \n     work.\n       (B) Poor wages and living conditions in Russian ``nuclear \n     cities'' have inspired protests and strikes among the \n     employees working in them.\n       (C) Insiders have been caught attempting to smuggle nuclear \n     materials out of these facilities, presumably to sell on the \n     lucrative black market.\n\n     SEC. 1323.

SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO INTERNATIONAL \n                   SECURITY STANDARDS FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND \n                   MATERIALS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the President should seek \n     to devise and implement standards to improve the security of \n     nuclear weapons and materials by--\n       (1) establishing with other willing nations a set of \n     performance-based standards for the security of nuclear \n     weapons and weapons;\n       (2) negotiating with those nations an agreement to adopt \n     the standards and implement appropriate verification measures \n     to assure ongoing compliance; and\n       (3) coordinating with those nations and the International \n     Atomic Energy Agency to strongly encourage other states to \n     adopt and verifiably implement the standards.\n\n     SEC. 1333. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS RELATING TO \n                   INVENTORY OF RUSSIAN TACTICAL NUCLEAR WARHEADS \n                   AND DATA EXCHANGES.\n\n       In addition to any other amounts authorized to be \n     appropriated for such purposes, there are authorized to be \n     appropriated to the Administrator for Nuclear Security for \n     fiscal year 2007, $5,000,000 for assistance to Russia to \n     facilitate the conduct of a comprehensive inventory of the \n     stockpile of Russia of--\n       (1) non-strategic nuclear weapons; and\n       (2) nuclear weapons, whether strategic or non-strategic, \n     that are not secured by PALs or other electronic means.\n\n     SEC. 1334.

The report shall--\n       (1) detail past and current efforts of the United States to \n     encourage a proper accounting for and securing of Russia's \n     non-strategic nuclear weapons and Russia's nuclear weapons, \n     whether strategic or non-strategic, that are not secured by \n     PALs or other electronic means;\n       (2) detail the actions that are most likely to lead to \n     progress in improving the accounting for and securing or \n     dismantlement of such weapons; and\n       (3) detail the feasibility of enhancing the national \n     security of the United States by developing increased \n     transparency between the United States and Russia with \n     respect to the numbers, locations, and descriptions of such \n     weapons and of the corresponding weapons of the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 1335.

STRENGTHENING THE NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION TREATY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Article IV of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \n     Nuclear Weapons (commonly referred to as the Nuclear \n     Nonproliferation Treaty or NPT) (21 UST 483) states that \n     countries that are parties to the treaty have the \n     ``inalienable right . . . to develop research, production and \n     use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without \n     discrimination and in conformity with articles I and II of \n     this treaty.''.\n       (2) The rights outlined under article IV include all fuel \n     cycle activities, despite the fact that uranium enrichment \n     and plutonium production potentially put a country in a \n     position to produce weapons usable material.\n       (3) David Bergmann, former chairman of the Israeli Atomic \n     Energy Commission, stated: ``. . . by developing atomic \n     energy for peaceful uses, you reach the nuclear weapon \n     option. There are not two atomic energies''.\n       (4) The wording of article IV has made it possible for \n     countries that are parties to the NPT treaty to use peaceful \n     nuclear programs as a cover for weapons programs. In \n     particular, the misuse by North Korea and Iran of these \n     provisions threatens to undercut the viability of the nuclear \n     nonproliferation regime and the entire system of \n     international nuclear commerce.\n       (5) If the international community fails to devise \n     effective measures to deal with the ``loophole'' in article \n     IV, then there is a great likelihood that the ranks of \n     countries possessing nuclear weapons will increase markedly \n     in the next decade.\n       (b) Presidential Report on Control of Nuclear Fuel Cycle \n     Technologies and Material.--Not later than 90 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit \n     to the appropriate congressional committees a report \n     identifying ways to more effectively control nuclear fuel \n     cycle technologies and material, including ways that the \n     United States can mobilize the international community to \n     close the ``loophole'' of article IV of the NPT, without \n     undermining the treaty itself.\n\n     SEC. 1337. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this subtitle:\n       (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--\n       (A) the Committee on International Relations, the Committee \n     on Armed Services, the Committee on Homeland Security, and \n     the Committee on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (B) the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Committee on \n     Armed Services, the Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs, and the Committee on Appropriations of \n     the Senate.\n       (2) Cooperative threat reduction programs.--The term \n     ``Cooperative Threat Reduction programs'' means programs and \n     activities specified in section 1501(b) of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 (Public Law \n     104-201; 110 Stat. 2731; 50 U.S.C. 2362 note).\n\n                    DIVISION B--COMBATTING TERRORISM\n\n     SEC. 2001. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This division may be cited as the ``Targeting Terrorists \n     More Effectively Act of 2006''.\n\n              TITLE XXI--EFFECTIVELY TARGETING TERRORISTS\n\n     SEC. 2101. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES AND \n                   RELATED MATTERS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the number of active-duty Army Special Forces-qualified \n     personnel should be increased during the four years after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act so that on the date that is \n     four years after the date of such enactment such number is \n     9,290;\n       (2) an additional 16 Predator aircraft should be acquired \n     for the Air Force Special Operations Command by the end of \n     fiscal year 2008;\n\n[[Page S9393]]\n\n       (3) an additional Special Operations squadron should be \n     established not later than fiscal year 2009; and\n       (4) the increase in the number of regular and reserve \n     component personnel who are assigned civil affairs duty \n     should be accelerated.\n\n     SEC. 2102. FOREIGN LANGUAGE EXPERTISE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Success in the global war on terrorism will require a \n     dramatic increase in institutional and personal expertise in \n     the languages and cultures of the societies where terrorism \n     has taken root, including a substantial increase in the \n     number of national security personnel who obtain expert \n     lingual training.\n       (2) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the \n     United States identified the countries in the Middle East, \n     South Asia, Southeast Asia, and West Africa as countries that \n     serve or could serve as terrorist havens.\n       (3) Although 22 countries have Arabic as their official \n     language, the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon \n     the United States found that a total of only 6 undergraduate \n     degrees for the study of Arabic were granted by United States \n     colleges and universities in 2002.\n       (4) The report of the National Commission on Terrorist \n     Attacks Upon the United States contained several criticisms \n     of the lack of linguistic expertise in the Central \n     Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     prior to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and called \n     for the Central Intelligence Agency to ``develop a stronger \n     language program, with high standards and sufficient \n     financial incentives''.\n       (5) An audit conducted by the Department of Justice in July \n     2004, revealed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has a \n     backlog of hundreds of thousands of untranslated audio \n     recordings from terror and espionage investigations.\n       (6) The National Security Education Program Trust Fund, \n     which funds critical grant and scholarship programs for \n     linguistic training in regions critical to national security, \n     will have exhausted all its funding by fiscal year 2006, \n     unless additional appropriations are made to the Trust Fund.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the overwhelming majority of Muslims reject terrorism \n     and a small, radical minority has grossly distorted the \n     teachings of one of the world's great faiths to seek \n     justification for acts of terrorism, such radical Islamic \n     fundamentalism constitutes a primary threat to the national \n     security interests of the United States, and an effective \n     strategy for combating terrorism should include increasing \n     the number of personnel throughout the Federal Government \n     with expertise in languages spoken in predominately Muslim \n     countries and in the culture of such countries;\n       (2) Muslim-Americans constitute an integral and cherished \n     part of the fabric of American society and possess many \n     talents, including linguistic, historic, and cultural \n     expertise that should be harnessed in the war against \n     radical, fundamentalist terror; and\n       (3) amounts appropriated for the National Flagship Language \n     Initiative pursuant to the amendments made by subsection \n     (e)(2) should be used to support the establishment, \n     operation, and improvement of programs for the study of \n     Arabic, Persian, and other Middle Eastern, South Asian, \n     Southeast Asian, and West African languages in institutes of \n     higher education in the United States.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n       (1) National security education trust fund.--Section 810 of \n     the David L. Boren National Security Education Act of 1991 \n     (50 U.S.C. 1910) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(d) Authorization of Appropriations for the Fund for \n     Fiscal Year 2007.--\n       ``(1) In general.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n     to the Fund $150,000,000 for fiscal year 2007.\n       ``(2) Availability of funds.--Amounts appropriated pursuant \n     to the authorization of appropriations in paragraph (1) shall \n     remain available until expended and not more than $15,000,000 \n     of such amounts may be obligated and expended during any \n     fiscal year.''.\n       (2) National flagship language initiative.--\n       (A) In general.--Section 811(a) of the David L. Boren \n     National Security Education Act of 1991 (50 U.S.C. 1911(a)) \n     is amended by striking ``there is authorized to be \n     appropriated to the Secretary for each fiscal year, beginning \n     with fiscal year 2003, $10,000,000'' and inserting ``there \n     are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary for each \n     fiscal year 2003 through 2006, $10,000,000, and for each \n     fiscal year after fiscal year 2006, $20,000,000,''.\n       (B) Availability of funds.--Section 811(b) of such Act (50 \n     U.S.C. 1911(b)) is amended by inserting ``for fiscal years \n     2003 through 2006'' after ``this section''.\n       (3) Demonstration program.--There are authorized to be \n     appropriated to the Director of National Intelligence such \n     sums as may be necessary for each of fiscal years 2007, 2008, \n     and 2009 in order to carry out the demonstration program \n     established under subsection (c).\n\n     SEC. 2103. CURTAILING TERRORIST FINANCING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The report of the National Commission on Terrorist \n     Attacks Upon the United States stated that ``[v]igorous \n     efforts to track terrorist financing must remain front and \n     center in United States counterterrorism efforts''.\n       (2) The report of the Independent Task Force sponsored by \n     the Council on Foreign Relations stated that ``currently \n     existing U. S. and international policies, programs, \n     structures, and organizations will be inadequate to assure \n     sustained results commensurate with the ongoing threat posed \n     to the national security of the United States''.\n       (3) The report of the Independent Task Force contained the \n     conclusion that ``[l]ong-term success will depend critically \n     upon the structure, integration, and focus of the U. S. \n     Government--and any intergovernmental efforts undertaken to \n     address this problem''.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to work with the Government of Saudi Arabia to curtail \n     terrorist financing originating from that country using a \n     range of methods, including diplomacy, intelligence, and law \n     enforcement;\n       (2) to ensure effective coordination and sufficient \n     resources for efforts of the agencies and departments of the \n     United States to disrupt terrorist financing by carrying out, \n     through the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence in \n     the Department of the Treasury, a comprehensive analysis of \n     the budgets and activities of all such agencies and \n     departments that are related to disrupting the financing of \n     terrorist organizations;\n       (3) to provide each agency or department of the United \n     States with the appropriate number of personnel to carry out \n     the activities of such agency or department related to \n     disrupting the financing of terrorist organizations;\n       (4) to centralize the coordination of the efforts of the \n     United States to combat terrorist financing and utilize \n     existing authorities to identify foreign jurisdictions and \n     foreign financial institutions suspected of abetting \n     terrorist financing and take actions to prevent the provision \n     of assistance to terrorists; and\n       (5) to work with other countries to develop and enforce \n     strong domestic terrorist financing laws, and increase \n     funding for bilateral and multilateral programs to enhance \n     training and capacity-building in countries who request \n     assistance.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations To Provide Technical \n     Assistance To Prevent Financing of Terrorists.--\n       (1) In general.--There are authorized to be appropriated to \n     the President for the ``Economic Support Fund'' to provide \n     technical assistance under the provisions of chapter 4 of \n     part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2346 \n     et seq.) to foreign countries to assist such countries in \n     preventing the financing of terrorist activities--\n       (A) for fiscal year 2007, $300,000,000; and\n       (B) for fiscal years 2008 and 2009, such sums as may be \n     necessary.\n       (2) Availability of funds.--Amounts appropriated pursuant \n     to the authorization of appropriations in this subsection are \n     authorized to remain available until expended.\n       (3) Additional funds.--Amounts authorized to be \n     appropriated under this subsection are in addition to amounts \n     otherwise available for such purposes.\n\n     SEC. 2104.

The 9/11 Public \n     Discourse Project went on to give the Administration a \n     ranking of ``unfulfilled'' in this area, commenting that \n     ``[d]issession either at home or abroad on how the United \n     States treats captured terrorists only makes it harder to \n     build the diplomatic, political and military alliance \n     necessary to fight the war on terror effectively''.\n       (b) Policy.--The policy of the United States is as follows:\n       (1) It is the policy of the United States to treat all \n     foreign persons captured, detained, interned, or otherwise \n     held in the custody of the United States (hereinafter \n     ``detainees'') humanely and in accordance with the legal \n     obligations under United States law and international law, \n     including the obligations in the Convention Against Torture, \n     the Geneva Conventions, and the Detainee Treatment Act of \n     2005.\n       (2) It is the policy of the United States that all \n     officials of the United States are bound both in wartime and \n     in peacetime by the legal prohibitions against torture, \n     cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment set out in the \n     Constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States, as \n     reiterated by the Supreme Court in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (126 S. \n     Ct. 2749 (2006)).\n       (3) If there is any doubt as to whether a detainee is \n     entitled to the protections afforded by the Geneva \n     Conventions, it is the policy of the United States that such \n     detainee shall enjoy the protections of the Convention \n     Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, done at Geneva \n     August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3316) until such time as the \n     detainee's status can be determined pursuant to the \n     procedures authorized by Army Regulation 190-8, Section 1-\n     096.\n       (4) It is the policy of the United States to expeditiously \n     process and, if appropriate, prosecute detainees in the \n     custody of the United States, including detainees in custody \n     at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n       (c) Reporting.--The Secretary shall submit to the \n     appropriate congressional committees the following:\n       (1) Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, a report setting forth the number of individuals \n     currently held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the number of such \n     individuals who are unlikely to face a military commission in \n     the next six months, and each reason for not bringing such \n     individuals before a military commission.\n       (2) Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, a report setting forth all interrogation \n     techniques approved, as of the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, by officials of the United States for use with \n     detainees.\n       (d) Rules, Regulations, and Guidelines.--\n       (1) Requirement.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary and the Director \n     shall prescribe the rules, regulations, or guidelines \n     necessary to ensure compliance with the standards of the \n     Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 and Common Article 3 of the \n     Geneva Conventions by all personnel of the United States \n     Government and by any person providing services to the United \n     States Government on a contract basis.\n       (2) Report to congress.--The Secretary and the Director \n     shall submit to Congress the rules, regulations, or \n     guidelines prescribed under paragraph (1), and any \n     modifications to such rules, regulations, or guidelines--\n       (A) not later than 30 days after the effective date of such \n     rules, regulations, guidelines, or modifications;

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In a report entitled ``Emergency First Responders: \n     Drastically Underfunded, Dangerously Unprepared'', an \n     independent task force sponsored by the Council on Foreign \n     Relations found that ``America's local emergency responders \n     will always be the first to confront a terrorist incident and \n     will play the central role in managing its immediate \n     consequences. Their efforts in the first minutes and hours \n     following an attack will be critical to saving lives, \n     establishing order, and preventing mass panic. The United \n     States has both a responsibility and a critical need to \n     provide them with the equipment, training, and other \n     resources necessary to do their jobs safely and \n     effectively.''.\n       (2) The task force further concluded that many state and \n     local emergency responders, including police officers and \n     firefighters, lack the equipment and training needed to \n     respond effectively to a terrorist attack involving weapons \n     of mass destruction.\n\n[[Page S9400]]\n\n       (3) The Federal Government has a responsibility to ensure \n     that the people of the United States are protected to the \n     greatest possible extent against a terrorist attack, \n     especially an attack that utilizes nuclear, chemical, \n     biological, or radiological weapons, and consequently, the \n     Federal Government has a critical responsibility to address \n     the equipment, training, and other needs of State and local \n     first responders.\n\n     SEC. 2322. RESTORATION OF JUSTICE ASSISTANCE FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) State and local police officers, firefighters, and \n     emergency responders play an essential role in the efforts of \n     the United States to prevent terrorist attacks and, if an \n     attack occurred, to address the effects of the attack.\n       (2) An independent task force has concluded that hundreds \n     of local police offices and firefighting and emergency \n     response units throughout the United States are unprepared \n     for responding to a terrorist attack involving nuclear, \n     chemical, biological, or radiological weapons.\n       (3) The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant \n     Program provides critical Federal support for personnel, \n     equipment, training, and technical assistance for the \n     homeland security responsibilities of local law enforcement \n     offices.\n       (4) The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 (Public Law \n     108-447) appropriated funding for the Edward Byrne Memorial \n     Justice Assistance Grant Program, a program that resulted \n     from the combination of the Edward Byrne Memorial Grant \n     Program and the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant Program.\n       (5) Funding for the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice \n     Assistance Grant Program, as provided in the Consolidated \n     Appropriations Act, 2005, has been reduced by nearly 50 \n     percent since fiscal year 2002.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President should request in the annual budget proposal, \n     and Congress should appropriate, the full amount authorized \n     to be appropriated in subsection (c).\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated for the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice \n     Assistance Grant Program--\n       (1) for fiscal year 2007, $1,250,000,000;\n       (2) for fiscal year 2008, $1,400,000,000; and\n       (3) for fiscal year 2009, $1,600,000,000.\n\n     SEC. 2323.

Rumsfeld;\n       (4) in drafting legislation for the use of military \n     commissions, the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives should take into account the \n     views of professional military lawyers who have experience in \n     prosecuting, defending, and judging cases under chapter 47 of \n     title 10, United States Code (the Uniform Code of Military \n     Justice);\n       (5) the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate is \n     drafting a bipartisan proposal on military commissions that \n     reflects the views of senior military lawyers, and this \n     process must be allowed to move forward; and\n       (6) as the Judge Advocate General of the Navy explained in \n     testimony before the Committee on Armed Services of the \n     Senate on July 13, 2006, ``[w]e need to think in terms of the \n     long view, and to always put our own sailors, soldiers, \n     Marines, and airmen in the place of an accused when we're \n     drafting these rules to ensure that these rules are \n     acceptable when we have someone in a future war who faces \n     similar rules''.\n\n                DIVISION C--INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATIONS\n\n     SEC. 3001.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) United States government authorities should have the \n     legal authority to engage in electronic surveillance of any \n     telephone conversation in which one party is reasonably \n     believed to be a member or agent of a terrorist organization.\n       (2) Absent emergency or other appropriate circumstances, \n     domestic electronic surveillance should be subject to \n     judicial review in order to protect the privacy of law \n     abiding Americans with no ties to terrorism.\n       (3) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 \n     (FISA) authorizes the President to obtain a warrant for the \n     electronic surveillance of any telephone conversation in \n     which one party is reasonably believed to be a member or \n     agent of a terrorist organization. That Act also establishes \n     procedures for engaging in electronic surveillance without a \n     warrant on a temporary basis when emergency circumstances \n     make obtaining a warrant impractical.\n       (4) During the quarter century since the enactment of the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Court has issued a warrant for \n     electronic surveillance in response to all but 5 of the \n     approximately 19,000 applications for such a warrant.\n       (5) Congress has amended the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978 numerous times, including six times \n     since September 11, 2001, to streamline the procedures for \n     obtaining a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Court.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate and \n     the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House \n     of Representatives must be fully briefed on the history, \n     operation, and usefulness of the warrantless wiretapping \n     program carried out by the National Security Agency;\n       (2) Congress should modify the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978 as needed to ensure that the \n     government may engage in electronic surveillance of telephone \n     conversations in which one party is reasonably believed to be \n     a member or agent of a terrorist organization;\n       (3) the requirement that the government must, absent \n     emergency or other appropriate circumstances, obtain a \n     judicial warrant prior to engaging in electronic surveillance \n     of a United States person should remain in place to protect \n     the privacy of law abiding Americans with no ties to \n     terrorism; and\n       (4) the President is not above the law and must abide by \n     congressionally-enacted procedures for engaging in electronic \n     surveillance.\n\nTITLE XXXIV--MATTERS RELATING TO ELEMENTS OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY\n\n      Subtitle A--Office of the Director of National Intelligence\n\n     SEC. 3401.

UNITED STATES POLICY ON IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``United \n     States Policy on Iraq Act of 2006''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Global terrorist networks, including those that \n     attacked the United States on September 11, 2001, continue to \n     threaten the national security of the United States and are \n     recruiting, planning, and developing capabilities to attack \n     the United States and its allies throughout the world.\n       (2) Winning the fight against terrorist networks requires \n     an integrated, comprehensive effort that uses all facets of \n     power of the United States and the members of the \n     international community who value democracy, freedom, and the \n     rule of law.\n       (3) The United States Armed Forces, particularly the Army \n     and Marine Corps, are stretched thin, and many soldiers and \n     Marines have experienced three or more deployments to combat \n     zones.\n       (4) Sectarian violence has surpassed the insurgency and \n     terrorism as the main security threat in Iraq, increasing the \n     prospects of a broader civil war which could draw in Iraq's \n     neighbors.\n       (5) United States and coalition forces have trained and \n     equipped more than 129,000 Iraqi soldiers, sailors, and \n     airmen, and more than 165,000 Iraqi police, highway patrol, \n     and other Ministry of Interior forces.\n       (6) Of the 106 operational Iraqi Army combat battalions, 85 \n     are either in the lead or operating independently, according \n     to the August 2006 report of the Administration to Congress \n     entitled ``Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq'';\n       (7) Congress expressed its sense in the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 (119 Stat. 3466) that \n     ``calendar year 2006 should be a period of significant \n     transition to full Iraqi sovereignty, with Iraqi security \n     forces taking the lead for the security of a free and \n     sovereign Iraq, thereby creating the conditions for the \n     phased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq''.\n       (8) Iraq's security forces are heavily infiltrated by \n     sectarian militia, which has greatly increased sectarian \n     tensions and impeded the development of effective security \n     services loyal to the Iraq Government.\n       (9) With the approval by the Iraqi Council of \n     Representatives of the ministers of defense, national \n     security, and the interior on June 7, 2006, the entire \n     cabinet of Prime Minister Maliki is now in place.\n       (10) Pursuant to the Iraq Constitution, the Council of \n     Representatives is to appoint a Panel which will have 4 \n     months to recommend changes to the Iraq Constitution.\n       (11) Despite pledges of more than $8,000,000,000 in \n     assistance for Iraq by foreign governments other than the \n     United States at the Madrid International Donors' Conference \n     in October 2003, only $3,500,000,000 of such assistance has \n     been forthcoming.\n       (12) The current open-ended commitment of United States \n     forces in Iraq is unsustainable and a deterrent to the Iraqis \n     making the political compromises and personnel and resource \n     commitments that are needed for the stability and security of \n     Iraq.\n       (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that in \n     order to change course from an open-ended commitment and to \n     promote the assumption of security responsibilities by the \n     Iraqis, thus advancing the chances for success in Iraq--\n       (1) the following actions need to be taken to help achieve \n     the broad-based and sustainable political settlement so \n     essential for defeating the insurgency and preventing all-out \n     civil war--\n       (A) there must be a fair sharing of political power and \n     economic resources among all the Iraqi groups so as to invest \n     them in the formation of an Iraqi nation by either amendments \n     to the Iraq Constitution or by legislation or other means, \n     within the timeframe provided for in the Iraq Constitution;\n       (B) the President should convene an international \n     conference so as to more actively involve the international \n     community and Iraq's neighbors, promote a durable political \n     settlement among Iraqis, reduce regional interference in \n     Iraq's internal affairs, encourage more countries to \n     contribute to Iraq's extensive needs, and ensure that pledged \n     funds are forthcoming;\n       (C) the Iraq Government should promptly and decisively \n     disarm the militias and remove those members of the Iraqi \n     security forces whose loyalty to the Iraq Government is in \n     doubt; and\n       (D) the President should--\n       (i) expedite the transition of United States forces in Iraq \n     to a limited presence and mission of training Iraqi security \n     forces, providing logistic support of Iraqi security forces, \n     protecting United States infrastructure and personnel, and \n     participating in targeted counterterrorism activities;\n       (ii) after consultation with the Government of Iraq, begin \n     the phased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq \n     this year; and\n       (iii) submit to Congress a plan by the end of 2006 with \n     estimated dates for the continued phased redeployment of \n     United States forces from Iraq, with the understanding that \n     unexpected contingencies may arise;\n       (2) during and after the phased redeployment of United \n     States forces from Iraq, the United States will need to \n     sustain a nonmilitary effort to actively support \n     reconstruction, governance, and a durable political solution \n     in Iraq; and\n       (3) the President should carefully assess the impact that \n     ongoing United States military operations in Iraq are having \n     on the capability of the United States Government to conduct \n     an effective counterterrorism campaign to defeat the broader \n     global terrorist networks that threaten the United States.\n\n   TITLE LII--SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF SENATE ON WAR AND RECONSTRUCTION \n                              CONTRACTING\n\n     SEC. 5101. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have exerted very \n     large demands on the Treasury of the United States and \n     required tremendous sacrifice by the members of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States.\n       (2) Congress has a constitutional responsibility to ensure \n     comprehensive oversight of the expenditure of United States \n     Government funds.\n       (3) Waste and corporate abuse of United States Government \n     resources are particularly unacceptable and reprehensible \n     during times of war.\n       (4) The magnitude of the funds involved in the \n     reconstruction of Afghanistan and Iraq and the war on \n     terrorism, together with the speed with which these funds \n     have been committed, presents a challenge to the effective \n     performance of the traditional oversight function of Congress \n     and the auditing functions of the executive branch.\n       (5) The Senate Special Committee to Investigate the \n     National Defense Program, popularly know as the Truman \n     Committee, which was established during World War II, offers \n     a constructive precedent for bipartisan oversight of wartime \n     contracting that can also be extended to wartime and postwar \n     reconstruction activities.\n       (6) The Truman Committee is credited with an extremely \n     successful investigative effort, performance of a significant \n     public education role, and achievement of fiscal savings \n     measured in the billions of dollars.\n       (7) The public has a right to expect that taxpayer \n     resources will be carefully disbursed and honestly spent.\n\n     SEC. 5102.

There being no objection, the Senate proceeded \nto consider the resolution.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Saturday, September 9, 2006, was a great \nday for the Detroit Shock and for the people of Michigan. A crowd of \nover 19,600 at the Joe Louis Arena joined with the rest of Michigan in \ncelebrating the Shock's\n\n[[Page S9445]]\n\nsecond championship win and a tense victory in the fifth game against \nthe reigning champions, the Sacramento Monarchs.\n  In 2003, when the Detroit Shock came back after a difficult 2002 \nseason to win the championship, it was the first time in the 7-year \nhistory of the WNBA that the championship title was taken by a team \nother than Houston or Los Angeles.\n  The finals were tense, as the Shock started off with a loss at the \nPalace of Auburn Hills, in Michigan on August 30, which they followed \nup with a 73 to 63 win on Friday, September 1. As the finals moved to \nthe Arco Arena in Sacramento, California, the Shock suffered another \nloss in the third game. With strength and courage, the Shock beat the \nMonarchs 72 to 52 in an away win on Wednesday, September 6. With one \ngame left to go, and the prospect of overtaking the WNBA reigning \nchampion, the Shock moved into the Joe Louis Arena for the last game of \nthe finals.\n  The heat was on as the Sacramento Monarchs led for the first half of \nthe game and went into halftime with a 44 to 36 lead over the Shock. In \nthe beginning of the second half, Deanna Nolan led the Shock to an 18 \nto 3 scoring run that put the Shock ahead for the rest of the game. The \nfinal two points were scored in the last seconds of the game by Katie \nSmith, with a 17-foot jump shot that made the Detroit Shock one of the \nvery few teams to have achieved multiple championships in the WNBA.\n  The win over the Monarchs in the deciding game showcased the \nspectacular performances of the Most Valuable Player of the 2006 WNBA \nFinals, Deanna Nolan, who, with a total of 24 points, led the game in \npoints scored; Cheryl Ford, who led the game in rebounds, recovered 10 \nrebounds in addition to scoring 10 points; Katie Smith, who scored 17 \npoints; and the rest of the Shock teammates.\n  Each member of the Detroit Shock organization made meaningful \ncontributions to the team's success, including players Jacqueline \nBatteast, Kara Braxton, Swin Cash, Cheryl Ford, Kedra Holland-Corn, \nDeanna Nolan, Plenette Pierson, Elaine Powell, Ruth Riley, Katie Smith, \nand Angelina Williams, as well as the Head Coach, Bill Laimbeer, \nAssistant Coaches Cheryl Reeve and Rick Mahorn, Athletic Trainer Mike \nPerkins, and the owner of the Detroit Shock, Bill Davidson.\n  This championship win marks the fourth professional basketball title \nfor Head Coach Bill Laimbeer, including two as coach of the Detroit \nShock and two as a player for the Detroit Pistons. This is the fifth \nchampionship title for Detroit Shock owner Bill Davidson's Detroit \nteams.\n  I know that my colleagues will join me and Senator Stabenow in \ncongratulating the Detroit Shock on another spectacular championship \nwin, and I know that the Shock will continue to be a source of pride \nfor the people of the City of Detroit and throughout the whole State of \nMichigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Detroit \nShock on winning the 2006 Women's National Basketball Association \nChampionship.\n  On Saturday, September 9, 2006, the Detroit Shock won their second \nWNBA Championship by defeating the defending champion Sacramento \nMonarchs by a score of 80 to 75.\n  The Detroit Shock were able to celebrate the tenth year of the WNBA \nwith an inspiring victory in the fifth game of the finals and secured \ntheir second championship in four years.\n  The attendance for game 5 at the Joe Louis Arena was over 19,600 \npeople. The enthusiasm shown by the people of Michigan clearly \ndemonstrate Michigan's strong support for the Detroit Shock \norganization and the determined effort of all of its players.\n  The Shock completed an incredible season! It was capped by \nspectacular performances in the deciding game by the WNBA Finals Most \nValuable Player, Deanna Nolan, who scored a game high 24 points. Cheryl \nFord, who had a game high 10 rebounds, in addition to scoring 10 \npoints; and Katie Smith also contributed 17 points.\n  Head Coach Bill Laimbeer has now won four professional basketball \ntitles, including two as coach of the Detroit Shock and two as a player \nfor the Detroit Pistons. And the Detroit Shock owner Bill Davidson's \nDetroit. teams have won five championship titles, including three \nPistons' Titles.\n  The Shock demonstrated superior strength, skill, and perseverance \nduring the 2006 season and have made the City of Detroit and the entire \nState of Michigan proud.\n  I congratulate the Detroit Shock on winning the 2006 WNBA \nChampionship and recognize all the players, coaches, staff, fans, and \nothers who were instrumental in this great achievement.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues from \nGeorgia in congratulating the Columbus Northern Little League team for \nwinning the Little League World Series.\n  I would also like to congratulate a team from my home State, the \nLemont Little League team from Lemont, IL. On August 23, these young \nathletes competed in the U.S. semifinals of the Little League World \nSeries. It was the\n\n[[Page S9446]]\n\nculmination of a long journey. After earning the honor of representing \nIllinois, the Lemont team traveled to the Great Lakes Regional \nTournament in Indianapolis. Early in the regional, they lost games to \nboth Indiana and Kentucky. But they turned things around, beating both \nof those teams to advance to World Series play in Williamsport, PA.\n  Once again, the team was challenged, losing in its first game. But \nagain, they did not quit, and won their next two games to advance to \nthe U.S. semifinals. The semifinal game against Beaverton, OR, was hard \nfought. Lemont got on the board first with two runs in the third, but \ngoing into the bottom of the sixth and final inning, they were down 4-\n2. Exhibiting the strength and spirit that got them this far, they \nrallied, scored and got the tying run to third, but still lost 4-3.\n  The young men of Lemont Little League had a terrific run, and I \ncongratulate them for going this far into the tournament. Baseball is a \nwonderful sport and as the summer winds down, I am sure the boys are \nalready looking to next year. I wish them continued success.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, today, I am taking a parliamentary step to, \nin effect, reintroduce S. 3815, a bill I sponsored with Senator \nLincoln, that would improve access to and quality of long-term care. By \ndoing this, we are removing a provision from the original text of the \nbill that we did not intend, nor agree, to include in our legislation. \nDue to human error, a provision entitled ``Liability Acts of Abuse \nCommitted by Employees'' was incorrectly included in text of the bill \nthat I introduced with Senator Lincoln on August 3, 2006.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank Senator Smith for taking this step to correct \nthis error because I do not support the provision regarding liability \nprotection for acts of abuse in nursing homes that was mistakenly \nincluded in the version of S. 3815 I cosponsored with Senator Smith on \nAugust 3, 2006. The parliamentary step taken today will replace the \nincorrect version of legislation with a new version that accurately \nreflects the bill Senator Smith and I agreed to sponsor to help improve \nthe quality of life for those who need long-term care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/12/senate-section/article/S9446-4", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9446-S9447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S9446-S9447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr12se06-197]                         \n\n\n\n \n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         INVESTMENT TREATY WITH URUGUAY--TREATY DOCUMENT 109-9\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
