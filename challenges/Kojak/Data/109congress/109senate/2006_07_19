Mr. President, last week, on the morning of July 12, \nHezbollah launched a brazen and unprovoked attack on Israeli soldiers \npatrolling their side of the border with Lebanon in northern Israel. \nHezbollah militants killed seven Israeli soldiers and kidnapped two \nmore in the attack. These two soldiers remain captive, presumably \nsomewhere inside of Lebanon.\n  This Hezbollah attack followed an earlier attack from the Hamas \nterrorist groups on June 25. Hamas terrorists entered Israeli \nterritory, attacked an Israeli military base, killed two soldiers, and \nkidnapped another. CPL Gilad Shalit has yet to be released.\n  Hezbollah and Hamas are terrorists organizations. They receive \nmilitary and financial support from terror-sponsoring regimes in \nDamascus and Tehran, and they refuse to recognize Israel's right to \nexist. In fact, they call for Israel's destruction.\n  In June 2000, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan deemed Israel in full \ncompliance with Security Council Resolution 425 by completely \nwithdrawing its forces from Lebanon. Yet in the past year alone, \nHezbollah has launched at least four separate attacks into Israeli \nterritory using rockets and ground forces. It has blocked \nimplementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1559 by refusing to \ndisarm and disband its militia.\n  Last summer, Israel completely evacuated its forces from the Gaza \nStrip. Instead of demonstrating a willingness and ability to govern \nresponsibly and improve the lives of the Palestinians living there, \nHamas has used Gaza as a base to launch rocket attacks and other \nassaults on the State of Israel, like the one that led to the capture \nof Corporal Shalit on June 25.\n  Let us be clear: Hezbollah and Hamas, with the backing of Syria and \nIran, are wholly responsible for the recent outbreak of violence in the \nMiddle East.\n  While it is important for Israel to proceed carefully, we cannot deny \nits right to self-defense. Prime Minister Olmert's government has a \nresponsibility to the Israeli people to defend\n\n[[Page S7810]]\n\nIsrael against terrorist attacks. He has a responsibility to do what he \ncan to prevent similar attacks from occurring in the future.\n  Israel is an ally--our closest friend in the Middle East. We share \nits strong commitment to democracy, to the rule of law, and to a \npeaceful solution to this conflict, a solution that leaves two \ndemocratic States, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace \nand security.\n  Yesterday, the Senate passed a resolution reaffirming its steadfast \nsupport for Israel in its fight against these vicious terrorists and \nother extremists who target Israeli citizens and exploit their own \ncivilian populations as shields.\n  Hezbollah and Hamas must immediately and unconditionally release the \ncaptured Israeli soldiers and cease their rocket attacks against \nIsrael. The state sponsors of these groups in Syria and Iran must be \nheld to account.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, may I inquire about the regular order?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. We are in morning business with the first \nhalf of the time of 1 hour under the control of the majority leader or \nhis designee.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today deeply disturbed after \nwatching the situation in Israel continuing to escalate over the last \nfew days. Israel, over the last 3 years, has acted in a responsible \nmanner and done everything possible, in my view, to reach out to those \nwho desire peace. Unfortunately, there remain those who continue to \ndisregard the Israeli State and refuse to recognize its legitimacy.\n  Sadly, these terrorist groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah remain \ncommitted to their ideology of hatred toward the Jewish people and \nappear determined to try to bring an end to the State of Israel. As \nsuch, I strongly support Israel's response to the unprovoked kidnapping \nof two Israeli soldiers and the unprecedented rocket bombardment of \nnorthern Israel.\n  The current Israeli action is justified. Action is necessary to stop \nthose who are responsible for these despicable acts of terror. The \nattempts to defend Israel and rescue its captured soldiers with \nairstrikes and incursions by Israeli forces are not only appropriate \nbut are absolutely necessary to protect Israeli citizens from future \nterrorist attacks.\n  Ultimately, I believe outside actors, such as Syria and Iran, which \ncontinue to support terrorist organizations such as Hamas and Hezbollah \nare the main culprits. These nations have done nothing to promote peace \nin the region. I believe the United States and the community of nations \nshould put these nations on notice that their support for terrorism is \nunacceptable and will not be tolerated.\n  President Bush has likewise called out Syria and Iran for their \nsupport of Hezbollah by stating:\n\n       The one way to help heal the Middle East is to address the \n     root causes of the problems there, and the root cause of the \n     problem is Hezbollah and Syria and the Iranian connection.\n\n  No one doubts that with the support these nations provide to \nHezbollah they could bring an end to the hostilities in the region. \nInstead, they would rather Hezbollah continue to use innocent citizens \nas shields while the terrorist organization conducts attacks against a \nsovereign nation. They need to abide by the already passed United \nNations resolution and end support for Hezbollah.\n  That is why I rise in support of S. Res. 534 condemning Hezbollah and \ntheir sponsors, and I also ask to be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, our ally, Israel, is entitled to the \ndefense of its land. We as a body should again recognize this act and \nsupport Israel's right to self-defense while calling for the Syrians \nand the Iranians to take responsibility for these open hostilities. \nThey must help immediately to withdraw all terrorist forces from \nLebanon and end their support for Hezbollah's action against our \nallies. We also must ensure that the U.N. Security Council enforces the \nfull implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1559, which in \n2004 called for disarming Hezbollah and the removal of all foreign \nforces from Lebanon. We must use all of the tools at our disposal to \ndiscontinue the financial, military, and political support Hezbollah \nand Hamas receive from these state sponsors of terror.\n  Of course, during this crisis I would be remiss if I did not mention \nmy grave concern about the loss of innocent life in Israel, Lebanon, \nand Gaza. During the past week, Hezbollah has continued to fire rockets \nand mortars into civilian areas, killing multiple Israelis, among \nothers. As much as I believe it is imperative that the United States \nstand behind Israel in its time of need, we also must provide \nassistance to those who have been hurt because of this conflict.\n  It is my strong belief that the United States should do everything in \nits power to assure Israel's right to exist and right to protect its \nborders. Israel must be allowed to live without fear within those \nborders. It is my hope that this conflict will be resolved peacefully \nin the coming days. The people of Israel have not asked for more than \nthat, and I believe they certainly deserve as much.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/19/senate-section/article/S7810-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7810-S7812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WORLD SECURITY AND ENERGY\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I have come to the Chamber this morning to \ntalk about energy, an important issue that affects not only our cost of \nliving but our Nation's security. But before I do, I wish to say I was \npleased, as my colleague just mentioned, that last night the Senate \nvoted unanimously to recognize the inherent right of our ally, Israel, \nto defend itself against terrorist aggression. Israel has a \nresponsibility to protect its citizens, just as the United States does, \nand no nation should have to live under the constant fear of missile \nattacks or kidnapping.\n  The recent violence in the Middle East is demonstrating how broad \nthis global war against radical Islamic murderers really is and how \nmuch nations such as Iran and Syria are funding these radical \nextremists. As Israel fights to defend its way of life from Hezbollah \nand Hamas and other radical Islamic terrorist groups, America will \ncontinue to support their efforts to defend their freedom.\n  As we fight to secure our homeland from future attacks by completing \nour mission in Iraq and hunting down terrorists around the world, I am \nproud we took the time last night to recognize Israel's struggle and \nexpress our solidarity behind them.\n  I would like to spend the rest of my time this morning talking about \nthe energy crisis we are facing at home. Americans everywhere are \npaying the price.\n  For years, Democrats have complained about high energy prices and \nblocked the very solutions that would have lowered them and then \nattempted to blame Republicans for not doing enough.\n  American businesses, both large and small, are feeling the pinch. \nRecent estimates show that, since the year 2000, 3.1 million high-wage \nmanufacturing jobs have been eliminated and moved overseas, where \nenergy supplies are plentiful and costs are lower.\n  American families are struggling to make ends meet. In a recent \nsurvey, nearly 80 percent thought the rising cost of energy was hurting \nour economy and threatening jobs; 90 percent of those polled said that \nhigh energy costs were impacting their family budget. Despite having \nbeen through the warmest winter on record, heating bills for homes \nusing natural gas went up over 25 percent. Last year, the percentage of \ncredit card bills 30 days or more past due reached the highest level \nsince the American Banking Association began recording this information \nin 1973. The ABA's chief economist cited high gasoline prices as the \nmajor factor.\n  One letter I received recently from a South Carolinian detailed how \nhis father, who was on a fixed income, was forced to choose between \npaying for his medicine and putting gas in his car. Another constituent \nwrote that rising energy costs seriously threatened her family farm, \ndue to the increased cost of vehicle operation, fertilizer, and \nirrigation.\n  With all this news, is it any wonder that Americans are discouraged \nwhen they see the partisan obstruction coming from Washington \nDemocrats? The American people need answers, not\n\n[[Page S7811]]\n\nmore obstruction. We recently had good news that Republican tax cuts \ncontinue to produce strong economic growth and have helped to create \n5.4 million new jobs since 2003. But even as the economy grows and \nwages rise, family checkbooks still feel the pressure. If you get a \n$25-a-week raise but you have to spend $50 a week more to fill up your \ncar with gas, you are still $25 worse off than you were when you \nstarted. It is no wonder that American's optimism about their economic \nfuture has faded as concerns over the cost of living have increased.\n  There is no quick fix to this dilemma, but there are many things that \nwill work together to secure our economic prosperity. We can address \nrising health care prices by passing small business health plans to \nmake health insurance more affordable--another item my Democratic \ncolleagues have obstructed this year. We can return more control to \npatients by ensuring that every American has a health plan that they \ncan own and afford and keep.\n  We can invest in the flexibility and choice necessary to train the \nbest workforce in the world. It is not going to help to raise the \nminimum wage a dollar or two. We need to work on maximum wages for \nAmericans by creating more qualified workers.\n  We can work to increase our natural gas and oil supplies. That will \nreduce the cost of gas, it will increase America's supply of energy, \nand encourage conservation. We can reduce the dependence on foreign \noil. There is a lot we can do if we can work together in the Congress \nto pass new energy legislation.\n  The good news is that Republicans are working, one step at a time, to \nget these things done. In the next few weeks, the Senate will debate \ncritical legislation to increase America's deep sea exploration in the \nGulf of Mexico. This could help, again, to lower energy costs across \nthe Nation. Unfortunately, some Democrats have already threatened to \nobstruct this important bill that would keep American energy prices \ncompetitive and hopefully lower them in the future.\n  We are still waiting for these same Democrats to offer any immediate \nsolutions on their own. Strong economic growth in America and around \nthe world has greatly increased the demand for already limited supplies \nof energy. We are now competing with other nations, not just for jobs \nbut for the energy that powers those jobs.\n  Our energy problems did not occur overnight and they will not be \nfixed overnight. But if we fail to address rising American energy \ncosts, we will create yet another incentive for businesses to locate \noverseas and leave American workers behind.\n  To keep the United States competitive, we must transform our energy \npolicy to meet pressing short-term needs while exploring new \nalternative solutions to meet long-term needs for abundant, affordable, \nand emission-free energy. Currently, expensive and time-consuming \npermitting processes, extensive regulatory burdens, and overly \nbureaucratic environmental hurdles have made it cheaper to import our \noil and natural gas from the Middle East than to use our own domestic \nresources. This makes no sense. To address the short-term issue of \nconstantly fluctuating energy prices, we must eliminate these \nGovernment-imposed regulatory roadblocks in order to increase our \nenergy supply and get these resources to consumers quickly and \naffordably. We can unshackle American entrepreneurs, the best in the \nworld, and allow them to fully develop our natural resources and still \nprotect our environment.\n  The long-term policy must focus on creating a diverse energy \ninfrastructure that includes new technologies such as hydrogen, fuel \ncells, and other alternative forms of energy. Many of these \ntechnologies, currently in the early stages of development, have shown \ngreat promise and can revolutionize the way we fuel our cars, homes, \nand businesses.\n  Energy costs are on the rise and the ball is in the Democrats' court. \nRepublicans have put forth practical solutions, such as the deep sea \ndevelopment that we will be talking about over the next weeks. These \nwill diversify our energy infrastructure and supply affordable, \nabundant, and environmentally friendly energy, and most important, \nreduce the cost of living for American families.\n  I ask my Democratic colleagues to reject their leadership's tired \nstrategy of blocking real solutions and then trying to blame \nRepublicans when the problems don't get solved. Working together, we \ncan bring down the cost of living and improve the quality of life for \nevery American as we reduce the cost of gas and increase America's \nsupply of energy. We can still encourage conservation, while reducing \nour dependence on foreign oil.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from the great \nState of Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the majority and minority leaders for \nsetting aside some time today to discuss the situation in the Middle \nEast. While news of Israeli airstrikes and Hezbollah rocket attacks \nhave dominated the airwaves for over a week now, the issue has not been \nextensively debated on the floor of the Senate. What we have now, \ntoday, is an opportunity to stand together as the Senate and send an \nunequivocal message of support to our Israeli allies in their time of \nneed.\n\n  I am speaking about the Senate resolution which was adopted last \nevening, crafted in a bipartisan way by the majority and minority \nleaders of the Senate, a resolution which I am proud to cosponsor and \nwhich I believe eloquently expresses what I believe to be the true \nsense of this body and of the American people. It rightly points out \nthat Israel has complied with the relevant Security Council resolutions \nregarding withdrawal from Lebanon and that, by contrast, Lebanon has \nfailed to follow through on its obligation to disarm Hezbollah. The \nresolution correctly identifies the nexus of the problem not in Beirut \nor Gaza but in Tehran and Damascus, where State sponsorship of \nterrorism has reached new and disturbing levels.\n  Finally, this resolution encourages continued U.S. support for Israel \nand renewed international action to end the conflict by eliminating \nsupport and freedom of action of Hezbollah. It is, in summary, an \nimportant expression by the Senate.\n  I would like to take a moment now to address some arguments made by \nsome over the years that Americans are too quick to equate our \ninterests with those of Israel. There are recent articles by respected \nscholars who have argued that the role of the United States should be \nto push Israel toward an accommodation with these terrorists, the same \nterrorists bent on her destruction, rather than standing by her as she \ntries to lay the foundation for a lasting peace.\n  I think this past week's conflict exposes the utter fallacy of that \nperspective. Israel is under attack today, not just from Hezbollah and \nHamas but from Iran and Syria, the two most active State sponsors of \nglobal terrorism. Right now the United States is struggling with these \nsame two countries over their counterproductive roles in Iraq, their \nWMD programs, and their role in financing and equipping terrorists \nthroughout the world.\n  The kind of attacks that Israel is enduring today could be visited on \nthe United States or our troops tomorrow. For example, late last week \nan advanced Israeli warship was hit with an Iranian antiship missile. \nDespite the high-tech countermeasures on that ship, four sailors are \nnow presumed lost. It is not hard to imagine these very same missiles \nused against American ships in the future, especially if the Iranians \ndecide to blockade the Strait of Hormuz in response to U.S. pressure \nover that nuclear program. The attack on that ship can easily be \nperceived as directed as much against the U.S. Navy as it is against \nthe Israeli Navy.\n  Those fighting international terrorism are bound at the hip in this \nconflict. To believe otherwise is the height of foolishness.\n  William Kristol stated in a editorial yesterday:\n\n       It's our war. For while Syria and Iran are enemies of \n     Israel, they are also enemies of the United States. We have \n     done a poor job of standing up to them and weakening them. \n     They are now testing us more boldly than one would have \n     thought possible a few years ago. Weakness is provocative. We \n     have been too weak, and have allowed ourselves to be \n     perceived as weak.\n\n  This conflict, in short, is not just about the interests of the \nIsraeli or Palestinian or Lebanese people. It is\n\n[[Page S7812]]\n\nabout a broader state-sponsored jihad against Western civilization, a \nwar in which we cannot afford to stumble or waver or appear to be weak. \nThe Senate resolution is a sign that we will not stumble, that we stand \nby our Israeli allies as they fight on the frontlines of this war \nagainst terrorists. That the people of Lebanon have gotten caught in \nthe middle of this war is not simply regrettable, it is criminal. But \nmake no mistake who the perpetrators are: Iran and Syria and the \nterrorist groups they equip and encourage. This axis of violence cannot \nbe allowed to operate with impunity against the State of Israel.\n  The solution to this current crisis will not be easy. But the first \nstep was identified by President Bush, in what some have characterized \nas an overly candid conversation with Tony Blair in Saint Petersburg. \nParaphrasing the President, he said the international community must \nput pressure on Iran and Syria to curb the actions of their terrorist \nproxy armies.\n  At the same time, the Government of Lebanon must act swiftly and \ndirectly to dismantle the Hezbollah infrastructure that threatens \nnorthern Israel. When these processes are in motion and the kidnapped \nIsraeli soldiers have been returned, then is the time to again move \ntoward the end game of this crisis.\n  Many in the international community have urged restraint on the part \nof Israel in facing this crisis. They talk about proportionality. I \nthink we can all agree that in international relations, restraint is \ngenerally a good thing, but Israeli restraint and forbearance should \nonly be given in response to action on the other side. Israel's \nresponse against terrorism cannot be proportionate. It must be \neffective. Absent action by the international community and the \nLebanese Government, restraint will look like weakness to Israel's \nenemies. And any show of weakness will only bring more blood-thirsty \nattacks.\n  This is the experience of the region. This is the history of the \nregion. No sovereign nation would tolerate the type of attacks that \nIsrael has endured, nor would they prioritize restraint above \neffectiveness in their response.\n  This is why I come back to the resolution that was passed in the \nSenate in a bipartisan expression of our support for the State of \nIsrael, our condemnation of this action by terrorists and their State \nsponsors, and our commitment, as the Government of the United States, \nto do all we can to see to it that the terrorists are defeated, that \nthe people in the region have an opportunity to live in peace, and that \nonce and for all throughout the world the world can be safe from the \nthreat of those who would attack others and to do so in the most \nheinous way.\n  The kind of action that has been taken by these terrorists cannot be \njustified in any way, shape, or form, and it is altogether fitting for \nthe Senate to have expressed its resolve against this action.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I speak in morning business about the \nissue that the two prior speakers--the Senator from South Carolina and \nthe Senator from Arizona--spoke about, the Middle East. This is a key \ntime. I hope we continue to stand by Israel very strongly, very \nresolutely, and recognize what we are experiencing today. We are \nexperiencing a key global war on terrorism, which is the use of \nterrorist entities sponsored by state sponsors so that there is some \nsort of deniability by the state sponsor. But, nonetheless, there is \nreal terrorism that is taking place.\n  There are real threats that are occurring and real attacks that are \noccurring. There are real responses that are needed.\n  That is what you have seen Israel doing today. Israel has been \nattacked. Hezbollah has been launching missiles into Israel, into major \ncities in Israel. That is what is occurring. Hezbollah is sponsored by \nthe Iranians. Iran is the key sponsor of Hezbollah. Iran is the lead \nsponsor of terrorism in the world, according to our State Department \nand, I think, frankly, according to the intelligence entities around \nthe world. They cannot sponsor the terror group and then deny \nresponsibility for it and say they should be left alone and there \nshould be no consequences.\n  We need to move aggressively against Iran in the United Nations and \nforce the issue on Iran. Here I am talking about economic sanctions and \npolitical and diplomatic pressure on the Iranians for their state \nsponsorship of terrorism.\n  We are also seeing that in Syria. This body passed the Syrian \nAccountability Act. I urge the administration to use all tools \navailable toward Syria, which is also a state sponsor of terrorism, in \nworking with Hamas and Hezbollah and other groups in this region.\n  I get concerned when a lot of people look at it and say Israel \nshouldn't be doing this or shouldn't respond. Certainly, we want all \ncare to be given in any sort of military response so that innocent \ncivilians are not hurt. We want to urge that sort of restraint, but by \nthe same token, if the United States were attacked by terrorist groups \nsponsored by other countries operating off foreign soil, the United \nStates would act aggressively and respond. We would not allow this to \ncontinue. We would say our citizens are being attacked and we have the \nright as a sovereign nation to defend our people, as Israel does, and \nas any nation around the world does.\n  I hope we view this for what it is--a part of the global war on \nterrorism. These are terrorist tactics that are being used by terrorist \ngroups, and they have state sponsors behind them.\n  I wish the situation were different today. I wish we were not here \nhaving to talk about the support for Israel in a military engagement in \nLebanon. But the facts are what they are. We have to deal with the \nsituation as it is. I believe we should be standing aggressively and \nfirmly with Israel. They are a democratic country in the region. They \nare a strong ally of the United States. We have worked closely together \nover many years. They seek peace. They want peace as we want peace. \nYet, at some point in time they have to respond to the attacks. That is \nwhat they are doing.\n  I am pleased that this body in a bipartisan fashion has stood with \nIsrael.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/19/senate-section/article/S7812-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the prior speaker from South Carolina \ntalked about energy. We have to engage in energy strategies that pull \nus off of our addiction to Middle Eastern oil. We have a lot of plants \ncoming on in ethanol production from grain. We need to move that as \nwell--and plant materials and cellulosic alcohol from grain. We can \nproduce about 10 percent of our fuel needs from grain, corn, milo-based \nethanol. From the cellulosic material, we can get another 30 percent.\n  We need a rapid expansion of plants and investment in this field. It \nis starting to take place. It is very encouraging. The economics are at \nwork, particularly when you are looking at over $70 per barrel of oil. \nWe can produce energy cheaper than $70 a barrel oil and get off the \naddiction. We need more of our cars running on 85-percent ethanol \nrather than 10-percent ethanol. We need more plug-in technologies where \nwe have more cars that are using electricity rather than gasoline so we \ncan break the addiction.\n  This country can do it with our technology and our willingness and \nwith the economics of today. We can do it. And it is a matter of utmost \nnational security to break that addiction. It is time, I believe, that \nwe in this body take up additional energy legislation. It is time we do \nthat.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 728, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 728) to provide for the consideration and \n     development of water and related resources, to authorize the \n     Secretary of the Army to construct various projects for \n     improvements to rivers and harbors of the United States, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to start off by making a \ngeneral statement about the amendments we are going to offer, and I \nassume that time will come off the time of the amendment I will offer, \nthe amendment on independent peer review. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, that is the case.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will make a few remarks, and then I \nwould like to turn to the distinguished ranking member of the \ncommittee, my friend, Senator Jeffords, for a few remarks. Then after \nhe has talked, I will offer the amendment.\n  Mr. President, today the Senate will consider two tremendously \nimportant amendments to the Water Resources Development Act. Those \namendments are the Feingold-McCain-Carper-Lieberman-Jeffords-Collins \nindependent peer review amendment and the McCain-Feingold-Lieberman-\nFeinstein prioritization amendment.\n  As many know, I have tried to work for a long time to modernize the \nArmy Corps of Engineers to ensure that this Federal agency is best \nsituated to serve our great Nation. I have worked alongside Senator \nMcCain in these efforts, and I thank him for his dedication to helping \nme bring attention to the need for congressional leadership to address \nwhat many have noted as fundamental problems with the Corps.\n  I want to be clear about my intentions with the amendments we will \noffer this morning, as well as our other efforts involving the Corps. \nWe just want to get this agency back on track to serve the interests of \nall Americans. That is what it is about, period.\n  As many have noted over the past few days, I have been trying to \nbring up this issue for quite some time. In fact, I have waited 6 long \nyears to come down to the floor of the Senate to push for meaningful \nreform of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n  Back in 2000, during debate on final passage of the last enacted \nWRDA, the former chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee \nand the current ranking member of the subcommittee of jurisdiction, my \nfriend from Montana, Senator Baucus, made a commitment to me to address \nthe issues that plagued the Corps.\n  At that time I sought to offer an amendment to WRDA 2000 to create an \nindependent peer review process for the Army Corps. In response to my \namendment, the bill managers adopted language to authorize the National \nAcademy of Sciences to study peer review. This study has long been \ncomplete, and the final recommendation was clear. In a 2002 report--\nReview Procedures for Water Resources Planning--the National Academy of \nSciences recommended creation of a formalized process to independently \nreview costly or controversial Corps projects.\n  Four years later, and with Corps reform bills in the 106th, 107th, \n108th, and 109th Congresses, we are still trying to enact such a \nmechanism.\n  I would just like to note that I am pleased to see my friend involved \nin this issue, particularly given the role he played in 2000. My only \nhope is, after 6 years of work on this issue, we can go home tonight \nknowing we did right by the taxpayers, by the citizens of our country \nwho rely on sound Corps projects to protect their families, their \nproperty, and the natural systems they want to protect for future \ngenerations.\n  Yes, Corps reform has been a work in progress. In 2001, I introduced \na stand-alone bill to modernize the Corps. Later that Congress, I \ncosponsored a bill with Senator Smith from New Hampshire, Senator \nDaschle of South Dakota, Senator Ensign of Nevada, and Senator McCain, \nthe senior Senator from Arizona. In March 2004 I introduced another \nstand-alone Corps reform bill along with Senator Daschle and Senator \nMcCain. Then in the spring of 2005, Senator McCain and I offered \nanother bill detailing the changes we hoped to see in the agency. And, \nfinally, this spring we introduced another stand-alone bill.\n  What these efforts have been about is restoring credibility and \naccountability to this Federal agency that has been rocked by scandal, \noverextended to the tune of a 35-year backlog, and constrained by a \ngloomy fiscal picture. We can do that today. We can restore credibility \nand accountability to the Corps by passing the amendments that my \nfriend, the Senator from Arizona, and I will be offering.\n\n  Some have said I have an ax to grind with the Corps. That is not \ntrue. The reason I am dedicated to improving this embattled agency is \nthat I care about the Corps, and I want it to succeed. My home State of \nWisconsin and numerous other States across our country rely on the \nCorps. From the Great Lakes to the Mississippi, the Corps is involved \nin providing aid to navigation, environmental restoration, flood \ncontrol, and many other valuable services.\n  I want to improve the way this agency operates, so that not only \nWisconsinites but all Americans--particularly those who help pay for \nCorps projects either through their Federal tax dollars or, in many \ncases, through taxes they pay at a local level as part of a non-Federal \ncost-sharing arrangement--can rest easy knowing that their flood \ncontrol projects are not going to fail them, their ecosystem \nrestoration projects are going to protect our environmental treasures, \nand their navigation projects are based on sound economics and reliable \ntraffic projections.\n  Much of the work that has gone into reforming the Corps was done \nbefore our Nation saw a major U.S. city laid to waste. When Hurricane \nKatrina rocked New Orleans, none of us imagined the horrors that would \nensue. None of us imagined that much of the flooding--much of the \nflooding--that occurred could have possibly been prevented had some of \nthe reforms we will be discussing today been in place decades ago.\n  Despite every wish to the contrary, the aftermath of Hurricane \nKatrina exposed serious problems that this body will be addressing for \nyears to come. Many have stood on this floor and in their States and \ntalked about what must be done to responsibly move forward in a post-\nKatrina landscape. And many of those discussions have, of course, \ncentered, appropriately, on the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n  I am here to say that if you were outraged by FEMA's poor response, \nlike me, then you should be equally outraged by problems with the Corps \nand the process that has determined where limited Federal resources are \nspent.\n  While any hurricane that makes landfall will leave some level of \ndestruction behind, the country has been shocked to learn that there \nwere engineering flaws in the New Orleans levees, and that important \ninformation was ignored by the Corps. According to one of the \nindependent reviewers looking into what happened with the levee \nfailures, the causes of the failures ``are firmly founded in \norganizational and institutional failures that are primarily focused in \nthe Corps of Engineers.''\n  Now, I had the chance to visit New Orleans a little over a week ago, \nand I can attest that the sentiment toward the Corps is anything but \ncordial. There is a lot of anger toward the Corps down there, and we \nhave a responsibility in Congress to address it.\n  Additionally, following the hurricane, we have faced questions from \nour constituents about where the Corps was spending its limited budget \nand why. We have a responsibility to address those legitimate concerns, \ntoo.\n  The Times-Picayune of New Orleans recently said the following:\n\n       Efforts to reform the agency, the Corps, are critical for \n     this state [meaning Louisiana, of course] which--after the \n     levee failures during Hurricane Katrina--could serve as the \n     poster child [the poster child] for the Corps' shortcomings.\n\n[[Page S7814]]\n\n       The best chance for changing the way the Corps operates is \n     through reforms sought by Sens. John McCain and Russ \n     Feingold.\n\n  And finally,\n\n       Unfortunately, not everyone in Congress is interested in \n     changing the way the Corps does business. The McCain-Feingold \n     amendments face opposition and a rival set of measures by the \n     main authors of the water resources bill, Sens. James Inhofe \n     and Kit Bond. What those Senators offer as reform is \n     meaningless, however . . . Sham reform won't do anything \n     to restore confidence in the Corps and the Congress must \n     do better.\n\n  I agree that this body must do better than sham reform. Today Senator \nMcCain and I will be offering amendments that we believe are the \nminimum changes this body must accept as we look to the future and \nreflect on the past. I sincerely hope my colleagues will join me in \ndemonstrating that the Senate can respond to over 10 years of \nGovernment reports--from the Government Accountability Office, the \nNational Academy of Sciences, and even the Army Inspector General--on \nthe horrific aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and provide the leadership \nto move the Army Corps into the 21st century.\n  I want to publicly recognize the EPW Committee chairman and ranking \nmember, Senators Inhofe and Jeffords, as well as the Subcommittee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure chairman and ranking member, Senators \nBonds and Baucus. Late this spring those offices approached Senator \nMcCain and me and indicated a willingness to talk about some of our \ninterest with respect to the Corps. From those discussions came real \ncompromise on both sides. The result is that the underlying WRDA bill \ndoes include significant language to ensure periodic updating of the \nprinciples and guidelines that form the foundation of every Corps \nproject but which have not been updated since 1983.\n  The language also includes a minimum mitigation standard for Corps \ncivil works projects. The Corps' track record on mitigation suggests \nthat the Nation would be better served through the standard described \nin the underlying bill. As WRDA moves through conference, I look \nforward to the EPW Committee standing by the language we agreed on and \nincluded in the underlying bill in sections 2006 and 2008 so that it is \nincluded in any bill that comes out of Congress.\n  I will now give some of my time on the amendment to my friend, a \ndistinguished leader in this area, the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4681\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, before yielding to the Senator from \nVermont, I will offer the amendment, if there is no objection. I have \nan amendment at the desk numbered 4681 regarding independent peer \nreview.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself, Mr. \n     McCain, Mr. Carper, Mr. Lieberman, and Ms. Collins, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 4681.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4681, as Modified\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

The Director of \n     Independent Review shall ensure that these reviews be carried \n     out in a way to protect the public health, safety, and \n     welfare, while not causing unnecessary delays in construction \n     activities.\n       (4) Safety assurance review record.--After receiving a \n     written report from an independent panel of experts \n     established under this subsection, the Secretary shall--\n       (A) take into consideration recommendations contained in \n     the report, provide a written explanation of recommendations \n     not adopted, and immediately make the report and explanation \n     available to the public on the Internet; and\n       (B) submit the report to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on \n     Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (e) Expenses.--\n       (1) In general.--The costs of an independent panel of \n     experts established under subsection (c) or (d) shall be a \n     Federal expense and shall not exceed--\n       (A) $250,000, if the total cost of the project in current \n     year dollars is less than $50,000,000; and\n       (B) 0.5 percent of the total cost of the project in current \n     year dollars, if the total cost is $50,000,000 or more.\n       (2) Waiver.--The Secretary, at the written request of the \n     Director of Independent Review, may waive the cost \n     limitations under paragraph (1) if the Secretary determines \n     appropriate.\n       (f) Report.--Not later than 5 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress \n     a report describing the implementation of this section.\n       (g) Savings Clause.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to affect any authority of the Secretary to cause \n     or conduct a peer review of the engineering, scientific, or \n     technical basis of any water resources project in existence \n     on the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair.\n  I offer this independent peer review amendment on behalf of myself, \nSenators McCain, Carper, Lieberman, and Collins. As we all know, \nSenator Collins and Senator Lieberman, through their leadership of the \nHomeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, have done an \nextensive investigation into all aspects of the aftermath of Hurricane \nKatrina. I applaud their leadership and am proud they are cosponsoring \nthis amendment, as I think it is a testament to the importance of \nimplementing the changes included in this amendment. Additionally, \nSenator Jeffords has consistently pushed, through his position as \nranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, for many \nof the provisions of this amendment. I publicly thank him for all his \nattention to this matter.\n  Finally, Senator Carper has seen the need for an independent peer \nreview amendment through both his Homeland Security Committee \nmembership and his EPW Committee membership, and I appreciate his \nsupport in moving this issue forward.\n  Before I explain exactly what my amendment does, let me take a few \nminutes to talk about what various Government reports have said about \nthe Corps' study process, as these reports have been the basis of my \nefforts over the last 6 years.\n  More than a decade of reports from the National Academy of Sciences, \nthe Government Accountability Office, the U.S. Army inspector general, \nU.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, and other independent experts have \nrevealed a pattern of stunning flaws in U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \nproject planning and implementation and urged substantial changes to \nthe Corps' project planning process. Most recently, in June of this \nyear, a report entitled ``U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Performance \nEvaluation of the New Orleans and Southeast Louisiana Hurricane \nProtection System Draft Final Report on the Interagency Performance \nEvaluation Task Force'' acknowledged that the New Orleans levees failed \ncatastrophically during Hurricane Katrina because of poor design and \nflawed construction. In planning the system, the Corps did not take \ninto account poor soil quality and failed to account for the sinking of \nland which caused sections to be as much as 2 feet lower than other \nsections.\n  Breaches in four New Orleans canals were caused by foundation \nfailures that were ``not considered in the original design.'' The \nsystem was designed to protect against a relatively low-strength \nhurricane, and the Corps did not respond to repeated warnings from the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that a stronger \nhurricane should have been the standard. The Corps also did not \nreexamine the heights of the levees after it had been warned about \nsignificant subsidence.\n  In discussing this report, the Corps' chief of engineers acknowledged \nthat the agency must change, telling reporters that ``words alone will \nnot restore trust in the Corps.''\n  Also, in June of this year, a report issued by the American Society \nof Civil Engineers, ``Project Engineering Peer Review Within the U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers,'' recommends that Congress enact legislation \nto mandate external, independent peer reviews for all major Corps \nprojects that would include reviews of the feasibility report, \nsubsequent design and engineering reports, the project plans, and \nspecifications and construction. Reviews should be carried out by \nexperts who have no connection to the Corps, to the local project \nsponsor, or to the particular project contract.\n  In May of this year, we got ``A Nation Still Unprepared,'' a report \nthat resulted from the excellent work of my friend from Maine, Senator \nSusan Collins, chair of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee, and a cosponsor of our independent peer review \namendment, and Senator Joe Lieberman, ranking member of the committee, \nand another cosponsor of our amendment.\n\n[[Page S7816]]\n\n  That report recommends independent peer review of levee systems that \nprotect population centers throughout the country. I don't know if \nSenator Collins or Senator Lieberman will have time to elaborate more \non the thorough investigation their committee conducted and on their \nkey findings and recommendations, but the report in many ways speaks \nvolumes on its own.\n  One of the most striking reports, conducted by R.B. Seed in May of \nthis year, ``Investigation of the Performance of the New Orleans Flood \nProtection Systems and Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005, Draft \nFinal Report,'' finds that the catastrophic failure of the New Orleans \nregional flood protection system was the result of ``engineering \nlapses, poor judgments, and efforts to reduce costs at the expense of \nsystem reliability.'' The Corps failed to design the system with \nappropriate safety standards, failed to adequately address the complex \ngeology of the region, failed to provide adequate design oversight, and \nengaged in ``a persistent pattern of attempts to reduce costs of \nconstructed works at the price of corollary reduction in safety and \nreliability.''\n  These failings led to the ``single most costly catastrophic failure \nof an engineered system in history'' that caused the deaths of more \nthan 1,290 people and some $100 to $150 billion in damages to the \ngreater New Orleans area.\n  I could go on, and I will. I want my colleagues to know what is at \nstake. In March 2006, the Government Accountability Office testified \nthat ``the Corps' track record of providing reliable information that \ncan be used by decision makers . . . is spotty, at best.'' Four recent \nCorps studies examined by GAO were ``fraught with errors, mistakes, and \nmiscalculations and used invalid assumptions and outdated data.'' These \nstudies ``did not provide a reasonable basis for decisionmaking.'' The \nrecurring problems ``clearly indicate that the Corps' planning and \nproject management processes cannot ensure that national priorities are \nappropriately established across the hundreds of civil works projects \nthat are competing for scarce federal resources.'' Problems at the \nagency are ``systemic in nature and therefore prevalent throughout the \nCorps' Civil Works portfolio'' so that effectively addressing these \nissues ``may require a more global and comprehensive revamping of the \nCorps' planning and project management processes rather than a \npiecemeal approach.''\n  I commend to my coleagues this damning testimony before the House \nEnergy and Resources Subcommittee of the Committee on Government Reform \nby Ann Mittal, Director, Natural Resources and Environment, GAO.\n  In March of 2006, the American Society of Civil Engineers External \nReview Panel for the Interagency Performance Evaluation Task Force \nletter to the Corps' chief of engineers found that decisions made \nduring the original design phase led to the failure of the 17th Street \ncanal floodwall in New Orleans and are representative of ``an overall \npattern of engineering judgment inconsistent with that required for \ncritical structures.'' These problems pose ``significant implications \nfor the current and future safety offered by levees, floodwalls and \ncontrol structures in New Orleans, and perhaps elsewhere.'' The \nExternal Review Panel recommends a number of immediate actions to \nimprove Corps planning for ``levees and floodwalls in New Orleans and \nperhaps everywhere else in the nation,'' including external peer review \nof the Corps' design process for critical life safety structures.\n\n  In September 2005, the GAO issued a report which backs up our call \nfor prioritization. ``Army Corps of Engineers, Improved Planning and \nFinancial Management Should Replace Reliance on Reprogramming Actions \nto Manage Project Funds'' finds that the Corps' excessive use of \nreprogramming funds is being used as a substitute for an effective \npriority-setting system for the civil works program and as a substitute \nfor sound fiscal and project management.\n  In fiscal years 2003 and 2004, the Corps reprogrammed funds over \n7,000 times and moved over $2.1 billion among projects within the \ninvestigations and constructions account.\n  In September 2004, the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy issued a \nreport, ``An Ocean Blueprint for the 21st Century Final Report of the \nU.S. Commission on Ocean Policy.'' This report recommends that the \nNational Ocean Council review and recommend changes to the Corps' civil \nworks program to ensure valid, peer-reviewed cost-benefit analyses of \ncoastal projects; provide greater transparency to the public; enforce \nrequirements for mitigating the impacts of coastal projects; and \ncoordinate such projects with broader coastal planning efforts.\n  The report also recommends that Congress modify its current \nauthorization and funding processes to encourage the Corps to monitor \noutcomes from past projects and study the cumulative and regional \nimpacts of its activities within coastal watersheds and ecosystems.\n  In 2004, the National Academy of Sciences issued a slew of reports:\n  The ``U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Water Resources Planning: A New \nOpportunity for Service'' recommends modernizing the Corps's \nauthorities, planning approaches, and guidelines to better match \ncontemporary water resources management challenges.\n  ``Adaptive Management for Water Resources Project Planning'' \nrecommends needed changes to ensure effective use of the adaptive \nmanagement by the Corps for its civil works projects.\n  ``River Basins and Coastal Systems Planning Within the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers'' describes the challenges to water resources \nplanning at the scale of river basins and coastal systems and \nrecommends needed changes to the Corps' current planning practices.\n  ``Analytical Methods and Approaches for Water Resources Planning'' \nrecommends needed changes to the Corps' ``Principles and Guidelines'' \nin planning guidance policies.\n  In May 2003, the Pew Oceans Commission's ``America's Living Oceans, \nCharting a Course for Sea Change, A Report to the Nation, \nRecommendations for a New Ocean Policy'' recommends enactment of \n``substantial reforms'' of the Corps, including legislation to ensure \nthat Corps projects are environmentally and economically sound and \nreflect national priorities. The Pew report recommends development of \nuniform standards for Corps participation in shoreline restoration \nprojects and transformation of the Corps over the long term into a \nstrong and reliable force for environmental restoration. The report \nalso recommends that Congress direct the Corps and other Federal \nagencies to develop a comprehensive floodplain management policy that \nemphasizes nonstructural control measures.\n  In May 2002, the GAO found in its report ``Scientific Panel's \nAssessment of Fish and Wildlife Mitigation Guidance'' that the Corps \nhas proposed no mitigation for almost 70 percent of its projects. And \nfor those few projects where the Corps does perform mitigation, 80 \npercent of the time it does not carry out the mitigation concurrently \nwith project construction.\n  In response to language that was included in the WRDA 2000 bill, the \nNational Academy of Sciences, in ``Review Procedures for Water \nResources Planning'' issued in 2002, recommends creation of a \nformalized process to independently review costly or controversial \nCorps projects. And in one of the most disturbing of the numerous \nreports on the Corps and the problems endemic in this agency, in \nNovember 2000, the Department of the Army Inspector General issued a \nreport entitled ``Investigation of Allegations Against the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers Involving Manipulation of Studies Related to the \nUpper Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway Navigation Systems.'' \nTheir report found that the Corps deceptively and intentionally \nmanipulated data in an attempt to justify a $1.2 billion expansion of \nlocks on the upper Mississippi River and that the Corps has an \ninstitutional bias for constructing costly, large-scale structural \nprojects.\n  Back in 1999--yes, 7 years ago--the National Academy of Sciences, in \ntheir report titled ``New Directions in Water Resources Planning for \nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers'' recommends key changes to the Corps' \nplanning process and examines the length of time and cost of Corps \nstudies in comparison with similar studies carried out by the private \nsector.\n\n[[Page S7817]]\n\n  Twelve years ago, in June of 1994, the Interagency Floodplain \nManagement Review Committee report, ``Sharing the Challenge: Floodplain \nManagement Into the 21st Century,'' a Report to the Administration \nFloodplain Management Task Force--often referred to as the Galloway \nReport after the report's primary author, BG Gerald Galloway--\nrecommends changes to the Nation's water resources policies based on \nlessons learned from the great Midwest Flood of 1993, including \nmodernizing the Corps' Principles and Guidelines, requiring the Corps \nto give full consideration to nonstructural flood damage reduction \nalternatives, requiring periodic reviews of completed Corps projects, \nadopting floodplain management guidelines that would minimize impacts \nto floodplains land reduce vulnerabilities to population centers and \ncritical infrastructure, and reinstituting the Water Resources Council \nto facilitate improvement in Federal water resources planning.\n  Lastly, but certainly not least, in 1994 that very busy National \nAcademy of Sciences issued yet another scathing report, ``Restoring and \nProtecting Marine Habitat: The Role of Engineering and Technology,'' \nwhich finds, among other things, that the Corps and all Federal \nagencies with responsibility for marine habitat management should \nrevise their policies and procedures to increase use of restoration \ntechnologies; take into account which natural functions can be restored \nor facilitated; improve coordination concerning marine resources; \ninclude environmental and economic benefits derived from nonstrucural \nmeasures in benefit/cost ratios of marine habitat projects; and examine \nthe feasibility of improving economic incentives for marine habitat \nrestoration. It has been a long recitation of these reports, but it is \nan amazing record.\n  Over 12 years of analysis on how we can improve the Corps of \nEngineers. During that time, WRDA bills passed in 1996, 1999, and 2000, \nwith the only reform coming in the NAS study I got included in the 2000 \nbill. That is why today is the day to implement the knowledge we have \nfrom all of this expert consideration of the Corps. Today is the day \nfor action.\n  With that history in mind, let me describe what our independent peer \nreview amendment does: No. 1, it requires independent review of \nprojects that are costly, controversial, or critical to public safety. \nUnder my amendment Corps project planning will be independently \nreviewed if the project costs more than $40 million, a Governor \nrequests a review, a Federal agency finds the project will have a \nsignificant adverse impact, or the Secretary of the Army determines \nthat the project is controversial; No. 2, it ensures truly independent \nreview panels by implementing National Academy of Sciences criteria \nabout who would be eligible to provide expert review; No. 3, if \nimplements the recommendation of the 2002 National Academy of Sciences \nreport on peer review that said that independent reviewers should be \ngiven the flexibility to bring important issues to the attention of \ndecisionmakers; No. 4, it includes strict deadlines for reviews. \nReviews are subject to a strict timeline that requires independent \nreview panels to complete the review 180 days after being impaneled or \n90 days following the close of public comment, whichever provides the \nmost time. This timeline balances the need to not delay the planning \nprocess with the need to ensure that the panel will be able to review \nthe full draft study and to consider any relevant public comments; and \nNo. 5, it implements recommendations from the Senate Homeland Security \nand Government Affairs Committee's Katrina report by requiring review \nof the more detailed technical design and construction work for Corps \nflood control projects where failure could jeopardize the public \nsafety.\n  In a nutshell, that is what the amendment does.\n  Mr. President, when you have worked on an issue as long as I have \nworked on Corps reform, you are likely to hear your intentions \nmischaracterized.\n  I wish to address at some point today some of the myths out there \nabout what we are trying to do here. At this point, I inquire whether \nmy cosponsor, the Senator from Arizona, is interested in addressing \nthis issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma wants to speak \nfirst.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, Mr. President, I think the ranking member of the \ncommittee would like to make a short statement, and then it would be \nfine for Senator McCain to go and, after that, Senator Bond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Feingold-McCain \namendment on the Army Corps of Engineers' independent peer review, \nwhich I am proud to cosponsor.\n  For years, we have heard from a variety of reports about the need for \nreforming the Corps, reports that Senator Feingold has elaborated on in \nhis statement.\n  I thank him for his leadership in this issue. In fact, Senator \nFeingold has been a leader on this issue for many years. Through his \nefforts, an amendment was included in the last water resources bill in \n2000 directing the National Academy of Sciences to undertake a 1-year \nstudy on peer review. In the 107th Congress, Senator Feingold \nintroduced a comprehensive Corps reform bill and the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee held a hearing on it.\n  While development of the bill before the Senate today was a bi-\npartisan effort, independent reviews, mitigation and planning, and \nissues considered Corps reform, were not negotiated by the bill's \nmanagers.\n  However, in the previous Congress, the managers were able to reach a \ncompromise agreement on these issues, including peer review, which I \noffered during committee consideration of this bill, but it did not \nprevail.\n  Since committee consideration of the bill, some improvements have \nbeen made to the planning provisions of the bill, due to the work of \nSenator Feingold, and I want to thank him for working with the managers \nto incorporate those revisions.\n  I think many believe there should be independent peer review of Corps \nprojects, the debate is over what form that review should take and \nwhich projects should be reviewed.\n  In fact, the Assistant Secretary of the Army, Mr. Woodley, on March \n31, 2004, in testimony before the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee stated:\n\n       The concept of requiring a peer review is something that \n     should be addressed. We are supportive of requiring outside \n     independent peer review of certain Corps projects. Peer \n     review, where appropriate, would be a very useful tool and \n     add significant credibility to the Corps project analyses and \n     to our ability to judge the merits of a project.\n\n  I think the Feingold-McCain amendment provides the strong, truly \nindependent peer review that is needed to assure that taxpayer dollars \nare being spent on projects that have had the utmost scrutiny and \nunbiased review. The Inhofe/Bond amendment does not.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Feingold, \nCarper, Lieberman, and Jeffords in sponsoring the amendment. This \namendment has been described already by my friend from Wisconsin. I \nwill point out again that it establishes a truly independent system for \nconducting peer review of certain Army Corps projects.\n  As my colleagues know, the Corps comes under intense scrutiny by \nGovernment watchdog agencies and taxpayer groups, including the \nGovernment Accountability Office and the National Academy of Sciences. \nInvestigation after investigation into the Corps' project review \npractices has revealed serious problems with the quality, objectivity, \nand credibility of the Corps when reporting on the economic and \nenvironmental feasibility of proposed water projects. One GAO report \nconcluded in 2006 that the Corps' planning studies ``were fraught with \nerrors, mistakes, and miscalculations, and used invalid assumptions and \noutdated data.'' The same GAO report cited several examples of the \nCorps' failure to properly analyze projects.\n  These include the Sacramento flood protection project. According to \nthe GAO, the Corps didn't fully analyze likely cost increases for the \nSacramento flood protection project or report cost overruns to Congress \nin a\n\n[[Page S7818]]\n\ntimely manner. The GAO found that the estimated cost of the project \noriginally totaled about $114 million but increased to about $500 \nmillion by 2002. By the time the Corps reported those cost increases to \nCongress in 2002, it had already spent or planned to spend more than \ndouble its original estimated cost.\n  The Delaware deepening project: The GAO found that the Corps \nsubstantially overstated the projected economic benefits of the \nDelaware River channel-deepening project. Whereas the Corps estimated \nthe benefits to be $40.1 million per year in 1998, the GAO projected \nonly $13.3 million per year. The GAO urged the Corps to reanalyze the \nproject, which later revealed it could be built for $56 million less \nthan the Corps estimated.\n  The list goes on and on of these projects that have been understated \nin cost, not properly justified. There is not a proper prioritization.\n  Regarding the Corps' analysis of the Oregon Inlet jetty project, \naccording to the GAO, the Corps' analysis of the Oregon Inlet jetty \nproject, issued in 2001, failed to ``consider alternatives to the \nproposed project, used outdated data to estimate benefits to fishing \ntrawlers, and did not account for the effects on smaller fishing \nvessels.''\n  In 2005, the Corps adopted guidelines for conducting external reviews \nof projects. It sounds like a good idea. The current guidelines give \nthe Corps virtually complete discretion to decide what projects should \nbe reviewed from outside the Corps. The so-called peer reviewers \nthemselves are selected by the Corps and in some circumstances can even \nbe Corps employees. According to the American Society of Civil \nEngineers, Corps officials have identified approximately 25 engineering \nstudies as eligible for outside peer review since the peer review \nguidelines were enacted over a year ago, but the Corps has not been \nable to point to any study where an external review was actually \ncarried out.\n  Clearly, the system needs to be fixed. According to this amendment, \nCorps studies would be subject to peer review if the project cost more \nthan $40 million, the Governor of an affected State requests a review, \na Federal agency with statutory authority to review a project finds \nthat it will have significant adverse impact, or the Secretary of the \nArmy determines that the project is controversial.\n  This kind of issue hits home pretty much when we have a situation \nsuch as the catastrophe in New Orleans.\n  According to a March 25, 2006, article in the Washington Post:\n\n       An organization of civil engineers yesterday questioned the \n     soundness of large portions of New Orleans' levee system, \n     warning that the city's federally designed flood walls were \n     not built to standards stringent enough to protect a large \n     city.\n       The group faulted the agency responsible for the levees, \n     the Army Corps of Engineers, for adapting safety standards \n     that were ``too close to the margin'' to protect human life. \n     It also called for an urgent reexamination of the entire \n     levee system, saying there are no assurances that the miles \n     of concrete ``I-walls'' in New Orleans will hold up against \n     even a moderate hurricane.\n\n  We have just experienced an incredible disaster and, apparently, the \nCorps of Engineers is not taking the proper measures to repair it.\n\n       Corps officials said they had already taken steps to \n     address problems identified in the letter, starting with an \n     effort to replace miles of I-walls with sturdier structures. \n     But agency officials insisted the Corps was not solely to \n     blame for weaknesses in the system.\n       ``We have done the best things we could have done. We live \n     here,'' spokeswoman Susan J. Jackson said. . . .\n       The American Society of Civil Engineers panel is one of \n     three independent teams investigating the failure of the New \n     Orleans levees, and until now it has been the most cautious \n     in its public criticisms. The other investigating teams \n     quickly endorsed its findings.\n       ``We agree that every single foot of the I-walls is \n     suspect,'' said Ivor van Heerden, leader of a Louisiana-\n     appointed team of engineers. ``When asked, we have constantly \n     urged anyone returning to New Orleans to exercise caution . . \n     .\n\n  We are talking about a pretty serious situation here.\n  On May 14, 2006, an article entitled ``A Flood of Bad Projects,'' was \nwritten by Mr. Michael Grunwald who is a Washington Post staff writer. \nHe goes on to say:\n\n       In 2000, when I was writing a 50,000-word Washington Post \n     series about dysfunction at the Army Corps of Engineers, I \n     highlighted a $65 million flood control project in Missouri \n     as Exhibit A. Corps documents showed that the project would \n     drain more acres of wetlands than all U.S. developers do in a \n     typical year, but wouldn't stop flooding in the town it was \n     meant to protect. FEMA'S director called it ``a crazy idea''; \n     the Fish and Wildlife Service's regional director called it \n     ``absolutely ridiculous.''\n       Six years later, the project hasn't changed--except for its \n     cost, which has soared to $112 million.\n\n  Remember, Mr. President, originally, it was $65 million.\n\n       Larry Prather, chief of legislative management for the \n     Corps, privately described it in a 2002 e-mail as an \n     ``economic dud with huge environmental consequences.'' \n     Another Corps official called it ``a bad project. Period.'' \n     But the Corps still wants to build it.\n       ``Who can take this seriously?'' Prather asked in his e-\n     mail. That's a good thing question to ask about the entire \n     civil works program of the Corps.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Somehow, America has concluded that the scandal of Katrina \n     was the government's response to the disaster, not the \n     government's contribution to the disaster. The Corps has \n     eluded the public's outrage--even though a useless Corps \n     shipping canal intensified Katrina's surge,--\n\n  Remember that, we have come to the shipping canal intensified \nKatrina's surge--\n\n     even though poorly designed Corps floodwalls collapsed just a \n     few feet from an unnecessary $750 million Corps navigation \n     project, even though the Corps had promoted development in \n     dangerously low-lying New Orleans floodplains and had helped \n     destroy the vast marshes that [surround it.]\n\n  There have been many studies and views of what happened in New \nOrleans. We all know that canal intensified the damage. We all know \nthat the levees were not well built. Some of them, according to other \nnews reports, had already been turned over to the local authorities.\n  What we are asking for is rather modest. I am going to be astonished \nat the response of my dear friends from Missouri and Oklahoma about \nthis because basically all this says is that there would be a peer \nreview if a project costs more than $40 million, and if the Governor of \nan affected State--which seems to be a fairly good Republican principle \nto me--requests a review that it should be allowed, and a Federal \nagency with statutory authority to review a project finds that it will \nhave a significant adverse impact or the Secretary of the Army \ndetermines that the project is controversial.\n  The timing of the review is flexible, but the duration is strictly \nlimited in order to not delay the process. Reviewers will be able to \nconsider all the data, facts, and models used.\n  Finally, the amendment establishes an independent safety assurance \nreview for flood control projects where the public safety could be at \nrisk should the project fail.\n  By the way, that was recommended in the Senate Homeland Security \nCommittee's report on Hurricane Katrina.\n  I would think that the Members of this body, knowing the intense \ncriticism that the Corps of Engineers has come under for years and \nthese dramatic cost overruns time after time--I later may submit for \nthe Record the very long list of cost overruns that have been incurred \ndue to bad estimates to start with--that we would want to have greater \noversight, that we would want to have a peer review system that would \nonly apply to projects over $40 million each and if a Governor of a \nState requests it.\n  If I were in the Corps of Engineers, maybe I would like to continue \nto do business as usual, but I think we showed in New Orleans that we \nare not talking about just cost overruns. We are not just talking about \nfeatherbedding in bureaucracies. We are talking about the lives of our \ncitizens and catastrophes that could take place.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will understand that this amendment is meant to \ntry to improve the image of the Corps of Engineers, to give greater \nconfidence to the taxpayers of America that their tax dollars are being \nwisely spent, and that we will do everything we can to prevent the kind \nof construction and failing that took place in New Orleans which caused \nso much damage, including the construction of a canal that aggravated \ndramatically the disaster that took place.\n  I might add, it was also the Corps of Engineers' projects which \ndepleted the wetlands which have been the natural barrier to hurricanes \nfor hundreds of years, which are disappearing as we\n\n[[Page S7819]]\n\nspeak. As we speak, the wetlands south of Louisiana are being eroded on \na daily basis.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wisconsin for his \ninvolvement in this issue. I hope my colleagues will understand, \nconsidering the rather significant shortfalls and shortcomings we have \nfound involved in the Corps of Engineers, that we would want to support \nan effort for greater accountability and greater transparency and more \ninvolvement by local government.\n  I also remind my colleagues that there are many projects which are on \nthe boards, in planning stages. We will be discussing that when I \npropose my amendment for a process of prioritization for these \nprojects.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent to add the \nfollowing cosponsors to the Inhofe-Bond amendment: Senators Cochran, \nDomenici, and Thune.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, also, I am going to announce what we are \ndoing. We are going to be considering these two amendments, and after \nthe time has expired for both amendments under the time agreement, then \nwe will actually be voting on them side by side. That will take place \nand people will have a choice.\n  I also want to mention that the Senator from Wisconsin and the \nSenator from Arizona acknowledge that the underlying substitute \namendment does improve this situation. I don't think anyone is saying \nthat what we have had in the past is acceptable. It is not acceptable. \nWe are talking about making major changes, and the underlying \nsubstitute amendment does that as well as either of the amendments we \nare considering now.\n  Before I forget to do this, I wish to repeat something I said a \ncouple of days ago. I thank Senator McCain and Senator Feingold and all \nthe members of our committee for working closely together so that this \nvery significant legislation could come to the floor. I think, \nregardless of what amendments are adopted, we are going to have a \ndramatic improvement over the current system.\n  Speaking of thanking people, I thank Senator Bond. He is the one who \nhas been a driving force in this committee. I yield to him at this time \nwhatever time he wants to consume on our amendment or on the Feingold-\nMcCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I just did.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am very grateful to the chairman of the \ncommittee for giving me this opportunity to respond.\n  I was very pleased that my friend from Arizona finally called \nattention to the St. John's Bayou-New Madrid floodway project. This is \na very important project. I invite the Senator out to see it sometime \nbecause this area, a large area of southeast Missouri, was converted to \ncropland in the early 1900s.\n  One can argue whether that was a good idea, but for over a century, \nit has been farmed and farmed successfully. They are not wetlands. \nThere are no wetlands being drained there. This is cropland, and it is \nfarmed. Some of the farming is done by very low economic people. \nMinority communities are located there. The minority community of \nPinhook holds many of the farmers who farm this land.\n  We have had very compelling testimony before the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. When the late Jimmy Robbins, one of the leaders \nof Pinhook, came up and explained that without closing the St. John's \nBayou-New Madrid floodway, every time the river comes up, the river \nfloods Pinhook. The entire community is covered in floodwater. They \nhave to get out high-wheel tractors and large farm tractors to ferry \ntheir children to school, to ferry them back and forth to work, to take \ncare of their basic needs.\n  Do we want to subject these people to continued flooding?\n  My predecessor, Senator Tom Eagleton, back in 1976, proposed bringing \nrelief to the minority communities living in the area that floods when \nthe Mississippi River rises. Guess what. That was a mere 30 years ago \nbecause his project had been reviewed, re-reviewed, replanned, \nchallenged, re-reviewed, re-reviewed, and the people of Pinhook \ncontinued to be flooded.\n  This is not about draining wetlands. This is a problem of what \nhappens to the people who actually live there.\n  The purpose of the project is to protect communities, farmlands, and \nwildlife in a flood-prone area. No wetlands will be drained. The \nmajority of the land has been leveled, improved, irrigated and is not \nfunctioning as wetlands habitat but is functioning as farmland.\n  The Corps has reevaluated operations for fishery habitat for the area \nand determined that this project still exceeds the 1-to-1 benefit-to-\ncost ratio. I can tell you it is a whole lot more expensive than it \nwould have been had the project been done in a timely fashion after \n1976. That is what happens when you study, when you threaten to \nbankrupt local communities trying to pay their share. You put the State \nat great expense to continue these operations.\n  Yes, we should study, and the amendment that has been proposed by \nSenator Inhofe and me provides for review to make sure the review is \naccurate. But to provide the additional bureaucracy, the additional \nhassle that the Feingold-McCain amendment provides does not in any way \nassure that the taxpayers will get a better deal, the environment will \nbe better or that the needs of the people in the communities will be \nbetter satisfied.\n  I want to discuss, very briefly, the technical and scientific \nindependent review amendment offered by Senator Inhofe and me and the \npeer review amendment offered by Senators McCain and Feingold. Although \nthe difference between independent review and independent peer review \nappears to be semantic and minor, when you look at what is in them, you \nsee the difference. Both proposed amendments address Corps reform and \nboth address external review. Nobody is arguing to say there shouldn't \nbe review, that we shouldn't take a look and see what needs to be done \nand how it needs to be done better. Everybody can focus on the problems \nof New Orleans. Well, when you look at the problems of New Orleans, \nthere are many factors that go into account. We are not going to \naddress those here. But you take a look at how money was spent locally \nthat was supposed to be spent on levees, and you take a look at the \ndecisions made along the way that were not well made.\n\n  Senator Inhofe and I have offered an amendment which is before us \nthat is going to require an independent review by qualified, interested \nexperts, compiled by the National Academy of Sciences, and the review \nwill occur throughout the entire process. In other words, people such \nas representatives from the National Academy of Sciences, the IRC, the \nAmerican Society of Civil Engineers, will be focusing on the project as \nit is developed. There are many stages in the development of these \nprojects, and they need to be reviewed to make sure the work that is \nbeing done by the Corps is being done accurately.\n  This is a general operation of what happens before you go to a \ndecision to move forward. There is the chief's report; it is referred. \nThere are letters, OSA reviews, the Office of Management and Budget \nreviews, the Office of Management and Budget has to clear it, the \nAssistant Secretary of the Army recommends it to Congress, and then \nCongress approves it. All of these steps--there are about 103 separate \nsteps that have to be followed. So it comes to the Congress as a \npolicymaker to decide whether it is an appropriate policy. But all \nalong that path, we want to have people who are scientifically \nqualified to make sure that if they are building a levee, they build a \nlevee that will hold as projected. If they are building a lock, they \nwant to make sure it will hold water, that it will be sound, that it \nwill be safe, whether it is a levee or a lock.\n  As a result of the admission from the Corps that some of the problems \nexisted with the planning and construction of the New Orleans levees, \nno one--not even the Corps--is denying that realistic reform is an \nimportant component of this WRDA bill. The challenge is to enact \nrealistic reform that provides sufficient project review without \ncreating unnecessary costs.\n\n[[Page S7820]]\n\n  The Inhofe-Bond amendment proposed does just that. It provides reform \nthat will establish greater accountability and assure us that \nscientific, technical standards are observed without adding unjustified \ndelays and costs.\n  The peer review panels in the Feingold-McCain amendment are not \nclearly restricted to reviewing the scientific and engineering basis. \nThe panels are permitted to get into policy, value, public controversy, \nand make the decisions that Congress and the local community are \nsupposed to make. The local community decides whether to support it. \nCongress makes a policy decision. Congress has provided already for \npublic hearings, public comment. Yesterday I went through the process \nof the number of meetings that had been held with Governors, with \npublic hearings on the locks projects on the upper Mississippi, with \nthe number of comments, the number of people who participated. There is \ntremendous public participation and input. Setting up a separate body \nto judge that input, rather than the Congress, is not, I think, good \npolicy. We are supposed to make the policy based on the best scientific \nrecommendations we can get. OMB has a crack at the policy when they \nsend it up. But these policy reviews would be second-guessing the \nscientific decisions.\n  Let's think about how this would play out in the transition. Once the \ncomment period moves beyond the technicality and the science, what \nindependent experts are dictating the project approval? We should not \ndilute public review by giving technocrats a larger role in policy \nrecommendations than is given to the general public. There is a reason \nwhy we rely upon the appropriate training and expertise of the people \nwho are generating the process to develop and construct our \ninfrastructure and safety needs.\n  Let's take a look at the local cost share that would go into the \nFeingold-McCain process. It doesn't even provide for integration of \npeer review until the end of the process. Making sure that the \nindependent review begins as the process goes forward is the way that \nwe assure the process is better. We want integration of the review all \nthroughout before you make a major mistake and go off in the wrong \ndirection. When you wait to have end-of-the-line peer review--does it \nmake any sense to wait until a car is coming off of an assembly line, \nis rolled off the assembly line, to test to make sure that the lights \nwork and the switches work? You test them before you put them into the \ncar. That is what we are doing, we test along the line to make sure \nthat what you are putting into the process works. You don't want to put \ncomponents into a car only to find out, Hey, the lights don't work, the \nswitches don't work, and then have to start tearing the car apart.\n  That is what the Feingold-McCain amendment does. It is end-of-the-\nline peer review. It invites multiple passes through the study process \nwith unacceptable expense and delay, and it would, in effect, become a \nsecond study process. The first go-round, the local cost share, would \nincrease, because they have to pay for it, the locals have to pay for \nit. It takes 1 to 3 years to go through the process in the first place, \nand then you start a peer review at the end and it could take another \nperiod of time, and if they send it back, you start it 1 to 3 years \nover. That becomes extremely expensive for the local cosponsors. It \nbecomes extremely expensive for the taxpayers who are paying for the \ntab if you redo it without reviewing the project as you go forward. \nDoubling the time and moving the costs of a project outside of the \nrealm of the local community's ability to pay makes no sense.\n  Now, of course, beyond the peer review process, there is the \ncongressional process. Congress must authorize and fund studies on each \nproject and then authorize and appropriate funds to construct each \nproject. As we all know, the congressional process does take years. If \nmy ancient memory serves me, this is the 2002 Water Resources \nDevelopment Act. This was the bill that was due in 2002. Here we are 4 \nyears later. Don't let anybody tell you that Congress doesn't review it \nand review it and review it and review it until it is lying on the \nfloor gasping for breath.\n  The amendment Senator Inhofe and I propose establishes a peer review \npanel that provides a safety net. We are elected to represent the \ninterests of constituents. We are not appointed bureaucrats. The \namendment takes away our authority to act on behalf of our constituents \nand meet the needs of our local communities. It removes the checks and \nbalances set forth in our Constitution by shifting power away to other \npeople.\n\n  Now, why do we wait until the end of the line to do this peer review \nin the first place? The collaborative solutions to urgent flood and \nstorm control and other important questions would be moved to the end \nof the process and sent back to the drawing board.\n  Let's try another analogy. We test our schoolchildren throughout each \ngrade level and assess their progress. If a child has difficulty \nreading, it is flagged, and intervention and extra help should be \nprovided. We do not wait until students reach the end of the eighth \ngrade and then test them to see if they have learned to read in the \nfirst grade and send them back to the first grade. You ought to be \ntesting them each year to make sure they are proficient, and you ought \nto be testing the hypotheses of this process throughout.\n  Common sense says that independent review is effective only if it is \nused throughout the process. Can you imagine an employee working on a \nproject and planning for several years, and then during the end-of-the-\nline review finding a technical error and having to go back to the \nbeginning? Not only is that unnecessarily delaying and expensive, but \nit kills the motivation of employees, and it delays. I, along with \nSenator Inhofe, propose independent peer review during this study \nprocess.\n  One other thing, the inclusion of the expectation of litigation. \nTheir amendment talks about judicial review and invites judicial \nreview. Well, that is another cost adder that will continue to impose \nburdens on communities and delay the effectiveness of the ability to \nconstruct needed projects. With the clear-cut incentives to litigate, \nwe are going to see more lawsuits and less projects. Clear-cut \nopportunities to litigate, if the committee is unhappy with the chief's \nreport, will only complicate the cost-benefit analysis, when it is \nalready too challenging to place a value on human life and the economic \nlifeline of the country. The Corps study process already takes too long \nand will be too expensive, and it will continue to delay the progress \nwe need.\n  Media reports and editorials have criticized what went on, and they \nplay the blame game--they burden the Corps with the blame. But Senators \nshould understand that the Corps needs to have an improved process, and \nwe are going to do our best to make sure that process is driven by \nsound science throughout the process.\n  About 80 of our colleagues signed a letter saying, Bring this bill to \nthe floor. The 80 colleagues who are signed on to that letter believe \nthey have projects in their communities, in their States, that are \nimportant. If you wish to continue to delay the passage of the WRDA \nbill for another 2, 4, 6, 8 years, then forget about the environmental \nbenefits--the environmental benefits which are more than half of the \nauthorization of this project, and the environmental benefits which the \nAudubon Society, the Nature Conservancy, and other responsible \nenvironmental groups say need to happen. Trying to delay the bill or \ntrying to delay the process of implementation of Corps studies and \nrecommendations is very costly and denies us the ability to accomplish \nthings that are important for the safety, the well-being of our \ncommunities and the people who live in them.\n  Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to oppose the Feingold-McCain \namendment and to support the Inhofe-Bond amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we had a list of people wanting to be \nheard. It is my understanding the Senator from Montana wants to be \nheard, and that would come from the minority time on general debate.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes.\n  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Montana, the \nranking member of the Subcommittee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, over 70 years ago one of Montana's most \nrenowned political figures, Senator Burton K. Wheeler, attended a \nmeeting\n\n[[Page S7821]]\n\nwith President Franklin D. Roosevelt where be proposed building the \nFort Peck Dam in Central Montana. Fort Peck would be the largest \nhydraulic earth-filled dam in the world requiring over 11,000 workers \nat peak construction. At a pricetag of $75 million, the cost of \nconstruction was large even by today's standards. Fifteen minutes after \nSenator Wheeler's meeting with President Roosevelt had begun, Senator \nWheeler walked out with a promise from President Roosevelt to have the \nArmy Corps of Engineers build Fort Peck Dam. Construction began in \n1933.\n  While it has taken this Congress significantly longer than it did \nSenator Wheeler to advance the water resource needs of the Nation, I am \npleased to have worked with my colleagues--Senators Inhofe, Jeffords, \nand Bond--to bring the Water Resources Development Act of 2005 to the \nfloor.\n  It has been nearly 6 years since the last WRDA bill was signed into \nlaw. Protection of public safety, continued growth of the economy, and \nthe restoration of the environment depend on our timely action.\n  Much has changed since the Corps constructed Fort Peck Dam. Today \nmuch of the Corps work in Montana is focused on ecosystem restoration. \nThat is why I included a provision in this bill that will allow the \nCorps to plan conservation projects on the Yellowstone River that are \nidentified in the course of the Yellowstone River Cumulative Effects \nStudy. A cumulative effects study has been ongoing along the \nYellowstone River for several years, authorized by WRDA 1999. This \nstudy has been very successful, and has involved close collaboration \nwith the State of Montana, the Yellowstone Conservation District \nCouncil, and local conservation districts, among many others. The \nprovision included in the bill today would provide the Corps with the \nauthority to move forward with planning, design and construction of \necosystem restoration projects along the Yellowstone as they are \nidentified by the cumulative effects study. It is so important. All \nthese factors work together. It provides for public participation in \nthe selection of projects, and consultation with the State of Montana, \nthe Yellowstone Conservation District Council, and others.\n\n  The Yellowstone is the longest free flowing river in the county. Much \nof southern and eastern Montana depends on the health of the \nYellowstone River. It irrigates fields, provides world-class fishing, \nsustains the tourism sector, and supplies clean drinking water. It is a \nsource of great pride and economic strength for all Montana. This \nprovision will protect the Yellowstone and Montana's recreational \nheritage for generations to come.\n  While the Corps' mission has evolved to include ecosystem \nrestoration, part of the Corps' central mission is to develop our water \nresources to maintain our economic competitiveness. Economic \ndevelopment and ecosystem restoration used to be thought of as mutually \nexclusive. No more. This view is needlessly divisive. This bill \nincludes a provision that has brought together both irrigators and \nenvironmentalists. The Intake project on the Yellowstone River will \nauthorize the Corps to work with the Bureau of Reclamation in the \ndesign and construction of a dam and diversion works that will help \nboth farmers and endangered fish. Rebuilding the dam at Intake will \nguarantee farmers water for their crops and allow the endangered \nsturgeon to pass through the dam, opening 238 miles of river habitat \nfor the endangered fish.\n\n  This bill also includes urgently needed hurricane protection and \ncoastal restoration projects for the State of Louisiana. Indeed, this \nbill authorizes the Corps in consultation with the Governor of \nLouisiana to create a comprehensive ecosystem restoration plan for \nLouisiana to rehabilitate coastal barrier islands and wetlands that \nserve as natural hurricane barriers.\n  Unfortunately, some things at the Corps have not changed. In 1938 the \nFort Peck Dam tragically failed. Thirty-four workers were swept away in \na landslide. Eight lost their lives. The landslide was the result of \ninaccurate soils and foundation analysis. If we do not learn the \nlessons of history, we are doomed to repeat them.\n  Sixty-seven years later as Hurricane Katrina bared down on the city \nof New Orleans, floodwalls around New Orleans failed because of faulty \nsoils analysis. What makes this event even more tragic is that an \ninternal Corps study predicted exactly how the floodwalls would fail, \nand it went unread. The underlying bill does not go far enough to \nensure that the Corps learns from the tragedy of Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita. The Corps needs a robust program of independent peer review and \nproject prioritization. The Corps currently has a $58 billion project \nbacklog and a $2 billion a year project budget. At that pace it would \ntake the Corps roughly 30 years just to work through the backlog of \nprojects. With limited Federal resources, it is important that the \nCorps separate the wheat from the chaff.\n  In fact I would like to see the prioritization framework extended to \ncover not only construction projects but ongoing operational activities \nof the Corps as well. Recreation on the Missouri River generates nearly \n$85 million a year, while the barge industry provides only $9 million a \nyear. Despite this disparity, the Corps continues to maintain at least \na 6-month navigation season on the Missouri unless total water system \nstorage on the Missouri drops below 31 million acre feet. That is dryer \nthan a dust bowl drought. It makes no sense to waste precious taxpayer \nand water resources to maintain a navigation season on the Missouri in \ndrought years. That is why I was pleased to work with Senators Feingold \nand McCain to include a provision in their project prioritization \namendment that directs the Water Resources Planning Coordinating \nCommittee to recommend to Congress a process for prioritizing ongoing \noperational activities of the Corps.\n  I am proud of the work my colleagues and I have done on this bill. \nIt's been nearly 6 years in the making, but it has a solid base. This \nbill keeps our economy competitive. It restores fisheries along the \nYellowstone River so our kids can enjoy the great outdoors. It protects \nthe gulf coast from the ravages of hurricanes. But it can do more. With \nthe right amendments, it can reform the way the Corps does business to \nrebuild the floodwalls of New Orleans and the public's trust in the \nCorps.\n  I very much hope this amendment succeeds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield time to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I speak in opposition to the Inhofe-Bond \namendment. I would like to make it very clear that the Inhofe-Bond \namendment is not an independent review amendment. In fact, it is \nbusiness as usual.\n  We have an expansion of a system that has never worked before and \nwill continue to fail in the future because we are putting the fox in \ncharge of the hen house. We are putting the Corps of Engineers in \ncharge of reviewing their own work.\n  To begin with, I hesitate to call it an independent peer review \namendment, considering that the amendment directs the Chief of \nEngineers to select the panels, guaranteeing that the panels will not \nbe independent. The amendment makes the Chief of Engineers the final \narbiter of whether an independent review will happen at all. The Corps \ngets to select the reviewers. There are no criteria at all for ensuring \nindependence of those reviewers. Review is not independent if the Corps \nhas control over whether, how, and who will review the projects. Their \nversion, according to the Inhofe-Bond amendment, would be prepared by \nthe Corps, controlled by the Corps, evaluated by the Corps, and \nreported by the Corps, locking out input from other relevant water \nresources agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Putting the structure of the review aside, let's look more closely at \nwhat requirements would need to be met in order to trigger a review of \na Corps project. According to the Inhofe-Bond amendment, it gives the \nCorps complete discretion to avoid review of most projects. Review is \nmandatory only for projects costing more than $100 million. Inhofe-Bond \nlets the Corps ignore Governor and agency requests for review. Inhofe-\nBond prohibits review of the Corps' project proposal. Reviews could \nonly examine scientific, engineering or technical bases of the\n\n[[Page S7822]]\n\ndecision or recommendation but not the recommendations resulting from \nthat data. The environment review accompanying a feasibility study \nwould not be subject to review.\n  The Inhofe-Bond amendment prohibits reassessment of key models and \ndata. This permanent moratorium guarantees that the Corps will continue \nto use models that are widely recognized as inaccurate and flawed.\n  Mr. President, I think events of New Orleans cry out for independent \nreview and outside scrutiny. It is alarming what we have found out, \nafter some of the hubbub concerning Katrina has died down.\n\n       After Katrina, the Corps of Engineers said that all of its \n     failed flood walls had been overtopped by a hurricane too \n     powerful for the Category 3 protection authorized by \n     Congress, while [the President's] critics said the \n     administration budget cuts had hamstrung the Corps.\n       Both were wrong. Katrina was no stronger than Category 2 \n     when it hit New Orleans, and many corps [flood walls] \n     collapsed even though they were not overtopped. [President] \n     Bush's proposed budget cuts were largely ignored, and were \n     mostly irrelevant to the city's flood protection. New Orleans \n     was betrayed by the Corps and its friends in Congress.\n       The Corps helped set the stage for the disaster decades ago \n     by imprisoning the Mississippi River behind giant levees. \n     Those levees helped protect St. Louis, Memphis and even New \n     Orleans from river flooding, but they reduced the amount of \n     silt the river carries to its delta, curtailing the land-\n     building process that creates marshes and swamps along the \n     Louisiana coast. Those wetlands serve as hurricane speed \n     bumps--in Katrina, levees with natural buffers had much \n     higher survival rates--but they have been vanishing at a rate \n     of 24 square miles per year.\n\n  Mr. President, the record of the Corps of Engineers cries out for \nindependent review and scrutiny and a prioritization of projects. I \nquote from the Washington Post editorial of Wednesday, June 7, 2006:\n\n       Last week the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers admitted \n     responsibility for much of the destruction of New Orleans. It \n     was not true, as the Corps initially had claimed, that its \n     defenses failed because Congress had authorized only Category \n     3 protection, with the result that Hurricane Katrina \n     overtopped the city's floodwalls. Rather, Katrina was no \n     stronger than a Category 2 storm by the time it came ashore, \n     and many of the floodwalls let water in because they \n     collapsed, not because they weren't high enough. As the \n     Corps' own inquiry found, the agency committed numerous \n     mistakes of design. Its network of pumps, walls and levees \n     was ``a system in name only.'' It failed to take into account \n     the gradual sinking of the local soil; it closed its ears \n     when people pointed out these problems. The result was a \n     national tragedy.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will do everything in their power to make sure \nwe never see a repeat of this. There are admitted failures in the \nprocess, and I respect the effort of my colleagues from Oklahoma and \nMissouri to make some changes. But our argument is it is not enough. It \nis not enough. Virtually every environmental organization in America \nsupports this amendment. Virtually every outside organization supports \nthis amendment. The administration supports this amendment.\n\n  I hope that we would make sure that we can tell our constituents and \nthe people who live in areas that may be buffeted by hurricanes or \nother natural disasters, particularly as we enter another what is \npredicted to be a heavy hurricane season, that at least in future \nprojects, we have installed a proper system of scrutiny and oversight--\nnot only so their tax dollars aren't wasted but, far more important, \nthat they don't experience an unnecessary disaster.\n  I urge we adopt the amendment of Senator Feingold and myself and \nreject the Inhofe-Bond amendment.\n  I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senator from \nIowa is here, but I don't see him. Let me do this. We don't have any \nother speakers requesting time.\n  Yesterday, Senator Bond had printed in the Record the National \nWaterways Alliance letter that we received, dated June 30 of this year, \nwherein they were strongly requesting the passage of the WRDA bill \nwhich--I think we all are in agreement on that. We have not had a \nreauthorization since the year 2000.\n  They also say they want us to accept the Inhofe-Bond amendment and \nreject the Feingold-McCain Corps reform. I bring this up because the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona commented about a lot of groups that \nwere in favor of their amendment. But there are 288 organizations--\nlabor organizations, Chamber organizations, waterway organizations of \nthe National Waterway Alliance. I will go ahead and read a few:\n  American Farm Bureau Federation, American Shore and Beach \nPreservation Association, Arkansas Basin Development Association--this \nis kind of interesting. A lot of people don't realize my State of \nOklahoma is navigable. We have a port. It comes up through the Arkansas \nRiver, comes across from the Mississippi into Arkansas and up to my \nhome town of Tulsa, OK. Obviously, they are in support of this, too.\n  The California Coastal Coalition, the Carpenters' District Council of \nGreater Saint Louis and Vicinity, Grain & Feed Association of Illinois, \nthe Harris County Flood Control District of Texas, the Illinois Chamber \nof Commerce, Illinois Corn Growers Association, and many of the \nIllinois--almost every organization in Illinois, I believe; the \nInternational Union of Operating Engineers, Iowa Corn Growers \nAssociation, Iowa Farm Bureau Federation, Iowa Renewable Fuels \nAssociation, Johnson Terminal in Muskogee, OK, Kansas Corn Growers, \nKentucky Corn Growers, the Long Island Coastal Alliance, Louisiana \nDepartment of Transportation and Development, Maritime Association of \nthe Port of New York and New Jersey, Maritime Exchange for the Delaware \nRiver and Bay, the Mid-Central Illinois Regional Council of Carpenters, \nMissouri Farm Bureau Federation, Mississippi Welders Supply, \nIncorporated, the Missouri Corn Growers Association, Missouri Levee & \nDrainage District Association, National Association of Manufacturers, \nNational Association of Waterfront Employees, National Corn Growers \nAssociation, National Grain & Feed Association, National Grain Trade \nCouncil, National Grange, National Heavy & Highway Alliance, Laborers' \nInternational Union of North America, International Union of Operating \nEngineers, United Brotherhood of Carpenters & Joiners, International \nAssociation of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental & Reinforcing Iron Works \nof America, Operative Plasterers' & Cement Mason International \nAssociation, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and the \nInternational Union, Brickyard Layers & Allied Craftworkers.\n\n  The list goes on and on, including, of course, our State of Oklahoma \nDepartment of Transportation.\n  I guess what I am saying here is most States--the National Farm \nBureau as well as the American Farm Bureau and individual State farm \nbureaus--are all in support of the Inhofe-Bond amendment and they are \nall opposed to the Feingold-McCain amendment. I don't want people to \nthink these organizations are ambivalent. They are strongly in support \nof our approach.\n  Again, we all agree on one thing: that is, the need to make some \nimprovements. We like our peer review system better, and we will have \nample time to talk about that.\n  I understand Senator Grassley is here. I yield whatever time he wants \nto take and suggest it come off the general debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  I appreciate very much the opportunity to discuss the issue of the \nWater Resources Development Act and particularly that part of the act \nthat deals with the improvement of transportation on the Mississippi \nRiver because that improvement is very essential not only to the \neconomy of Iowa but to the economy of the whole Midwest, and in turn \nthat relates to the economy of the United States.\n  Most importantly, it affects the economy--meaning the economic \ncompetitiveness of our industry and agriculture, and primarily \nagriculture with competition around the world, and particularly that, \nas I see it, of Brazil. Brazil is becoming very much a competitor with \nthe Midwest of the United States in the production of a lot of grains, \nparticularly soybeans.\n  I owe a thank you, particularly to Senators Bond and Inhofe, for \ntheir strong leadership in moving this legislation forward.\n\n[[Page S7823]]\n\n  This used to happen every 2 years, a bill called the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act. But we have not dealt with this issue since the year \n2000. This bill is not only long overdue, but it is a very important \nbill. Not only does the bill which is before us include many updates in \nexisting authorized projects, but it also authorizes new projects \nthroughout the country.\n  Several examples of these much-needed projects beyond the ones I am \ngoing to emphasize are the coastal wetland restorations, but the one I \nwant to emphasize the improvement of is the Upper Mississippi and \nIllinois Rivers. Coastal wetland restoration will help protect our \ninland waterways. We think, maybe too often, of that as being an \nenvironmental issue, but it is also about protecting our inland \nwaterways, making sure that there is a multiple use of the rivers, \nrecreation, food, as well as commerce.\n  In the process of the wetland restoration protecting our offshore \nenergy supply, we provide much-needed flood protection in the gulf \ncoast region. But for my State and the Midwest generally, the Upper \nMississippi and Illinois River navigation and ecosystem investments are \nalso very vital because of the multipurpose use of the river. Of \ncourse, Iowa is bounded on the east side by the Mississippi River for \nthe entire north and west distance of our State. And Iowa, as well as \nthe Nation, relies on the river to move both goods that are \ndomestically oriented and distributed as well as goods that are \ninternationally distributed.\n  The United States enjoys a comparative advantage in corn production \nworldwide. My State is also the No. 1 producer of corn, and usually we \nare also the No. 1 producer of soybeans.\n  In regard to corn production, the per-ton cost of transporting corn \nin the United States is lower than any other country. But our country \nmust not allow its transportation infrastructure to continue to \ndeteriorate. Quite frankly, that is what this legislation is all about. \nBecause of deterioration, it needs to be enhanced, it needs to be \nimproved, and it needs to be kept up to date. Our international \ncompetitors are making major investments in their transportation \nsystems.\n  In Brazil, surface transportation--meaning railroads and highways, \nprimarily highways--is very much inferior to ours. In March, I took a \ntrip to Brazil. I can tell you that when we were out in the \ncountryside, what we would call rural Brazil, we ran into more potholes \nthan you could count, something that farmers of Iowa would not \nanticipate or tolerate from our local officials. You wonder how local \nofficials get reelected because they are not going to be reelected \nbecause of filling potholes. But Brazil, on the other hand, as far as \ntheir river transportation, brings into question the competitive \nadvantage the United States might have that we could be losing. Brazil \nhas made significant investments in its river infrastructure. They do \nnot have to have locks and dams, such as we do on the Mississippi, in \nthe case of the Amazon. I saw facilities on my trip to Brazil on the \nAmazon that we could be very jealous of, the opportunity to bring \ncommercial seagoing ships up the Amazon to load in Brazil on the Amazon \nand coming in this far with very major terminals for loading primarily \nsoybeans, but also they can go up the river as well.\n\n  There is a new facility being built at this point. I believe these \nships go even further up. But at least I wanted to be sure of here and \nhere that it is possible to load those ships at that point. They don't \nhave to use barges as we do from Iowa to New Orleans to load. This \nwould be the equivalent of our being able to take oceangoing ships up \nto Memphis to load for soybeans.\n  You can understand then that we have this lock and dam situation that \nmakes it possible for us to use the Mississippi River for major \ntransportation. Keeping that up to date is very important if we are \ngoing to be economically competitive with how they can move their \nagricultural products--primarily soybeans--out of Brazil into the world \ntrade.\n  What they don't have that we have is very good roads, although they \nare improving them. They don't have the railroad system we have in the \nUnited States that makes it possible for us to get our grain very \neasily to the Mississippi River or using railroads to get it down to \nthe gulf. But they are working on that. Right now we are competitive \nbecause they do not have that land infrastructure we have. When they \nget that, we will have a hard time competing.\n  That brings up the point of this legislation and getting it passed, \nto make sure our Mississippi infrastructure is up to date. We must \ninvest in major improvements in all of our transportation \ninfrastructure. If we don't make these investments in our roads, our \nrails and water, the U.S. agricultural industry and labor will pay the \nprice.\n  Last year we did a lot to help with surface transportation, primarily \nreferred to as the highway bill, although maybe not entirely highways. \nWe provided $295 billion for road, transit, and rail improvements in \nthat bill we passed last year. These funds will help facilitate the \nmovement of our goods. The surface transportation bill will help \nalleviate congestion so our trucks can move more efficiently.\n  It also provides additional loan authority and tax credit to help \nrailroads invest in much-needed capital improvements and to help meet \nthe large demands for their services.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, last year U.S. \nexports of goods and services totaled $1.275 trillion compared to \n$1.115 trillion in 2004 and $1.023 trillion in the year 2003.\n  You can see very much an enhancement in value of our exports from the \nUnited States according to the Congressional Research Service. Of \ncourse, our consumers and our manufacturers, and to some extent food \nsupply, rely upon importing goods into the United States. But whether \nit is exports or imports, whether it is consumers or input into \nmanufacturing and agriculture, many of these goods travel on our inland \nwaterways.\n  Again, emphasizing the need to get this legislation passed, because \nit is also forecast to beat our exports and imports are going to \ncontinue to grow in the future, we must be able to efficiently and \neconomically move these goods.\n  When I get more parochial in my economic observance of the need of \nthis legislation, it is because nearly two-thirds of all grain as well \nas soybean exports are moved through the Mississippi and Illinois \nRivers. According to one study, unless the Army Corps of Engineers \nmodernizes, which means Congress giving them the ability to do it, \nunless we modernize the lock and dam system on the Upper Mississippi \nand the Illinois Rivers, the cost of transporting just one commodity, \ncorn, to the export market would rise by 17 cents per bushel.\n  As a result, corn and soybean exports would decline by 68 million and \n10 million bushels per year, respectively, and the decline in corn and \nsoybean exports would reduce farm income by $246 million. This \nhighlights how important barge transportation is to the farmers but in \nturn to the economy generally.\n  In addition, there are many environmental benefits to river \ntransportation. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, \ntowboats might have 35 to 60 percent fewer pollutants than either train \nlocomotives or our big semitrucks in transporting anything, but \nparticularly in regard to what I am talking about, the necessity of \nmoving grain. A color chart used by the Senator from Missouri shows the \nsame thing. I have a black-and-white chart. The information is the \nsame, but it is cheaper to make white charts than it is colored charts.\n\n  It shows one barge can move what 15 jumbo hopper cars of railroads \ncan move or what 58 large semis can move. Not only is that an \nenvironmental issue, that is an issue of economy of moving a product. \nMost importantly, when you are waiting for a long train at a crossing, \nthink in terms of fewer hopper cars because of what one barge can move. \nOf all of the trucks you meet on the interstate or the two-lane \nhighways of the Midwest, think how many more there would be if we did \nnot have transportation to the gulf by barge. If you have 15 of these \nbarges being pushed by one motor, you would have 2.25 miles of train, \n180 cars or, in this case, 870 large semis.\n  I hope everyone can see that moving a lot of merchandise to export on \nthe Mississippi River is taking an awful lot of pressure off the \nhighways, an awful lot of pressure off of the railroads. It is \nenvironmentally sound in the process.\n\n[[Page S7824]]\n\n  The Army Corps of Engineers data suggests that the Nation currently \nsaves $100 to $300 million in air pollution abatement when moving bulk \ncommodities by barge through the Mississippi River system. In these \ntimes of high fuel prices and with the need to conserve energy, one \ngallon of fuel in a towboat can carry one ton of freight 2.5 times \nfurther than rail and nine times further than trucks.\n  Quoting the Minnesota Department of Transportation estimate, shifting \nfrom barge to rail results in fuel usage emissions and probable \naccident increases by the following percentages: 331-percent fuel \nusage; 470 percent less emissions; and 290 percent less probable \naccidents. Shifting traffic from barge to trucks increases fuel use 826 \npercent, emissions 709 percent, and probable accidents by 5.967 \npercent. In addition, another 1,333 heavy trucks would be added to our \nalready congested roads.\n  For these above reasons, we have this legislation before the Senate. \nSeveral of my Senate colleagues for many years have been seeking \nauthorization for this lock and dam modernization as well as enhanced \nenvironmental restoration of the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. To \nget that done, we have to get this bill to the President for his \nsignature.\n  I am very pleased the Committee on Environment and Public Works \nincluded these important initiatives in this Water Resources \nDevelopment Act and that a truly bipartisan group of Senators is \nadvocating for this important modernization. If anyone believes it is \nalways Republicans attacking Democrats and Democrats attacking \nRepublicans, this is an ideal initiative that shows how widespread \nbipartisan support and cooperation can be in this Senate when there is \na national emergency. That national emergency is environmental, the \nnational emergency is for our economy to be competitive, the national \nemergency is safety on our highways, to relieve glut on our railroads. \nIt is all around.\n  This is a bipartisan effort to cooperate for the good of this Nation \nbecause this lock-and-dam system of the Upper Mississippi River was \nbuilt in the late 1930s, I suppose over a period of a few decades. But \nmany lock chambers are only 600 feet long and cannot accommodate the \nbarges we are talking about used in the modern day to get things into \nthe international market. These structures require a modernization \nbecause there is a tow configuration that needs a double lock to pass. \nThis adds to mounting delay time when we do not have the modernization. \nIt amounts to increased costs to the shippers, increased harm to our \nenvironment with higher emissions and higher sediment suspensions in \nthe river channel, the loss of jobs when we are not competitive, and \nlower wages when we are not competitive.\n  Increased traffic levels without these improvements will result in \ngross farm revenue loss of over $105 million per year. This does not \ntake into account the huge cost of increased highway and rail \ntransportation.\n  We realize the authorization of the lock-and-dam improvements is a \nfirst step in a lengthy process, but it is a necessary step and one \nthat a bipartisan group of Senators, an increasing number of Senators \nin a bipartisan way, has been working on for a few years.\n  It is an important and necessary project for our Nation. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for this balanced legislation, not to vote for any \namendments that are going to dilute it or harm it in any way. When we \nget this number of Senators working together in a bipartisan fashion, \nthis ought to be a test of something that is needed, a test of \nsomething that is good, something to move forward on. It is balanced \nlegislation and, of course, it is good for the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nin support of the bill. The Senator from Iowa is in support of the \nInhofe-Bond amendment and opposed to the Feingold-McCain amendment. I \nremind him that virtually every organization in Iowa, including the \nIowa Renewable Fuels Association, Iowa Farm Bureau Federation, Iowa \nCorn Growers Association, and others, are in support of the Bond-Inhofe \namendment.\n  I also make a request, and I am sure others will join, asking Members \nto come to the Senate if they want to speak on either of the two \namendments that are being discussed right now.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Burns as a cosponsor of the \nInhofe-Bond amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is my understanding Senator Hatch is going to be \nmaking a request to be heard as if in morning business for 15 minutes. \nBecause of the time constrains we are operating under, I will ask that \ntime be taken off of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hatch are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNew York, who will speak in morning business, but I understand the time \nwill be charged to my side of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, first, I thank my colleague for \nyielding time generously, as he always does, and note that I support \nhis amendment and look forward to voting on it.\n  (The remarks of Mr. SCHUMER are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4682\n\n     (Purpose: To modify a section relating to independent reviews)\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily set aside, and I call up amendment No. 4682.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] for himself, Mr. \n     Bond, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Thune, Mr. Domenici, and Mr. Burns, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4682.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that the time until 2:30 be for \nconcurrent debate on the pending Feingold-McCain amendment and the \npending Inhofe-Bond amendment and be equally divided between the bill \nmanagers or their designees, and that at 2:30 the Senate proceed to a \nvote in relation to amendment No. 4681, to be followed by a vote in \nrelation to the Inhofe-Bond amendment, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. For clarification, I encourage Members to come down \nbecause our time is running out. It is confusing when you have two \namendments that you are using the same time for. So essentially the \ntime that we would have in favor of the Inhofe-Bond amendment would be \nthe same as the time in opposition to the Feingold-McCain amendment. I \nappreciate the Senator from Wisconsin for his cooperation in moving \nthis along.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nhis continued cooperation in the way in which this debate is \nproceeding. I will use a few minutes of my time to bring us back to the \ndebate on these two amendments that are before us. First, to make it \nabsolutely clear to people that the amendment that Senator McCain and I \nare offering certainly would not slow down the bill in any way or \ndelude the bill; we have a time agreement. However, it turns out the \nlegislation will go forward and there is an obvious expectation that \nthe bill will pass. In light of the remarks of the Senator from Iowa, I \nwant to make it clear to people that this in no way is going to somehow \nstop the bill from going through this body. We will let the chips fall \nwhere they may based on the results of the\n\n[[Page S7825]]\n\nvotes, but there is no slowing down of the bill.\n  Secondly, I was struck by the response to our amendment. Senator \nMcCain and I laid out some pretty damning evidence about what the Army \nCorps of Engineers' role may have been in the Katrina disaster, which \neverybody admits is one of the worst disasters in the history of our \ncountry. I think the Senator from Missouri indicated that he didn't \nthink we ought to engage in a blame game. I wouldn't call it a blame \ngame, but somebody has to be held responsible. We have to acknowledge \nwhat might have caused this horrendous problem, and the evidence is \noverwhelming. Just as FEMA's performance was abysmal, so, too, was the \nrole of the Army Corps of Engineers in properly establishing levees and \nother engineering that had to be done. And it may well have been \nsignificantly responsible for the tragedy that occurred in New Orleans. \nI don't know if they plan to mount a response to that, but I hope the \nrecord makes it clear that this New Orleans situation is Exhibit A in \nthe kinds of problems that can occur if you don't have appropriate \nreview of these Army Corps of Engineers projects.\n  I wanted to also respond to some of the specific issues the Senator \nfrom Missouri spoke about. He talked about what issues an independent \nreview group could consider. I want to make it very clear. Under my \namendment, which directly implements the recommendations of the 2002 \nNational Academy of Sciences' report on peer review, independent panels \nwill ensure that the Corps' proposed approach to a problem will work to \nresolve the identified problem and not cause unintended adverse \nconsequences. Independent review panels will not take away any \ndecisionmaking responsibilities. I want to be clear on that because a \ncouple of the comments today could at least be interpreted to suggest \nthat somehow this is going to take away the decisionmaking power from \nthose who have it. Under my amendment, no decisionmaking \nresponsibilities are taken away from the Army Corps of Engineers. The \namendment simply allows for independent experts to identify problems in \nthe best possible way.\n  Why would anyone not want to hear the important feedback from \nindependent experts?\n  I would like to talk a little more in detail about one of the biggest \ndifferences between our independent review amendment and the Inhofe-\nBond alternative which will be voted on side by side starting at 2:30, \nas the Senator from Oklahoma indicated. One of the very clear \nrecommendations from the National Academy of Sciences' 2002 report on \npeer review is that reviewers should have the flexibility to comment on \nimportant issues to decisionmakers.\n  On this point, the two competing amendments are very different. I \nwant my colleagues to understand the importance and the potential \nramifications of the difference as they consider these two amendments.\n  My amendment implements the recommendations of the National Academy \nof Sciences by allowing a thorough analysis of a Corps feasibility \nstudy. The Inhofe-Bond amendment ignores this recommendation by sharply \nlimiting what independent reviewers would be allowed to consider. On \nthis point, it is good to give an example of why this matters. Many of \nus know about the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, MRGO, in Louisiana. In \nLouisiana, MRGO is what this project is referred as.\n  According to most scientists who have looked at it, MRGO, a Corps \nnavigation channel, greatly exacerbated the impact of Hurricane Katrina \nby funneling and intensifying Katrina's storm surge directly into New \nOrleans and by destroying 20,000 acres of coastal wetlands that could \nhave buffered the storm's surge. These same experts, including the \nindependent reviewers looking into what happened in New Orleans, have \nsaid that the devastating flooding that overwhelmed St. Bernard Parish \nand the lower ninth ward of New Orleans came from the MRGO. I was in \nboth of those parishes 10 days ago, and that is exactly what the \nNational Guard and other people and experts indicated to me while I was \nphysically looking at this destruction.\n  Only 52 of the 28,000 structures in St. Bernard Parish escaped \nunscathed from Katrina. For years, community leaders, including the St. \nBernard Parish Council, activists, and scientists warned that the MRGO \nwas a hurricane highway and called for closing the outlet. This is not \nmerely an after-the-fact recognition that something was wrong. People \nwho lived and some who died in these communities were warning about \nthis potential disaster before it occurred.\n\n  Why is this relevant? Under the Inhofe-Bond limited review, the other \namendment, a panel would not have been able to examine the full \nimplications of constructing the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet or MRGO \nin New Orleans. While reviewers would have been able to assess whether \nthe Corps properly calculated the wetlands impact of the MRGO, they \nwould not have been able to comment on the fact that the recommended \nplan would put New Orleans at risk by destroying wetlands vital for \nbuffering storm surge and by creating a funneling effect that would \nintensify the storm surge. The Inhofe-Bond review also would not have \nallowed any comment on the appropriateness of proceeding with the MRGO \nin light of the increased danger to the city and the fact that traffic \nprojections were vastly overstated.\n  I think we can all agree that this example shows what can be at stake \nif we don't allow reviewers some flexibility to bring up important \nissues. This isn't the only example of where the Inhofe-Bond amendment \nfalls short, but I will try to say more about that later. This is a \ntimely and very serious example of the dramatic difference between the \namendment that Senator McCain and I have offered and the, frankly, \ninadequate amendment that is offered as an alternative.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first, let me make a couple of \nobservations. I think in the discussions we have had so far, there are \na lot of things we agree on. We agree that we need to change the system \nwe have right now. I don't really take issue with some of the things \nthat the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin have said \nabout existing problems with the way that the Corps of Engineers has \nbeen working. I recognize also that the Senator from Wisconsin agrees \nthat the underlying substitute amendment does include some provisions \nto require peer review, specifically for Corps of Engineers studies. \nThe Inhofe-Bond amendment gives additional detail and clarity to that \nrequirement as well as the Feingold-McCain amendment gives additional \ndetail and clarity to that amendment. So there are some areas where I \nthink we are in agreement.\n  Also, we are in agreement on the necessity of reauthorizing the Water \nResources Development Act. It has not been addressed since the year \n2000.\n  Our amendment ensures that peer review is integrated into the Corps \nstudy process. Most stakeholders agree that the current study process \nis already too long and further delays are not advisable. That is not a \nreason to ignore the critical role that peer review can play, but it is \na reason to demand that peer review not be an end of the process \naddition or delay.\n  Our amendment clarifies that peer review panels are to review the \ntechnical and scientific information that forms the basis of decisions, \nbut the decisions themselves are a function of the Government. It is \nsomething the Government should be doing, not any independent peer \nreview. Decisions regarding how best to meet our Nation's water \nresources needs all involve tradeoffs of some sort. No outside group or \ndistinct subject matter experts can truly be considered experts at \nmaking those decisions.\n  I am sure they would all have opinions, but everyone has opinions. \nGovernment officials, on the other hand, are specifically charged with \nmaking the decision. They have that responsibility. I believe that is \none of the distinctions between the Inhofe-Bond amendment and the \napproach taken by Senators Feingold and McCain.\n  Another aspect of the Inhofe-Bond amendment I would highlight is the \ndetailing of which project studies at a minimum should undergo peer \nreview. Independent reviews are required if the estimated total project \ncost is more than $100 million. I believe the Feingold-McCain approach \nis $40 million.\n\n[[Page S7826]]\n\nWe also say it has to be over $100 million and if the Secretary of the \nArmy determines that the project is controversial. Independent reviews \nmay be required if a Governor or head of a Federal agency requests the \nreview.\n  I know some of those opposed to this amendment have argued that these \ntriggers are too lenient, but I don't believe that is the case.\n  Of the 44 new or contingent authorizations included in the substitute \namendment, 18 would have been subject to independent peer review based \non the $100 million trigger alone. That is 40 percent of these projects \nbased on just one of the four possible triggers. The other triggers \nwould be in addition to this requirement of the minimum of $100 \nmillion. I don't consider that lenient at all. The Inhofe-Bond \namendment also incorporates a recommendation of the American Society of \nCivil Engineers to require independent review of technical and design \nspecifications of certain projects critical to public safety beyond the \nstudy phase.\n  Finally, I would like to address another baseless charge that has \nbeen made against this amendment: that these panels wouldn't really be \nindependent because the chief of engineers is the official in charge of \nselecting the panels. The amendment is clear that the Corps must issue \nguidelines that are consistent with the Information Quality Act as \nimplemented in OMB's revised bulletin from December 2004. This bulletin \ndiscusses in some detail requirements for reviewers, including \nexpertise and balance of panels, lack of conflicts of interest, and \nindependence.\n  I have been a little concerned, after reading the Feingold-McCain \namendment, as to just how this works. It is my understanding that it \nwould--in my opinion and in the way I look at things--create another \nbureaucracy and another board that would be looking at these. I am not \nsure this is really going to be necessary. I do believe that we have \ntried to strike a balance. I believe we have done so. I am quite \nconfident we can trust a three-star general to follow direct commands, \nespecially those issued in law.\n  As I have outlined, the Inhofe-Bond independent peer review amendment \nwould ensure review of critical information by experts outside the \nCorps without creating unnecessary burdens and delays.\n  As was stated before, we are going to first be voting at 2:30 on the \nFeingold-McCain amendment and then on the Inhofe-Bond amendment. I will \nbe encouraging them to vote against the Feingold-McCain amendment and \nfor our amendment. But having said that, I would like to say that we \nare in agreement. Sometimes you get into a discussion on these things \nand it sounds as if everyone is in disagreement. This isn't like a \nclimate change debate. This isn't one where everybody gets all fired \nup. I know we are all trying to do the same thing. We know there is \nroom for improvement in the way the Corps of Engineers operates. I have \na few examples I could use. We have right now a problem in Oklahoma \nwith one of the individuals who has not been doing a conscientious job. \nWe can't get the Corps of Engineers to listen to us in terms of how \nthis particular bureaucrat is abusive in his treatment of individuals.\n  I think that we need to do something. Our underlying substitute \namendment does something. I think probably either of these two \namendments will take that one step further. There are areas where we \nagree.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I am pleased to yield 12 minutes to \none of our strong supporters and cosponsors of the amendment, the \nSenator from Delaware, Mr. Carper.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, to my colleague and friend, Senator \nFeingold, I thank him very much for yielding, and I thank him even more \nfor his leadership and that of Senator McCain in offering this \namendment.\n  Before I talk about the amendment, I want to also thank Senator \nInhofe and our ranking member, Senator Jeffords, as well as Senators \nBond and Baucus, for bringing this bill to the floor today. It has \ntaken 6 long years and a huge amount of work on the part of them and \ntheir staffs and our staffs as we have prepared for this debate today.\n  We are finally able to move this important legislation because of \ntheir dogged determination, really a collective determination and \nwillingness to work with all of us to address our States' respective \nneeds, and an openness to debating possible reforms for the way we plan \nand prioritize water resource projects.\n  This bill includes several provisions that are very important to my \nState of Delaware. I want to quickly highlight maybe two of those and \ntalk about the importance of modernizing the Corps of Engineers.\n  First, this bill preserves something called the St. Georges Bridge \nover the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, the 14-mile canal that really \nconnects the Delaware Bay to the Chesapeake Bay. It serves to divide \nDelaware in half. It takes up valuable space within my little State, \ndisrupts our commerce and the movement of people and goods, and \nprovides a shortcut for ships trying to get from the Delaware Bay to \nthe Chesapeake Bay, and it helps to divert traffic away from my port, \nthe Port of Wilmington. To say that I am not a great admirer of all \nthat the C Canal does for my State would be an understatement. I have \nproposed, tongue-in-cheek, that we appropriate shovels to the people of \nDelaware so we can line up on either side of the C Canal and fill it \nin, and that we bring in plants and trees from other parts of the \ncountry to use up enormous quantities of water, and that we might plant \nthem in the bed of the canal to soak up the water and then we can go \nacross, like the children of Israel, on dry land. Well, none of that \nhas happened, so we have to figure out how to get across the C Canal \nthat disrupts commerce in my State.\n  In return for the imposition of this canal, the Corps of Engineers \nhas been obligated for three quarters of a century to provide \nsufficient access across that canal. Yet, in recent years, in spite of \npopulation growth that has stretched the capacity of the current \nbridges, the Corps has sought to reduce the number of bridges across \nthe C Canal. Thanks to the support of the chairman and ranking \nmember, that will not happen.\n  The second important provision in this bill to our State is a late \nentry. A little over a year ago, some of you may recall that the Senate \npassed a bill by unanimous consent to rename our new bridge over the \nC Canal along State Route 1 for former U.S. Senator Bill Roth, my \npredecessor. Senator Roth served in the Senate for 30 years and in the \nHouse of Representatives for a time before that. I see Senator Bond \nhere; he served with him for a number of those years. Bill Roth, for \nover a third of a century, served the people of Delaware admirably and \nwith distinction in the House and later, for many years, in the Senate. \nHe also worked hard to make sure about 15 years ago that this new \nbridge over the C Canal would be built.\n  The bill to name the State Route 1 bridge at St. Georges for Senator \nRoth passed the Senate unanimously. It has been held up in the House \nfor the past year. I appreciate Senator Inhofe's and Senator Jeffords' \nwillingness to move it forward by agreeing to add it to the Water \nResources Development Act. On behalf of our State and the Roth family, \nwe express our deepest gratitude.\n  I also rise today to voice my support for Senator Feingold's and \nSenator McCain's Corps independent review amendment. It is essential \nthat we apply the lessons that we learned from Hurricane Katrina. This \namendment seeks to do that, at least in part.\n  This past April, I had the opportunity to tour both the devastation \nin New Orleans, as well as the wetlands that act as a buffer for that \ncity. As a member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, I have spent many hours hearing from experts about why the \nlevees failed in New Orleans.\n  One thing became inescapably clear: There were warnings that were not \nheeded. The McCain-Feingold amendment seeks to prevent that from \nhappening again.\n  The McCain-Feingold independent review amendment--which I have \ncosponsored--requires an independent panel of experts to be constituted \nto review projects that will cost greater than $40 million.\n\n[[Page S7827]]\n\n  That panel will be fully independent of the Corps and made up of \nanywhere from five to nine experts in engineering, hydrology, biology, \nand economics. This panel will be able to review every aspect of a \nproposed project, from the data and assumptions that went into the \nCorps' analysis into the actual design of the final project that is \nchosen.\n  Having such a review of the New Orleans levee system likely would \nhave drawn attention to the flaws in the Corps' design, including the \nfacts that they failed to account for the natural subsidence of the \ncity and that the flood walls were not properly anchored in the swampy \nsouthern Louisiana ground.\n  We often talk about these proposals as ``Corps reform.'' But in a \nreal sense, they are also congressional reforms. That is because the \nfindings of the independent panels merely provide more information to \nus, the Congress. They are not binding. It will still be up to us in \nthe Congress to decide how to proceed, and we will need to do a better \njob ourselves in the future. But we cannot be expected to make good \ndecisions if we don't have good information.\n  Moreover, in these days of tighter budgets, we are not going to be \nable to gather support of our constituents for big navigation projects \nthat they fear will destroy wetlands that are needed for flood \nprotection or for a flood control project that people don't believe \nwill work.\n  As the New Orleans Times-Picayune stated in a recent editorial:\n\n       Taxpayers shouldn't have to wonder if there's a rational \n     basis for spending billions of dollars.\n\n  I am reminded of something that LTG Carl Strock, who commands the \nArmy Corps of Engineers, said:\n\n       Words alone will not restore trust in the Corps.\n\n  These amendments will provide some substantive change to back up the \nclaim that we will never let what happened in New Orleans happen again.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the McCain-Feingold independent \nreview amendment. I am pleased to be among its cosponsors. I urge its \nadoption.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have had a lot of talk about all of the \nthings that the Corps has done wrong and the problems in the past. I \ndon't think anybody believes that there is not a need for reform, \nreview, independent review by experts who can comment on and who can \nprovide valuable input to the Corps. The Corps has learned a lot of \nlessons, and the Inhofe-Bond proposal creates a mechanism for improving \ntechnical quality of the projects that move forward, not an incubator \nfor more lawsuits to delay needed projects.\n  The Inhofe-Bond amendment would encourage independent review of \ntechnical information and science, not a review of policy decisions, \nwhich are appropriately made in the executive branch and by this body. \nWe don't want to outsource our policy decisions to some other group, as \nthe Feingold-McCain amendment would do. We want to continue an open, \nfair, and public review of recommendations, and not create a public \nreview created by special interests designed to undo projects for \nreasons other than policy reasons.\n  We support stabilizing, not destabilizing, Federal/ non-Federal \ninterests in reliance on the Corps. We support Presidential oversight \nof independent review, not handing government functions over to some \nunelected commission.\n  When you take a look at the past work of the Corps, you see that the \nCorps now currently provides 3 trillion gallons of water for use by \nlocal communities and businesses. The Corps manages a supply of one-\nquarter of our Nation's hydropower. The Corps operates 463 lake \nrecreation areas. The Corps moves 630 million tons of cargo valued at \nover $73 billion annually over the inland water system. It manages over \n12 million acres of land and water.\n  The levees that have been properly constructed have prevented an \nestimated $76 billion in flood damage within the past 25 years, with an \ninvestment of one-seventh of that value. These are the tremendous \nvalues that can be provided if we can pass this bill and if we can make \nsensible Corps reform, without providing major hindrances and \nroadblocks.\n  I hope that the 80 Senators who joined with us in saying ``bring this \nbill to the floor'' will realize that there is such a thing as \nappropriate review and there is such a thing as unnecessary, late-stage \nsecond guessing, which can be extremely expensive and can delay the \nbenefits that could come from the work of the Corps.\n  The McCain-Feingold independent review amendment has a tremendous \npotential to delay project construction. They wait until the end of the \nprocess, and any mistakes found at the end of the process, as \nenvisioned in the Feingold-McCain amendment, would necessitate a repeat \nof the study to correct the problems--beginning over again. Clearly, \nthis would delay project construction and drive up costs.\n  Under our proposal, since reviews are integrated into the process, \nany mistakes made or improvements suggested could be corrected and \nincorporated at the time. As I said earlier today, it is like waiting \nto test students in the eighth grade to see if they have first-grade \nreading capabilities. If a child cannot read at the first-grade level \nwhen he or she finishes the first grade, give them remediation then, \nhelp prepare them for the second grade; don't wait until they get to \nthe eighth grade and say we just wasted 8 years of this child's \neducation because they could not read at the first-grade level. This \nessentially--testing at the eighth grade level for first-grade \ncompliance--is what the Feingold-McCain amendment would do.\n  Let's be clear about it. We passed a bill 2 years ago that had all \nsorts of regulatory redtape and delays. This was opposed by the House, \nwhich could not agree on a conference with us. That is why we lost this \nbill. Putting in a batch of redtape and bureaucratic delays is going to \nmake possible negotiations with the House extremely difficult and could \nlead to no bill being passed again.\n  So the 2002 Water Resources Development Act that we are still trying \nto pass in 2006 would go into 2007 and 2008. The benefits that come \nfrom the authorized projects in this bill will be delayed. I want the \n80 Senators who want to see this bill passed--because they have \nprojects that are important--to understand that the review that is \nnecessary is being incorporated in the Inhofe-Bond amendment. It is \nbeing incorporated in a sensible timeframe, reviewing with \nrepresentatives from the National Academy of Science, the American \nSociety of Civil Engineers, and the Independent Research Council, as \nthe project goes along.\n  Everybody knows there needs to be review. The Corps has learned a lot \nof lessons from mistakes. We ought to learn from our mistakes. One of \nthe mistakes we have made is to try to burden the process and make it \nso cumbersome it can't work.\n  If you don't want to see the Corps providing water supply, protecting \nagainst floods and hurricanes, making sure we have the most efficient, \neconomical, environmentally friendly, energy-friendly means of \ntransportation, then support more bureaucracy, more redtape, and more \ndelays.\n  If, on the other hand, you want to see the Corps do the job and get \nthe job done right, then I ask my colleagues to support the Inhofe-Bond \namendment and let us get on about the business of protecting people \nfrom floods, from hurricanes, and making sure that our waterways \ncontinue to be an efficient energy-conserving means of transporting \nbulk commodities.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from California in support of our amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Feingold for his \nleadership. I also thank Senator McCain. They have two amendments \nbefore us, the next one coming shortly. I enthusiastically support this \namendment. I think this one is very much a reform. I strongly oppose \nthe other one. But I am not going to use my time now to talk about the \nsecond amendment because I do want to concentrate on what an important \nstep forward this particular amendment is.\n\n[[Page S7828]]\n\n  The 2005 hurricane season taught us many valuable lessons--lessons \nthat we will never forget because we saw them with our very own eyes. \nAnd one of the most important lessons is that major water resources \nprojects and especially flood control projects must be carefully \nreviewed to be sure they will be effective.\n  What a disaster it is for our taxpayers to spend millions and \nbillions on these projects, only to learn that they were not designed \nwell or they didn't meet the real threat that was posed by Mother \nNature or that there was cronyism dealing with putting together the \nalternatives.\n  I believe this amendment will put independent and expert eyes on the \ndata, on the science, and on the engineering of our major public works \nprojects. We need these independent and expert eyes because so much is \nat stake.\n  I come from a State that has every kind of natural disaster \nimaginable. The people there are very good at pointing out what the \nproblems are, and we have to be equally as good in responding to these \nneeds and making sure we give them quality, that we give them the \nprotection they deserve.\n  In this amendment, we are giving the people what they deserve. When a \nreview is triggered under this proposal, a panel of experts, of \nengineers and hydrologists to biologists and economists, must look at \nthe underlying technical data and look at the project in its whole and \nmake sure that the project will meet and achieve its goals.\n  There is little point in expending hard-earned taxpayers' dollars \nunless we know it is being spent right. What this particular amendment \ndoes is bring in those outside experts to kind of give a seal of \napproval on what we are doing.\n  Again, I don't go along with the next amendment, and I will be back \nto talk about that, but this amendment does what needs to be done. The \npanel will make recommendations to improve the project. This particular \namendment is common sense, pure and simple.\n  Complex and costly engineering projects deserve the additional \nscrutiny. Mistakes do happen. You know what. Mistakes will happen no \nmatter how many panels we have, but the idea is to cut down on those \nmistakes. We are all human. We all make mistakes, but how much better \nis it to get a very seasoned pair of eyes to take a look at what we are \ndoing.\n  I believe this amendment will make these projects safer, and they \nwill make them more effective.\n  I support the Army Corps of Engineers' mission. When I first got into \npolitics in local government, I worked very closely with the Corps on \nmany flood control projects. We have had our arguments, we have had our \ndebates, but over the years, we have managed to work well together. But \nthere were moments during those debates when I knew I could benefit \nfrom outside experts, and that is what we are giving to the Congress \nand, therefore, to the American people. We are going to have additional \nscrutiny, and we are going to make sure that mistakes are rare.\n  When we talk about mistakes, it is one thing to make a mistake on an \nissue that doesn't put lives at risk, but we are talking about the \nprotection of life and limb for our people.\n  I think this amendment will help the Corps do its job better. It will \nimprove public faith in the work of the Corps because, frankly, after \nKatrina, many people are saying to me: Can we trust these public works \nprojects, these flood control projects to really protect us?\n  They have doubts, and they should have doubts, having seen what they \nsaw.\n  I, again, thank Senators Feingold and McCain for their leadership on \nthis particular amendment, and I urge a ``yes'' vote. I know it is \ngoing to be a close vote, but I really do believe people listening to \nthis debate will see that all we are saying in support of this \namendment is we are bringing in outside experts to keep an eye on \ntaxpayers' dollars and keep an eye on these designs to make sure that \nwhen we fund a public works project, we have done everything in our \npower to make sure it is designed well, that it will be cost-effective, \nand it will be safe.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nMcCain-Feingold amendment on independent review. I do so because of the \ninvestigation that the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee recently completed into the preparation for and \nresponse to Hurricane Katrina. In that investigation, Senator Collins \nand I and the rest of the committee learned a great deal about the \ninadequacy of the levee system that was supposed to protect New \nOrleans. And we were greatly aided by the work of the three different \nindependent forensic investigations carried out by the State of \nLouisiana, the National Science Foundation, and by the Army Corps' own \nInteragency Performance Evaluation Task Force or IPET.\n  The results of these reviews were truly shocking. In the words of the \nArmy Corps' own IPET report, ``The System did not perform as a system: \nthe hurricane protection in New Orleans and Southeast Louisiana was a \nsystem in name only.'' IPET found that the system was only as strong as \nits weakest links, and that there were many weak links. IPET found:\n  That the materials and designs used in the levees were inadequate and \nfailed faster than expected in fending off Katrina.\n  That project designs failed to incorporate redundancy and measures to \nrespond to a hurricane that was larger than expected. For instance, \nthere was no shielding on the back of the flood walls to prevent their \ncollapse if they were overtopped by the storm surge.\n  That some parts of the system were not prepared to handle a category \n3 storm even though the Army Corps had been telling the city and the \nNation for years that the system offered comprehensive category 3 level \nprotection.\n  That the floodwalls along the 17th Street and London Avenue Canals \ncollapsed because of foundation failures caused by design and \nconstruction mistakes. Those walls collapsed well before the water \nreached the height the walls were designed to protect against, causing \na major portion of the flooding in the city and the suffering at the \nSuperdome and Convention Center. The Army Corps considered those \nfloodwalls complete, ready to defend against a hurricane of Katrina's \nstrength. Unfortunately, it took Katrina and the subsequent IPET report \nto learn that those floodwalls were not designed, built, or constructed \nto protect those who lived in nearby neighborhoods.\n  And one of the most shocking discoveries, IPET found that, because of \nsubsidence in the area, parts of the levee system were anywhere from 2 \nto 3 feet below their design height. What was even more shocking was \nthat the Army Corps was aware of the subsidence before Katrina but did \nnothing to address the obvious deficiency.\n  Mr. President, I am on the Senate floor today because while it is \nenormously important that we have learned of these failures after \nKatrina, it is even more important that we learn of them before the \nnext Katrina, before the next failure of a major flood control project. \nAnd that is what this amendment will do. It will require that major \nCorps projects, and especially flood control projects that protect \npeople and property, be subject to the kind of independent oversight \nthat has proven so beneficial in the aftermath of Katrina.\n  Why did the citizens of Louisiana not know any of these problems \nbefore Katrina made landfall, and why did the Army Corps not feel \ncompelled to fix the ones they knew about?\n  How different the preparation for and response to the storm would \nhave been had an independent review process like IPET been initiated \nbefore the Army Corps designed and constructed the levee system rather \nthan after a storm like Katrina left it and the city it was supposed to \nprotect in tatters.\n  We have learned valuable lessons from Katrina, and one of those \nlessons is that we need an independent review process for our most \ncritical projects before they are battle tested. We need assurances \nthat what the Army Corps builds will function as planned. And \nunfortunately, we have also learned that we cannot count on the Army \nCorps of Engineers to do this themselves. These reviews need to be \nindependent, conducted by 3 outside experts who can objectively \nevaluate what is being proposed, and in the case of major flood control \nprojects, also how it is being designed and built.\n  The Army Corps has already given us an effective model to do that--\nIPET.\n\n[[Page S7829]]\n\nThis amendment, introduced by Senators McCain and Feingold, would \ncreate within the Army Corps a Director of Independent Review. The \nDirector's job will be to establish a panel of distinguished experts to \nconduct a thorough review of the planning process for major projects, \nincluding engineering analyses, and to issue a report and make \nrecommendations to the Army Corps. For major flood control projects, \nwhere lives are at stake, the Director would create an additional panel \nto review the detailed design and construction so that we do not find \nourselves in another Katrina situation where we find, after the fact, \nthat designs and construction were flawed.\n  It is then up the Army Corps to implement those recommendations. The \nArmy Corps will also be required to make the independent panel's report \npublic so Congress and the American people will be aware of possible \nproblems before the project is funded and before the public relies on \nthe project for protection.\n  The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee learned a \ngreat deal in our investigation into Hurricane Katrina, and we made \nsome recommendations in our report to address what we found. One of \nthose recommendations was to create an independent review process like \nIPET and the one established in this amendment to oversee the design \nand construction of critical flood control projects. These were joint, \nbipartisan recommendations, and I am pleased that the chairman of our \ncommittee, Senator Collins, is also joining as a cosponsor of this \namendment.\n  Catastrophes like Katrina will be repeated unless we learn from our \nmistake, and this amendment is a tremendous opportunity to do just \nthat. We already have a model for the proposed solution in the \nindependent forensic teams that were created after Katrina whose \nreports and recommendations have been applauded from all circles--the \nArmy Corps, independent professional engineers, and local interests in \nNew Orleans. But those efforts need to be in place before disaster \nstrikes, and that is exactly what this amendment would do.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wish to respond to a couple of \narguments in the debate. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 31 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I heard the comment from some of my colleagues on the other side \noffering the alternative amendment that somehow this independent peer \nreview will create a bureaucracy. I find that a little ironic because \nto me the definition of ``bureaucracy'' is an agency, such as the Army \nCorps of Engineers, that has $68 billion in authorized projects that \napparently would take 35 years to build if everything was done in a \nsort of rational manner. That is how long it would take. It is sort of \nthe definition of a bureaucracy that has gone awry, where there are not \npriorities, where there isn't clarity, where there really isn't any \nsense of what is more important than something else or what situation \nis more dangerous than another situation, what is more threatening to \npeople's lives than another situation.\n  The notion that an independent peer review would not be binding, to \nhave experts give us guidance as to what is more important as opposed \nto what is less important to fix or change, to me, is the opposite of \nbureaucracy. It is bringing rationality and a good government approach \nto what is currently a very troubled and in-need-of-reform bureaucracy.\n  I certainly expected the other side would try to raise the notion \nthat somehow our amendment, our new system of independent review, would \nlead to more litigation. Of course, that is a standard argument against \neverything, and sometimes it is true, but here it is not.\n  The judicial deference provision makes it clear that the Corps must \ngive serious consideration and review to an independent panel's \nfindings. Unless that happens, independent review will just be another \nbox to be checked off in project planning and will not result in better \nand safer projects.\n  The Corps, unfortunately, has a history of ignoring independent panel \nrecommendations, even when those panels have been hand picked by the \nCorps, and that is unacceptable.\n  To ensure the independent review process is meaningful and produces \nreal improvements for project planning, the amendment gives the \nrecommendations of a panel equal deference with the Corps's \nrecommendation in any judicial proceeding regarding the project in \nquestion if the Corps rejects the expert panel's finding without good \ncause.\n  That is what it does, and that is all it does. It provides an \nalternative view that the Corps can consider, but there is the key \npoint. The judicial deference provision clearly does not--does not--\ncreate any new cause of action. It does not create a new basis for \nsomebody to litigate. So it is false that somehow this creates the \nopportunity for new litigation. It does not even anticipate that \nprojects subject to independent review will ever be involved in \nlitigation at all. It simply notes that where there is judicial review \nof a project where the Corps did not follow an independent panel's \nfindings, the Corps will need to explain that decision to the court.\n  The Corps would then be given ample opportunity to demonstrate to the \ncourt that it has rejected an expert panel finding for a valid reason, \ngood cause--not a difficult judicial standard to meet.\n  If the Corps cannot do so, the court will give equal consideration to \nboth the panel and the Corps's recommendations.\n  So just as the argument that we are creating somehow a new \nbureaucracy is just the opposite of the fact, there is no basis, no \nvalidity whatsoever to the notion that this creates some new legal \ncause of action that didn't exist before.\n  I have two more points with regard to independence. I have heard the \nmanager of the bill and the Senator from Missouri indicate that they \nare for some kind of independent review and that their alternative \nprovides for it. But, of course, it is only in the most narrow of \ncircumstances, only in projects that are over $100 million. That is \nessentially wiping out independent review on almost every single \nproject.\n  Our view is this probably involves, maybe on average of less than one \nproject a year that would receive that kind of independent review. We \ncompromised to make sure that our figure would be acceptable to the \nbody. We started with $25 million and went up as high as $41 million. \nBut $100 million essentially makes a mockery of the whole idea of \nindependent review because it would only apply in the most rare cases.\n  Finally, of course, the argument is, apart from the notion that \nsomehow this creates new litigation, which is not the case, somehow \nthis will cause things to take longer in terms of approving projects \nand reviewing projects.\n  That also is incorrect. The Senator from Missouri is incorrect about \nour amendment and the timing of review. To quote from page 8:\n\n       Panels may be established as early in the planning process \n     as deemed appropriate by the director of independent review.\n\n  So this whole idea that he indicated of somehow waiting until the \neighth grade for somebody who needs help in the first grade--I heard \nthat analogy--is not true. The Director has the power to do this \nwhenever he deems this appropriate. He has that discretion. He has that \nflexibility, so it is not some kind of a locked-in delay at the end of \nthe process review.\n  I encourage my colleagues to read the text of the bill on each of \nthese points which I think will bear out the validity of the arguments \nI made.\n  Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S7830]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield myself some additional time.\n  When you have worked on an issue as long as I have worked on Corps \nreform, sometimes people don't always understand your intentions and \nmaybe, in some cases, mischaracterize them.\n  But I am astonished at the extent to which my opponents, those who \nlike the status quo, those who benefit from the status quo, are saying \nabout the Feingold-McCain-Lieberman-Carper-Jeffords-Collins Independent \nPeer Review Amendment. If I may, I would like to take this opportunity \nto clarify some of the myths I have heard and set the record straight.\n  Myth No. 1: The Feingold-McCain independent peer review amendment \nwill delay project construction.\n  This just is not true. Our amendment will not delay projects. We \nagree, projects do take some time. That's why we were very sensitive to \nensure that independent peer review of Army Corps feasibility studies \noverlays with the existing process. Furthermore, our amendment includes \nstrict deadlines for the panel to report and, if they fail to report in \nthe allotted time, the Chief of Engineers is directed to proceed with \nplanning. In fact, the Inhofe-Bond amendment uses some of the same \ntiming criteria.\n  Independent review will ensure that communities will actually get the \nprojects they are being told they will get. The independent review can \nstart as early in the process as deemed appropriate, and for projects \ncosting more than $40 million, must end within 90 days after the close \nof the public comment period.\n  Under the most ideal circumstances the Corps takes 11 to 12 months \nfrom the close of the public comment period to the time it issues a \nChief's report for a project. And under current law, the Corps must \ntake into account all the public and agency comment submitted during \nthe public comment period. For large and controversial projects the \ntime from draft feasibility study to final Chief's report takes much \nlonger. So the independent review of feasibility studies in our \namendment, which balances the absolute need to allow for a thorough \nreview with the need to move forward in a timely fashion, fits well \nwithin the current timelines and will not delay project planning. The \nNation will get better projects under this amendment.\n  Myth No. 2: The Feingold-McCain amendment will require reviews of too \nmany projects.\n  Mr. President, the $40 million review trigger in our amendment will, \non average, subject about five projects a year to independent review. \nThis is a highly valuable use of resources. And, I believe it will \npromote better and more efficient studies for Corps projects throughout \nall of the Corps' 38 domestic districts.\n  Just this March, the GAO testified to the House Committee on \nGovernment Reform that:\n\n       GAO's recent reviews of four Corps civil works projects and \n     actions found that the planning studies conducted by the \n     Corps . . . were fraught with errors, mistakes, and \n     miscalculations, and used invalid assumptions and outdated \n     data.\n\n  GAO went on to note that the planning studies:\n\n       did not provide a reasonable basis for decision-making.\n\n  Later in its report, GAO even says:\n\n       The Corps' track record for providing reliable information \n     that can be used by decision makers . . . is spotty, at best.\n\n  This is simply unacceptable for a Federal agency and it should get \nthe attention of every Member of this body.\n  Given the Corps' track record, we really should be requiring reviews \nof all studies until the agency improves its record. The $40 million \ntrigger, however, is a reasonable and appropriate compromise that will \nsweep in the largest and costliest Corps projects. The other triggers \nwill ensure that any less costly projects that could be very \nproblematic do not fall through the cracks in the study process. We \nmust be able to rely on the integrity of Corps project studies and \ntheir recommendations to Congress. And unfortunately, right now we \ncannot.\n  Myth No. 3: The Feingold-McCain amendment will increase project \ncosts.\n  Independenter peer review is a critical taxpayer investment. The \ncountry cannot afford to have costly mistakes like the levee failures \nin the aftermath of Katrina. The Corps, the American Society of Civil \nEngineers, the National Academy of Sciences have all said that faulty \ndesign and construction by the Corps resulted in the levee failures. We \ncannot afford any more examples like what we saw in New Orleans. We \nalso cannot afford to build projects based on economic or engineering \nerrors. We have tight water resource budgets, thus we must spend every \ndime wisely and judiciously. I believe, and my cosponsors agree, \nindependent peer review will help us do that.\n  Myth No. 4: The Feingold-McCain amendment will open the door to more \nlitigation.\n  The Corps must give serious consideration and review to an \nindependent peer review panel's findings. Without that hook, the \nconcept is useless. We do not want independent review to be just \nanother box to be checked off in project planning, for I think we can \nall agree that doing so will not yield better or safer projects. The \nCorps unfortunately has a history of ignoring independent panel \nrecommendations, even when those panels have been hand picked by the \nCorps. This can happen no longer.\n  To ensure that the independent review process is meaningful and \nproduces real improvements to project planning, the amendment gives the \nrecommendations of an independent peer review panel equal deference \nwith the Corps' recommendations in any judicial proceeding regarding \nthe project in question if the Corps rejects the expert panel's \nfindings without good cause.\n  The judicial deference provision clearly does not create any new \ncause of action, and it does not even anticipate that projects subject \nto independent review will ever be involved in litigation at all. It \nsimply notes that where there is judicial review of a project where the \nCorps did not follow an independent panel's findings, the Corps will \nneed to explain that decision to the court. The Corps would then be \ngiven ample opportunity to demonstrate to the court that it has \nrejected an expert panel's findings for a valid reason. If the Corps \ncannot do so, the court will give equal consideration to both the \npanel's and the Corps' recommendations.\n  Myth No. 5: The Feingold-McCain independent peer review will apply to \nall projects, even those that are already authorized.\n  The independent peer review of Corps studies applies to projects as \nthey enter the feasibility stage, not after authorization, at which \npoint the Chief's report is already complete. However, my amendment \nwill ensure that flood control projects whose failure could endanger \npeople and communities will be properly designed and constructed with \nadequate review. If such a project is in the post authorization design \nphase or construction phase it will receive the benefit of the safety \nassurance review required by the amendment. This comes directly from \nthe recommendations of the Senate Homeland Security Committee's Katrina \nreport, and I am sure my colleagues will agree that we need to make \nsure key flood control projects are designed and built properly.\n  Myth No. 6: The Feingold-McCain amendment will create a whole new \nlayer of bureaucracy.\n  The amendment does not create a bureaucracy; it establishes a \nworkable system to address a very real problem--poorly planned and \ndesigned projects that put people at risk, unnecessarily damage the \nenvironment and waste taxpayer dollars.\n  I would like to address one final myth, and that is that the Inhofe-\nBond amendment would create a system of true independent project \nreview.\n  Their amendment makes the Chief of Engineers the final arbiter of \nwhether an independent review will happen at all. This is like puttingy \nthe fox in charge of the henhouse. The Corps gets to select the \nreviewers, and there are no criteria at all for ensuring independence \nof those reviewers. Review is not independent if the Corps has control \nover whether, how, and who will review projects.\n  As you can see, the naysayers want to keep saying no, but we need to \nmove beyond this game and start implementing policy that has a real \nchance of improving a broken system, protecting lives and property, and \nrestoring integrity to a Federal agency\n\n[[Page S7831]]\n\ncharged with providing the first line of defense against storms, \ncharged with protecting and restoring some of our most precious natural \nresources and charged with providing efficient commerce.\n  Let me say a bit about what editorials from across the country have \nsaid. It has been just an overwhelming response. They are from \ncommunities large and small, but they all have the same message: \nCongress must reform the Corps. I don't have every editorial ever \nwritten about a need for a change in the Corps. I do have a good \nnumber.\n  I ask unanimous consent they be printed following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Let me ask again, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. In the Northeast, the New York Times and the Washington \nPost have been leaders in calling for reform. While some Members will \njokingly say they don't read the New York Times or the Washington Post, \nmaybe they have heard of some of the others--the Concord Monitor in New \nHampshire, the Delaware News Journal, the Philadelphia Inquirer.\n  Moving to the South, in Florida alone, a State with numerous Corps \nprojects, including projects to help restore the Everglades, five \npapers have called for enactment of the reforms the Senator from \nArizona and I are offering today. In addition, the Winston-Salem \nJournal, the Atlanta Journal and Constitution. Most importantly, in my \nregard, the New Orleans Times-Picayune has called not only for passage \nof our reform amendments but flatout rejection of the competing \namendments that will be offered today.\n  In the Midwest, where I hail from, the editorial boards for the \nWisconsin State Journal, the Star Tribune in Minnesota, the Chicago \nTribune, the St. Louis Post Dispatch. Let me repeat that: the St. Louis \nPost Dispatch has editorialized on the need for modernization of the \nCorps of Engineers.\n  Those of us familiar with the players on this issue in the Senate \nwill be interested to note that in fact the St. Louis Post Dispatch ran \nan editorial today, supporting the Feingold-McCain amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the St. Louis Post Dispatch, July 19, 2006]\n\n                           Course Correction\n\n       The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is a force nearly as \n     inexorable as the mighty rivers it dams and dredges.\n       From the moment it accepts an assignment, the Corps moves \n     slowly and relentlessly forward in its course. In many \n     circumstances, that can-do attitude is a positive attribute. \n     But when questions arise about whether a new Corps project \n     will drain money from other, more crucial projects, or \n     whether a design is adequate or cost-effective, the Corps has \n     been slow to evaluate its own decisions and glacial in \n     course-correction. A governance structure and an endless \n     river of federal money have allowed the Corps to avoid \n     accountability.\n       The high water mark of those wrong-headed policies came \n     last summer in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The \n     strengthening of levees and flood walls around New Orleans \n     had been deferred for decades while money was spent on less \n     urgent needs, like planning new locks and dams along the \n     Upper Mississippi and Illinois rivers. When Katrina struck, \n     the levees broke and New Orleans was underwater.\n       It's time for a more rational approach. It could start \n     today, when the U.S. Senate votes on a bill called the Water \n     Resources Development Act of 2006 (H.R. 2864), a version of \n     which the House passed last year.\n       The bill's primary purpose is to authorize a slew of big \n     water projects with big price tags around the country. But it \n     also contains some much-needed reforms.\n       Several are included in an amendment co-sponsored by Sens. \n     John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russ Feingold, D-Wis. Their \n     amendment would require that all Corps projects costing more \n     than $40 million be reviewed by independent experts. The bill \n     also would establish a transparent national system to set \n     priorities for Corps projects.\n       Those are simple steps in the right direction.\n       But a rival amendment has been sponsored by Sens. \n     Christopher ``Kit'' Bond, R-Mo., and James Inhofe, R-Okla., \n     long-time defenders of the Corps. The Bond-Inhofe amendment \n     also would require reviews and priority-setting. But reviews \n     would be done only on projects costing at least $100 million \n     a year; only two or three such projects a year fall into that \n     big bucket. Priorities would be set by a process that would \n     not be shared with the public, and Congress would have the \n     final sign-off.\n       The effect would be to reinforce the old, flawed ways of \n     doing things, with the Corps' influential champions like Mr. \n     Bond overseeing the doling out of pork projects with \n     inadequate attention to weeding out the inefficient and \n     unrealistic. That approach wastes taxpayers' money.\n       The Senate should chart a course to true reform by passing \n     amendments proposed by Sens. McCain and Feingold.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Winston-Salem Journal:\n\n       After Hurricane Katrina, to vote with Inhofe and Bond to \n     block reform of the Corps would be downright reckless.\n\n  The Miami Herald:\n\n       A bipartisan Senate proposal to overhaul the U.S. Army \n     Corps of Engineers deserves approval to eliminate some of \n     Congress' most nefarious pork-barrel spending and improve the \n     process that determines which projects are worthwhile.\n\n  San Francisco Chronicle:\n\n       This reform is not only about saving money, it's about \n     saving lives.\n\n  The Commercial Appeal--Tennessee:\n\n       At the very least, evaluations of proposed corps projects, \n     their environmental impact and especially their cost and \n     benefits, should be in independent and impartial hands.\n\n  The Cleveland Plain Dealer:\n\n       This singular study of failure no doubt will become a \n     standard reference work in engineering school libraries. It \n     should be cross-referenced, as well, to those who study \n     political science and philosophy, for between its lines it \n     reveals a government authority in which a region's trust was \n     misplaced, and a hubris in the face of the inevitable that \n     cost more than 1,200 lives and as-yet uncounted billions of \n     dollars in damage. Congress must read it, too, for it \n     describes flaws in corps management that demand fixing before \n     the next levee fails.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Times-Picayune, July 16, 2006]\n\n                        Counting on Corps Reform\n\n       Louisiana urgently needs hurricane protection and coastal \n     restoration projects contained in the Water Resources \n     Development Act, and for that reason alone it's critical for \n     Congress to move on this long-delayed measure.\n       But Louisiana's fortunes are also tied, for better or \n     worse, to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Efforts to reform \n     the agency are critical for this state, which--after the \n     levee failures during Hurricane Katrina--could serve as the \n     poster child for the corps' shortcomings.\n       Congress is four years overdue in adopting a new water \n     resources bill, in part because of disagreements over corps \n     reform. But the Senate is expected to vote on the measure \n     this week, and Sens. Mary Landrieu and David Vitter need to \n     do more than push for crucial Louisiana projects. They need \n     to push for changes that will make the corps a better, more \n     responsible agency in the future.\n       The best chance for changing the way the corps operates is \n     through reforms sought by Sens. John McCain and Russ \n     Feingold. They're offering two amendments to the water \n     resources bill. One would establish independent review of \n     corps projects from planning and design to construction. The \n     other would require corps projects to be ranked in importance \n     based on three national priorities: flood and storm damage \n     reduction, navigation and environmental restoration.\n       While the McCain-Feingold amendments won't fix everything \n     that's wrong with the corps, Louisiana stands to benefit from \n     both proposed changes.\n       The catastrophic failure during Katrina of canal floodwalls \n     built by the corps is Exhibit A in the case for independent \n     review. If such a process had been in place, surely \n     subsidence wouldn't have been discounted when New Orleans' \n     levee system was being built, and research on soil strength \n     wouldn't have been ignored.\n       Louisiana also should fare better under a system that uses \n     criteria other than political clout to decide which projects \n     should be done. The corps already has a $58 billion project \n     backlog--an amount that will grow by another $10 billion if \n     the water resources bill is adopted. That means competition \n     for the $2 billion per year that the corps gets for projects \n     is intense.\n       Without a rational system for prioritizing that work, \n     there's no guarantee that Louisiana's critically needed flood \n     control project will prevail even over less-needed or \n     justified projects. While there's a danger that a Louisiana \n     project could be pushed aside in a priority-based system, \n     this state is helped by the fact that the McCain-Feingold \n     approach favors projects that reduce flood damage and restore \n     the environment.\n       The effectiveness of the proposed changes will depend on \n     details. If an independent review panel isn't given adequate \n     time to evaluate a project, for example, the benefit of \n     oversight could be lost. Conversely, a cumbersome review \n     process could end up further delaying badly needed projects.\n\n[[Page S7832]]\n\n       But an independent review process that works, combined with \n     a ranking policy that makes sense, should result in a better-\n     performing agency.\n       Unfortunately, not everyone in Congress is interested in \n     changing the way the corps does business. The McCain-Feingold \n     amendments face opposition and a rival set of measures by the \n     main authors of the water resources bill, Sens. James Inhofe \n     and Kit Bond.\n       What those senators offer as reform is meaningless, \n     however. The Inhofe-Bond review process would be controlled \n     by the corps and would only apply to projects that exceed \n     $100 million, compared to a $40 million threshold in the \n     McCain-Feingold measures. The Inhofe-Bond amendments also \n     call for prioritization, but their system would simply \n     measure projects against a set of national priorities without \n     actually ranking them.\n       Sham reform won't do anything to restore confidence in the \n     corps, and Congress must do better. The public should be able \n     to rely on the agency that builds levees and dams to do work \n     that will stand up to independent scrutiny. Taxpayers \n     shouldn't have to wonder if there's a rational basis for \n     spending billions of dollars.\n       And Louisianians should be able to believe that the corps, \n     which is rebuilding our levee system and restoring our \n     coastline, is a wiser, better managed and more reliable \n     agency than the one that failed us when Hurricane Katrina \n     came to town.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 19, 2006]\n\n                      A Chance To Reform the Corps\n\n       The Senate has a rare opportunity today to strike a blow \n     for both fiscal sanity and environmental stewardship. It will \n     consider several amendments that would bring a measure of \n     discipline and independent oversight to the Army Corps of \n     Engineers, a notoriously spendthrift agency with a history of \n     answering to no one except a few members of Congress who \n     control its purse strings.\n       The reputation of the Corps is now at a low ebb because of \n     levee failures in New Orleans. But well before that debacle, \n     studies by the National Academy of Sciences and others had \n     found that the agency routinely inflated the economic payoffs \n     of its construction projects to justify steadily greater \n     budget outlays, while underestimating the environmental \n     damage of those projects.\n       The amendments' main sponsors are the Senate's reformist \n     duo of John McCain and Russ Feingold. One amendment would \n     subject any project costing more than $40 million to an \n     independent review of the project's design, feasibility, cost \n     and environmental consequences. A second amendment would \n     require that projects be ranked in order of importance based \n     on established national priorities like flood control and \n     environmental restoration. This amendment is aimed less at \n     the Corps than its Congressional paymasters, who have \n     historically put their own local pork barrel projects ahead \n     of more urgent and generally accepted needs.\n       The sponsors will try to attach these amendments to the \n     five-year $40 billion Water Resources Development bill, \n     itself overdue even though it includes several important \n     provisions. One authorizes $1.5 billion for key elements of \n     the Everglades restoration project, which has suffered from \n     Congressional neglect. Another would jump-start a major \n     effort to reverse the erosion of coastal wetlands that has \n     left Louisiana vulnerable to flooding.\n       A bill this size inevitably has the usual ration of local \n     pork. But some of this would now be subject to outside review \n     and possible rejection if the McCain-Feingold amendments \n     stick. As they should. These reforms made sense when first \n     offered in 2002.

It is a process that needs reform, and we \n     hope senators will approve a bipartisan proposal which would \n     ensure that national priorities--and not pork-barrel \n     spending--determine which projects the Corps undertakes.\n       For years, members of Congress have pushed for Corps \n     projects beneficial to little but their own districts. The \n     trend has grown to the point where the corps now has an \n     estimated $70 billion in backlogged projects.\n       Presidential budget plans have sought to eliminate such \n     pork, but it consistently has been reinserted by Congress.\n       Now Sens. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., and John McCain, R-Ariz., \n     have introduced an amendment to the Water Resources \n     Development Act that would set up clear criteria to ensure \n     that projects carried out by the Corps reflect national \n     priorities as they relate to navigation, flood damage \n     reduction and ecosystem restoration. The Corps currently uses \n     a cost-benefits ratio to determine project priority, which \n     gives more weight to economic benefits--such as jobs in a \n     certain area--than to national needs, such as ensuring levees \n     can hold back flood waters and rivers remain navigable.\n       The Feingold-McCain amendment would re-establish the Water \n     Resource Council and order it to provide Congress with a list \n     of which water-resources projects should get priority \n     funding. Under the amendment, any project costing more than \n     $40 million would be subject to an independent review. A \n     review also could be ordered if another federal agency \n     challenged the project or the secretary of the Army found the \n     project to be controversial.\n       The proposed reforms would help eliminate wasteful projects \n     such as Alaska's infamous ``Bridge to Nowhere,'' which \n     carried a price tag of more than $200 million.\n       The Feingold-McCain plan is competing with another proposal \n     by Sens. Kit Bond, R-Mo., and James Inhofe, R-Okla. But the \n     Bond-Inhofe plan would provide no ranking for Corps projects \n     and would give the Corps the power to deny a request for an \n     independent review--even if it came from a governor or the \n     leader of a federal agency.\n       We think the Bond-Inhofe plan would do little to change the \n     status quo.\n       The devastation of Hurricane Katrina illustrated the need \n     for the Corps of Engineers to carry out its vital mission \n     with more coordination and funding. With federal tax dollars \n     already being stretched, it is important that funds for the \n     Corps are directed to those projects that will produce the \n     greatest benefits for the nation--not for a single \n     congressional district.\n       We hope senators agree.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 7, 2006]\n\n                      Katrinia's Unlearned Lessons\n\n       Last week the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers admitted \n     responsibility for much of the destruction of New Orleans. It \n     was not true, as the Carps initially had claimed, that its \n     defenses failed because Congress had authorized only Category \n     3 protection, with the result that Hurricane Katrina \n     overtopped the city's floodwalls. Rather, Katrina was no \n     stronger than a Category 2 storm by the time it came ashore, \n     and many of the floodwalls let water in because they \n     collapsed, not because they weren't high enough. As the \n     Corps' own inquiry found, the agency committed numerous \n     mistakes of design: Its network of pumps, walls and levees \n     was ``a system in name only''; it failed to take into account \n     the gradual sinking of the local soil; it closed its ears \n     when people pointed out these problems. The result was a \n     national tragedy.\n       You might think that the Corps' mea culpa would fuel \n     efforts to reform the agency. Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and \n     Russell Feingold (D-Wis.) are pushing a measure that would do \n     just that, requiring that future Corps proposals be subject \n     to technical review by an independent agency. But the \n     stronger current in Congress goes in the opposite direction. \n     A measure urged by Louisiana senators and written by Sens. \n     James M. Inhafe (R-Okla.) and Christopher S. Band (R-Mo.) \n     would loosen oversight of the Corps.Billions of dollars may \n     be spent in ways that ignore the most basic lessons from \n     Katrina.\n       Congress has already passed laws with language directing \n     the Corps to design a new flood-protection plan for \n     Louisiana. The language encourages the construction of \n     Category 5 protections for the whole state, a project that \n     could cost tens of billions of dollars; it advertises its own \n     profligacy by laying down that the flood-protection plan \n     should be exempt from cost-benefit analysis. The new measure, \n     which is reportedly part of a revised version of a water \n     projects bill that will be unveiled shortly, would lower the \n     bar for congressional approval of whatever Louisiana defenses \n     the Corps sees fit to propose. Rather than requiring full \n     votes in both chambers of Congress, the Corps' plan could be \n     authorized by votes in two committees that tend to rubber-\n     stamp such projects.\n       In the wake of Katrina, this is almost beyond belief. The \n     Corps' admission of its own technical shortcomings points to \n     the need for tougher oversight, not less. And the New Orleans \n     disaster has illustrated the folly of building flood defenses \n     for vulnerable lowland: Some of the worst-hit areas would not \n     have been developed in the first place if the Corps hadn't \n     decided to build ``protections'' for them. Encouraging the \n     Army Corps of Engineers to build Category 5 defenses for all \n     of Louisiana, including parts that are sparsely populated for \n     good reason, would not merely cost billions that would be \n     better spent on defending urban areas. It would encourage \n     settlement of more flood-prone land and set the stage for the \n     next tragedy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Wisconsin State Journal, June 28, 2006]\n\n                   Protect Taxpayers From Boondoggles\n\n       If the United States is to rein in the billions of dollars \n     misspent on pork-barrel projects each year, a top priority \n     should be reforming the way the Army Corps of Engineers does \n     business.\n       That's why Congress should pass the Army Corps reforms \n     proposed by Sens. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., and John McCain, R-\n     Ariz. The Feingold-McCain proposal would improve the public's \n     ability to make sure limited federal resources are spent on \n     cost-effective projects for flood control, navigation, \n     environmental protection and related goals, rather than on \n     boondoggles.\n       At stake is how the Corps spends its $12-billion-a-year \n     budget, which includes nearly $5 billion for civil works \n     projects, from levees to canals to coastal restoration.\n       Analyses of last year's hurricane disaster in New Orleans \n     helped to expose costly even deadly flaws in how the Corps \n     decides where to spend the public's money. For example, \n     before the flooding from Hurricane Katrina breached the levee \n     on the New Orleans Industrial Canal, the Corps had begun a \n     $748 million project at that exact spot.\n\n[[Page S7833]]\n\n       The project, however, was not flood control but rather a \n     new lock for the canal. The lock, favored by local \n     politicians, was supposed to accommodate barge traffic. Barge \n     traffic on the canal, however, was decreasing.\n       The New Orleans experience highlighted the Corps' long \n     history of mutual back-scratching with members of Congress: \n     The Corps caters to pet projects, even if their costs far \n     outweigh the benefits, and Congress in return makes sure the \n     Corps gets a big fat budget all at the expense of fiscal \n     responsibility and long-term water resource strategy.\n       The Feingold-McCain proposal would modernize the Corps' \n     cost-benefit analysis to make it more about project merit and \n     less about political influence. One provision would require \n     independent review of any project estimated to cost more than \n     $40 million, requested by a governor, determined to have \n     significant adverse impact, or judged by the secretary of the \n     Army to be controversial.\n       Another provision would require a cabinet-level committee \n     to work with the secretary of the Army to annually establish \n     a list of water resource project priorities to give Congress \n     guidance.\n       Wisconsin taxpayers would benefit if Congress limits the \n     influence of pork-barrel politics in the Army Corps of \n     Engineers.

Bill \n     Nelson and Mel Martinez, this might be the case with an \n     urgently needed reformation of the Army Corps of Engineers \n     via the Water Resources Development Act now under \n     consideration.\n       The Corps has long been famous for, above all, fulfilling \n     the aspirations of unenlightened politicians who are dying to \n     bring home the bacon to their districts, usually not for the \n     good of the taxpayers but for well-focused special interests. \n     The Corps is the nation's construction company for big water-\n     management projects, but it has regrettably become known for \n     building wasteful, unnecessary, even destructive projects.\n       Florida's long-ago Cross Florida Barge Canal, which was to \n     cut a 150-foot-wide swath across the upper neck of our \n     peninsula (from Palatka to Yankeetown), is a great example.\n       It would have furthered the shipping industry's interests, \n     cutting off some 600 miles on a voyage around the state's \n     southern tip. But it would have destroyed so many vital \n     aspects of Florida's precious environment--groundwater \n     resources, wildlife areas and other ecosystems--that \n     President Richard Nixon suspended work on it in 1971, after \n     millions had been invested and 25 ugly miles of excavation \n     (later filled in) had been completed.\n       Less dramatic, but more current, has been the Corps' \n     dredging of the Apalachicola River, which had been listed as \n     the nation's ``most endangered'' rivers and one that feeds \n     directly into our Big Bend coastline.\n       Last year, the Corps was forced to stop years of dredging \n     when the Florida Department of Environmental Protection \n     denied a request to continue operations for the sake of a few \n     commercial interests and even though there has been a sharp \n     decline in barge traffic in recent years. The river's no \n     longer on that endangered list, but it's so damaged that \n     restoring it--while considering the water needs of Florida, \n     Alabama and Georgia--is an almost untenable undertaking. The \n     dredging kept water out of thousands of acres of flood \n     plains, changing everything--largely for the worse--by \n     destroying natural habitats, allowing construction in areas \n     that never should have been built on, and restricting the \n     flow of that necessity of life, fresh water.\n\n\n                       Put a lock on boondoggling\n\n       Which leads us full circle back to Hurricane Katrina and \n     the Water Resources Development Act. The hurricane disaster \n     in New Orleans exposed fatal flaws in how the Corps spends \n     its $12 billion annual budget. It was spending $748 million \n     on a new lock for one of the canals whose levee was breached \n     by the hurricane, even though, once again, barge traffic was \n     decreasing. Local politicians had wanted the lock \n     nonetheless. After all, the nation's taxpayers would be \n     picking up the tab.\n       The boondoggles will continue unless we get approval of \n     bipartisan reforms proposed by Sens. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., \n     and John McCain, R-Ariz., to modernize the cost-benefit \n     analysis of Corps' projects.\n       Just now about $70 billion in backlogged projects are in \n     line, though none has been prioritized as being in the public \n     interest. The reforms would require what seems utterly \n     obvious: those promoting projects would have to demonstrate \n     that they were more about merit than political influence. \n     Really big ones--those costing more than $40 million, \n     requested by a governor, determined to have major and \n     detrimental impacts or otherwise enormously controversial--\n     would have to go to an independent expert review panel. It \n     would make sure that the economics of a project, and the \n     science and engineering, all work to make sure limited \n     federal resources are spent on the most essential flood \n     control, environmental protection and navigation projects.\n       We urge Mr. Nelson and Mr. Martinez to modernize and \n     restore integrity to the Army Corps of Engineers.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Buffalo News, July 17, 2006]\n\nAnother Voice/Army Corps of Engineers: Major Reform Needed for Nation's \n                             Water Projects\n\n                          (By Larry Schweiger)\n\n       The U.S. Senate is set to decide in the next few days \n     whether to reform or concede to a fiscal outrage akin to the \n     infamous ``bridge to nowhere.'' Few taxpayers know about it, \n     though billions in public funds hang in the balance. The \n     Water Resources Development Act funds the Army Corps of \n     Engineers, the nation's chief flood protection builder, but \n     with a troubled history of promoting wasteful and unnecessary \n     projects.\n       The water resources bill headed to the Senate floor this \n     week is a public scandal. It is fiscally out of control, \n     laden with lawmakers' pet projects that are often \n     economically unjustifiable and environmentally destructive. \n     The central decision senators will have to make in voting on \n     this legislation is whether to support basic reforms or \n     continue business as usual.\n       The reforms would apply the lessons learned from Hurricane \n     Katrina by putting the public interest first and spending tax \n     dollars where they are needed most. While the bill includes \n     important projects, notably protecting New Orleans and \n     restoring coastal Louisiana and the Everglades, without \n     reform it will maintain a process where they may never be \n     funded.\n       The current bill would add another $10 billion to $12 \n     billion to an already estimated $58 billion in backlogged \n     projects. Essential projects will have to compete with \n     boondoggles and earmarks in that $70 billion mix. With the \n     Corps receiving about $2 billion per year for construction, \n     it would take 35 years to clear the existing backlog--none of \n     it prioritized in the public interest or subject to \n     independent peer review.\n       Sens. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., and John McCain, D-Ariz., have \n     proposed reforms to fix these problems. Corps projects will \n     be prioritized based on clear standards that put the public \n     interest first. The Feingold-McCain measures also provide for \n     independent expert review of large or controversial projects, \n     ensuring that economic assumptions, science and engineering \n     stand up to outside scrutiny.\n       But not everyone takes issue with the status quo. Sens. \n     James Inhofe, R-Okla., and Christopher Bond, R-Mo., have \n     proposed reforms to give the appearance of responding to \n     growing public unease over the Corps' performance in New \n     Orleans. For instance, the Corps could appoint its own \n     ``independent'' review panel, and deny others' requests for \n     independent reviews. The Inhofe-Bond approach also lacks \n     clear prioritization of Corps projects and will only \n     encourage the back scratching and cronyism that has long \n     plagued the system.\n       Without prioritization reform, crucial projects will fall \n     through the cracks, while outrageous boondoggles gobble up \n     scarce federal funds. If the New Orleans tragedy taught \n     anything, it's that human safety is compromised when \n     professional standards and fundamental construction needs are \n     ignored.\n       The receding floodwaters of Hurricane Katrina revealed \n     preventable devastation and the need to clean up a fiscal \n     mess. The Feingold-McCain reforms will restore integrity and \n     security in the wake of a Corps disaster. The Senate should \n     pass them.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Concord Monitor, July 17, 2006]\n\n              Put a Stop to Corps of Engineers Boondoggles\n\n       The U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly last week to replace \n     FEMA, a federal agency whose name became inextricably linked \n     to failure in the days and months after Hurricane Katrina, \n     with a new agency. The Emergency Management Authority will \n     remain under the umbrella of the Department of Homeland \n     Security, but unlike FEMA, it will report to both Homeland \n     Security and to the president.\n       The reshuffling may or may not solve the agency's many \n     problems, but it's a start. This week, however, the Senate \n     will turn its attention to the agency that bears the most \n     responsibility for the needless loss of life and property in \n     New Orleans, the Army Corps of Engineers.\n       It was the Corps whose faulty design of the city's levee \n     system, whose refusal to heed decades-old warnings that the \n     levees would not hold and whose shoddy construction practices \n     caused the levees to collapse and drown the city.\n       The disaster was a symptom of a much larger, longstanding \n     problem with the Corps. It is one of the biggest barrels of \n     pork in Washington, and no outside agency has oversight over \n     its planning and projects. It is answerable not to presidents \n     or secretaries of defense, but only to the members of \n     Congress who use the Corps to funnel money to their home \n     states.\n       Tomorrow the Senate will take up the Water Resources and \n     Development Act\n\n[[Page S7834]]\n\n     passed earlier by the House. The measure contains $12 billion \n     worth of alleged flood control, water resources and \n     environmental protection projects. If it passes in its \n     current form, that sum will be added to the $58 billion list \n     of previously approved Corps projects.\n       That backlog is big enough, if nothing is ever added to it, \n     to keep the Corps digging and dredging for the next 40 years;\n       Some Corps projects work beautifully, as the elaborate \n     flood control system it built in central New Hampshire a \n     half-century ago proved again this spring. But many are a \n     waste of money, and some do far more harm than good.\n       The bad projects get built--often while worthy ones wait--\n     because the priorities of the Corps are based not on need but \n     politics.\n       To justify a project, the Corps need only show that its \n     public or private economic benefit will be more than its cost \n     to taxpayers. When, to please a congressional benefactor, the \n     Corps can't make the numbers add up, it cooks the books, \n     according to audits by the General Accounting Office and \n     others, The agency's priorities are so wrong that ``beach \n     rebuilding'' has become its fastest-growing activity. Many of \n     the beaches it spends million re-sanding are off limits to \n     the public.\n       Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Russ Feingold of Wisconsin \n     and Joe Lieberman of Connecticut are trying to reform the \n     Corps by creating an independent agency to assess its \n     projects and rank them in the order of their priority. The \n     rankings would not be binding on the Corps, but they would be \n     made public so that taxpayers who pay for the projects would \n     know which are boondoggles and which are justified.\n       To counter the attempt to bring some fiscal responsibility \n     to the process, Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe has introduced a \n     rival amendment to keep the pork barrel open.\n       New Hampshire benefits from Corps projects, and perhaps a \n     dozen are in the works. But Sens. Judd Gregg arid John Sununu \n     enjoy a reputation for frugality, fiscal responsibility and \n     abhorrence of waste. Their vote on the attempt to reform the \n     Corps will say a lot about whether that reputation is \n     deserved.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent the stacked votes now occur at \n2:45 and all other provisions of the agreement remain in place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me make a couple of comments. I appreciate that there \nis some division of editorial policy around the country. Different \npositions are taken. I would say this, though. Probably the most \nimpressive thing we have added to the Record is from the National \nWaterways Alliance, which has been a very strong supporter, of course, \nof the bill, as are, I believe, most of us on both sides of this issue \nwho do agree we want to have the WRDA bill. We haven't had a \nreauthorization since the year 2000.\n  This organization says they want to accept the Inhofe-Bond amendment \nand reject the Feingold amendments. It is interesting. As the Senator \nmentioned some of the editorials, perhaps the St. Louis Dispatch would \nbe of interest to my colleague, Senator Bond.\n  This also has a number of groups from Wisconsin who are strongly in \nopposition to the Feingold-McCain amendment, such as the Wisconsin Corn \nGrowers, the Wisconsin AgriServices of Brunswick, the Farm Bureau, and \nothers.\n  Sometimes you can evaluate something, an amendment, by who is in \nsupport of it. I think if you look at this, there are 288 groups. \nVirtually everyone who has any interest in using a waterway has said \nthey strongly support the Inhofe-Bond amendment. It is such a varied \nand diverse group. All the Chambers of Commerce, the labor unions, they \nare all in there, including, of course, the U.S. Chamber, the Wisconsin \ngroups, Agribusiness Association of Iowa, as I mentioned before, \nAmerican Association of Port authorities, the American Farm Bureau \nFederation, American Shore and Beach Preservation Association, Arkansas \nBasin Development Association.\n  That is an interesting one because as I sometimes remind my \ncolleagues, people are not aware, maybe one of the best kept secrets \nhaving to do with this subject matter is that my home State of Oklahoma \nis a navigable State. Much of that is due to activities of my father-\nin-law, who is deceased now. Glade R. Kirkpatrick is the one who \nintroduced legislation to provide for the Arkansas Development \nAssociation, working with Senator McClellan from Arkansas, Senator \nKerr, at that time from Oklahoma.\n  I can remember 47 years ago, when I married my wife, the first thing \nmy father-in-law did was take me with him for the dedication of the \nPort of Catoosa. Lyndon B. Johnson came out. I believe that was who \ncame out to dedicate it.\n  I remember also--I think my friend from Wisconsin will enjoy this--\nmany years ago when I was in the State senate, I was trying to draw \nattention to the fact that we have barge traffic coming into Oklahoma. \nI approached a group called the Submarine Veterans of World War II. \nThey decided what they would like to do. I said we have to do something \nto show the people of America that we can take barge traffic up and \ndown here. It was all done through the private sector. We went to \nOrange, TX, got a 300-foot-long submarine, the USS Batfish, and the \nidea was to bring it all the way up to my home town of Tulsa, OK. This \nwas quite an undertaking. We had to put floatation on it to raise it \nup, then bring it down to get it under the bridges. Nobody thought it \ncould be done. All of my political adversaries in the State of Oklahoma \nwere saying we will sink Inhofe with this submarine. It is there, one \nof the most attractive tourist sites in the State of Oklahoma. Some \npublications had it coming across the Arkansas line into Oklahoma.\n  I mention that, that is one of the many groups supporting this, the \nArkansas Basin Development Association. Also the California Coastal \nCoalition, California Marine Affairs Navigation System, the Grain and \nFeed Associations of Illinois.\n  There is a long list from Illinois; almost every agricultural \norganization up there is in support of the Inhofe-Bond amendment--the \nIllinois Chamber of Commerce, Illinois Corn Growers Association, the \nInternational Union of Operating Engineers. Everybody in Iowa is for \nthis, too. The list goes on and on. It gets into some of the labor \nunions; in fact, almost all of them are in support of our amendment and \nopposed to the Feingold-McCain amendment, such as the Laborers' \nInternational Union of North America, the International Union of \nOperating Engineers, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, \nInternational Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and \nReinforcing Iron Works of America, Operative Plasterers & Cement Mason \nInternational Association, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the \nInternational Brotherhood of Brickyard Layers and Allied Craftworkers. \nThe list goes on. As I say, the total number is 288 organizations. I \ncan't think of any user--even recreational groups--who are in support \nof this.\n  I have to repeat this. I don't want it to be implied by the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin or the Senator from Arizona that I do not believe reform \nis necessary. I talked at earlier times on this floor about the \nproblems we have had with the Corps of Engineers. Sometimes they have \ndone good work. Sometimes the work has not been so good. They need to \nhave more oversight. They need to have some kind of a system, which is \nbuilt into the underlying amendment or the underlying legislation. It \nmeans, to enhance that, either the Inhofe-Bond amendment or the \nFeingold-McCain amendment would do that. I think that is a recognition \nthat the main thing we want here is to pass the WRDA bill. It is long \noverdue. We have to do it.\n  It is funny for me to stand up here as a conservative, having been \nthe author of the transportation reauthorization bill, which was \nperhaps the largest nondefense spending bill in the history of this \nbody, and now come along with this one, yet I still have my 100 percent \nrating with the American Conservative Union, I remind my friends.\n  Nonetheless, this is important. As I say, we are now down to less \nthan 50 minutes until we have a chance to vote.\n  Several times they have talked about the Hurricane Katrina situation \nas the ultimate example for the Feingold-McCain amendment. As outlined \nin the draft final report of the Interagency Performance Evaluation \nTask Force issued on June 1, the Corps has made mistakes. We do not \nknow why certain decisions were made during the design of the New \nOrleans levees, but in retrospect we know that they were the wrong \ndecisions. Some or all of these mistakes may have been noticed by an \nindependent peer review panel.\n\n[[Page S7835]]\n\n  It could have been a panel that would either be adopted under the \nFeingold-McCain amendment or the Inhofe-Bond amendment.\n  I agree this unfortunate disaster is an example of the potential \nusefulness of peer review, but it is not a mandate for their particular \namendment. At the time the New Orleans levees were being designed, \nindependent peer review was not a requirement.\n  I recall one case in particular. In 1976, the Corps had actually done \na review of the levee problems that might arise in the future. So they \nwere talking about enhancing the strength of the levee. However, there \nwas an environmentalist group called Save The Wetlands that came along \nand enjoined them in court and kept them from doing this.\n  Either review is something that would take care of problems like this \nthat might come up in the future.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, continuing the debate, I appreciate the \nSenator mentioning my home State of Wisconsin. I think that is an \nopportunity to quote from one of the leading newspapers in our State, \nthe Wisconsin State Journal. It in the past has not always agreed with \nme on this issue. But they have come down strongly this year, and I \nwould like to read what they said.\n  The title of the editorial is ``Protect taxpayers from boondoggles,'' \nand I am going to read it in its entirety.\n\n       If the United States is to rein in the billions of dollars \n     misspent on pork-barrel projects each year, a top priority \n     should be reforming the way the Army Corps of Engineers does \n     business.\n       That's why Congress should pass the Army Corps reforms \n     proposed by Senators Russ Feingold, D-Wis., and John McCain, \n     R-Ariz. The Feingold-McCain proposal would improve the \n     public's ability to make sure limited federal resources are \n     spent on cost-effective projects for flood control, \n     navigation, environmental protection and related goals, \n     rather than on boondoggles.\n       At stake is how the Corps spends its $12-billion-a-year \n     budget, which includes nearly $5 billion for civil works \n     projects, from levees to canals to coastal restoration.\n       Analyses of last year's hurricane disaster in New Orleans \n     helped to expose costly, even deadly flaws in how the Corps \n     decides where to spend the public's money. For example, \n     before the flooding from Hurricane Katrina breached the levee \n     on the New Orleans Industrial Canal, the Corps had begun a \n     $748 million project at that exact spot.\n       The project, however, was not flood control but rather a \n     new lock for the canal. The lock, favored by local \n     politicians, was supposed to accommodate barge traffic. Barge \n     traffic on the canal, however, was decreasing.\n       The New Orleans experience highlighted the Corps' long \n     history of mutual back-scratching with members of Congress: \n     The Corps caters to pet projects, even if their costs far \n     outweigh the benefits, and Congress in return makes sure the \n     Corps gets a big fat budget all at the expense of fiscal \n     responsibility and long-term water resource strategy.\n       The Feingold-McCain proposal would modernize the Corps' \n     cost-benefit analysis to make it more about project merit and \n     less about political influence. One provision would require \n     independent review of any project estimated to cost more than \n     $40 million, requested by a governor, determined to have \n     significant adverse impact, or judged by the secretary of the \n     Army to be controversial.\n       Another provision would require a cabinet-level committee \n     to work with the secretary of the Army to annually establish \n     a list of water source project priorities to give Congress \n     guidance.\n       Wisconsin taxpayers would benefit if Congress limits the \n     influence of pork-barrel politics in the Army Corps of \n     Engineers. So would Corps projects affecting the state, from \n     the modernization of the Mississippi River's lock-and-dam \n     system to efforts to keep invasive species out of the Great \n     Lakes.\n       The State's congressional delegation should support the \n     Feingold-McCain reforms.\n\n  I could go on.\n  There are more editorials coming online every day. These editorials \nare coming from States that have projects in this bill, projects that \nwould be subject to the prioritization amendment, projects that would \nbe subject to the independent peer review amendment. These editorials \nare coming from small States and large cities. Yet they still support \nreform. And I believe that is because any State that might be the non-\nFederal cosponsor of a project should want these reforms to ensure that \ntheir investment is a wise one.\n  As the Senator from Oklahoma mentioned some of the groups that \nsupport his position, let me also briefly touch on the amazing support \nfor our independent review amendment. There are letters of support from \nall of the following groups and individuals: League of Conservation \nVoters; Taxpayers for Common Sense; American Rivers; National Taxpayers \nUnion; National Wildlife Federation; Environmental Defense; the \nCoalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana; Association of State Floodplain \nManagers; Republicans for Environmental Protection; Defenders of \nWildlife; Louisiana Wildlife Federation; Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil; Sierra Club; the Garden Club of America; Council for Citizens \nAgainst Government Waste; Earthjustice; the Tennessee Wildlife \nResources Agency; the Isaak Walton League of America; World Wildlife \nFund; Friends of the Earth; The John Muir Chapter of the Sierra Club; \nU.S. Public Interest Research Group; a letter from G. Paul Kemp, a \nprofessor at Louisiana State University and a member of the Louisiana \nForensics Team investigating the Corps' engineering failures; more \nGreat Lakes groups than I can describe here, including Great Lakes \nUnited, Alliance for the Great Lakes, Lake Erie Region Conservancy, the \nOhio Environmental Council, Environment Michigan, and the Michigan \nWildlife Conservancy; Columbia River Fisherman's Protective Union and \nColumbia Riverkeeper; Environment Maine; National Audubon Society; and \nfinally, a letter that is signed by over 120 grassroots groups from \nacross the country that supports our stand-alone bill, from which \ntoday's Feingold and McCain amendments come. The States represented on \nthe letter are Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, \nDelaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, \nMaryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, \nNew York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode \nIsland, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, \nVermont, Washington, and, of course, Wisconsin.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that several of these letters be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                League of Conservation Voters,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 17, 2006.\n     Re Support Corps of Engineers modernization amendments to S. \n         728 (Water Resources Development Act), oppose sham \n         amendments.\n\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) is \n     the independent political voice for the environment. Each \n     year, LCV publishes the National Environmental Scorecard, \n     which details the voting records of Members of Congress on \n     environmental legislation. The Scorecard is distributed to \n     LCV members, concerned voters nationwide, and the press.\n       LCV urges you to support amendments to S. 728, the Water \n     Resources Development Act, offered by Senators Feingold, \n     McCain, Carper, Lieberman, and Jeffords, and oppose \n     amendments offered by Senators Inhofe and Bond. The Feingold-\n     McCain-Carper-Lieberman amendments will provide additional \n     transparency and accountability for the Army Corps of \n     Engineers, while the Inhofe-Bond amendments do little more \n     than codify current practices, which have failed to protect \n     the public and the environment. Hurricane Katrina offered a \n     stark example of these failures.\n       Corps of Engineers projects have all too often been plagued \n     with inadequate or erroneous environmental or economic \n     studies. Recently, the American Society of Civil Engineers \n     called for mandatory independent peer review at all phases of \n     major Corps projects. The Feingold-McCain-Carper-Lieberman-\n     Jeffords amendment ensures that studies for significant \n     projects receive an independent, peer-reviewed assessment. \n     This independent review is empowered to examine all aspects \n     of the Corps analysis it believes are flawed. By contrast, an \n     Inhofe-Bond amendment sharply limits which projects must \n     receive this review, fails to ensure independence, and \n     narrows the scope of that review.\n       The Corps of Engineers has a multi-decade backlog of \n     authorized projects. In an era of limited resources, it is \n     more important than ever that funds are focused on those \n     projects that are most important to protecting public health \n     and the environment. The McCain-Feingold-Lieberman amendment \n     establishes an independent body that will determine criteria \n     for setting priorities, and then issue a prioritization \n     report to Congress. In contrast, the competing Inhofe-Bond \n     amendment skews the prioritization process toward particular \n     types of Corps projects, leaves the Corps to determine, in \n     vague terms, what the\n\n[[Page S7836]]\n\n     priorities should be, and provides Congress with minimal \n     information for decision-making.\n       We urge you to support the amendments to WRDA which \n     increase accountability within the Corps of Engineers and to \n     oppose those amendments which do not provide real reform. The \n     LCV Political Advisory Committee will consider including \n     these votes in compiling LCV's 2006 Scorecard. If you need \n     more information, please call Tiernan Sittenfeld or Nat Mund \n     at my office at (202) 785-8683.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Gene Karpinski,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Rivers, Defenders of Wildlife, Earthjustice, \n           Environmental Defense, Friends of the Earth, National \n           Wildlife Federation, Republicans for Environmental \n           Protection, Sierra Club, U.S. Public Interest Research \n           Group,\n                                                    July 17, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of our organizations and our \n     millions of members and supporters, we request your support \n     for the true Army Corps of Engineers modernization amendments \n     that will be offered to the Water Resources Development Act \n     when it comes to the floor. These amendments, offered by \n     Senators Feingold, McCain. Carper, Lieberman, and Jeffords, \n     pose our only meaningful chance of reforming this embattled \n     federal agency.\n       Hurricane Katrina confirmed the high cost of the Corps' \n     flawed process for developing water projects. As such, our \n     organizations have made addressing the flaws exposed by \n     Katrina a top priority for the 109th Congress. Poorly \n     conceived and engineered flood control, and navigation \n     projects led to the destruction of coastal wetlands and \n     caused most of New Orleans' Katrina related flooding. \n     Billions of federal dollars flowed to low priority Corps \n     projects while acknowledged weaknesses in New Orleans levees \n     went unaddressed.\n       To avoid repeating these preventable disasters, Congress \n     must require to independent peer review of costly, \n     controversial, and high risk projects. With a 30-year backlog \n     of authorized projects, Congress should also establish a \n     credible system for identifying projects that deserve \n     priority funding. If the Water Resources Development Act \n     comes to the floor, Senators Feingold, McCain, Carper, \n     Lieberman and Jeffords will introduce well-crafted amendments \n     to address these two endemic problems with the Corps.\n       However, to undercut true reforms, competing amendments \n     developed by and for the Corps will be offered on the floor \n     by Senators Inhofe and Bond. The purpose of these amendments, \n     which do no more than codify existing Corps procedures that \n     have proved inadequate, is to give the appearance of reform \n     without the substance. We strongly urge you to reject these \n     distracting alternatives, which would prohibit review of how \n     models and tools are applied to a particular project; provide \n     only a snap shot assessment of design specifications, for \n     even the most critical projects; and give sole control over \n     peer review and prioritization ``evaluations'' to the Corps. \n     The Chief of Engineers, not an impartial officer or outside \n     body, would select project reviewers, decide which projects \n     should be reviewed, and recommend priority projects. It would \n     be absurd to vest this additional authority in the Corps in \n     light of the dramatic problems at the agency revealed by \n     Katrina and more than a decade of government and independent \n     studies.\n       We urge you to oppose the amendments offered by Senators \n     Inhofe and Bond and VOTE YES on the common sense reforms that \n     will be offered by Senators Feingold, McCain, Carper, \n     Lieberman and Jeffords when WRDA is brought to the Senate \n     floor.\n       Sincerely.\n       Rebecca Wodder, President, American Rivers.\n       Buck Parker, Executive Director, Earthjustice.\n       Brent Blackwelder, President, Friends of the Earth.\n       Martha Marks, President, Republicans for Environmental \n     Protection.\n       Doug Phelps, Chairman, Board of Directors, U.S. Public \n     Interest Research Group.\n       Roger Schlickeisen, President and CEO, Defenders of \n     Wildlife.\n       Fred Krupp, President, Environmental Defense.\n       Larry Schweiger, President and CEO, National Wildlife \n     Federation.\n       Carl Pope, Executive Director, Sierra Club.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     June 9, 2006.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: On behalf of the Michigan United \n     Conservation Clubs and the National Wildlife Federation, we \n     urge you to cosponsor the Independent Peer Review amendment \n     proposed by Senators Feingold and McCain, which will be \n     offered to the Water Resources Development Act when it comes \n     to the Senate floor for consideration. This provision would \n     address fundamental flaws with the Corps of Engineers and our \n     nation's water resources program that have been brought to \n     light by Hurricane Katrina. It would improve the health, \n     safety, and security of all Americans, while better \n     protecting the environment and the taxpayers.\n       As a senior member of the Senate Homeland Security and \n     Government Affairs Committee, you have done due diligence for \n     both the residents of New Orleans and Americans nationwide \n     who watched in horror the days after Hurricane Katrina hit \n     that historical city. Your thorough investigation into all \n     facets of the many failures that befell New Orleans exposed \n     numerous flaws in the federal response system. One of the \n     most startling flaws, in our regard, is the mismanagement of \n     the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n       Unchecked engineering flaws, poorly planned water projects \n     like the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet that destroy natural \n     flood protection, and misplaced priorities can have \n     disastrous consequences, and not just in a vulnerable city \n     like New Orleans. Senator Levin, this is an historic moment \n     for our nation. We must do a better job of managing our water \n     resources.\n       The amendments proposed by Senators Feingold and McCain \n     will steer the Corps in a new, more sustainable direction. \n     Recommendation 82 in your report called for independent peer \n     review task forces to be convened to oversee flood control \n     projects across the country. The Feingold-McCain Independent \n     Peer Review amendment will subject all costly and \n     controversial Corps projects to independent peer review. This \n     will provide an important check to ensure that projects \n     proposed by the Corps are based on sound science and \n     economics.\n       We urge you to cosponsor this critically needed amendment \n     before WRDA is brought to the Senate floor.\n       Sincerely,\n     Andy Buchsbaum,\n       Director, Great Lakes Natural Resource Center.\n     Sam Washington,\n       Executive Director, Michigan United Conservation Clubs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           The Izaak Walton League\n\n\n                                                   of America,\n\n                                  Gaithersburg, MD, July 17, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: The Izaak Walton League of America requests \n     that you oppose the current S. 728 Water Resources \n     Development Act when it comes to the Senate floor. A Water \n     Resources Development Act (WRDA) has not passed congress in \n     six years because of bad provisions and resistance to \n     necessary revisions that would safeguard the environment. \n     This legislation sets water policy for our nation and should \n     never be approved without due consideration to the \n     conservation of our water resources. Specifically, please \n     vote against any WRDA bill that contains the boondoggle \n     scheme to build new locks on the Upper Mississippi River. \n     This navigation expansion plan closely follows the Army Corps \n     of Engineers proposal for seven new locks that has been found \n     to be unjustified in multiple examinations by the National \n     Academy of Sciences. Furthermore, President Bush, the \n     Secretary of the Army for Civil Works and the Secretary of \n     Agriculture have all previously disputed the need for the new \n     locks.\n       Rather than spending billions on un-needed construction \n     projects, the Leagile reminds you that the Mississippi River \n     corridor contains an ecosystem home to 260 fish species, more \n     than 300 varieties of birds, and serves as the migratory path \n     to 40 percent of North America's waterfowl. And the Army \n     Corps of Engineers itself has reported this ecosystem is \n     ``significantly altered, is currently degraded, and is \n     expected to get worse.'' There is no need for the new locks; \n     it is time for the Senate to instead discuss the critical \n     ecological restoration needs of the Mississippi River.\n       We encourage you to support amendments to S. 728 offered by \n     Sen. Feingold and Sen. McCain.\n       The Independent Peer Review amendment will require the \n     Corps to submit costly or controversial projects to be \n     reviewed by an independent panel of experts in science and \n     transportation. This amendment will ensure that Corps \n     projects are based on solid engineering, are technically and \n     environmentally sound, and are fiscally responsible.\n       The Prioritization amendment will require an independent \n     panel to identify the top priority flood control, navigation, \n     and restoration projects for our country. The panel will \n     share their findings with Congress to guide funding \n     decisions.\n       Our country's water resources are far too important to be \n     altered without complete review, and our federal funds are \n     far too scarce to be spent on unjustified new locks. Thank \n     you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Bradley Redlin,\n     Director, Agricultural Programs.\n                                  ____\n\n         Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, Ellington \n           Agricultural Center,\n                                     Nashville, TN, July 17, 2006.\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Alexander: We are writing this letter in \n     support of the Feingold-McCain-Carper-Lieberman-Jeffords \n     sponsored amendment to the Water Resources Development Act \n     (WRDA) which is scheduled to be on the floor of the Senate \n     sometime the week of July 17, 2006. The proposed amendment \n     allows for the formation of a Water Resources Coordinating \n     Committee (WRCC) which will provide review and oversight to \n     water resources projects by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. \n     This interagency task force will prioritize Corps 'projects; \n     establish a transparent system of ongoing review; and issue \n     recommendations set upon\n\n[[Page S7837]]\n\n     strict timelines that will not delay the planning process. \n     The amendment provides WRCC review for all projects exceeding \n     $40 million; when a state Governor requests it; when a \n     federal agency finds the project will have a significant \n     adverse impact, or when the Secretary of the Army determines \n     that the project is controversial. We urge you to support the \n     Feingold-McCain-Carper-Lieberman-Jeffords amendment to the \n     WRDA which ensures a meaningful, independent review mechanism \n     to review Corps projects.\n       A competing amendment to the WRDA is being sponsored by \n     Senators Inhofe and Bond that imposes little change on how \n     the Corps does business. It continues to foster a system \n     without clear water resource priorities and allows the Corps \n     to ignore requests from federal agencies and state Governors. \n     Furthermore, reviews will only cover scientific, engineering \n     or technical bases of the decision or recommendation, but not \n     recommendations resulting from the data. Environmental \n     reviews accompanying a feasibility study would not be subject \n     to the overall review. Review will be one-time instead of \n     ongoing during the life of each Corps project, and will not \n     be independent; allowing the Corps Chief of Engineers to \n     select the review panel. Only projects exceeding $100 million \n     will be subject to mandatory review, allowing the Corps \n     discretion to avoid review for most projects. We urge you to \n     vote to defeat the Inhofe-Bond amendment which allows the \n     Corps to continue to ignore priorities for politics.\n       The current lack of clear water resources priorities is \n     damaging the nation's economic development, transportation \n     systems, and ability to protect its citizens and property \n     from flooding and natural disasters. The Feingold-McCain-\n     Carper-Lieberman-Jeffords amendment moves the nation toward a \n     transparent system that establishes water resource priorities \n     through independent, external peer review. The review system \n     proposed by this amendment ensures that Congress has the \n     information it needs to direct limited federal resources to \n     meet the nation's most urgent needs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Tim Churchill,\n                              Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the need for change could not be more \nclear, and I hope that today the Senate will adopt the Feingold-McCain-\nCarper-Lieberman-Jeffords-Collins independent peer review amendment and \nreject the Inhofe-Bond counter amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have several times addressed both sides \nof the agreement we have in terms of how Katrina would have been \naffected with the various different types of approaches of peer review. \nI was approached by the junior Senator from Louisiana who said that in \nLouisiana they are very strongly in support of the Inhofe-Bond \namendment. He says those in support are the City of New Orleans, \nJefferson Parish, St. Tammany Parish, the State of Louisiana, the \nTerrebonne Levee and Conservation District, and the Red River Valley \nAssociation.\n  I yield as much time to the Senator from South Dakota as he desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman.\n  I congratulate the chairman of the committee and Senator Jeffords and \nSenator Bond and others who have worked so hard to get this measure to \nthe floor.\n  Congress is long overdue in reauthorizing this important measure. As \na member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I am pleased to \nbe part of efforts to improve the functionality of the Army Corps of \nEngineers.\n  While my home State of South Dakota doesn't have any new specific \nprojects in this bill, I appreciate the hard work that has been put in \non the part of Chairman Inhofe, Subcommittee Chairman Bond, and \nSenators Jeffords and Boxer in getting this long overdue legislation to \nthe floor for consideration and hopefully a favorable vote.\n  I express my appreciation to the bill managers for their willingness \nto extend the provisions having to do with the Missouri River \nRestoration Act that was authorized in the 2000 Water Resources \nDevelopment Act bill.\n  This particular provision will allow the State of South Dakota to \nmove forward with a task force report from State, tribal, and Federal \nentities concerning siltation, erosion, and the status of Native \nAmerican historical and cultural sites along the Missouri River.\n  My colleagues will be interested to know that my home State of South \nDakota has four dams along the Missouri River which resulted in the \nflooding of hundreds of thousands of acres of State, tribal, and \nprivate lands. This particular provision will assist in addressing some \nof the consequences of the construction of those dams.\n  Additionally, I appreciate the inclusion of clarifying language in \nsection 5010 that will assist the U.S. Treasury in managing the assets \nwithin the Habitat Restoration Trust Fund for the Cheyenne River Sioux \nTribe and the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe that was created in the 1999 WRDA \nbill. These trust funds are close to being fully capitalized and will \ngreatly assist mitigation of the terrestrial impacts that resulted with \nthe construction of the Oahe and Sharpe reservoirs. This language was \nrequested by the U.S. Treasury and will assure the trust fund's assets \nare properly invested.\n  I also would highlight that the Governor of South Dakota is very \nsupportive of a provision I advocated in section 3126 which ensures \nthat Missouri River recovery funds are available to upper basin \nStates--States including Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota--that \nwould be covered by that provision.\n  While there have been some previous disagreements among the upper \nbasin States and lower basin States regarding the management of the \nMissouri River, I am pleased to see that section 5008 has been included \nto allow all the stakeholders along the Missouri River to work together \nin laying out what needs to be done to address long-term recovery and \nmitigation activities.\n  I rise today to again congratulate and give due credit to the \nleadership of Environment and Public Works Committee on both sides of \nthe aisle, and our leadership here in the Senate in getting this \nlegislation to the floor.\n  This is a bill, as I said, which I had some experience working on as \na Member of the House of Representatives back in 2004. It is something \nthat we reauthorize on a fairly regular basis. But this one in \nparticular is long overdue.\n  There are many needs that have been raised for why we need a \nreauthorization of the Water Resources Development Act, and I also add \nin terms of the direct benefits to South Dakota and our issues with \nregard to the Missouri River which are many and have been going on for \na very long time.\n  I also add that the agricultural groups in South Dakota have all \nweighed in in favor of getting this bill to the floor, voted on and on \nthe President's desk because of the important projects that are \nincluded that will make it more possible for them to get their \nagricultural products to the marketplace.\n  It is widely supported by a lot of groups in my State--agricultural \ngroups, the Governor of South Dakota, and obviously the tribes of South \nDakota, who have been impacted as well when the Missouri River was \ndammed up and lands were taken to help in flood control issues \ndownstream. There have been ongoing disputes over the years with \nrespect to this river and how it is managed by the Corps of Engineers.\n  This bill moves us a long way toward addressing some of those issues \nand making sure that we have good policies and a good process in place \nfor the needs of the States that are impacted by the Missouri River--my \nState right down the center--which, as I said, has provided a number of \nbenefits, construction of the dams and the area of recreation but also \nhas created a number of challenges for landowners, and for many of the \nbenefits that were promised when the dams were put in. People in my \nState don't believe they have been fully realized. It seems we have \nbeen fighting ever since between the up- and downstream States over \ngetting policies in place that will effectively manage in a fair way \nthe Missouri River.\n\n  The WRDA bill doesn't address all those legal issues, but it \ncertainly does address many of the ongoing challenges we face in making \nsure that the Missouri River is a river that provides for all the \nvarious users.\n  There are many stakeholders, as I mentioned earlier, who have a \nvested interest in seeing this bill get passed. I am pleased today to \nbe able to rise in support, and I urge us to get a vote on it, pass it, \nand get it on the President's desk and signed into law so this long\n\n[[Page S7838]]\n\noverdue legislation can be put into effect and begin to provide the \nbenefits and the intended results for those who have been waiting for \nits passage.\n  I yield my time to the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, and again give him due credit for getting this bill to the \nfloor today. I hope we get a very favorable vote.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota. He \nhas been a huge help on the committee. He is always very active.\n  I agree with him, the WRDA bill has been pretty heavy lifting. We \nwere both around in 2004 when we had our last reauthorization. It was \nnot an easy accomplishment. It was one that was almost the magnitude of \nthe Transportation reauthorization bill.\n  We have these amendments, and we are coming down to the wire where we \nare going to be able to see final passage before too long. I thank my \nfriend from South Dakota for all of his help.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the time be \nequally divided during the quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent Senators Cornyn and Hutchison \nboth be added as cosponsors to the Inhofe-Bond amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nIowa. He is going to speak as in morning business, but I understand it \nwill be charged against my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized \nfor 3 minutes.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Harkin and Mr. McCain are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, while we have a minute or two here, the \nSenator from Oklahoma and I have agreed--and I hope the Senator from \nVermont would agree--that on the next amendment we could get it \ndispensed with pretty quickly. We do not intend to propose the other \ntwo amendments which we had pending. So as far as the Senator from \nWisconsin and I are concerned, we would only have one additional \namendment, and if it is agreeable to the managers of the bill, that \nwould be for an hour equally divided.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the junior Senator \nfrom Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my strong support \nfor S. 728, the Water Resources Development Act. This is truly a \nmomentous and important day for Florida. My State is home to beautiful \nbeaches, coastal estuaries, numerous ports, and the Everglades. No \npiece of legislation moving through Congress could have as much lasting \nimprovement on Florida's fragile ecosystem as the WRDA bill.\n  I express my sincere thanks to the EPW chairman, Senator Jim Inhofe, \nand Senator Bond for their diligent leadership in crafting this \nlegislation. I also thank Majority Leader Frist and Senators Reid and \nJeffords for reaching time agreements and allowing this historic \nlegislation to come to the floor. So often the media depicts Congress \nin such an acrimonious light, and I believe this bill is a testament to \nthe fact that bipartisanship still exists in the Senate and that we can \nalso roll up our sleeves and act for the betterment of our Nation.\n  For too long in our Nation's past, the Federal Government's water \nresources policies seemed to be in conflict with nature. In the not-so-\ndistant past, the Corps and even the elected congressional and State \nleadership of Florida was determined to drain the Everglades. One of \nour most colorful former Governors, Napoleon Bonaparte Broward, \nfamously proclaimed: ``Water will run downhill!'' At that time, \ndraining and improving ``useless swampland'' was the epitome of true \nconservation because opening the wetlands and marshes of Florida to \nfarming and development was considered a better use of land because it \ncould feed and employ people. The idea that places should be protected \nfor their intrinsic beauty and public enjoyment was a foreign concept. \nFortunately for our Nation and Florida, the idea of conservation and \nrestoration has an entirely different and more sophisticated meaning \ntoday than it did in years past.\n  In 2000, Congress authorized the landmark Comprehensive Everglades \nRestoration Plan to repair and restore the natural sheet flow of water \nacross the Everglades National Park into Florida Bay. CERP projects \nwill capture and store a great deal of the nearly 1.7 billion gallons \nof fresh water a day which are currently released into the Atlantic \nOcean and Gulf of Mexico. This water will be restored in above- and \nunderground reservoirs. And when needed, it will be directed to the \nwetlands, lakes, rivers, and estuaries of south Florida--providing \nabundant, clean, fresh water, while also ensuring future urban and \nagricultural water supplies.\n  This incredible undertaking is the largest environmental restoration \nproject in the world. I am proud to say the State of Florida has made \nan historic and prolific financial investment of over $3 billion to \nhonor its commitment to the Everglades restoration. And now, with the \nexpected passage of WRDA, new major CERP projects such as the Indian \nRiver Lagoon and the Picayune Strand will finally be federally \nauthorized so this important restoration effort can start to take \nshape.\n  The Indian River Lagoon's South Restoration Project in WRDA is \ncritical to the success of CERP and returning the Saint Lucie estuary \nto a healthy status. Approximately 2,200 species have been identified \nin the lagoon system, with 35 of these species listed as threatened or \nendangered.\n  Implementation of the South Restoration Project will feature more \nthan 12,000 acres of aboveground water reservoirs; 9,000 acres of \nmanmade wetlands; and 90,000 acres of natural storage and water quality \nareas, including 53,000 acres of restored wetlands. We will also be \npleased to restore a great deal of the Saint Lucie River, with a \ncorresponding restoration of 2,600 acres of habitat.\n  Another very important Everglades restoration project included in \nWRDA is the authorization of the Picayune Strand project. This area was \noriginally planned as the largest subdivision in the United States \ncalled Golden Gate Estates. In the early 1960s, the Gulf American \nCorporation dredged 48 miles of canals, built over 290 miles of roads, \nand sold thousands of lots before going bankrupt. At that time, there \nwere no Federal or State laws setting drainage standards. So now today \nwe will be moving that area back into somewhat of its natural state and \nnatural habitat, and it will join with the Big Cypress National \nPreserve and the 10,000 Islands National Wildlife Refuge. It will also \nprovide additional grounds for the Florida Panther Wildlife Refuge.\n  These are great things for our State. They are great things for \nrestoring back to a lot of its original beauty Florida's ecosystem; not \njust the beauty but also the functionality of providing for wetlands as \na renourishment\n\n[[Page S7839]]\n\nof Florida's aquifer, which also is so important to maintaining the \nurban lifestyle of south Florida.\n  The need to pass a comprehensive water resources bill in Florida is \noverwhelming. Florida will benefit tremendously from it. I want to use \nthis opportunity to thank Chairman Inhofe and Senator Bond for \nincluding these vital restoration and economic development projects in \nWRDA. This legislation is long overdue. It is time for us to pass S. \n728. I urge my colleagues to support final passage of this very \nimportant piece of legislation to Florida.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin has 30 seconds remaining. All other time \nhas expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the amendment cosponsored by Senators \nMcCain, Carper, Lieberman, Jeffords and Collins will ensure independent \nreview of Army Corps projects that are costly, controversial or \ncritical to public safety. The amendment responds to over 10 years of \nstudies, including analysis of the Katrina disaster, documenting \nserious problems with planning and design of Army Corps projects. We \nowe it to the people of New Orleans, and to all of our constituents, to \nensure close scrutiny of critical flood control projects, as \nrecommended by the Homeland Security Committee. That is what our \namendment does.\n  Despite any outcome on my amendment, I urge my colleagues to vote \n``nay'' on the Inhofe-Bond amendment which maintains the unacceptable \nstatus quo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 4681, as modified.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMcCain be recognized to offer an amendment regarding prioritization \nreport; further, that following the reporting of that amendment, \nSenator Inhofe be recognized to offer an amendment on fiscal \ntransparency; provided further that there be 1 hour total for both \namendments, to be divided equally between Senators Inhofe and McCain; \nfurther, that following the use or yielding of time, the Senate proceed \nto a vote in relation to the McCain-Feingold amendment, to be followed \nby a vote in relation to the Inhofe-Bond amendment, with no intervening \ntime or extra debate; and that following the votes, there will be 30 \nminutes equally divided, followed by a vote on final passage.\n  Mr. President, let me restate this. We have too many things going on, \nso let me be sure we get it right.\n  The unanimous consent request is that Senator McCain be recognized to \noffer an amendment regarding prioritization report; further, that \nfollowing the reporting of that amendment, Senator Inhofe be recognized \nto offer an amendment on fiscal transparency; provided further that \nthere be 1 hour total for both amendments to be divided between \nSenators Inhofe and McCain; further, that there be 30 minutes equally \ndivided for general debate on the bill, and that following the use or \nyielding of time, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the \nMcCain-Feingold amendment, to be followed by a vote in relation to the \nInhofe amendment, to be followed by a vote on final passage, all with \nno intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, could I ask \nmy friend if I could have just a few minutes? It sounds like the \nunanimous consent takes up all the time, and I just wanted to speak for \n4 or 5 minutes on the bill, which I would want to do before we got into \nthat.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would respond to my friend from Missouri that we do \nhave in this unanimous consent request 30 minutes equally divided \nbefore final passage, and I would be glad to yield to the Senator at \nthat time.\n  Mr. TALENT. That will be fine.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nlike to ask the Chair if there is any possible way we could take the \nopportunity to give myself and my colleague from Arkansas and Senator \nRockefeller just a few moments to speak in morning business in behalf \nof paying tribute to our Lieutenant Governor from Arkansas.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes. Let me respond to the Senators from Arkansas. I have \ntalked to Senator Rockefeller and we have agreed that as soon as this \nUC goes through, we will recognize him and the Senator from Arkansas \nfor up to 15 minutes for that purpose.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. We are so grateful. We appreciate that from our \ncolleague from Oklahoma.\n\n[[Page S7840]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Pryor, and Mr. Rockefeller are \nprinted in today's Record under ``Morning Business''.)\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the chairman of the committee and ranking \nmember. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, while we have a moment I would like to \ntake some time to thank the staff from the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee.\n  Senator Inhofe's staff is first class, including Ruth Van Mark, \nAndrew Wheeler, Angie Giancarlo, Stephen Aaron, and many others.\n  Senator Bond's lead staffer Letmon Lee has done excellent work on \nthis bill.\n  Paul Wilkins and Sara Roberts from Senator Baucus' staff also \ncontributed extensively to this product.\n  From my staff, Ken Connolly, Alison Taylor, Margaret Weatherald, and \nCaroline Ahearn have been tremendous.\n  But most importantly I wanted to recognize two staff people who have \nworked for years and years on Army Corps issues and specifically this \nbill.\n  First, Catharine Cyr Ransom. Catharine is an exceptional Senate \nstaffer. She works hard, is fair, and a joy to work with. She also is \nvery persistent and has made sure that my little State of Vermont has \nbeen looked after in this legislation.\n  Finally, JoEllen Darcy, who has been with the Committee 12 years, and \nhas lived through this WRDA process for her entire tenure, is a true \ngem. JoEllen has an incredible record of legislative success on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee due to her depth of knowledge, \nkind manner, and strong negotiating skills. She is also an avid Red Sox \nfan, which says a lot about her character and why I like her so much.\n  I thank all the staff for their work and for all their work through \nthe August recess on this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, right now we are waiting for Senator \nMcCain to return and call up his legislation in conjunction with the \nunanimous consent agreement.\n  I would like also to say the same thing. It has been great working \nwith Senator Jeffords and his staff, as well as other staff members, \nand of course my staff. Angie, here, has been the primary driver with \nSteve Aaron and Blu Hulsey, David Lungren, our staff director, and Ruth \nVan Mark, who has done so much work on the transportation end.\n  On Senator Bond's staff, Letmon Lee; of course, JoEllen Darcey with \nSenator Jeffords, Catharine Ransom, Alison Taylor, and I guess I would \nhave to mention Ken Connolly, too, as someone who hangs around and gets \nthings done, and Paul Wilkins with Senator Baucus.\n  There is a lot of truth to this. This is more of a nonpartisan \ncommittee. We have a lot of issues on which we disagree, but when it \ngets down to the big authorization we recognize that what we deal with \nare some of the most significant aspects of government--those that have \nto get done.\n  It is the only way to do that when we are dealing with many areas--is \ncooperate. I appreciate all the staff working together.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4684\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I call up my amendment which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Feingold, Mr. Lieberman, and Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4684.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide for a water resources construction project \n                         prioritization report)\n\n       On page 76 between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2007.

Mr. President, if I may ask the distinguished chairman, \nhave we entered into a time agreement on this amendment?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, we have. In fact, I will be bringing up mine, and we \nwill consider them jointly. There will be 1 hour equally divided.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Ohio be \nrecognized for however much time he may take in support of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I would like to second the remarks of \nSenator Inhofe about Senator Jeffords. I have had an opportunity to \nwork with Senator Jeffords now for 8 years. We have had our good days \nand bad days, but we never had good days and bad days between us. I \nconsider him to be an outstanding Senator and a gentleman. I appreciate \nthe courtesies which he has extended me over the years of his \ndistinguished career.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator for his remarks. It has been a \nprivilege to work with him. We got some things done.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Water \nResources Development Act of 2006.\n  I commend Senators Inhofe, Jeffords, and Bond--and their staffs--for \ntheir hard work and strong leadership in putting together a bipartisan \nbill. As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I am \npleased to have been a part of this effort. But I want to make it clear \nthat Senator Inhofe is the driving force and Senator Bond kept pushing \nus. If it wasn't for their unbelievable commitment to this, we wouldn't \nbe here today.\n  It has been 6 years since the Congress last passed a Water Resources \nand Development reauthorization bill. I remember it because I was \nchairman of the subcommittee that handled the bill. The time has come \nto finally pass this legislation.\n  America's infrastructure and waterways system is the foundation of \nour economy. For too long, we have been ignoring our infrastructure, \nbut Katrina was a wake-up call for all of us. In the wake of this \ndisaster, we saw firsthand the devastating impact of a weak \ninfrastructure on our people and our economy. The more we continue to \nfail to fund our water infrastructure, the more we are putting our \nNation's competitiveness at risk in this global marketplace.\n  It has a new dimension to it because if we are going to compete in \nthe global marketplace, we need to build the infrastructure for \ncompetitiveness, and we have had our heads in the sand in terms of the \ncondition of that infrastructure. It is a critical piece of America's \ncompetitiveness.\n  Our infinite needs are overwhelming and being squeezed. We should be \nrebuilding an infrastructure so that the new generation has at least \nthe same opportunity to enjoy our standard of living and quality of \nlife.\n  Right now, our infrastructure is collapsing due to insufficient \nfunding. Congress desperately needs to provide increased funding for \nthe Army Corps of Engineers, including funding for levees and funding \nfor additional engineers.\n  I have been concerned about the backlog of unfunded Corps projects \nsince I was chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure in 1999. When I arrived in the Senate in 1999, the \nbacklog of unfunded Corps operation and maintenance projects was $250 \nmillion. Today, it is $1.2 billion. At that time, there was a backlog \nof $38 billion active water resource projects waiting for Federal \nfunding. I want to emphasize that.\n  Today, according to the administration, there are about $50 billion \nin Army Corps construction projects that are in need of Federal \nfunding.\n  Despite these needs, the Corps is currently able to function only at \n50-percent capacity at the rate of funding proposed by the budget. It \nis hard to believe when you consider what we have had with Katrina.\n  Annual appropriations for the Corps' construction accounts has fallen \nfrom a $4 billion average in the mid-1960s to a $1.5 billion average \nfor 1996 through 2005.\n  The stark reality is at the current levels of construction \nappropriations, the Corps' water resource projects, we already have \nmore water resource projects authorized for construction than we can \ncomplete. At the current low levels of construction, it would take 25 \nyears to complete the active projects in the backlog without even \nconsidering additional project authorizations that are in this bill.\n\n  That is why I am supporting the prioritization amendment offered by \nSenator McCain and Senator Feingold.\n  I tried to get this kind of amendment back 5 or 6 years ago, but it \nwas rebuffed. We don't want to do that. We don't want to prioritize \nanything. It might be someone's special project, and it may not get on \nthe list where they would like it to be. So let's not do that.\n  Unfortunately, appropriations for the Corps program have not been \nadequate to meet the needs that have been identified in our Nation. We \nhave also been asking the Corps to do more with less. I am all for \ntrimming fat from the Federal budget and practicing fiscal discipline, \nbut the Corps of Engineers budget is not fat--it is the bread and \nbutter of our economy and our infrastructure.\n  I believe this amendment will reduce this backlog. This amendment \nwould allow the Water Resources Coordinating Committee, an interagency \ntask force that has been established in the underlying bill, to \nestablish transparent, project-specific national priority criteria, \nclassify projects either currently under construction or authorized \ninto a tier system based on that criteria, and then issue a nonbinding \nprioritization report to the authorizing and appropriations committees.\n  I will bet you that a lot of what they have against this is because \nthey do not want anyone to tinker with what they do. The fact is, I \nthink we owe it to them to make sure they have some priority list as to \nthe importance of these projects as well as the Office of Management \nand Budget to help guild them in their funding decisions. This report \nwould also be made available to the public.\n  I believe this report would ensure that the most critical projects in \nthe Nation are receiving adequate funding. Katrina showed us the \nimportance of prioritization.\n  We need a comprehensive prioriti- zation system to ensure that \nCongress has the information it needs to direct limited Federal \nresources to the most urgent projects.\n  When I was Governor of the State of Ohio, the State had hundreds of \nhighway projects that every preceding Governor had promised each \nmunicipality would be built. It is whatever you want, you got it. The \nlist was unbelievable. The projects would have cost the State of Ohio \nbetween $5 billion and $6 billion to build, whereas the State typically \nonly received between $100 million and $300 million a year. At the \ntime, it would have taken decades to build all the projects my \nconstituents asked for, even if another new project was not added to \nthe list for years.\n  In order to deal with the imbalance between demand and available \nrevenue, I created an objective, criteria-driven project selection \nprocess called the Transportation Review Advisory Council, or TRAC. \nThis process gives paramount consideration to effective management of \nthe backlog to assure that it only includes needed projects that\n\n[[Page S7842]]\n\nare economically justified, environmentally acceptable, and supported \nby willing and financially capable, nonfederal sponsors. The State is \nrequired to balance this project list with the State's revenue \nprojections.\n  The TRAC also is required to issue a 4-year fiscal forecast after \nCongress passes each highway bill to get an idea of how much money we \nare going to get. It made no sense for the State of Ohio to continue \nproject development on projects worth millions of dollars that had no \nrealistic hope of ever being built. I think my constituents are much \nbetter served by this system because the State is investing its \nresources in projects that will become a reality in the near future.\n  I am sure the President would understand this. When you have a \nhighway bill, a lot of the Congressmen would put in earmarks on \nprojects. And today when they are earmarking, they earmark it for \nprojects that are on that list because they know that the money will be \nspent for the project.\n  We need to take similar steps in the Senate in addressing our water \nresource needs. It is long overdue with the limited resources that we \nhave. Hopefully, one day we will face up to those limited resources in \nterms of our infrastructure. We need a prioritization.\n  I think Senator McCain and Senator Feingold have put together a very \ngood amendment.\n  Again, I know it may be controversial for some of the authorizers, \nbut it is time that we do this.\n  The passage of another WRDA bill cannot be delayed any further. It is \nsimply too important to our Nation in terms of its benefits to our \neconomy and environment and for the speedy recovery for the areas \naffected by Hurricane Katrina.\n  I call on President Bush and my colleagues in both the House and the \nSenate to work expeditiously to get this bill enacted into law as soon \nas possible.\n  Really from the bottom of my heart, I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bill and this amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4683\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask that the Inhofe-Bond amendment be \nbrought up for immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], for himself and Mr. \n     Bond, proposes an amendment numbered 4683.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To modify a section relating to a fiscal transparency and \n                         prioritization report)\n\n       Strike section 2004 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2004.

and\n       (III) the risk of loss of human life and risk to public \n     safety if the project is not completed, taking into \n     consideration the existence and probability of success of \n     evacuation plans relating to the project, as determined by \n     the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency;\n\n       (ii) for evaluating the benefit of a project to the \n     national economy--\n\n       (I) the benefit-cost ratio, and the remaining benefit-\n     remaining cost ratio, of the project;\n       (II) the availability and cost of alternate transportation \n     methods relating to the project;\n       (III) any applicable financial risk to a non-Federal \n     sponsor of the project;\n       (IV) the costs to State, regional, and local entities of \n     project termination;\n       (V) any contribution of the project with respect to \n     international competitiveness; and\n       (VI) the extent to which the project is integrated with, \n     and complementary to, other Federal, State, and local \n     government programs, projects, and objectives within the \n     project area;\n\n       (iii) for evaluating the extent to which a project protects \n     or enhances the environment--\n\n       (I) for ecosystem restoration projects and mitigation plans \n     associated with other project purposes--\n\n       (aa) the extent to which the project or plan restores the \n     natural hydrologic processes of an aquatic habitat;\n       (bb) the significance of the resource to be protected or \n     restored by the project or plan;\n       (cc) the extent to which the project or plan is self-\n     sustaining; and\n       (dd) the cost-effectiveness of the project or plan; and\n\n       (II) the pollution reduction benefits associated with using \n     water as a method of transportation of goods; and\n\n       (iv) for evaluating the extent to which a project promotes \n     the national defense--\n\n       (I) the effect of the project relating to a strategic port \n     designation; and\n       (II) the reduction of dependence on foreign oil associated \n     with using water as a method of transportation of goods.\n\n       (c) Contents.--In addition to the information described in \n     subsections (a) and (b), the report shall contain a detailed \n     accounting of the following information:\n       (1) With respect to general construction, information on--\n       (A) projects currently under construction, including--\n       (i) allocations to date;\n       (ii) the number of years remaining to complete \n     construction;\n       (iii) the estimated annual Federal cost to maintain that \n     construction schedule;

and\n       (E) a brief explanation of the reasons for the delay.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n15 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my chairman, Chairman Inhofe, for \ngranting me this time.\n  I feel so strongly against this amendment. I really need the time to \nexplain to my good colleagues why I think it ought to be voted down.\n  We have amendments before us from time to time and they come to us as \nreform. I totally understand that we need reform in this whole area of \nthe way we prioritize projects that come before us. But I don't believe \nthis is reform at all. In my view, I think this is a delegation of the \nresponsibility of the Senate and the House over to the executive \nbranch. I believe it is going to be put into the hands of people who \nwon't know a thing about this subject matter, and it is going to bring \npolitics right into this Chamber. We were elected by the people. The \ncities and counties count on us to do our homework, to do our due \ndiligence and understand what the needs are of our people, what our \nflood control needs are in our States, what our other needs are in our \nStates, the studies that need to be performed, and all of that. That is \nour job.\n  The McCain amendment just simply wraps it all up and tosses it over \nto the executive branch. It sets up a whole new bureaucracy that I \nthink is absolutely unnecessary and, frankly, I think it is disastrous \nfor this WRDA bill. Unlike the other amendment which we supported, \nwhich is peer review, that looked forward, this amendment looks back \ninto this bill where we have sat for years and years.\n  Again, I thank Senators Inhofe, Jeffords, Bond, and Baucus and the \nleaders of this committee who have worked with us to ferret out the \nprojects that didn't have merit. I can attest to the fact that I had an \namendment that I wanted to move forward.\n  I was persuaded by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that \nthere was a better way to move forward.\n  We have done our work. This amendment is well intended. I know that. \nI know the people who have put it forward to us have good intentions. \nBut I think it is going to make it more difficult for worthy projects \nto get needed funding. That includes projects that have an impact on \npublic health and safety.\n  I may have a debate with Senator Bond over which project I think is \nthe more worthy and we will sit and talk about it and we will argue \nabout it. At the end of the day, there will be a decision. Why should \nthe two of us toss that all over to the executive branch, no matter who \nis President? What does it have to do with them? It is our bill. The \nPresident has the right to veto it if he doesn't like it or sign it. \nBut thrashing out what ought to be in it and what is good, we have done \nthat. That is part of our job.\n  There is another problem with this amendment. It sets up a nightmare \nof a tier system. You have to fight your way into a tier in order to be \nfunded. The administration--this one and the next one and the one \nthereafter--will be able to recommend which tier your State projects \nought to be in. When the first tier reaches $5 billion, or when there \nare 100 projects in it, that tier is finished. So if you have a very \nimportant project, a large project, but let's say we all know we have \nto move to help the folks who are impacted by Hurricane Katrina, and \nthey have priority--we all agree that it has a very high priority--if \nyou represent a large State, you have a large project, you will never \nmake it into the first tier. It is bad for my State.\n  Frankly, it is bad for any project that is large enough and can't get \ninto the first tier--it gets knocked down. You get stuck in a lower \ntier simply because the project may protect more people. How does that \nmake any sense whatsoever? It is an arbitrary system. It can label a \nproject as second tier despite critical local public safety needs. It \nwill undermine a project's chances of receiving appropriations.\n\n  We already know what a fight we have to convince our colleagues in \nthe Committee on Appropriations that the projects in our State have \nmerit. We subject these projects to tremendous scrutiny, first in this \nparticular WRDA bill. As we struggle to get appropriations funds, we \nhave to make the case. Then we have to go to conference and continue to \nmake the case.\n  Under this amendment, I am sorry to say this is no reform. I ask \nrhetorically if this makes any sense. There is a very important \ncommittee that has been set up in the underlying bill. The committee \nhas some very important functions, but now the McCain amendment adds \nthis next function on to this committee, this coordinating committee \nwhich, by the way, is going to hire an executive director.\n  If anyone wants to learn how projects and laws get bogged down, here \nis an example. This committee that is going to be set up includes the \nfollowing people: The Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of \nAgriculture, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary \nof Housing and Development, the Secretary of Transportation, the \nSecretary of Energy, the Secretary of Commerce, the Administrator of \nthe EPA, the chairperson of the Council on Environmental Quality, and \nhere is my favorite, the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  We all know about their priority list. We just took a look at their \npriority list. Petting zoos should be protected before bridges and \nhighways. They have included Old McDonald's Petting Zoo, a bourbon \nfestival, a bean festival, the Kangaroo Conservation Center. This is \nwhat the Department of Homeland Security said ought to be prioritized.\n  Do we want to invite them into a new prioritization game for the WRDA \nprojects? I hope not. What could come out of this is not good.\n  In discussing this with my colleagues, they say: But, Senator Boxer, \nthey are just going to recommend. We have the ability to sit down among \nourselves--Democrats and Republicans--as we have done in this bill, and \ncome to some decisions on what the priorities are. I believe the \nCommittee on Appropriations, working with all of us, has a second bite \nat that apple.\n  I don't believe we need to ask this President or any future President \nto get into this issue and convene meetings, have studies, and waste \nmoney just to put together a list that they say is their priorities. \nWhat makes their priorities better than our priorities? They are not \neven elected. This is not even their job. How do you come forward--I \nask my friend from Arizona, rhetorically, because he is not here--\ngiving people who have no idea what this is about the power over the \nprojects? They say it is just a recommendation, but we know they will \ntake that seriously.\n  We remember the whole tizzy when they said they thought it was fine \nfor the country of Dubai to run our ports. There was a big debate in \nthe Senate. Most Members believed that was a mistake. That also came \nout of some committee.\n  We all fight to get here. We all work hard to get here. At a minimum, \nwe are in touch with our States and we know the needs of our States. \nThe Congress, not a political appointee, not some bureaucrat, but \nMembers of the Senate should retain the central responsibility for \nestablishing the border resource priorities for their States. Instead, \nthis amendment leaves the recommendation of priorities up to a \ncommittee made up of Cabinet and other political appointees.\n  We are inviting politics into this debate. As Senator Inhofe said, \nthis is one of those rare moments in history, this bill, where politics \nis left at the committee door. We worked together. We worked hard \ntogether. Now, with this McCain amendment, we are injecting partisan \npolitics. In this case it is a Republican President. In future years it \ncould be a Democratic President. It does not make any difference.\n  We should do our job. We should not punt the ball elsewhere. What are \nwe here for? Anyone who votes for this, and I am sure there will be a \nfew--I hope not too many--the message they are basically sending is \nthat they do\n\n[[Page S7844]]\n\nnot feel comfortable enough, they do not feel knowledgeable enough, \nthey do not feel strong enough to stand up for what needs to be done in \ntheir States.\n  Again, I ask, do we really want to have the Department of Homeland \nSecurity deciding the critical water resource projects? They have \nenough to do to get their own priorities in order.\n  With all due respect to members of the Cabinet, we as individual \nSenators know our States' needs. We know our States' priorities. This \nis not reform; this is injecting, in my view, partisanship into a very \nbipartisan approach.\n  I trust my colleagues, whether Republican or Democrat, in this bill \nbecause they have to explain why their projects are worthy. This is not \nlike an earmark where something is stuck in the bill in the middle of \nthe night. This is a major reauthorization bill where every project is \nlooked at very carefully. I don't believe any Cabinet is going to be \nmore effective at telling us what projects should be funded.\n  As Members of Congress, let us not surrender our responsibility to an \nexecutive branch that, in my view, will not reflect the real needs of \nour people. I urge my colleagues to vote no, a very sound no, on this \namendment. Let's send a message today that this Senate knows what it is \ndoing in this bill.\n  I feel very comfortable with the leadership of Senators Inhofe and \nJeffords, that we do know what we are doing in this bill. If you are \nfor this bill, I hope you will vote no on the McCain amendment.\n  I give the remainder of my time to the good Senator, Mr. Inhofe. I \nthank him so much for the chance to speak against this amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from California for bringing up some \nvery good points.\n  How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The total time remaining is 17 minutes 45 \nseconds.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Parliamentary inquiry because there is some confusion, \nwithout using our time to make the parliamentary inquiry: It is my \nunderstanding that while we have an hour equally divided on the two \namendments that are going to be voted back to back, there is also 30 \nminutes equally divided on final passage. All of this time would be \nused prior to the three votes that come consecutively; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If that is the case, there would be more like 30 minutes \nremaining because each side would have 45 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The agreement contemplated that the final 30 \nminutes would be used after the initial hour so that the Senator's \nassumption is correct that he will have 15 minutes after the 17 minutes \nand 35 minutes is expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent on our side, and I suggest they \nprobably want to do the same thing, that our time not be segregated as \nto the amendments versus final passage so we could have 45 minutes for \neither as we desire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. With that, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMissouri who has been very helpful and constructive in this \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for the time and also \nfor the kind remarks. I appreciate the excellent leadership he has \nprovided and the bipartisan nature with which he and Senator Jeffords \nbrought this bill to the Senate.\n  It is important to take a look at the substance of what is going on \nin these prioritization amendments now before the Senate which deal \nwith fiscal deadlines and requirements and, in turn, how projects \nshould be prioritized. I hope our colleagues will listen carefully to \nthe context of the WRDA legislation and the Corps reform.\n  Worthwhile projects of the Corps of Engineers should be funded. The \ninadequate funding of the levees in New Orleans was a bad mistake. We \nneed to fund worthwhile levees, but the best route is not the total \noverhaul of the Corps and passage of the Feingold-McCain amendments, in \nthis case, specifically, the prioritization amendment.\n  The Feingold-McCain amendment proposes a complete overhaul by \nestablishing a new bureaucracy, the Water Resources Planning \nCoordinating Committee. We need another bureaucracy in the Federal \nGovernment like a bear needs tennis shoes. This idea is essentially a \nreprise of the Water Resources Council that existed during the Carter \nadministration which was discredited due to its inability to get \nanything done. That is not surprising when you have members ranging \nfrom the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of \nHousing and Urban Development, the Secretary of Homeland Security. \nThese are just a few of the Cabinet members, along with others, \nproposed to provide review under the Feingold-McCain amendment. The \nSecretary of the Army is on there, not even a Cabinet position. I look \nforward to the Secretary of the Army, for example, providing input and \nreview to the Department of Education on No Child Left Behind. That is \nessentially the same thing as having the proposed Feingold-McCain \ncouncil consisting of noninterested, nontrained Cabinet members with \nother heavy responsibilities involved in the Corps of Engineers' very \ncomplicated 103-step process to come up with priorities and approval of \nprojects.\n  Beyond a lack of interest in expertise, this council is structured \nfor projects to fail. A meeting of the minds is very difficult. This is \nprobably the reason such a council does not exist in any other forum. \nIn the rare event a consensus would emerge, the 50 percent local cost \nshare would increase to the point where communities could no longer \nafford to make their contributions for essential projects.\n  It sounds like a time-consuming, expensive, headache-producing \nbureaucracy to me, and I have seen them before. I can tell one when I \nsee it. This is one area where trained experts who understand the \nprocess, from planning to construction, should be running our water \nproject formulation process. There is a reason we rely upon those with \nappropriate training and expertise to develop and construct our \ninfrastructure and safety needs. These decisions should be based on \nsound science, not on political judgment of people with no expertise in \nthe area.\n  With thousands of projects and costs that change annually, \nprioritization of the projects and the process directed by Feingold-\nMcCain would be extremely cumbersome. Achieving stability and \nprioritization would be nearly impossible.\n  The amendment Senator Inhofe and I have proposed would categorize and \nprioritize projects on scientifically sustainable reports. These \nreports will provide Congress with the necessary information to make \ntough values-related decisions. Our proposed approach supports and \nencourages a holistic approach to water resource management by \nconsidering a wide range of important factors.\n  Feingold-McCain fails to address multipurpose projects and thus \nresults in inadequate cost-benefit ratios. Modernizing our locks and \ndams and improving our levees contribute to the entire way of American \nlife: enhancing flood control, transportation, hydropower, water \nsupply, and recreation. Each purpose of the project served determines \ndemands prioritization, weighing all benefits in the analysis. And even \nthen, how do you truly value safety and the health of human life?\n  Media reports and editorials have criticized and played the blame \ngame. As a result, the Corps has received more than its share of public \nridicule. What is not well publicized is the good work that the Civil \nWorks Program of the United States Army Corps of Engineers has already \ndone in its exhaustive inhouse budget prioritization. The Civil Works \nProgram has the only infrastructure project analysis that is required \nto have cost-benefit ratios grounded in economic theory and extensive \nongoing economic analysis.\n  From its inception, each economic water resource infrastructure \nproject goes through multiple ``winnowing'' processes. In recent years, \nonly 16 percent of the proposed projects generally pass on a ``national \nbenefit,'' a positive benefit to cost ratio. Unless a project meets \nthis threshold, the process will not allow for a favorable report of \nthe chief of engineers.\n  The second winnowing is cost-share requirements where both studies \nand\n\n[[Page S7845]]\n\nconstruction require percentages of local moneys to match the amounts \nfrom the Federal Government as well as other contributions such as \nlands, easements, and rights-of-way.\n  Unless exempted by Congress, if a local cost-sharing agreement does \nnot come forward, a project is not eligible for Federal funds.\n  Next is the actual budget appropriations process, which begins at the \n38 districts of the Corps of Engineers 18 months before a President's \nbudget is delivered.\n  Performance-based budgeting requires a highly detailed process, \nsorting the projects by benefits and costs and rated in a variety of \ncategories, including risk factors for the environment, safety, \nsecurity, and operations.\n  Each of the ``economic'' Corps projects is then subject to \n``diminishing returns'' analysis that defines specific measurable \nperformance benefits that may be gained through a number of levels of \nincremental funding.\n  In addition, unique elements or circumstances, such as judicial \nfindings and orders, are taken into account. The recommendation is then \nsent to the Corps Division office that merges all district inputs into \na division recommendation which goes to the Corps headquarters in \nWashington.\n  Once at headquarters, they are reviewed, merged, cross-walked, \nracked, stacked, jacked, and tacked, and finally nationally ranked on a \nbenefit scale, to deliver a list to OMB.\n  I am exhausted--and I know my listeners are exhausted, those who are \nstill listening--merely summarizing the current standards and the \nprocess that has to be followed--and we did not go into the 103 steps \ncurrently existing before the request even reaches Congress for \nappropriations.\n  But the Bond-Inhofe amendment goes further and categorizes and \nprioritizes projects scientifically and makes a supportable report to \nmake it easier for us to make the important judgments. It is a time-\nconsuming and extensive process already. The last thing the process \nneeds is additional bureaucratic steps and redtape from those who have \nalready skewed priorities and lack the expertise to make decisions.\n  OMB has its own criteria and priorities, with recent trend analysis \nshowing they favor environmental restoration projects. For example, \nwithin the fiscal year 2007 construction account, only 90 out of the \napproximately 655 projects were accorded ``priority status'' that would \nallow for some level of funding.\n  The Feingold-McCain amendment would only add additional steps, \nlengthen the timetable, with fewer funded projects, the loss of jobs, \nand the inability to provide safety and the transportation we need.\n  Finally, of course, there is a congressional process where we must \nauthorize and fund the projects. We establish our priorities, and they \nare contained in the amendment, the Bond-Inhofe amendment.\n  The Feingold-McCain amendment proposes a council that lacks the \nnecessary expertise and adds redtape. We believe the Bond-Inhofe \namendment makes sense, and it will add to what the WRDA legislation \nalready includes: reasonable Corps reform amendments that would strike \na balance, that disciplines new projects to criteria fairly applied, \nwhile addressing a greater number of water resources multipurpose \npriorities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Inhofe-Bond amendment and to \noppose the Feingold-McCain amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to thank my friends from \nOklahoma and Missouri for their courtesy in the way we have been \naddressing these two amendments.\n  Mr. President, I begin by asking unanimous consent that the Statement \nof Administration Policy be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Statement of Administration Policy, July 18, 2006\n\n\n            S. 728--Water Resources Development Act of 2006\n\n       The Administration has strong concerns with the significant \n     overall cost of S. 728. The Congressional Budget Office has \n     estimated that the bill as reported by the Committee would \n     authorize nearly $12 billion in discretionary spending, and a \n     preliminary Administration review indicates that the cost of \n     the manager's amendment would be greater. The Administration \n     believes the bill should establish priorities among these \n     activities and limit new authorizations to those projects \n     that represent the highest priorities for Federal funding \n     within the three main Corps mission areas: commercial \n     navigation, flood and storm damage reduction, and aquatic \n     ecosystem restoration. The Administration is committed to \n     maintaining fiscal discipline in order to protect the \n     American taxpayer and sustain a strong economy.\n       The Administration supports the intent of the manager's \n     amendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 728 with regard \n     to provisions that: (1) address high-return nationally \n     significant water resource infrastructure efforts and aquatic \n     ecosystem restoration opportunities in coastal Louisiana and \n     along the Upper Mississippi River; (2) protect the Great \n     Lakes from invasive fish species; and (3) improve the Corps \n     of Engineers recreation services by providing a financing \n     authority similar to that proposed in the President's Budget.\n       The Administration is committed to restoring the Everglades \n     in partnership with the State of Florida. S. 728 would \n     authorize construction of the Indian River Lagoon project, a \n     significant South Florida aquatic ecosystem restoration \n     project. It would also authorize construction of the Picayune \n     Strand project, which has not completed its review by the \n     Administration. We look forward to working with Congress on \n     these and future authorizations for this priority restoration \n     effort.\n       The Administration looks forward to working with the Senate \n     to revise this legislation so that it will accomplish our \n     shared goals and objectives.\n\n\n                       The Need for Basic Reforms\n\n       The civil works program has played an important role in \n     developing the Nation's water resources; however, it faces \n     several interrelated problems: (1) the Corps has a large \n     backlog of unfinished construction work, resulting in more \n     projects facing delays and a $50 billion cost to complete the \n     backlog of already-authorized projects; (2) the Corps is \n     providing funding to construct projects outside of its three \n     main missions, which reduces the funding available for higher \n     priority needs; and (3) the Federal government pays a \n     substantial share of project costs, which can lead to an \n     over-allocation of resources to build new projects and \n     upgrade existing ones. The bill does not address, and in some \n     cases would exacerbate, these problems.\n       The President's last four Budgets have outlined the \n     direction of the reforms needed to address these and other \n     concerns. The Administration has proposed five principles to \n     guide Corps authorizations and appropriations, which focus \n     on: (1) improving how the Corps formulates its water \n     resources projects, such as through changes to the 1983 \n     principles and guidelines for proposed Federal water \n     resources projects; (2) limiting new construction starts to \n     projects with a very high net economic or environmental \n     return per dollar invested; (3) setting priorities for \n     allocating funding among the projects with ongoing \n     construction work in the three main Corps mission areas; (4) \n     de-authorizing commercial navigation projects with extremely \n     low levels of commercial use, and projects whose main purpose \n     falls outside the three main mission areas; and (5) \n     addressing cost-sharing.\n       The FY 2007 Budget proposes specific economic, \n     environmental, and public safety performance criteria for use \n     in establishing priorities among ongoing construction \n     projects. The Administration supports efforts to prioritize \n     water resources construction projects consistent with this \n     approach, and looks forward to working with Congress to \n     accomplish this objective.\n\n\n                        Planning Future Proiects\n\n       The bill's proposals regarding the formulation of projects \n     would undermine efforts to improve the economic and \n     environmental performance of future projects. Subsection \n     2005(e)(1)(A)(ii) would increase the ability of local project \n     sponsors to direct the project alternatives that the Corps \n     may consider and recommend, and could preclude consideration \n     of other reasonable alternatives. Subsection 2005(e)(I)(B) \n     would prohibit the use of budgetary and other policy \n     considerations in the formulation of proposed projects. Both \n     of these changes would erode the ability of the Executive \n     Branch and Congress to ensure that the projects proposed for \n     authorization are well-justified and in the national \n     interest.\n       The Administration supports the independent peer review of \n     proposed projects. Section 2007 would restrict such reviews \n     to 90 days from the start of the public comment period, which \n     may not provide enough time to fully consider the public \n     comments and would preclude using these panels to assess \n     substantial changes to the project proposed by the Corps in \n     response to the public comments. The Administration looks \n     forward to working with Congress on this process.\n\n\n             Restricting the Powers of the Executive Branch\n\n       The Administration strongly objects to section \n     2006(f)(1)(C), which would limit the\n\n[[Page S7846]]\n\n     ability of the Executive Branch to properly supervise the \n     civil works program by prohibiting anyone from giving \n     direction to the Chief of Engineers, including Senate-\n     confirmed Presidential appointees in the Department of \n     Defense, regarding any Corps report on a proposed project or \n     any related recommendations for changes in law or policy. \n     Such a provision would hinder the President's ability to \n     fulfill his Constitutional duties. The bill would also \n     require the Secretary to provide his recommendations to \n     Congress on a proposed project within 90 days of the Chiefs \n     report, which is not adequate time for a proper review and a \n     determination of the Administration's position. In addition, \n     this language should be revised to request rather than \n     require the recommendation, in keeping with the President's \n     constitutional authority to make recommendations he \n     determines to be necessary and expedient.\n       The Administration strongly objects to Section 1003(o) \n     which conditionally preauthorizes the construction of all \n     projects identified in a future Corps report on options for \n     improving storm damage reduction along the Louisiana coast. \n     Congress should not preauthorize these yet-to-be-identified \n     projects, whose total cost is likely to be measured in the \n     tens of billions of dollars and is not included in \n     Congressional Budget Office estimate, before the Executive \n     Branch, Congress, and the public have had a full opportunity \n     to review them.\n       The Administration objects to Section 1003(n) which creates \n     a new agency--the Louisiana Water Resources Council--to \n     manage and oversee a system-wide comprehensive plan of \n     unspecified future projects in Louisiana. This provision \n     would circumvent the normal chain of command within the \n     Executive Branch and thereby reduce accountability for the \n     costs to build these projects. The provision also raises \n     constitutional concerns with regard to the Appointments \n     Clause.\n\n\n                 Adequate and Appropriate Cost-sharing\n\n       The Administration objects to the authorizations in the \n     bill that would have the effect of providing unwarranted \n     waivers or reductions in non-Federal cost-sharing \n     requirements. The Administration strongly opposes section \n     2039(a), which could be read as authorizing a major shift in \n     future project costs--potentially costing billions of dollars \n     to the general taxpayer. In addition, for the aquatic \n     ecosystem restoration work along the Upper Mississippi River \n     and Illinois Waterway and in the wetlands of coastal \n     Louisiana, the cost-share paid by the general taxpayer should \n     be no more than 50 percent, as it is for the Everglades \n     restoration effort.\n\n\n        Upper Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway Navigation\n\n       The Mississippi River is a major artery for transporting \n     America's bulk agricultural products, and the Administration \n     is working to keep it that way. The Administration has \n     identified work on the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois \n     Waterway as one of the most important Corps operations and \n     maintenance projects. The Administration would like to work \n     with Congress to appropriately address the navigation and \n     ecosystem needs of this part of the inland waterway.\n\n\n                           COASTAL LOUISIANA\n\n       The Administration recommends that the Senate revise \n     section 1003 to provide a single generic authorization \n     covering all studies, construction, and science work needed \n     to support the effort to restore coastal Louisiana wetlands, \n     including but not limited to the work envisioned in the near-\n     term restoration plan. This would expedite the approval \n     process for projects and their implementation while providing \n     greater flexibility in setting future priorities. Subsection \n     1003(j) should also be revised to provide for only a science \n     program, which should be run by the U.S. Geological Survey \n     and be funded on a cost-sharing basis and through \n     appropriations from the Corps. Moreover, section 1003(i), and \n     several other provisions in the bill, should be revised to \n     avoid micromanaging the internal deliberations of the \n     executive branch, and thereby interfering with the \n     President's constitutional duty to execute the law.\n\n\n                             Other Concerns\n\n       The Administration also opposes certain other provisions in \n     the bill, including:\n       Section 2001, which could significantly diminish \n     accountability, nationwide consistency, and oversight of \n     Corps projects by limiting the ability of Corps headquarters \n     and the Secretary of the Army to review proposed agreements \n     with local project sponsors, and could expose the Federal \n     government to liquidated damages in the event that Congress \n     terminates funding for a project;\n       Section 2014, which would establish a binding 50-year \n     Federal commitment to the periodic nourishment of sandy \n     beaches and which could be construed as promoting ``shore \n     protection'' instead of storm damage reduction as the \n     program's objective; and\n       Section 3067, which would lead to the use of the Bonnet \n     Carre Spillway in ways that could be harmful to the ecosystem \n     of Lake Pontchartrain.\n       The Administration looks forward to working with Congress \n     on these and other concerns as the legislation proceeds.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would just like to quote from the first \nparagraph of the Statement of Administration Policy:\n\n       The Administration has strong concerns with the significant \n     overall cost of S. 728. The Congressional Budget Office has \n     estimated that the bill as reported by the Committee would \n     authorize nearly $12 billion in discretionary spending, and a \n     preliminary Administration review indicates that the cost of \n     the manager's amendment would be greater. The Administration \n     believes the bill should establish priorities--\n\n  I repeat: ``The Administration believes the bill should establish \npriorities''--\n\n     among these activities and limit new authorizations to those \n     projects that represent the highest priorities for Federal \n     funding within the three main Corps mission areas: commercial \n     navigation, flood and storm damage reduction, and aquatic \n     ecosystem restoration.\n\n  The first paragraph of the administration's Statement of \nAdministration Policy emphasizes their belief that this legislation \nshould establish priorities amongst these activities. That is what this \namendment is about. It is exactly that. The amendment is designed to \nhelp Congress make clear and educated decisions on which Army Corps \nprojects should be funded based on our Nation's priorities.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Feingold, Lieberman, and \nFeinstein in offering this important amendment to the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act.\n  Last August, this Nation witnessed a devastating national disaster. \nWhen Hurricane Katrina hit, it brought with it destruction and tragedy \nbeyond compare; more so than our Nation has seen in decades. Almost a \nyear later, the gulf coast region is still trying to rebuild and there \nis a long road ahead. We learned many lessons from this tragedy, and, \nas our Nation continues to dedicate significant resources to the \nreconstruction effort, we must ensure that those resources are being \nused in the most effective and efficient manner as possible. It is time \nthe Congress takes a hard look at how our scarce Army Corps dollars are \nbeing spent overall and whether they are actually going to the most \nnecessary projects.\n  Our current system for funding Corps projects is not working. \nCurrently, projects are submitted by Members of Congress for funding \nwithout having a clear picture of how that project affects the overall \ninfrastructure of our Nation's waterways or where it fits within our \nnational waterways priorities.\n  Too often, it is a Member's seniority and party position that \ndictates which projects are funded and which ones will join the $58 \nbillion backlog. Mr. President, I repeat, we have a $58 billion backlog \nof projects. And the bill before us is going to add another $12 billion \nin projects to the backlog. Do you know how much funding the Corps \nreceives annually? Two billion dollars. So if you have $70 billion, and \nwe are annually allocating $2 billion, that is 35 years. It is 35 years \nbefore any project that is on this list is funded.\n  Clearly, without a prioritization, that opens itself up to no way \nthat we would have a way of determining which project is most important \nand which is not. There is no way to know which projects warrant these \nlimited resources because the Corps refuses to give Congress its views \non which projects are necessary. In fact, even when Congress \nspecifically requests a list of the Corps' top priorities, it is unable \nto provide it. Remarkable. Remarkable. Unfortunately, the underlying \nbill does not address this problem.\n  To help my colleagues fully understand the extent of this problem, \nlet me quote Representative Hobson, chairman of the House Energy and \nWater Appropriations Committee, from his statement on the House floor \non May 24, 2006:\n\n       Last fall, we asked the Corps to provide Congress with a \n     ``top 10'' list of the flood control and navigation \n     infrastructure needs in the country. The Corps was \n     surprisingly unable or not allowed to respond to this simple \n     request, and that tells me the Corps has lost sight of its \n     national mission and has no clear vision for projects it \n     ought to be doing in the future . . . . frankly, what is \n     still lacking is a long-term vision of what the Nation's \n     water resources infrastructure should look like in the \n     future. ``More of the same'' is not a thoughtful answer, nor \n     is it a responsible answer in times of constrained budgets.\n\n  This amendment is designed to address this problem and shed light on \nthe funding process. It allows both Congress and the American people to \nhave a clear understanding of where our limited resources should be \nspent.\n\n[[Page S7847]]\n\nThe amendment will tap a multiagency committee created in the \nunderlying bill. It will direct that committee to review Corps projects \nthat are currently under construction or have been authorized during \nthe last 10 years.\n  These projects would be evaluated by several commonsense, transparent \ncriteria. They would also be divided and judged within their own \nproject category, such as navigation, flood and storm damage reduction, \nand environmental restoration. Each project category would be broken \ninto broad, roughly equal-sized tiers, with the highest tiers including \nthe highest priority projects, and on down the ladder. This advisory \nreport would then be sent to Congress and be made available to the \npublic.\n\n  Some have said this amendment relinquishes congressional authority to \nthe executive branch. That is a false allegation. The prioritization \nreport is an effort to inform Congress, but it does not dictate \nspending decisions--just as the Department of Defense sends our \nauthorizing committee, the Armed Services Committee, their priorities. \nWithout knowing their priorities, how in the world can we know how to \nspend the dollars?\n  To more fully understand the need for a prioritization system, let's \nconsider funding for Louisiana in the fiscal year 2006 budget. The \nadministration's budget request included 41 line items or projects \nsolely for Louisiana that totaled $268 million. That works out to $6.5 \nmillion per project, on average. The House Energy and Water \nappropriations bill included 39 line items or projects totaling $254 \nmillion--again, in the neighborhood of $6.5 million per project. The \nSenate bill included 71 line items or projects, to the tune of $375 \nmillion--averaging out to $5.3 million per project.\n  So while even more money was proposed for Louisiana under the Senate \nversion, individual projects would receive less money, and, inevitably, \nthis would result in delays in completing larger projects. So this \nreally does come down, once again, to real-world consequences of \nearmarking. Communities actually lose under this earmarking practice.\n  Can we really afford long, drawn-out delays on flood control projects \nthat people's lives depend on simply because too many Members are \nfighting for a small pool of money with no real direction? We need some \nkind of direction, clear understanding and guidance for funding Corps \nprojects. While more money may ultimately be going to a State, if it is \nbeing parsed via earmarking in an appropriations bill, we will not be \nable to make significant progress on any project.\n  Ultimately, without guidance, Congress is able to cram as many \nprojects as possible into appropriations bills while contending that \neach project is as important as the next. Drawing out completion on all \nof these projects puts people's lives in danger and is unacceptable.\n  Some may believe that under this amendment smaller projects will lose \nout. However, the size of the project has no impact on the \nprioritization system. In fact, this objective system will help find \nthe hidden gems in the Corps project list and highlight their strengths \nto Congress.\n  It is time we end this process of blind spending, throwing money at \nprojects that may or may not benefit the larger good. It is time for us \nto take a post-Katrina look at the world and decide whether we will \nlearn from our experiences over the last year or whether we are content \nto continue business as usual.\n  Shouldn't we be doing all we can to reform the Corps and ensure that \nmost urgent projects are being funded and constructed or are we more \ncontent with needless earmarks--too often at the expense of projects \nthat are of most need?\n  As stated in a letter signed by the heads of the Taxpayers for Common \nSense Action, the National Taxpayers Union, and the Council for \nCitizens Against Government Waste, in support of our amendment:\n\n       Enough is enough . . . we need a systematic method for \n     ensuring the most vital projects move to the front of the \n     line so limited taxpayer funds are spent more prudently.\n\n  The Corps procedures for planning and approving projects, as well as \nthe congressional system for funding projects, are broken. But they can \nbe fixed. The reforms in this amendment are based on thorough program \nanalysis and common sense. And let me be clear: A vote against this \namendment is a vote against Government transparency and accountability. \nThis amendment is a step toward a more informed public and a more \ninformed Congress. We owe the American public accountability in how \ntheir tax dollars are spent.\n  I commend Senator Feingold for his efforts to build and improve upon \nthe Corps reforms we have explained before. Corps modernization has \nbeen a priority that Senator Feingold and I have shared for years, but \nnever before has there been such an appropriate atmosphere and urgent \nneed to move forward.\n  I also thank Senators Inhofe and Bond for working with us throughout \nthis process and helping us to incorporate many commonsense changes \ninto the larger bill. While I still have concerns with the underlying \nbill, and particularly the number of projects that would be authorized, \nI hope that by adopting this amendment we can move this bill in a \ndirection that will truly benefit the Nation.\n  I want to share with my colleagues not only the administration's \nsupport for this important prioritization amendment, it also has been \nendorsed by many outside groups, including Taxpayers for Common Sense \nAction, National Taxpayers Union, Citizens Against Government Waste, \nAmerican Rivers, National Wildlife Federation, Earthjustice, \nEnvironmental Defense, Republicans for Environmental Protection, Sierra \nClub, and the World Wildlife Fund. And it has been positively commented \non by the Heritage Foundation. The vote on this amendment will be key \nvoted by the Taxpayers for Common Sense Action, National Taxpayers \nUnion, Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, and the League of \nConservation Voters.\n  We are also considering side by side the Inhofe-Bond amendment. As I \nhave mentioned before, their version would be prepared by the Corps, \ncontrolled by the Corps, evaluated by the Corps, and reported by the \nCorps, locking out input from other relevant water resources agencies \nsuch as the Department of Homeland Security. That amendment, unlike my \namendment, only looks at likely construction projects, forces the Corps \nto review every single project in its $58 billion backlog, soon to be \n$70 billion with the passing of this bill. It would also create a vague \nneed to fund a relative rating system that does not require any final \nanalysis or ranking. This would lead to an argument over semantics \nrather than quality of a project. Members would come to the floor to \nargue that the criteria that their project scored well in is the most \nimportant criteria, whereas another Member would be arguing for another \ncriteria because their project scored well in that area. This system \nwould only lead to further confusion over the worth of individual \nprojects and distract Congress from the job at hand. Further, this \nsystem would use criteria clearly devised to skew ratings toward \nparticular types of Corps projects. How would an environmental \nrestoration project ever score well on a criteria designed to weigh a \nproject's ability to lessen our dependence on foreign oil? How would a \nflood and storm damage reduction project do being judged by this \ncriteria that is in the amendment, pollution reduction benefits \nassociated with using water as a method of transportation of goods?\n  Additionally, the Inhofe-Bond amendment would require the rating \nreport to be delivered only to the authorizing committee, thus sending \nthe signal that this information is not intended to help set funding \npriorities and not intended to be transparent for the public. I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I point out again the problem we have here: $70 billion, $2 billion \nspent every year. That makes for $70 billion worth of authorized \nprojects, $2 billion can be spent each year. That makes for some pretty \nferocious competition. I think it is very important that we put some \nkind of prioritization into this kind of process; otherwise, it will be \nvery hard for us to understand what is being done. But more \nimportantly, it is certainly not clear that the projects that need the \npriority will receive them.\n\n[[Page S7848]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a memo published by the Heritage \nFoundation on this issue be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Heritage Foundation, July 19, 2006]\n\n     Improving the Performance of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\n\n                       (By Ronald D. Utt, Ph.D.)\n\n       The extensive flooding of New Orleans caused by several \n     breaks in the levee system during Hurricane Katrina led to an \n     extensive debate about the performance of the Army Corps of \n     Engineers in protecting Americans from natural disasters. In \n     the months following Katrina's assault on the Gulf Coast, \n     many public officials, civil engineers, and policy analysts \n     began to question both the quality of the Corps' work and the \n     spending priorities Congress imposes on it. In particular, \n     there is considerable evidence that lobbyists and Members of \n     Congress systematically redirect Corps' spending for the \n     benefit of influential private interests at the expense of \n     essential flood control and protection. An amendment proposed \n     by Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Russ Feingold (D-WI) would \n     create an independent commission to review select Corps \n     projects. This would be a major step towards reform of the \n     Corps.\n       As a Heritage Foundation Backgrounder and the Washington \n     Post have recently reported, a substantial portion of Corps \n     spending supports harbor and channel maintenance that benefit \n     specific shipping companies, new irrigation projects that \n     benefit crops like rice that already receive extensive \n     federal subsidies from the Department of Agriculture, \n     recreational boating facilities, and beach replenishment \n     programs to enhance the value of seaside vacation homes. As a \n     result of these diversions to low-priority purposes, Corps' \n     spending on flood and storm protection have accounted for \n     only about 12 percent of its budget in recent years.\n       Absent any formal mechanism to rate Corps projects and \n     establish priorities for investments that benefit ordinary \n     Americans, not just lobbyists and special interests, the \n     Corps will continue on the same ineffective course that \n     contributed to last year's disaster in New Orleans. And with \n     the Corps already working under a 35-year backlog of projects \n     totaling $58 billion, these management deficiencies will \n     persist for decades.\n       Senators John McCain and Russ Feingold propose to remedy \n     this deadly deficiency with an amendment to the Water \n     Resources Development Act that would require independent peer \n     review if a project costs more than $40 million, the Governor \n     of an affected state requests a review, a federal agency with \n     statutory authority to review a project finds that it will \n     have a significant adverse impact, or the Secretary of the \n     Army determines that a project is controversial. Their \n     amendment would also require an independent safety review for \n     flood control projects involving issues of public safety. \n     While the McCain-Feingold proposal is a big step in the right \n     direction, the independent review commission should also be \n     encouraged to comment on the Corps' broad resource \n     allocations to ensure that priority projects involving issues \n     of public safety are not delayed because of diversions to \n     beach resorts, environmental remediation, and irrigation \n     crops already in substantial surplus.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Heritage Foundation memo says:\n\n       Absent any formal mechanism to rate Corps projects and \n     establish priorities for investments that benefit ordinary \n     Americans, not just lobbyists and special interests, the \n     Corps will continue on the same ineffective course that \n     contributed to last year's disaster in New Orleans. And with \n     the Corps already working under a 35-year backlog of projects \n     totaling $58 billion, these management deficiencies will \n     persist for decades.\n\n  I hope my colleagues on this side of the aisle who almost always pay \nclose attention to the Heritage Foundation and their findings will pay \nattention to this one as well.\n  I again thank my friend from Oklahoma for his courtesy in \nconsideration of this amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it further demonstrates that people can \nhave honest disagreements. I look forward to responding to some of the \ncomments that were made by the Senator from Arizona.\n  I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Talent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. TALENT. I thank the chairman for yielding and compliment him and \nSenator Bond for their work in getting the Water Resources Development \nAct on the Senate floor finally. It has been literally years getting it \nhere. I think it is a very important measure. Transportation \ninfrastructure is very important. If we are going to maintain our \nglobal competitiveness, our economic growth, we have to be able to get \ngoods from one place to another. We have to be able to protect people \nfrom natural disasters. We have to control and use the water resources \nthis Nation is blessed with, and we cannot do it without this bill.\n  I want to address specifically the provisions in the bill that \nauthorize the modernization of locks and dams on the upper Mississippi \nRiver--locks and dams which, if they were people, would be old enough \nto collect Social Security; locks and dams which are so small relative \nto the needs of modern transportation that barges must routinely be \nbroken down into two halfs, in essence, before they can go through the \nlocks and dams; locks and dams which are in such need of maintenance \nthat you can take a picture of one and then come back and take a \npicture of the same lock a month later and you will find that concrete \nhas literally fallen off it.\n  The case for river transportation is so strong, it is a matter of \ncommon sense. It is a cheap, environmentally sound method of moving \ngoods. I say inexpensive because it costs roughly a third of the cost \nof shipping by rail; environmentally friendly because one medium barge \ntow can carry the same freight as 870 traffic trail trucks. So \nobviously, by fixing locks and dams, we can relieve highway congestion, \nreduce shipping costs, reduce fuel consumption, and we can reduce air \nemissions. We will also create jobs.\n  The construction of new 1200-foot locks and lock extensions will \nprovide more than 48 million man-hours of employment over the next 10 \nto 15 years. We can also move the country's goods more efficiently. \nSixty percent of the country's corn exports, 45 percent of soybean \nexports go on the Mississippi River to their destination. It is \nabsolutely important to the transportation of coal, steel, and \nconcrete. We have a new concrete facility going into Sainte Genevieve, \nMO. It was a number of years before they were able to begin building \nit, but they have. The reason that plant is going in there is because \nthe river is there, because they can bring products in and they can \nmove products out. It is vitally important that we do this. We have \nbeen waiting a number of years. We are at least going to be able to \nauthorize doing it in this bill. We then have to fund it.\n  I want to say a few words about what I think is the most important \nissue regarding our Nation's transportation infrastructure, and that is \nless about how we prioritize than whether we are going to build it at \nall. Transportation infrastructure is absolutely crucial to the \ncompetitiveness and future of any economy. Other nations know that. \nThat is why they are building it. Brazil, for example, which is \ncertainly not a country with an economy as prosperous as ours, is \nbuilding water transportation infrastructure. I know people are \nconcerned about the revenues of the Federal Government and about the \ndeficit. I certainly am as well. But that is not a reason to avoid \ninvestments in capital infrastructure. If you are a homeowner and you \nhave a hole in your roof, you have to fix the hole in the roof. You \nhave to fix it somehow because it doesn't go away if you don't fix it. \nIt gets worse. Then it costs more when you finally do decide to fix it.\n\n  We have been talking about priorities. It is certainly reasonable to \ndiscuss how we are going to prioritize the projects that we have \nbacklogged. But I note with interest that both sides seem to agree that \nafter this bill passes, if it passes, we will have $70 billion in \nbacklogged projects and evidently $2 billion a year to spend on them. I \nwonder if anybody else noted the irony of that. We are arguing about \nhow to prioritize $2 billion, when we have $70 billion in backlog. \nPerhaps we ought to be arguing about how we can reduce the backlogs \nfaster by finding more money. Unless somebody is aware of some \ntechnology that is going to allow us to transport goods across the \ncountry other than through rivers or rail or trucks, we had better \nfigure out how we are going to fix this, and we had better figure it \nout fast.\n  A lot of people who are concerned--I don't mean here in the Senate so \nmuch but over in the Office of Management and Budget--about passing \ntrade agreements will reassure us that it is OK to have trade \nagreements with other countries, even though they have lower wage \nlevels, because they say we are\n\n[[Page S7849]]\n\ncompetitive anyway because we have a better financial system, a better \ntelecommunications systems, and we have a better transportation system. \nThen the same people begrudge every attempt to invest in the \ntransportation system. The reality is that however we prioritize the \nmoney, we are falling behind every year. In 10 or 15 years from now, \nmaybe sooner, we are going to have fallen so far behind, we will never \nbe able to catch up. When the next generation does not have the \ntransportation infrastructure they need to be competitive, as we had \nbecause the earlier generation gave it to us, I don't think we will be \nable to explain it away by saying we were arguing over how to \nprioritize it. I think they will want to know how we are going to build \nit. Because right now, however you prioritize it, we have a heck of a \nlot more priorities than we have money to spend. I hope we can put a \nlittle bit of the energy that we are now putting into prioritization--\nand I don't begrudge anybody the debate over this--into how we are \ngoing to fund the transportation infrastructure that this generation \nand the next generation needs before the Chinese fund theirs and the \nThird World countries fund theirs, and our people are out in the cold.\n  I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his efforts and for yielding.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, under Senate rules, I ask \nunanimous consent that I be allowed to show a prompt on the Senate \nfloor, a bottle of water.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, this is the bottle. This is a \nglass of clean water that is put on our desk to drink. This is the \nbottle of water that I scooped up out of the Saint Lucie River which is \none of the estuaries that will be dealt with in this Water Resources \nDevelopment Act that we are now considering. You can see the dramatic \ndifference between the two. This one is laden with algae and with all \nkinds of particulates. This is the kind of clean water that we would \nlike our rivers and estuaries to be.\n  Thank goodness we have this bill and we are going to pass it. It is \ngoing to address these kinds of problems. Specifically in this bill is \nthe Everglades restoration and two important projects, the Indian River \nLagoon, from which this water came. It is the Saint Lucie River estuary \nthat leads into the Indian River. You can see why that estuary is \nmessed up. When I went out there and scooped up this bottle of water, \nit was a dead river. That river, the Saint Lucie, flows into the Indian \nRiver, which is not a river, it is a lagoon. It is a bay. This Senator \ngrew up on the banks of the Indian River.\n  Where I grew up, there are the pelicans diving for fish because there \nare plenty of fish. There is Mr. Osprey up there swooping down and \ngetting his dinner. You look up in that dead pine tree and there is old \nMr. Eagle. He is up there waiting for Mr. Osprey to go down and scoop \nup and get his dinner. Then Mr. Eagle is going to take off after Mr. \nOsprey, and Mr. Osprey is going to drop that fish and Mr. Eagle is \ngoing to swoop it up. That is going to be his dinner. Yet there is \nnothing out there in a river that has water like this--no pelicans, no \nbird life. You cannot even see it. You can see the density of this \nwater. You cannot even see below the surface of the water. Thank \ngoodness we have up this WRDA bill. This bill also is going to \nauthorize the Fakahatchee Strand and the waters that dump into the St. \nLucie, like this to the east of Lake Okeechobee, dumped into the \nCaloosahatchee River to the west, and a similar kind of water goes out \nto tidewater in the Gulf of Mexico to the Caloosahatchee River. This is \nwhat we are going to correct with this WRDA bill.\n\n  And, also, we are going to--in the managers' package they have \naccepted an amendment that the two Senators from Florida have offered, \nwhich is to get an examination of this report that came out about a 70-\nyear-old dike that rings Lake Okeechobee; 40,000 people live in the \nvicinity of the perimeter of Lake Okeechobee, and the report predicts \nthere is a one-in-six chance of dike failure with each year that \npasses. So we are getting an emergency examination and report in this \nbill of the sanctity and security of that dike, with all of those lives \nthat are at stake.\n  Overall, all of this is so important for us. This is the greater part \nof a 20-year project of the restoration of the Everglades, the river of \ngrass, which for over a half century we have messed up by diking and \ndraining and sending this water of Mother Nature out to tidewater, \ninstead of preserving it for what it was intended by Mother Nature--to \nkeep flowing south through the Everglades and ultimately out into the \nFlorida Bay.\n  I am so grateful that the leadership on both sides of the aisle has \nbrought this bill to the floor. It is with great joy that I will be \nvoting for this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n   Mr. President, the Water Resources Development Act is critically \nimportant for our nation because it provides our States and local \njurisdictions with the support they need to manage their water \nresources, and improve flood and storm control damage protection.\n  The Senate's passage of this legislation maintains our commitment to \nthe protection of our rivers, streams and lakes.\n  And it also maintains our commitment to protect our aquatic \necosystems, which are so delicate and yet so vital to critical species.\n  I am proud that the Senate will pass a good, comprehensive bill that \nalso includes key coastal restoration and hurricane projects to further \nassist the rebuilding efforts in the State of Louisiana following \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  I am also very proud that my State of Vermont will receive important \nproject authorizations, including restoration programs for the upper \nConnecticut River; the repair, remediation and removal of small dams \nthroughout the State; and the construction of a dispersal barrier to \nprotect Lake Champlain from invasive species.\n  As we stand on the verge of passing the Water Resources Development \nAct, I would once again like to thank Chairman Inhofe for his \nleadership. We would not be at this point without his persistence and \nhard work.\n  I would also like to thank Senators Baucus and Bond for their hard \nwork in advancing this bill.\n  Mr. President, it may have taken us six long years to get here, but \nthe impact of this bill will be felt for decades to come.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill as it moves through \nconference.\n  Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I had to come to the floor and speak \nbriefly and thank the ranking member and the chairman for their \nextraordinary help in crafting this bill to help meet the needs of \nLouisiana's vanishing coast. This coastline just doesn't belong to \nLouisiana, it belongs to the Nation. It is America's last coastal zone, \nwith millions of acres of wetlands that serve as hosts of the oil and \ngas industry and that cradle, if you will, the great Mississippi River, \nwhich is the greatest river system on the North American Continent. It \nprovides for the extensive fisheries industry.\n  This is a picture of southeast Louisiana. But if you head southwest, \nit is also host to major river systems, the Calcasieu Ship Channel, et \ncetera. This coast is threatened. This is a pretty extraordinary graph \nthat we found recently, which shows the track of every major hurricane \nsince 1955. The blue line is the track of Hurricane Rita, a category 4 \nto 5 hurricane. Katrina is the yellow line that went through the \neastern part of our State, and then, of course, Rita on the western \npart on the Texas-Louisiana line.\n  This gulf coast is America's only energy coast. All of the oil and \ngas offshore is produced right here. Most of the refineries, platforms, \net cetera, are beside these great wetlands. This bill is going to make \nsubstantial investments\n\n[[Page S7850]]\n\nalong this coastline to keep our river open, to keep our ports \noperating, to protect these wetlands, and to help create a stronger \nbarrier.\n  Obviously, we need to be doing this all over the country, this \nAtlantic coast. There is money for that as well. Of course, I am not as \nfamiliar with those projects. I can tell you that this WRDA bill--of \ncourse, my partner and colleague, Senator Vitter, is on the authorizing \ncommittee, and he deserves a tremendous amount of credit for his work.\n  I wanted to say that the ecosystem project of Louisiana's coastal \narea is funded, as well as significant navigation and hurricane \nprotection and wetlands restoration projects. In addition, there are \nsome innovations important to America. There are some new technologies \nthat will allow us to protect these areas, to build stronger levees, to \nprotect this coast with better materials that cost less--way less--and \nwe can stretch the dollars in this bill far more than we have been able \nto do in the past because although this is a very large bill with a $10 \nbillion authorization, it is not enough, as some of our colleagues have \nsaid.\n  Mr. President, the technology--and we will soon send to the Record an \nexample of the technologies--will help us to make these projects \nstretch. I thank the ranking member for his courtesy and the chairman \nfor all of his help.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the junior Senator \nfrom Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise, too, in strong support of this \nWRDA bill with my Louisiana colleague and many others because of the \nenormously important work it will do for the country, including the \nState of Louisiana, particularly after the devastating hurricanes of \nKatrina and Rita.\n  I, too, thank the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, Chairman Inhofe, and the ranking member, Senator Jeffords, \nand Senators Bond and Baucus, and everybody who has made this very \nimportant bill possible, including our great staff, including Angie \nJohncarlo, Ruth VanMark, Letmon Lee, Stephen Aaron, Catharine Ransom, \nand Jo-Ellen Darcy. I thank them all for their hard and, in so many \ncases, their ongoing work.\n  This bill is vitally important to the country and is vitally \nimportant to Louisiana, and it was before 2005. It was important before \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita, but it is 10 times more important after \nthose devastating storms and in light of our continuing and increasing \nneeds following those storms.\n  I want to highlight some very important aspects. One is fundamental \nCorps reform, which is important, which will get done one way or \nanother in this bill. Now, in terms of Corps reform, I favor the model \nof Chairman Inhofe. I also point out that I have been working, with his \nhelp and the help of many others, on a Louisiana water resources \ncouncil to ensure proper oversight, vetting, review, and ongoing \noutside independent expert review of all of the projects in the \nLouisiana hurricane area.\n  That concept was first embodied in a separate stand-alone bill that I \nintroduced on March 15 as S. 2421. I am happy to say that through a \nmanagers' amendment it will be included in all substantial and major \nways in this WRDA bill. It is very important to bring outside expertise \nto bear to review on an ongoing basis, to do that peer review for those \nprojects and to integrate those projects into an overall plan for our \nLouisiana coast.\n  There are other important needs that the bill meets. The \ncomprehensive hurricane, flood, and coastal protection program is fully \nauthorized in this bill. Immediately, it authorizes 5-year near-term \ncoastal restoration projects and will exceed $1.2 billion, establishes \na science and technology program of at least $500 million, requires \nconsistency and integration in all of the programs, and makes sure they \nwork together.\n  Other crucial Louisiana needs addressed in the bill are hurricane \nprotection for Terrebonne and Lafourche. The bill authorizes the \nMorganza to the gulf hurricane protection project that has been ready \nfor 3 years now. This is long overdue and it finally comes in this \nimportant WRDA bill, addressing the travesty of the Mississippi River \nGulf Outlet, MRGO, fixing that environmental disaster and making sure \nthat the negative impacts of it, as we saw through Katrina, never \nhappen again. And other crucial needs are addressed, such as the Port \nof Iberia, Vermillion hurricane protection, east Baton Rouge, Red-\nOuachita River Basin, Atchafalaya Basin, Calcasieu River and Pass, \nLarose to Golden Meadow, Vidalia Port, and St. Charles. They are all \ndirectly met in this bill.\n  Again, I thank the chairman, the ranking member, and others on the \ncommittee for their leadership to meet these crucial Louisiana needs \nand certainly these crucial national needs. I strongly and fully \nsupport the bill.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield myself time off of the McCain-Feingold \nprioritization amendment.\n  I rise in strong support of the McCain-Feingold prioritization \namendment. I am pleased to be a cosponsor. As Senator McCain points \nout, it recognizes we must respond to the tragedy of Katrina and to our \ncurrent flawed planning process by making sure that limited taxpayer \ndollars go to the most worthy water resources projects.\n  That doesn't sound like a lot to ask. As we all know, our Nation is \nstaring down deficits that just a few years ago were unimaginable. We \nhave a backlog of $58 billion in projects that are authorized but not \nbuilt, and that number will be closer to $70 billion when this bill \npasses. Clearly, we need some way of identifying projects that are most \nneeded.\n\n  Right now, Congress does not have any information about the relative \npriority of the current massive backlog of unauthorized projects, and \nwe don't have any way of evaluating the relative priority of the new \nprojects. What we do have is individual Members arguing for projects in \ntheir States or districts but no information about which projects are \nmost important to the country's economic development or transportation \nsystems or our ability to protect our citizens and our property from \nnatural disasters.\n  Our current prioritization process is not serving the public good. \nThe McCain amendment would make sure Congress has the tools to more \nwisely invest limited resources while also increasing public \ntransparency in decisionmaking. It does so by utilizing an interagency \ntask force set up in the underlying bill, the Water Resources \nCoordinating Committee, to evaluate likely Corps projects in three \ndifferent categories: flood damage reduction, navigation, and ecosystem \nrestoration. The committee will establish broad national priorities to \napply to those projects.\n  The amendment sets out minimum requirements that projects in each \ncategory have to meet, so that, for example, flood reduction projects \nmust be evaluated in part whether they reduce the risk of loss of life. \nBut the committee is free to consider other factors as long as it is \nclear about which factors it is considering.\n  Projects in each of these project types will be placed in tiers based \non how great a priority they represent, and this information will be \nprovided to Congress and the public in a nonbinding annual report. That \nis it. Congress and the public get information to help them make \ndecisions involving millions--or even billions--of dollars. Surely that \nisn't too much to ask.\n  Modernizing all aspects of our water resources policy will help \nrestore credibility to a Federal agency that is plagued by public \nskepticism in the wake of Katrina. The Corps has admitted serious \ndesign flaws in the levees it built in New Orleans, and it is clear \nthat the Corps' mistakes contributed significantly to the damage New \nOrleans suffered.\n  I can tell you, when I was down in New Orleans just last week, even \nmore than complaints about FEMA, I heard complaints about the Corps. \nAnd just as we have worked as a body to improve FEMA, we need to work \nto improve the Corps. Our constituents and the people of New Orleans \ndeserve no less.\n  The Corps does important work. The real problem, as the senior \nSenator\n\n[[Page S7851]]\n\nfrom Arizona points out, that this amendment seeks to get at is us in \nCongress. Congress has long used the Army Corps of Engineers to \nfacilitate favored pork-barrel projects, while periodically expressing \na desire to change its ways. If we want to change our ways, we can \nstart by passing the McCain prioritization amendment which will help us \nmake sure the Corps continues to contribute to our safety, environment, \nand economy, without wasting taxpayer dollars.\n  The Inhofe-Bond so-called prioritization amendment does not \naccomplish that. In fact, that competing amendment would do nothing \nmore than create a bureaucratic nightmare. It would require every \nproject in the $58 billion backlog to be rated. Even the Corps admits \nthere are many projects in the backlog that will never be built. Some \nof the projects being deauthorized in this WRDA bill were first \nauthorized in the 19th century. So why would we expend such time and \nresources evaluating projects that have no chance of being built? We \ncan prioritize in a smarter, more manageable way.\n  Their amendment creates an ill-defined relative rating system for \ncriteria but doesn't require any final analysis or ranking. How is that \ngoing to help us decide where to allocate taxpayer dollars? It won't. \nThe relative rating system is nothing more than a throwaway single line \nwith no substance.\n  What is most telling is that there is no provision to allow for the \ninformation to be made available to the public so they can look over \nour shoulders and make sense of whether our decisions about national \nwater resource priorities make sense.\n  Furthermore, their amendment, rather than using impartial criteria on \nwhich to weigh projects, would use criteria which would be applied \nacross project types and which appear to be reverse-engineered to \nelevate inland navigation projects: for example, criteria such as \n``availability cost alternate transportation methods relating to the \nproject''; ``[R]eduction of dependence on foreign oil associated with \nusing water as a method of transportation of goods''; ``pollution \nreduction benefits associated with using water as a method of \ntransportation of goods.''\n  These criteria serve to elevate generically inland navigation \nprojects at the expense of flood and storm damage reduction projects \nand environmental restoration projects.\n  Obviously, I do not have an issue with inland navigation projects.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time on the amendment has now expired.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \ncontinue under the remaining time on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, I inquire as to how much \ntime remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amount of time combined is 10 minutes 58 \nseconds under the control of Senator Inhofe and 2 minutes 41 seconds \nunder the control of the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. INHOFE. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Does the Senator from Vermont \nor the Senator from Oklahoma yield? Does the Senator from Vermont yield \ntime?\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is correct, I do not yield time. I just don't object \nto his using some of the time on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont yields time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank my colleagues.\n  The Mississippi River is a critical artery for Wisconsin and national \ncommerce, and many other rivers serve the same role. However, I do take \nissue with the process that uses broadly applied criteria that will \nobviously only be met by a small subset of projects at the expense of \nother valuable project types that fall within the mission area of the \nCorps of Engineers.\n  Lastly, if any of my colleagues are tempted to vote for the Inhofe-\nBond alternative, I encourage them to take a close look at it. It is \nclearly designed to look more substantial than it really is because in \na nine-page amendment, four pages are dedicated to simply reinserting \nthe same language on a fiscal transparency report that the amendment \ninitially deleted.\n  Unfortunately, the existing inadequate, opaque funding process is \nbetter than the prioritization process created by the Inhofe-Bond \namendment. A deliberately flawed and skewed prioritization system would \nbe more harmful than the current ineffective one. As such, whatever \none's position may be on the McCain-Feingold-Lieberman-Feinstein \namendment, I strongly encourage my colleagues to oppose the Inhofe-Bond \nprioritization amendment.\n  I certainly thank my colleagues for the additional time, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. \nIt is my intention to yield back some time. We have some colleagues we \nwant to accommodate. I think if I do that, time will also be yielded \nback from the other side.\n  While I don't agree with those who tried to argue that there are \ncurrently no prioritization projects, I do acknowledge that we can do a \nbetter job. That is exactly what the Inhofe-Bond amendment will do.\n  The administration has priorities right now. They can set priorities. \nIt is called the budget. The administration sets its funding priorities \nthrough the President's budget request. For the last couple of fiscal \nyears, President Bush has relied on a measure called the remaining \nbenefit-remaining cost ratio.\n  The Inhofe-Bond amendment requires the Corps of Engineers to provide \ncritical and easy-to-understand information to Congress that can then \nbe used to make tough budgetary decisions that we have to make when the \nfunds are so limited.\n  The amendment sets out four national priorities--I mention this \nbecause this contradicts something said by the Senator from Wisconsin: \nNo. 1, to reduce the risk of loss of human life and risk to public \nsafety; No. 2, to benefit the national economy; No. 3, to protect and \nenhance the environment; and No. 4, to promote the national defense.\n  Let me just say in closing that no one can vote either for their \namendment or against our amendment saying that one of them is going to \nbe spending more money or there is pork. It is a wash. They are both \nthe same. Voting for the Inhofe-Bond amendment is not going to reduce \nthe amount of money that is going to be spent on projects or voting for \nthe other amendment is not going to do that, either. Not one of these \nis a large spending bill or a small spending bill. I would like to get \nthat out of the way.\n  Our amendment sets out our national goals. The Corps is directed to \ndevelop a relative ranking system to report how well each project meets \nthese four priorities.\n  I really think enough has been said on this issue. I am prepared at \nthis point, if the other side is, to yield back and accommodate some of \nour colleagues. I do so at this time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first, I commend my partner for the \ncooperation we have had on this bill.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the managers' \namendment at the desk be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. This amendment has been cleared on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n\n\n                        Removal of Marine Camels\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to engage in a colloquy \nwith the distinguished manager of this bill, Senator Inhofe, and the \ndistinguished Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, pertaining to a \nprovision that would clarify that funds from the Department of Defense \naccount for environmental remediation at formerly used Defense sites \nmay be used for the removal of abandoned marine camels at any formerly \nused Defense site under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense.\n  First, perhaps for those who are not familiar with marine and naval \nterminology, it would be useful to point out that a ``marine camel'' is \nnothing more than a large timber fender. These wooden fenders, or \nbumpers, are of the type that have been used since the days of sail to \ncushion a ship as it lays alongside a pier, or to act as a buffer \nbetween two or more ships when they are tied up alongside each other, \neither at a pier, a mooring, or at anchor. The purpose of the camel is \nto prevent damage to a ship or a pier that would otherwise occur when a \nship rocks against a pier or against another ship due to shifting \ntides, currents, wakes from passing ships, and so forth.\n  The problem this provision seeks to solve is that over the many years \nthese marine camels have been in use at naval facilities, marine \nterminals, and moorings controlled and operated by the Department of \nDefense, they have been lost, sunk, or otherwise have become hazardous \ndebris, often containing hazardous substances, in the waters and on the \nshores of formerly used Defense sites in Narragansett Bay.\n  The purpose of this colloquy is to establish that the provision that \nhas been included in the Water Resources Development Act is not an \nexpansion of existing authority. This provision is clear that use of \nDepartment of Defense funds is linked to formerly used Defense sites \nthat are under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense. \nTherefore, this provision clarifies but does not expand the authority \nor responsibility of the Department of Defense to undertake \nenvironmental restoration.\n  Mr. INHOFE. My colleague on both the Armed Services and Environment \nand Public Works Committees is correct. This Water Resources \nDevelopment Act provision is simply to clarify existing authority. The \nother bill managers and I were informed that there was some confusion \nas to whether funds from the Department of Defense environmental \nremediation account for formerly used Defense sites could be used to \nremove abandoned marine camels located in the waters of formerly used \nDefense sites in Narragansett Bay. It was our intent to clarify that \nthe Department could in fact use these funds to remove debris linked to \na formerly used Defense site even if that debris has drifted off land \nand into the water. Of course, any debris in the water not linked to a \nformerly used Defense site could not be cleaned up using funds from \nthis account, and I believe the language in the bill reflects that \ndistinction.\n  Mr. WARNER. Further, it is also my understanding and I wish to make \nclear as part of our discussion that this provision is not intended to \ngive a priority to clean up sites in Narragansett Bay over other \nformerly used Defense sites that present a greater risk to public \nhealth and safety.\n  The Department of Defense establishes the priority for cleanup of \nformerly used Defense sites on the basis of risk to the public. The \nSenate Armed Services Committee has long supported the Department's \npolicy of prioritizing environmental cleanup based on risk. We stand \ncommitted to that principle today. I ask my distinguished colleague to \nconfirm that he shares my understanding on these fundamental points.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Again, I agree completely with my colleague. There is \nabsolutely no intent to change the Department's current policy of \nprioritization through this provision. Those sites presenting the \ngreatest risk to the public should be cleaned up first. This provision \nis silent with regard to where on that priority list sites in \nNarragansett Bay may fall.\n  Mr. WARNER. With that understanding, I support this provision and I \nbelieve it may be helpful in ensuring that this cleanup in the \nNarragansett Bay takes place, as it should.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for including this \nprovision in the Water Resources Development Act. More than 100 \nabandoned camels litter Narragansett Bay, creating a safety hazard for \nboaters and divers and contaminating the bay's water with creosote, \nwhich has been listed by the Environmental Protection Agency as a \nprobable human carcinogen. Camels were commonly used as fendering \nsystems at the Newport Navy Base, the Quonset Point Naval Air Station \ncarrier pier, Davisville Naval Construction Battalion Center, and the \nMelville Fuel Depot. As my colleagues from Virginia and Oklahoma \npointed out, this\n\n[[Page S7853]]\n\nlanguage claries that funding from the formerly used Defense sites' \naccount could be used to remove abandoned marine camels located in the \nwaters of formerly used Defense sites in Narragansett Bay, including \nremoval of debris that is linked to a formerly used Defense site even \nif that debris has drifted off land and into the water. The ecological \nhealth and water quality of Narragansett Bay is vital to the economy of \nRhode Island, and I believe that this language will aid in the cleanup \nof this precious natural resource.\n\n\n                        Aquatic Nuisance Species\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as the leaders of this bill know, aquatic \nnuisance species cause unwanted and potentially harmful environmental \nchanges in the Nation's waters. Aquatic nuisance species are introduced \nthrough various pathways, with ballast water on ships being the most \npredominant. Having a strong program to address the challenges \npresented by new introductions, allow rapid response actions, screen \nimports of aquatic organisms, and conduct research in all of these \nareas is extremely important and something this Congress needs to \naddress.\n  In an attempt to develop a system to confront the challenges \npresented by these species, Senator Collins and I have sponsored \ncomprehensive legislation to address this issue. While the Water \nResources Development Act addresses protecting our Nation's waters, my \ncolleague from Maine and I have decided not to address the need for \ncomprehensive aquatic nuisance species legislation in this bill because \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee leadership has committed to \ntry to move a comprehensive bill forward this year.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I do understand the concerns about the impacts of aquatic \nnuisance species. I want to assure the Senate that it is my intention \nto resume discussions on a bill and try to bring a comprehensive bill \nto the Senate floor this year.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the chairman and ranking member for their \ncommitment to continue the process and look forward to working with you \nand continuing the discussion on this issue.\n\n\n               Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Senator Inhofe, as you know, the 2000 WRDA bill \nauthorized the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. CERP created \na permanent and independent peer review panel. The process used to \ndevelop CERP had broad public and technical review and participation. \nTherefore, all CERP projects have already gone through an initial \nplanning stage. However, there are approximately 50 CERP projects that \nstill need additional authorization from Congress. During conference \nnegotiations with the House, would you be willing to examine the impact \nof additional peer review on CERP projects and its current independent \nreview process?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Senator Martinez, I am aware of the CERP review process \nestablished in WRDA 2000, and during conference we will examine its \nestablished independent review process to ensure that Everglades \nrestoration is not unduly impeded.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Thank you, Senator Inhofe. I appreciate your leadership \nand diligence on this important issue.\n\n\n                              Section 2019\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am aware that section 2019 of the WRDA bill before us \nhas some problems with how we have attempted to deal with balancing the \nneeds of municipal water suppliers and hydroelectric power generation. \nComplicating the issue is how CBO has scored our proposals to achieve \nbalance. I fully intend to resolve this issue and do not intend to \npreempt existing statutory authorities that govern the Corps' ability \nto reallocate storage and provide municipal and industrial water \nsupply. I ask my colleague, the senior Senator from New Mexico, to \naccept my assurances that I will work towards a compromise that treats \nall parties fairly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank my colleague for his efforts on these difficult \nissues and appreciate his consideration of the importance of \nhydroelectric generation to the nation's power supply. I also \nappreciate his working with me to ensure that this has no unintended \nimpact on existing authorities that govern the Corps' ability to \nreallocate storage. I look forward to working with the senior Senator \nfrom Oklahoma on these issues.\n\n\n               Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Senator Feingold, as you know, the legislation \nestablishing the Everglades Restoration Comprehensive Plan creates a \npermanent, independent peer review panel with extensive \nresponsibilities for reviewing the Everglades restoration plan in \ndetail. The Corps of Engineers has contracted with the National Academy \nof Sciences to establish that panel, and it has been working \nproductively for years, issuing a number of major reports. Would this \nlegislation create duplication with that panel?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Senator Nelson, I am familiar with the excellent peer \nreview system that has been established for the comprehensive \nEverglades project. In many ways, that peer review system is a model \nfor this amendment. There is nothing in this amendment that would keep \nthe Director of Independent Peer Review from determining that the \nEverglades peer review is the functional equivalent of the peer review \nor substitute for the peer review required by this amendment and \nsatisfies this requirement. In many ways, the Everglades peer review \ngoes beyond that required by this amendment, and works smoothly with \nthe requirements of this amendment.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I appreciate and agree with your understanding \nof this amendment. I fully support the view that expensive \ncontroversial Corps of Engineers projects should be subject to \nindependent peer review. In case there is any possible need for \nclarification of this issue, would the Senator from Wisconsin be \nwilling to work with me during the conference on this bill?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Absolutely.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of S. 728, \nthe bill to reauthorize the Water Resources Development Act, WRDA.\n  I want to join my colleagues in expressing my sincere appreciation to \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee Chairman Inhofe and Ranking \nMember Jeffords, and to Senator Bond, who chairs the Subcommittee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure, and Senator Baucus, who serves as \nthe ranking member of the Subcommittee. I also want to commend their \ndedicated staff for their hard work and consideration on this important \nlegislation. The leaders in our committee and their staff have \nliterally worked for years to bring this bill to the floor for \nconsideration, and they deserve credit for their patience and \nperseverance.\n  I particularly thank Senator Inhofe and Senator Bond for the New \nJersey project authorizations they have included in this bill. As do \nother States, New Jersey depends on the Army Corps to carry out \nprojects that are vital to our economy. This bill contains \nauthorizations for three important projects in New Jersey. The first is \na South River storm damage and ecosystem restoration project. The \nsecond is a Raritan Bay and Sandy Hook Bay project at Union Beach which \nwill address hurricane and storm damage and provide for beach \nnourishment over the 50-year life of the project. The third is a \nManasquan to Barnegat Inlets project to address hurricane and storm \ndamage and provide for beach nourishment over the 50-year life of the \nproject.\n  The bill also contains a contingent authorization for a Great Egg \nHarbor Inlet to Townsends Inlet project for hurricane and storm damage \nreduction and periodic nourishment over the 50-year life of the \nproject. I also appreciate the bill managers' willingness to accept my \nlanguage on the shore protection demonstration program. This program \nwill help us learn how to nourish our shore in smarter and cheaper \nways.\n  While I supported the Feingold-McCain amendment regarding independent \npeer review, I hope this won't be construed to take anything away from \nthe underlying bill or the hard work of its managers. The underlying \nbill is one that I am pleased to support, and I will vote for its final \npassage.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President. I want to express my support of S. 728, the \nWater Resources Development Act, WRDA, of 2006. S. 728 authorizes the \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers to study water resource problems, \nundertake construction projects, and make major modifications to \nexisting projects. It has\n\n[[Page S7854]]\n\nbeen 5 years since the last WRDA was enacted into law and I thank my \ncolleague, the Senior Senator from Missouri, for his leadership in \nbringing this bill to the floor. This is a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation that must be passed to address our Nation's critical \nnavigation, flood control, and environmental restoration needs.\n  I am a cosponsor of S. 728 because I recognize the need to authorize \nessential flood control, shore protection, dam safety, storm damage \nreduction, and environmental restoration projects. These projects \ncarried out by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers protect communities \nacross the country from destruction caused by severe weather and \nflooding, and also promote protection and restoration of our Nation's \necosystems. In addition, the legislation establishes standards that \nbalance the safety and interest of the public with the economic and \nenvironmental feasibility of projects.\n  I am pleased that provisions from S. 2735, the Dam Safety Act of \n2006, which I introduced with Senator Bond, are included in the \nmanagers' amendment to S. 728. This will advance dam safety in the \nUnited States and prevent loss of life and property damage from dam \nfailures at both the Federal and State programmatic levels. \nSpecifically, the reauthorization of the National Dam Safety Program \nAct will provide much needed assistance to State dam safety programs \nthat regulate 95 percent of the 80,000 dams in the United States. Of \nthe approximately $13 million authorized annually through 2011, $8 \nmillion will be divided among the States to improve safety programs and \n$2 million will be dedicated for research to identify more effective \ntechniques to assess, construct, and monitor dams. In addition, \n$700,000 will be available for training assistance for State engineers, \n$1 million for the employment of new staff and personnel for Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, and $1 million for the National Inventory \nof Dams.\n  An additional provision that mirrors S. 2444, the National Dam Safety \nProgram Act, which I introduced with Senator Inouye, is included in S. \n728. This authorizes appropriations of $25 million for small dam \nremovals and dam rehabilitation projects. Although the amount included \nin S. 728 is not as large as in S. 2444, this is still an important \nfirst step in ensuring the safety of the public. I will continue to \nwork with my colleagues to ensure that both public and private dams \nreceive the maintenance they need.\n  The cost of failing to maintain our Nation's dam infrastructure is \nextremely high. There have been at least 29 dam failures in the United \nStates during the past 2 years causing more than $200 million in \nproperty damage. In my home State in March, the Ka Loko Dam, a 116-year \nearthen dam, on the island of Kauai breached during heavy rains killing \nseven people. This tragic event serves as an important reminder of the \nresponsibility held by the State and local governments, but also of the \nleadership role of the Federal Government in supplementing State \nresources and developing national guidelines for dam safety.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 728. Again, I \nexpress my appreciation to my colleagues Senators Bond, Inhofe, \nJeffords, Feingold, Boxer, Specter and McCain for their leadership in \nbringing this bill to the floor. This bill is essential in improving \neconomic growth, safety, and the quality of life of all Americans.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Water \nResources Development Act. First, let me commend my colleague from \nacross the Mississippi River, Senator Bond, for his efforts in bringing \nthis bill to the floor. I was pleased to support his efforts in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee and to be an original cosponsor \nof this bill.\n  Last year, Senator Bond and I worked together on a letter, signed by \n40 of our colleagues, saying it was time for this bill to be considered \non the floor of the Senate. When we were told that 40 was not enough, \nthat we needed 60 signatures, we came back and got 81.\n  That was 7 months ago, and I am pleased that the Senate is now on the \nverge of passing this bill because this is an important bill both to my \nState of Illinois and to the entire country. It authorizes and revises \nthe policies and practices of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in \nwaterway navigation, including the construction of locks and dams, the \nconstruction of levees and wetlands restoration to promote flood \ncontrol, and other ecosystem and environmental mitigation activities.\n  For two decades, Congress has enacted revisions and updates to WRDA \nroughly every 2 years. It is now been 6 years since the last WRDA bill \nand, in light of the devastation wrought by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita \nlast year, this bill is long overdue.\n  Recently, the American Society of Civil Engineers conducted a report \ncard of the Nation's infrastructure and gave a D-minus to our navigable \nwaterways. More than 50 percent of our lock and dam systems in the \nUnited States are functionally obsolete, and that figure will rise to \n80 percent in the next 10 years.\n  Now, if you are not from a farm State, you might not understand why \nnavigable waterways are important to all of us. But a major component \nof the cost of farm commodities is the cost of transportation. That \naffects both the price of food that we buy in grocery stores and the \nprice of homegrown fuels that fuel our cars. If U.S. agriculture is to \nremain competitive in the worldwide market during the 21st century, we \nneed to improve our transportation infrastructure.\n  Countries such as Brazil and China understand the importance of \nefficient commerce for their farmers and have made significant \ninvestments in improvements. Unfortunately, American farmers still rely \non pre-World War II-era infrastructure when transporting their goods to \nmarket. When we talk about the responsibility of Congress and the U.S. \nGovernment to create jobs and economic development, upgrading these \nlocks and dams is part of that responsibility.\n  This bill provides $1.8 billion for lock and dam upgrades along these \nwaterways to replace transportation infrastructure almost 70 years old. \nThis is an important provision to Illinois farmers and to everyone \naround the world who uses the products that we grow in Illinois.\n  The bill also provides an unprecedented $1.6 billion in Federal funds \nfor ecosystem restoration along the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers to \nimprove fish and wildlife habitat as well as land and water management.\n  Finally, there is a small, but important, provision to authorize \ncontinued funding for the electric barriers that prevent the Asian carp \nfrom entering into the Great Lakes. The Asian carp is an invasive \nspecies with a voracious appetite that, if left unchecked, would \ndisrupt the natural ecosystem in the Great Lakes and crowd out the \nnative fish. Senator Voinovich and I were able to get a temporary fix \nput into the supplemental appropriations bill, but we need a more \npermanent guarantee of funding, and WRDA will provide just that.\n  I will also take a minute to discuss the subject of reforming the \nArmy Corps of Engineers. Serious questions have been raised as to how \nthe Corps develops its calculations and analyses for projects. I \nbelieve that subjecting some projects to an independent review process \nis necessary to ensure that taxpayer dollars are used in the most \neffective manner.\n  In closing, I commend Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member Jeffords for \ntheir leadership, and I thank the EPW Committee staff for their fine \nefforts in preparing this bill. I am pleased to cosponsor this bill and \nurge my colleagues to support it as well.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, our Nation's waterways, harbors, and \nports are vital to our economic prosperity, the safety of those who \nnavigate our waters, and to our quality of life. It is estimated that \none out of every five jobs in the United States is dependent, to some \nextent, on commercial activities handled by our ports and harbors. In \nmany instances, ship and barge transport is the safest, cheapest, and \ncleanest transportation mode. Likewise, our waterways provide critical \nhabitat for fish and wildlife, recreational opportunities for boaters, \nand contribute to the health and well-being of millions of people \nthrough their diversity, beauty, history, and natural environment. This \nlegislation authorizes the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to undertake \nwater resource projects of great importance to our Nation's and\n\n[[Page S7855]]\n\nour states' economy and maritime industry, public safety and to our \nenvironment.\n  I am particularly pleased that the measure includes a number of \nprovisions for which I have fought to help ensure the future health of \nthe Port of Baltimore, the Chesapeake Bay, and Maryland's waterfront \ncommunities. With more than 4,000 miles of shoreline around the \nChesapeake Bay and Atlantic Ocean, 126 miles of deepwater shipping \nchannels leading to the Port of Baltimore, some 70 small navigation \nprojects critical to commercial and recreational fisherman and to local \nand regional economies, Maryland is a State which relies heavily on the \nnavigation, flood control, and environmental restoration programs of \nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Over the years, I and other members \nof the Maryland congressional delegation have worked hard to maintain \nand improve the Federal channel system--serving the Port of Baltimore \nand other communities throughout Maryland, to address the severe \nshoreline erosion problems on Maryland's Atlantic Coast, and to bring \nthe Army Corps of Engineers' expertise to bear in the restoration of \nthe Chesapeake Bay and Maryland's rivers and streams. While other ports \nare just now beginning to deepen their channels to 45 or 50 feet, we \nsucceeded in deepening the port's main shipping channel to 50 feet 16 \nyears ago making navigation safer, easier, and cheaper for ships using \nthe channel and assuring that the route can handle the deep draft bulk \ncargo carriers in use today.\n  We recently completed two critical safety improvements to the Port's \nchannel system--the straightening of the Tolchester ``S'' turn and the \nwidening and deepening of the Brewerton channel eastern extension--as \nwell as some long-needed improvements to Baltimore harbor's anchorages \nand branch channels. We constructed a hurricane protection project at \nOcean City, MD to help protect the citizens and the billions of dollars \nin public and private infrastructure in the area and restored the beach \nat the north end of Assateague Island National Seashore. We also \ncompleted numerous environmental restoration projects throughout the \nChesapeake Bay watershed from Jennings Randolph Lake in western \nMaryland to the Poplar Island Environmental Restoration Project--the \nlargest and most environmentally significant island habitat restoration \nproject ever undertaken in the Chesapeake Bay. These projects would not \nhave taken place without the authorities and funding provided in \nprevious Water Resources Development Acts. The measure before us will \nenable several, much-needed water resource infrastructure projects in \nMaryland to move forward.\n  First, the bill authorizes a 50-percent expansion of the Poplar \nIsland environmental restoration project, to provide additional dredged \nmaterial capacity for the Port of Baltimore and additional habitat for \nthe Chesapeake Bay's wildlife. Initially authorized by section 537 of \nthe Water Resources Development Act, WRDA, of 1996, the Poplar Island \nproject has proved to be a tremendous success and a model for the \nNation on how to dispose of dredged material.\n  Instead of the traditional practice of treating the dredged material \nas a waste and dumping it overboard, we are putting approximately 40 \nmillion cubic yards of clean dredged material from the shipping \nchannels leading to the Port of Baltimore into a productive use, \nrestoring 1,140 acres of remote island habitat in the Chesapeake Bay, \ncreating a haven for fish and wildlife, and helping reduce sediment \ndegradation of the Bay's water quality. This represents a win-win \nsituation for two of Maryland's most important assets--the Port of \nBaltimore and the Chesapeake Bay.\n  Last year, the Army Corps of Engineers completed two studies--a \nBaltimore Harbor and Channels Dredged Material Plan, DMMP, and an \nintegrated General Reevaluation Report, GRR/Supplemental Environmental \nImpact Statement, SEIS, on the Poplar Island Environmental Restoration \nProject--which identified a critical need for new dredged material \nplacement capacity for the Port of Baltimore by 2009 in order to meet \nFederal and State of Maryland requirements and recommended the \nexpansion of Poplar Island as a preferred alternatives for addressing \nthe dredged material capacity gap in an economically and \nenvironmentally sound manner. A subsequent Chief's Report submitted to \nCongress on March 31, 2006, recommended a 575-acre expansion of the \nexisting Poplar Island and the raising of the island's existing upland \ncells to add approximately 28 million cubic yards of dredged material \nplacement capacity and extend the project life by approximately 7 \nyears. This measure authorizes the expansion of the existing Poplar \nIsland project as recommended in the Chief's Report. It authorizes \n$256.1 million for the expansion project, bringing the total cost of \nthe existing project and the expansion project to $643.4 million, with \nan estimated Federal cost of $482.4 million and an estimated non-\nFederal cost of $161 million. The Poplar Island environmental \nrestoration project has been a top priority of mine, of the Maryland \nPort Administration and of the shipping and environmental communities \nfor many years, and I am delighted that this legislation will enable us \nto move forward with the expansion of this project.\n  Second, the bill contains three additional provisions authorizing a \ntotal of nearly $100 million which are critical to our continuing \nefforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay. It reauthorizes and expands a \nprogram that we established in section 510 of WRDA 1996 known as the \nChesapeake Bay Environmental Restoration and Protection Program, \nraising the authorized funding from the current level of $10 million to \n$30 million. It increases the funding for Chesapeake Bay native oyster \nrestoration to $50 million--a $20 million increase over current levels. \nAnd it authorizes the Smith Island ecosystem restoration project to \nreverse the tremendous loss of wetlands and submerged aquatic \nvegetation around Smith Island, MD.\n  In 1984, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a comprehensive \nstudy--the first such study ever undertaken--of the present and future \nuses and problems of Chesapeake Bay's water and related land resources. \nSince then the Corps has undertaken or participated in a variety of \nprojects to help restore the Chesapeake Bay's water quality and living \nresources, including sewage treatment plant upgrades, making beneficial \nuse of dredged materials, removing impediments to fish passage, \nmitigating the impacts of shoreline erosion, and restoring wetlands, \nhabitat and oyster reefs. But despite these efforts, the Chesapeake \nBay's health continues to languish.\n  To restore the integrity of the ecosystem and to meet the goals \nestablished in the Chesapeake 2000 Agreement, nutrient and sediment \nloads must be significantly reduced, oyster populations must be \nincreased, SAV and wetlands must be protected and restored, and \nremaining blockages to fish passage must be removed, among other \nactions. As the lead Federal agency in water resource management, the \nCorps has a vital role to play in this endeavor, and the programs \nauthorized in this measure will enable the Corps to continue to \nparticipate in this effort. The funding increase provided for the \nChesapeake Bay Environmental Restoration and Protection Program will \nallow the Corps to expand design and construction assistance to State \nand local authorities for a variety of environmental restoration \nprojects in the bay. The additional funds provided for native oyster \nrestoration will help support the Chesapeake 2000's goal of increasing \noyster populations by tenfold by the year 2010. And the new authority \nto construct the Smith Island environmental restoration projects will \nhelp stem the alarming loss of SAV and wetlands along the coastline of \nMartin National Wildlife Refuge and Smith Island, protecting \napproximately 720 acres and restoring about 1,400 acres of valuable \nhabitat.\n  Third, the measure provides the funding necessary to complete the C \nCanal rewatering project in Cumberland, MD. In 1952 a 1.2-mile section \nof the historic C Canal and turning basin at its Cumberland terminus \nwas filled in by the Corps of Engineers during construction of the \nCumberland, MD, and Ridgely, WV, flood protection project. The National \nPark Service and State and local authorities have long sought to \nrebuild and rewater the C Canal in this area to restore the integrity \nof the historic canal and assist in\n\n[[Page S7856]]\n\nrevitalizing the area as a major hub for tourism and environmentally \nsound economic development. The Corps investigated the feasibility of \nreconstructing and rewatering the turning basin and canal near its \nterminus and determined that it is feasible to rewater the canal \nsuccessfully without compromising the flood protection for the city of \nCumberland.\n  Subsequently, Senator Mikulski and I secured a provision in WRDA 1999 \nauthorizing the Corps to construct this project at a then-estimated \ntotal project cost of $15 million. Those estimates were based on a 50-\npercent design document completed in 1998. Since that time, the \nestimated cost of the project has increased due, in large part, to the \nfinding of archeological objects and petroleum in the canal turning \nbasin and prism as well as design refinements. The provisions included \nin this bill increase the authorized funding level for the project from \n$15 million to $25.75 million and will ensure that the full 1.2-mile \nsection of canal and turning basin are completed.\n  Fourth, the bill contains provisions to facilitate the restoration of \nthe Anacostia River, one of the most degraded rivers in the Chesapeake \nBay watershed and in the Nation.\n  Through a cooperative and coordinated Federal, State, local, and \nprivate effort, significant progress has been made over the past decade \nto restore the Anacostia watershed. Today there are more than 60 local, \nState, and Federal agencies involved in Anacostia watershed restoration \nefforts, and more than $100 million in Federal, State, and local funds \nhave been invested in this endeavor. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \nhas played a key role in improving tidal waterflow through the marsh, \nreducing the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus, and restoring \nwetlands, but the job of restoring the Anacostia watershed is far from \ncomplete. The provisions in this legislation require the Secretary of \nthe Army, in coordination with the Mayor of the District of Columbia, \nthe Governor of Maryland, the county executives of Montgomery County \nand Prince George's County, MD, and other stakeholders, to develop and \nmake available to the public a 10-year comprehensive action plan to \nprovide for the restoration and protection of the ecological integrity \nof the Anacostia River and its tributaries.\n  I wish to compliment the distinguished chairmen of the committee and \nthe subcommittee, Senators Inhofe and Bond, and the ranking members, \nSenators Jeffords and Baucus, for including these provisions and for \ntheir work on this legislation. This legislation is long overdue, and I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that we are finally \ngoing to conclude the Water Resources Development Act. My hope is that \nthe conference with the House can be completed before the Congress \nrecesses in early October. This is a good bill, providing for flood \ncontrol, improvements to navigation, and considerable improvements to \nthe environment. The bill also provides some real improvements to the \nway the Corps works.\n  I am very pleased that the bill includes improvements for navigation \nand environmental improvements for the Upper Mississippi River. It \nincludes five expanded locks, a number of long-overdue efficiency \nimprovements, and a major boost to the Corps of Engineers' \nenvironmental programs. I was pleased to work with Senator Bond to \ndevelop this important and very balanced proposal. The unfortunate \nthing is that our Upper Mississippi lock and dam measure was first \nintroduced in 2004 and then made a part of the Senate WRDA bill that \nyear. But we are only now getting a chance to move it to the Senate \nfloor.\n  I have been deeply involved with navigation because of its importance \nto farmers in Iowa and across the upper Midwest. River transportation \nis critical to keeping commodity costs low enough to remain \ncompetitive.\n  When shipping on the river is constrained, costs rise. When that \nhappens, prices for moving bulk farm commodities by alternative means, \nmainly rail, go up as well. These price differentials seem relatively \nsmall compared to the total price, but they make a huge difference in \nfarm income.\n  Clearly, river traffic on the Mississippi is incredibly important to \nproducers in my State and elsewhere in the upper Midwest. As a result \nof traffic congestion on the Mississippi, producers face longer \nshipping times, which are very costly. Clearly, traffic management and \nhelper boats to push long barges through crowded locks will be very \nhelpful, and this bill will help that happen. In the long run, though, \nthat won't be enough. It is incredibly important that we address ways \nto modernize a number of the locks on the upper Mississippi.\n  And we face substantial improvements from our competitors in their \ntransportation capabilities, particularly in Brazil. I visited there a \nfew years ago and saw firsthand how Brazil was rapidly moving to \nimprove its Amazon River facilities. In contrast, we are sitting with \n60-year-old locks that raise our costs.\n  I would also note that moving goods like corn down to the Gulf by \nriver instead of by rail, and building material up from the Gulf in the \nsame manner means considerable saving in fuel both lowering costs and \nair pollution.\n  Existing law requires exhaustive analysis of future river use levels \ndecades into the future. The studies required for such predictions are, \nby their nature, highly speculative at best. While many have been \ncritical of the methods of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Corps \nis essential to our ability to compete, to ensure that we keep the \narteries and veins of America's river transportation system in smooth \nrunning order. We must remain competitive. We cannot wait any longer to \nauthorize construction for 1,200-foot locks so barge tows can move \nthrough the upper Mississippi and Illinois without being split.\n  Of course, navigation needs cannot be our sole concern. Over the \nyears, I have heard time and time again from constituents and national \nleaders concerned about the environment, about the need to maintain a \nbalance among navigation, flood control and the environment. Habitat \nfor many species--indeed, the Mississippi River ecosystem as a whole--\nhas deteriorated since the construction of the original lock system in \nthe 1930's.\n  The Mississippi River is home to a wide variety of fish and birds, as \nwell as other wildlife. These animals and abundant plant life are \nimportant to the character and life of the Mississippi River. \nApproximately, 40 percent of North America's waterfowl and shorebirds \nuse the Mississippi Flyway.\n  Parts of the Upper Mississippi River may serve as the most important \narea for migrating diving ducks in the United States. And the \nMississippi River serves as habitat for breeding and wintering birds, \nincluding the bald eagle.\n  We are all aware of the problems that have plagued the Corps' actions \non the Mississippi River. However, the Corps has pledged and is putting \na much stronger emphasis on environmental protection. We need to work \nwith the Corps to ensure that all updates and renovations of the locks \nand dams are done with the utmost care for the environment and the \nwildlife that depends on the Mississippi River habitat.\n  In addition to that mitigation, we need to give the Corps the \nauthorization and the funding it needs to accomplish real ecosystem \nrestoration, and not just make up for the lost habitat of specific \nidentified species. The legislation we are proposing does just that.\n  This is going to be a challenge in these difficult budget times, but \nnot to do so would be penny-wise and pound-foolish. We need to be \nthinking both of the long-term economic health of our agricultural \nproducers and shippers, in tandem with the long-term health of the \ndiverse ecosystems on the river.\n  I would like to note that I am pleased that bill authorizes \nimprovements to the Des Moines flood control system. Des Moines \nsuffered major flooding in 1993 and clearly needs the improvements to \nreduce the chance of flooding in the future.\n  I believe the legislation we are proposing strikes the correct \nbalance. I urge our colleagues to support this important bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. Presient, I thank Chairman Inhofe and Senator \nJeffords and both of their staffs for their tireless effort writing \nthis bill. It has not been an easy bill to write due to the many \ncompeting demands on water resources as well as interests regarding \nCorps reform.\n\n[[Page S7857]]\n\n  Traditionally, Congress passes WRDA every 2 years, ensuring that the \nCorps of Engineers can stay current in studying the most pressing water \nresource problems, constructing projects, and modifying existing \nprojects to meet various needs across the country.\n  We have been waiting 6 long years for a bill to reauthorize \nnavigation, ecosystem restoration, fish and wildlife conservation, and \nflood and storm damage reduction projects all over the country.\n  Today, I am pleased to see this bill on the floor of the Senate, a \nmeasure that is the product of bipartisan negotiations and has the \nsupport of 80 Senators.\n  I strongly support this legislation.\n  Most significant to my home State of Illinois is the bill's \nauthorization of navigation improvements and restoration of the \necosystem of the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway System. \nThis project will increase lock capacity and improve the ecosystem of \nboth the Upper Mississippi River and the Illinois River.\n  Specifically, this bill authorizes improvements to Locks 12, 14, 18, \n20, 22, and 24 on the Mississippi River. It also authorizes the \nconstruction of 7 new 1,200-foot locks at Locks 20, 21, 22, 24, and 25 \non the Mississippi River and at the LaGrange and Peoria Locks on the \nIllinois River. Many of the locks on the rivers were built nearly 70 \nyears ago and are in desperate need of an overhaul. Inland waterway \nshipping relies on the successful operation of these locks. Frequent \ndelays caused by the antiquated lock system increase shipping costs, \nwhich hurts American farmers.\n  Updating these locks is critical for industry and agriculture in the \nMidwest and in my home State of Illinois. Every year, the river moves \n$12 billion worth of products. It moves 1 billion bushels of grain--\nabout 60 percent of all grain exports--to ports around the world. More \nthan half of Illinois' annual corn crop and 75 percent of all U.S. \nsoybean exports travel via the Upper Mississippi/Illinois River system. \nShipping via barge keeps exports competitive and reduces transportation \ncosts. That is good for producers and consumers. In addition, increased \nbarge shipping displaces shipments by rail and truck, which lowers \ntransportation costs for all businesses nationwide.\n  There are significant cost savings and environmental benefits to \nupdating these locks as well. Barges operate at 10 percent of the cost \nof trucks and 40 percent of the cost of rail traffic. They also emit \nmuch less carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, and hydrocarbons, and use \nless fuel to transport the equivalent tonnage of products.\n  It is estimated that the construction of the 7 locks will create 48 \nmillion man-hours of jobs and provide 3,000 to 6,000 jobs per year, \nincluding many high-paying manufacturing jobs. Currently, in the Upper \nMississippi River Basin alone, more than 400,000 jobs are connected to \nthe river. This includes 90,000 well-paid manufacturing jobs.\n  In addition, this project manages to balance the navigation needs of \ncommercial shippers on our inland waterways with ecosystem restoration. \nQuite simply, this project authorizes the most ambitious ecosystem \nrestoration project in the history of the Corps of Engineers. At a time \nwhen many believe this waterway is losing its habitats and eco-\ndiversity, this $1.65 billion ecosystem restoration project is an \nimportant step toward fostering wildlife and natural habitats along the \ninland waterway system.\n  This restoration project will restore over 100,000 acres of habitat \nand create new recreational opportunities and additional jobs in the \narea.\n  Ecosystem restoration projects that are authorized in this bill \ninclude flood plain restoration, island building, construction of fish \npassages, island and shoreline protection and tributary confluence \nrestoration, among others. When this project was developed, I worked \ndiligently to ensure that the natural ecosystem of the Mississippi and \nIllinois Rivers received the same attention as the navigational needs \nof the area.\n  I also thank the managers of this bill for the inclusion of a project \nthat is critically important to Illinois as well as the entire Great \nLakes region--the authorization to make permanent the Chicago Sanitary \nand Ship Canal Dispersal Barrier system. This project is critical to \nprotecting the Great Lakes from the Asian Carp, an invasive species now \nfound in the Mississippi River. Asian carp can grow to 4 feet, weigh 60 \npounds, and are capable of consuming up to 40 percent of their body \nweight in plankton per day. While the Mississippi River and the Great \nLakes were once separate water systems, the construction of the Chicago \nSanitary and Ship Canal connected these two water bodies. Today, the \nAsian carp threatens a $4.1 billion sport and commercial fishing \nindustry in the Great Lakes. Permanent operation of the barrier system \nto prevent the Asian carp from entering the waters of the Great Lakes \nis critical to the protection of this valuable ecosystem. I appreciate \nthe inclusion of language in this bill that recognizes the threat of \nthe Asian carp and the need to protect the Great Lakes ecosystem from \nthis invasive species.\n  Finally, we must recognize that Hurricane Katrina was a wake-up call; \none that requires us in Congress to take those steps that ensure we \ndon't witness another Katrina-type disaster caused by a failure of \nengineering, analysis or any other failure of oversight. We must ensure \nthat projects meant to protect the public wellbeing do just that. This \nbill is critically important to the agricultural interests in my State. \nI will encourage the advancement of this bill through Congress and am \ncommitted to seeing that it is sent to the President.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, when a bill like this one comes to the \nfloor, especially after 6 years, there are so many people to thank. \nFirst, I want to thank the support of my principal cosponsor, the \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, who has worked with me since the \n108th Congress.\n  I know he shares my view that future Corps projects should no longer \nfail to produce predicted benefits, should stop costing the taxpayers \nmore than the Corps estimated, should not have unanticipated \nenvironmental impacts, and should be built in an environmentally \ncompatible way.\n  He saw the importance of ensuring that the Corps does a better job, \nwhich is what the taxpayers and the environment deserve. He and his \nstaffer, Becky Jensen, deserve commendation.\n  I am particularly grateful for the help and support of the chairman \nof the committee, Mr. Inhofe. He directed his staff to work closely \nwith mine, and Ruth Van Mark, Angie Giancarlo, and Steven Aaron did so \nably, and I thank them, and the majority staff director, Andy Wheeler.\n  I would also be remiss if I did not acknowledge the support of \nanother former EPW chairman, the former Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. \nSmith. It was he who brought conservative groups and taxpayer groups to \nthe table on these issues, honored my request for a hearing in 2002 \nalong with then-Ranking Member Baucus, and I am deeply grateful.\n  I want to thank our current esteemed and retiring ranking member, the \nSenator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords. This may be the committee's last \nmajor bill this Congress, and he is to be commended for his leadership.\n  He and I have spoken personally about my interests in improving the \nCorps, and I am grateful for his support.\n  Several of the minority staff of the committee have been working on \nthe issues I am raising in my amendments since my first independent \nreview amendment on the 2000 WRDA bill. At the time, Jo-Ellen Darcy \nworked on the committee for the Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, who \nwas then the ranking member, and she has followed my interest in these \nissues for Senator Baucus, Senator Reid, and now Senator Jeffords.\n  I also want to acknowledge the help and support of several others on \nthe minority staff, Catharine Ransom, Alison Taylor, Ken Connolly, and \nMary Frances Repko, who worked for me until 2003, and provided \ninvaluable help to me with my first Corps reform bill in the 107th \nCongress and the WRDA amendment that preceded it.\n  I also have a long history working with the Senator from Missouri, \nMr. Bond, on Corps issues. I appreciate the effort that he, and his \nstaffers, Brian Klippenstein and Letmon Lee, have made to improve the \nCorps' performance.\n  Our work together goes back to 1999. The reauthorization of the \nEnvironmental Management Program in the\n\n[[Page S7858]]\n\nUpper Mississippi was the only permanent authorization in WRDA 99. \nIncluded in the final EMP provisions was a requirement that Senator \nBond and I developed to have the Corps create an independent technical \nadvisory committee to review EMP projects, monitoring plans, and \nhabitat and natural resource needs assessments. Our work helped to \ncement the Environment Committee's commitment to secure outside \ntechnical advice in Corps habitat restoration programs, like the EMP.\n  The amendments I offered to the WRDA bill are widely supported in the \nenvironmental and taxpayer community, and several individuals have \nworked hard for this day, including Chelsea Maxwell, former staffer to \nthe retired Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, and now with \nNational Wildlife Federation, Adam Kolton, David Conrad and Tim Eder \nwith National Wildlife Federation, Joan Mulhern with Earth Justice, \nMelissa Samet with American Rivers, Steve Ellis and Jill Lancelot with \nTaxpayers for Common Sense, Tim Searchinger with Environmental Defense, \nand Pete Sepp and Kristina Rasmussen with the National Taxpayers Union.\n  Finally, I want to thank my own staff. My staffer, Jessica Maher, has \nworked tirelessly on this legislation. She has talked to countless \noffices and constituents, and has worked to address their concerns and \nquestions with grace and good humor, as has Mike Schmidt, another \nmember of my staff. I am deeply grateful to Jess and to her \npredecessor, Heather White.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, while we are nearing completion of this \nbill, I would like to take a few minutes to highlight some of the \nprojects in the bill for my State of Vermont.\n  Throughout our work on this bill, I have worked to find a way to use \nthe Army Corps of Engineers' expertise in a series of ``Vermont style'' \nprojects. I believe we have succeeded.\n  This bill would provide $67 million in new authorities for the State \nof Vermont. Vermonters identified four major priorities for the Corps \nduring my discussions with them: keep Vermont projects in the Vermont \nstyle, continue ongoing Lake Champlain efforts, address Connecticut \nRiver issues, and find a way to repair or eliminate the thousands of \nsmall dams throughout the State creating flood hazards and causing \necosystem damage. This bill addresses each of these areas.\n  First, during our discussion on the WRDA bill, I advocated strongly \nfor an increase in the authorization for small ecosystem restoration \nprojects like those in Vermont. In this bill, we increase that program \nfrom $25 million to $50 million, allowing smaller, Vermont-scale \nprojects to move forward.\n  Second, we have continued our ongoing support of the Lake Champlain \nprogram, authorized in WRDA 2000, by adding $2 million in authority for \ngeographic mapping and $10 million for streambank stabilization \nprojects to protect water quality. We also authorize a study of the \nLake Champlain Canal dispersal barrier to help prevent invasive species \nfrom entering the lake.\n  Third, this bill includes major changes for the Connecticut River. We \nauthorize $30 million for modifications to existing Corps dams on the \nConnecticut River to regulate flow and temperature to mitigate impacts \non aquatic habitat and fisheries. The bill also includes a $20 million \nauthorization for ecosystem restoration on the Upper Connecticut River \nand $5 million for a wetlands restoration partnership.\n  Finally, the WRDA bill includes both nationwide and Vermont-specific \nprograms for small dam remediation, removal, and rehabilitation. I \nauthored a continuing authority for small dams that allows $25 million \nto be used for small dam removal or rehabilitation. I joined my \ncolleagues, Senators Kerry and Kennedy, as a cosponsor of this \nprovision as a stand-alone bill, S. 1887. In addition, the existing \nVermont dams remediation authority is expanded to allow for measures to \nrestore, protect, and preserve an ecosystem affected by one of the dams \nincluded in the program.\n  When I first took over as chairman of this Committee in 2001, I \nstarted working with the State of Vermont to identify how we could get \nthe Corps more involved in Vermont. At first blush, this seemed \ncounterintuitive to me, and to many Vermonters. After all, early on in \nmy career as the States attorney general, I led efforts to derail \nseveral major flood control dams proposed by the Corps for the Moose \nRiver, White River, and Saxtons River.\n  Did we really want to open the door again? At the time, my answer \nwas, and still remains, a guarded yes.\n  In my opening statement when WRDA reached the Senate floor on \nTuesday, I referenced some of the reforms contained in the underlying \nbill as well as some of the amendments proposed by Senator Feingold \nthat will further improve the Corps. However, over the last 30 years, \nthe Corps has made much progress. Ecosystem restoration is a defined \nmission area. Continuing authorities programs allow small-scale \nprojects, like the ones usually found in Vermont, to proceed without \nthe excessive bureaucracy that smallest States tend to dread.\n  Beginning in 2003, I held a series of annual workshops with the New \nEngland and the New York districts, the State of Vermont, and local \nstakeholders at multiple locations in Vermont. The first year we were \nin Bennington, Norwich, and Barrer, and the second year we were in \nNorwich and Burlington.\n  The projects included in this bill for Vermont are a direct result of \nthose workshops, and I thank everyone who helped make them possible. \nSpecifically, I thank LTC Brian Green, Acting New England District \nCommander; John Kennelly, Chief of Planning, and Bobby Byrne, Chief of \nPrograms and Civil Project Management with the New England District.\n  With the New York District, I thank COL John O'Dowd, the former \nDistrict Commander; COL Richard Polo, the current District Commander; \nGene Brickman, Deputy Chief of the Planning Division; Paul Tumminello, \nthe Waterbury Dam Project Manager; and Jason Shea, the Lake Champlain \nBasin Program Coordinator.\n  In addition, from the North Atlantic Division, BG Bo Temple, the \nformer Division Commander; Joseph Vietri, the Planning Director; and \nStuart Piken, the former Project Management Chief at Division and the \ncurrent New York District Deputy District Engineer for Project \nManagement.\n  Finally, I thank Rob Vining, formerly with Army Corps Headquarters.\n  Mr. President, I especially thank my colleagues on the EPW Committee, \nparticularly Senators Baucus, Bond, and Inhofe, for working with me on \nthese critical priorities, and I look forward to the enactment of the \nWater Resources Development Act of 2006.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have been advised by both sides a voice \nvote would suffice on this measure. Many Members want to be recorded, \nbut if we all speak loudly we can do that without going through the \ntime of a rollcall vote.\n  I suggest to my colleague from Vermont, if his side is happy with it, \nwe accept a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 2864; all after the enacting \nclause is stricken, and the text of S. 728, as amended, is inserted in \nlieu thereof, and the bill is read the third time.\n  The question is, Shall it pass?\n  The bill (H.R. 2864), as amended, was passed as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 2864\n\n         Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 2864) entitled ``An Act to provide for the conservation \n     and development of water and related resources, to authorize \n     the Secretary of the Army to construct various projects for \n     improvements to rivers and harbors of the United States, and \n     for other purposes.'', do pass with the following amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, last week a group of Senators announced \nthey had reached an agreement to open more offshore areas to oil \ndrilling. For the first time, they would allow nearby States, under \ntheir proposal, to share in the oil royalties from drilling in Federal \nwaters.\n  I have come to the floor tonight to say that while I am very hopeful \nthe Senate can come to agreement on a plan that provides significantly \nmore relief to the areas that have been ravaged by Hurricane Katrina, I \nam also hopeful that the Senate will use this opportunity to finally \naddress a current program, a current royalty relief program, that is \nout of control and is diverting billions of dollars away from the \nFederal Treasury.\n  What the Senate is going to confront, apparently next week, is the \nprospect that while there is a royalty relief program now that needs to \nbe fixed and has not been fixed, the Senate is going to start a new \nroyalty relief program.\n  Usually, the first thing you do is fix the program that is not \nworking today before you start anything else. Apparently, some would \nnot be supportive of that taking place. I am one who sees this \notherwise.\n  I also think if you can fix the current royalty relief program, where \nthe Government Accountability Office says $20 billion to possibly $60 \nbillion is being wasted, you could use that money from the current \nprogram--that even the sponsor, our respected former colleague, Senator \nBennett Johnston, says is out of control--you could use that money from \nthe current program, that wastes so much money, and get some of that to \nthese areas that have been ravaged by Katrina.\n  There were two floods, in effect, that the Congress must now \nconfront. First, we have to help rebuild the States of Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Alabama that were destroyed by the storm surge of \nAugust 29 of last year. But the second flood that needs to be stemmed \nis the flood of billions of dollars of oil royalties that have gone \ninto the pockets of the world's largest oil companies at a time when \nthey have enjoyed extraordinary profits. They have enjoyed tremendous \nprofits. We have seen extraordinary prices, and yet they continue to \nget these great subsidies.\n  As I say, if we can clean up the current royalty program, which is so \ninefficient that even its sponsor thinks is out of control, we will \nhave more money to help these flood-ravaged areas of the gulf that are \nthe legitimate concern of all of my colleagues from those States.\n  The existing oil royalty giveaways have grown over the years to \nbecome the biggest oil subsidy of all and one of the largest \nboondoggles that wastes taxpayer money of any Federal program.\n  The General Accountability Office estimates that at a minimum the \nFederal Government and the taxpayers are going to be out $20 billion in \nlost revenues. If the Government loses pending lawsuits, that amount \ncould reach as high as $80 billion. This comes at a time when, \naccording to the Congressional Research Service, the oil companies are \nenjoying record profits.\n  It will be very difficult to explain to the American public how \nCongress can be proposing to allow additional billions of dollars of \nroyalty money to be given away before it first puts a stop to what is \nalready going out the door.\n  Now, in opening this discussion tonight--I expect the Senate will \nlook at this formally next week--I want to be very clear in saying that \nI understand the need of the gulf States to secure Federal funds to \nrestore their coastlines and rebuild their communities. There is no \nquestion that Katrina and Rita flattened New Orleans and other \ncommunities up and down the gulf coast, and that there is a clear need \nfor all Americans, including my constituents at home in Oregon, to be \npart of going to bat for our fellow Americans.\n  But I do hope, fervently, that as the Senate looks to find additional \nresources for these gulf States, the Senate will not be given a false \nchoice between either aiding the gulf States or standing up for the \npublic interest in the face of the outrageous oil company windfalls now \nbeing paid for today. We can and should do both.\n  Helping the victims of Katrina is not mutually exclusive from helping \ntaxpayers. It is possible to do both. And as\n\n[[Page S7895]]\n\nI have outlined, if you clean up the oil royalty giveaway that is on \nthe books today, that is so inefficient, you can take those dollars and \ngive some of them to folks in the gulf States that are suffering.\n  Mr. President, my seatmate, Senator Landrieu, for whom I have the \ngreatest respect, is from the great State of Louisiana, and she and \nother colleagues from the gulf States have come to the floor again and \nagain and again to describe eloquently the devastation their States \nhave faced from these hurricanes. Senator Landrieu has been a tireless \nadvocate for her State. They have made a compelling case why Congress \nand the American people ought to provide real assistance to these \ncommunities.\n\n  Like my colleagues, like Senators of both parties, I want to help the \nhurricane victims in the gulf rebuild. But I also do not want to \ncontinue wasting taxpayer money in unnecessary giveaways to oil \ncompanies that have been raking in gushers of cash in the past few \nyears.\n  As I indicated earlier when we talked about this subject at length on \nthe floor of the Senate, the mistakes that were made in the current \nroyalty relief program have been bipartisan. Certainly, the Clinton \nadministration muffed the ball back in the 1990s when they did not step \nin and put a solid price threshold on this program. That caused a \nsignificant amount of money to be given away. But the mistakes made by \nthe Clinton administration were compounded by Secretary Gale Norton in \nthe Bush administration, and also by the Congress in the energy bill, \nwhich continued to sweeten the current royalty relief program.\n  So citizens and taxpayers have a bit of history: The current oil \nroyalty relief program, which is such a colossal waste of taxpayer \nmoney, began when oil was $19 a barrel, and has been continuing at a \ntime when oil has been well over $70 a barrel.\n  So I think it is important for the Senate to look at ways to provide \nadditional help to the needs of the gulf States without turning a blind \neye to this boondoggle that is on the books today--the oil royalty \ngiveaway program that came about in the 1990s.\n  A possible solution to the current predicament is to use some of the \nmoney from the program, which does not work, to try to provide an \nadditional boost of funding for the gulf States at present. Reforming \nthe current royalty program could provide more money for areas hit by \nhurricanes and possibly other urgent priorities.\n  As long as we are on that subject, I would very much like to see some \nof the money that now goes to this inefficient oil royalty giveaway \nprogram used for the Secure Rural Schools legislation that is so \nimportant in my home State and much of the West and the South.\n  The oil companies are supposed to pay royalties to the Federal \nGovernment when they extract oil from Federal lands. But in order to \nstimulate production of oil in our country--this was back when oil was \n$19 a barrel--the Federal Government has been giving oil producers what \nhas been known as royalty relief for some period of time.\n  Royalty relief is a nice way of saying that the oil companies are \ntaking something from the American people without paying for it. That \nrelief now amounts to billions of taxpayer dollars that are given away \nto companies that do not need them.\n  In fact, the President has said that with the price of oil at $55 a \nbarrel, companies do not need incentives at all to drill for oil. That \nis the President of the United States, not some anti-oil advocate. The \nPresident of the United States has said that you do not need incentives \nwith the price of oil above $55 a barrel. In fact, with prices shooting \nup to more than $75 a barrel--more than $20 higher than the price the \nPresident said meant there should not be any subsidies--I do not see \nhow you can make a case at all for the current out-of-control oil \nroyalty giveaway.\n  I am not the only person who is making this argument. For example, in \nMay, a few weeks after I spent about 5 hours on the floor talking about \nthis program, the other body, the House, held a historic vote to put an \nend to taxpayer-funded royalty giveaways to profitable oil companies. \nThe House of Representatives, the other body, voted overwhelmingly, on \na bipartisan basis, to put a stop to this waste of taxpayer dollars.\n  So what I spent 5 hours talking about on the floor of the Senate \nearlier this year--and Senators were saying: What is the point of this? \nWhat are going to be the implications? I think it is important to note \nthat a few weeks after I took that time on the floor of this great \nbody, the other body voted overwhelmingly to cut these unnecessary \nsubsidies.\n  Even officials in the oil industry are saying that you cannot make a \ncase for this multibillion-dollar subsidy at this time. The architect \nof the program, our respected former colleague, Senator Bennett \nJohnston, has said that what has taken place with respect to the \nroyalty relief program is far removed from what he had in mind when he \nwrote the program.\n  Now, I believe the Senate ought to have another opportunity to debate \nand vote on the oil royalty issue, just as the other body did this \nspring. I was unable, earlier this year, despite being close to 5 hours \non the floor, to even get an up-or-down vote on my proposal to stop \nladling out tens of billions of dollars of unnecessary subsidies to the \noil industry.\n  It seems to me if the U.S. Senate is going to vote on a new royalty \nscheme that will involve, again, enormous sums of money, the Senate \ncertainly should have the opportunity to vote on reforming the existing \nprogram at that time.\n  We are, of course, in the middle of the summer driving season. This \nis a time of the year when our citizens drive more, as they go on \nsummer vacations, when demand for gas goes up, and when prices at the \npump continue to escalate. I am sure our citizens, who are now facing \nthe highest gas prices ever at this time of the year, will be \ninterested to know when the Senate will have a chance to vote on the \nquestion of whether, at this time of record prices, oil companies \nmaking record profits should continue to get record taxpayer subsidies \nin the form of royalty relief.\n  Along with several colleagues, I have written to the distinguished \nmajority leader asking for the Senate to hold an up-or-down vote on \nending royalty relief to profitable oil companies before the August \nrecess. I will continue to press for a floor vote on reforming the oil \nroyalty program at the earliest possible opportunity. I am going to do \neverything I can to see that this vote happens in a fashion that will \nexpedite aid to the people and communities in the Gulf States who await \nour best efforts.\n  It is my understanding that the legislation to open up more offshore \nareas to oil drilling will come up under expedited procedures next \nweek. I am going to work with colleagues who I know have a great \ninterest in this. I have already spoken with Senator Kyl, for example, \nwho helped me greatly when we tried to roll back the oil royalty \nprogram earlier this year. I have also spoken with Senators Lott and \nLandrieu and Chairman Domenici. I will continue to have those \ndiscussions. I simply wanted to take the time tonight, with the Senate \nhaving completed business for the week, to go through some of the \nimplications of this offshore oil drilling program that will be debated \nnext week.\n  What it comes down to is, before you start a brandnew program that \nwill involve vast sums, you ought to clean up one that is on the books \ntoday and is currently out of control, wasting billions of dollars, \naccording to the Government Accountability Office. Secondly, if you \nclean up the program that doesn't work today, you save some dollars and \nyou can apply them to those devastated gulf States which have such a \ngreat need.\n  I intend to talk about this further next week. I do think it is time \nfor the Senate to start thinking about the implications of what happens \nif you start a new program and you haven't fixed the one on the books \ntoday that even its author thinks is completely out of control and far \nremoved from what he intended.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today we have the opportunity to do \nsomething very important for a precious national resource: our \nchildren.\n  We must seize this opportunity and approve H.R. 4472, the Adam Walsh \nChild Protection and Safety Act of 2006.\n\n[[Page S7896]]\n\n  As the father of six and the grandfather of 22, and about to be 23, \nmy heart reaches out to parents whose children become the victims of \nsexual predators.\n  I cannot imagine what a nightmare that must be.\n  And as a legislator, I want to assure those parents that we are doing \nall we can to make certain this never happens again.\n  I am very confident that due to passing this legislation, there will \nbe fewer sex offender victims in America, and fewer sex offenders \nroaming free.\n  This bill has enjoyed vast bipartisan support. When Senator Biden and \nI first introduced the legislation in the Senate, in the form of S. \n1086 the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act--42 Senators \nquickly signed on as cosponsors.\n  In particular, I thank for their support my colleague from Utah, Bob \nBennett, and Senator Grassley. I also thank Representative Mark Foley \nwho introduced a companion bill in the House and Chairman Jim \nSensenbrenner, who moved this through the House Judiciary Committee.\n  Majority Leader Bill Frist and Speaker Hastert are to be applauded \nfor coming together to make sure this bill passed. I thank them all.\n  Technology of the 21st century, such as DNA testing, has empowered \nlaw enforcement to identify, prosecute, and punish sex offenders--the \nmost despicable of criminals--as never before.\n  But advanced technology has also empowered sexual predators in way \nthat outrages and disgusts me.\n  Some have compared the Internet to an ``open game preserve'' where \nsex offenders can prey on vulnerable children, meeting them in chat \nrooms and luring them into horrible situations.\n  Pedophiles use the web to hunt our children; now we will start using \nthe web to hunt down sexual predators when this bill passes.\n  Today, there are more than 500,000 registered sex offenders in the \nUnited States.\n  Unfortunately, many of them receive limited sentences and roam \ninvisibly through our communities.\n  With too many, we don't know where they are until it is too late.\n  We have tried tracking sex offenders through Web sites before, but \nthese sites are virtually useless because the information is frequently \nwrong and outdated.\n  Most offenders register once a year, by mail. Moreover, state Web \nsites do not correspond with each other, and sex offenders are under \npenalty of only a misdemeanor if they lie or just decide not to \nparticipate. There are 150,000 out there that we do not know where they \nare.\n  This bill will enhance the web technology available for tracking \nconvicted sex offenders and replace outdated, inaccurate Web sites with \nmeaningful tools to protect children.\n  It will be a searchable national Web site that interacts with state \nsites.\n  Citizens in every state will be able to inform themselves about \npredators in their communities with accurate information.\n  Under this legislation, offenders will be required to report \nregularly to the authorities in person, and let them know when they \nmove or change jobs.\n  And if they don't want to follow the rules, they will go to jail, \nbecause failure to provide truthful information will become a felony.\n  Those who break such a sacred trust and harm our children, no matter \nwho they are, where they are from, or where they commit their crime, \nwill have obligations under this law to make their whereabouts known \nvoluntarily or subject themselves to additional prison time.\n  The bill also provides money to put tracking devices on high-risk sex \noffenders who are released from jail. If we convict these monsters, we \ncan't lose track of them.\n  These are all common-sense solutions to a dark and horrible problem \nin our society.\n  We have all heard with horror the tales of sexual predators.\n  One of those tales that has captured national headlines comes from my \nhome state of Utah. Elizabeth Smart, then a 14-year-old girl, was \nkidnapped from her home in 2002. Miraculously, she was rescued nine \nmonths later.\n  Since then, she and her father, Ed Smart, have vigorously labored on \nbehalf of sex-crime victims and laws to help them, including this law.\n  Ed and Elizabeth have joined me in the Senate today. I thank them \npublicly, both for standing up and for fighting back. It means so much \nto all of us.\n  I have come to know and love them both, and I am grateful for the \ndevotion they have shown for the children of this country.\n  This bill will call for the creation of a new office within the \nDepartment of Justice--called the SMART Office--the Director of which \nwill be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. SMART \nis an acronym which represents the reaffirmed efforts of the Justice \nDepartment to, Sentence--Monitor--Apprehend--Register--and Track, sex \noffenders. It is also named after Elizabeth Smart.\n  I thank the Department of Justice for their commitment to the issues \nof sex offenders, child pornography and the creation of the SMART \nOffice--and I want to, again, thank the Smart family for their active \nparticipation in this debate and for helping to move this bill forward.\n  This legislation is truly ``smart'' legislation.\n  Also included in this legislation are child protection provisions \nfirst introduced in the House by Representative Mike Pence, and which I \nintroduced here in the Senate.\n  This legislation will help prevent children from participating in the \nproduction of sexually explicit material.\n  It strengthens current law by requiring producers of sexually \nexplicit material to keep records regarding the identity and age of \nperformers.\n  I thank the Senator from Kansas, Senator Brownback, who was this \nbill's original cosponsor, and the 29 other Senators, on both sides of \nthe aisle, who joined as cosponsors of this bill.\n  As my colleagues are aware, Congress previously approved the PROTECT \nAct of 2003 against the backdrop of Department of Justice regulations \napplying recordkeeping statutes to both primary and secondary \nproducers.\n  Along with the act's specific reference to the regulatory definition \nthat existed at the time, this signaled Congress's agreement with the \nDepartment's view that it already had the authority to regulate \nsecondary producers.\n  A Federal court in Colorado, however, recently enjoined the \nDepartment from enforcing the statute against secondary producers, a \ndecision that conflicted with a DC court ruling on this point.\n  Title V of the Adam Walsh Act will eliminate any doubt that the \nrecordkeeping statute applies to both primary and secondary producers. \nIt clearly expresses Congress's agreement with the Department's \nregulatory approach and gives the Department the tools to enforce the \nstatute.\n  I want to thank the American press corps for the attention it has \ngiven to this issue. News outlets have diligently raised the American \npublic's awareness of the grave threat posed by today's sexual \npredators. And the press have followed the lead of John Walsh, host of \n``America's Most Wanted.'' He and his wife, Reve, have waited nearly 25 \nyears for the passage of this bill.\n  Next Thursday, July 27, 2006, marks 25 years since the abduction and \nmurder of their son Adam. And on that 25th anniversary, it is our hope \nthe President will sign into law legislation that will help law \nenforcement do what John has been doing all along--hunt down predators \nand criminals.\n  Ernie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children, along with Robbie Callaway, John Libonati, and \nCarolyn Atwell-Davis were also very prominent spokespeople for this \nlegislation, and I want to personally thank them.\n  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children is one of the \nunsung heroes in the efforts to stop the abduction, exploitation, and \nmurder of children. Their staff works long hours, and their commitment \nto stopping child pornography and sexual assault against kids is hard \nto match.\n  I am grateful that the Senate will soon act on this bill. In the \npreamble to our Nation's great Constitution, we the people promise to \nestablish justice, promote the general welfare, and provide for the \ncommon defense. There is no defense more sacred, nor welfare more \nprecious, than those of our children.\n\n[[Page S7897]]\n\n  Currently, we track library books in this country better than we do \nsex offenders. With this measure, however, law enforcement will have \nthe best means possible to protect our Nation's most precious national \nresource: our children.\n  Now, I appreciate the help of all of my colleagues. I certainly \nappreciate this time from the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma \nbecause I wanted to make this statement, and this was a good time to \nmake it. I am grateful to him for providing the time. I yield back the \nremainder of my time and ask everybody in the Senate to vote for this \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/19/senate-section/article/S7897-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7897-S7898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      VIOLENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise to speak about the situation in \nthe Middle East. As we have seen, the missiles are continuing to fly, \nthe fighting continues, the situation gets volatile. This morning, \nanother Hezbollah rocket attack--this time on Nazareth--caused the \ndeath of two more Israelis. So it is vitally important that we \nseriously discuss this issue.\n  Israel and its immediate neighbor Lebanon are in a state of peril \nthat concerns the entire world. If I had one point to make this \nmorning, it is this: President Bush is correct to fully support Israel \nin her effort to bring peace, to bring the soldiers home, to prevent \nmissiles from flying on the northern fifth of Israel.\n  Mr. President, 1.2 million people are living in shelters. That is a \nfifth of the entire population. Israel has an inherent right as a \nsovereign nation not only to secure her borders but to defend herself \nfrom outside attack. I am urging the President to continue to stand \ntall and give Israel the space she needs, the time she needs, to defend \nherself and make sure that these missiles cannot continue to rain down \nupon her people at Hezbollah's will.\n  There is a great deal of pressure from the European community and \nfrom others that Israel should not be given the ability to defend \nherself. In short, if we were to prevent Israel from doing everything \nshe could to stop these rockets from flying down on her people, we \nwould be back where we are now 3 months, 6 months, a year from now, in \nthe same situation.\n  So should there be peace and negotiations? Yes. Might it be possible \neventually to have an international force in southern Lebanon? Perhaps, \nalthough many of us who believe in Israel are worried about that force \nbecause in the past it has not stopped terrorist attacks on Israel. But \nat the moment, we cannot allow the status quo to continue, where a \nmilitant terrorist organization, Hezbollah, has the ability to rain \ntorture down on the northern part of Israel.\n  Israel must be allowed to defend herself like any nation. Can you \nimagine if some group were operating in Canada and continued to fire \nmissiles at Buffalo and Detroit and Minneapolis and Seattle? Would the \nrest of the world tell the U.S. ``show restraint'' even though every \nnight a hundred missiles came down on the cities, even though millions \nof people might be living in shelters? Of course not.\n  Every country has the right to defend herself. Israel is no \nexception. I salute President Bush for understanding that and hope he \ncontinues on that course because any other course, any appeasement of \nHezbollah, will lead to this same sorry situation repeating itself.\n  Let's be clear: The state of Israel is not an aggressor here. Israel \nhas stated over and over again its desire to live in peace with the \nArab world. It is Israel's policy to allow a Palestinian state. And \nthere are some in the Palestinian and Arab world who agree with it. But \nthere are some who do not.\n  Hezbollah believes Israel has no right to exist, not simply in the \nWest Bank and Gaza but in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem and Ashdod and \nAshkelon. And Hezbollah has said they will do all they can to eradicate \nthe state of Israel. Hezbollah is the aggressor.\n  I feel deeply for those who are injured, both Israeli and Lebanese, \nboth Jew and Arab. But the Lebanese Government also has an obligation \nhere; that is, not to allow terrorists to operate on her soil. I was so \npleased to see that Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Arab world \nunderstand that Hezbollah is the provocateur here. But the world must \nunite against terrorism. The sad lesson we learn is that if terrorism \nis first directed at one country, it will inevitably spread, unless we \nhave a strong, united world against terrorism.\n  In this case, Israel is not the aggressor. She is defending herself \nagainst an unlawful incursion into her borders by the terrorist \norganization Hezbollah. Hezbollah has rockets, and they shoot \nindiscriminately at civilians. Israel, on the other hand, in defending \nherself, goes out of her way and sacrifices the lives of her soldiers \nnot to punish and hurt civilians. It is awfully difficult when people \nstore missiles in their garages and in their homes.\n  But all Israel asks for is the ability to defend herself. To create \nsome moral equivalency between Israel's response to these rocket \nattacks and the terrorist attacks themselves is, in my opinion, \nimmoral. What other country would allow it? Would Prime Minister Chirac \nstand for restraint if missiles rained from Switzerland to Lyon? Would \nPresident Putin ask for restraint? Why he asks for restraint against \nterrorists in the Middle East but asks for world support against \nterrorists in Chechnya is beyond me. He seems to have a double \nstandard.\n  Would any country simply watch as dozens of its own citizens were \nkilled, countless more injured, the whole nation frantic with fear and \nuncertainty? No, of course not. Every nation would respond with \nstrength and do everything it could to eradicate the terrorists. And \nthat is just what Israel is doing now.\n  Prime Minister Olmert has publicly called for peace. He is right to \ndo so. Israel did not seek out this conflict and does not seek its \ncontinuance. But neither will nor should Israel back down and simply \nallow Hezbollah to continue its reign of terror over Israel and its \ncitizens at any time of its choosing.\n  So this is a sad situation. Lebanon's entire population is paying the \nprice for Hezbollah's outrageous actions. The Prime Minister, Siniora, \nsaid in a statement:\n\n       Lebanon cannot grow and develop if the government is the \n     last to know and yet the first to pay the price.\n\n  The great mistake was allowing Hezbollah into the government and then \nallowing them free reign in southern Lebanon. It should not be a \nmistake that Lebanon repeats, and it should not be a mistake to which \nthe world acquiesces.\n  Lebanese Prime Minister Siniora has called for his government to \nassert ``sovereignty in all Lebanese territory.'' I agree with this. \nYou cannot have a terrorist separate nation living within your nation \nand then disclaim any responsibility and blame the country that is \nsimply defending itself against terror.\n  As I said, I welcome the stance of Saudi Arabia and Egypt and Jordan \nand Kuwait, which characterized Hezbollah's actions as ``unexpected, \ninappropriate and irresponsible.'' This is a welcome stance, a new \nstance. But talk is cheap. We should hold the Arab League's feet to the \nfire and pressure them to take concrete steps that will force Hezbollah \nto stop its attacks and return the captured soldiers.\n  In short, our President is doing the right thing. Americans of all \npolitical philosophies and all parties back him in doing it. Our plea, \nMr. President: Stay the course. Continue strong. Let Israel, who does \nnot ask for United States troops or United States casualties in any \nway--defend herself. All she needs is the support of the world to help \nher fight terrorism, a terrorism which could afflict any one of our \nnations.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I think this may be the first time I \nhave had occasion to stand on the floor and associate myself with the \nremarks of the distinguished Senator from New York. I appreciate his \nthoughtful remarks.\n\n\n                      PRESIDENT'S VETO OF H.R. 810\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I just watched the President of the United \nStates veto the bill that passed here yesterday by 63 votes, the bill \nto provide that our scientists in this country, under the guidance of \nthe National Institutes of Health, could conduct lifesaving research on \nembryonic stem cells, with strong ethical guidelines.\n\n[[Page S7898]]\n\n  I will mince no words about the President's action and the words he \nused. I think this veto is a shameful display of cruelty and hypocrisy \nand ignorance. It is cruel because it denies hope to millions of \nAmericans who suffer from Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, ALS, juvenile \ndiabetes, and spinal cord injuries.\n  The best scientists in the world, overwhelmingly--including dozens of \nNobel Prize winners, every director at the National Institutes of \nHealth--say that embryonic stem cell research offers enormous potential \nto ease human suffering.\n  I think this veto displays some hypocrisy. The President describes it \nas immoral, yet himself provided funding for it in 2001. How is it that \nfor those stem cells derived before 9 p.m. August 9, 2001, it is moral \nto do research on them, but it is immoral to do research on any stem \ncells after that? Please, explain that, Mr. President.\n  Quite frankly, I think this is a shameful display of ignorance about \nwhat stem cell research is. His spokesman today, Mr. Snow, said we are \nnot going to kill these embryos to provide life to someone else. What a \nshameful display of ignorance. These cells are not killed. They are \nkept alive. These stem cells are kept alive to grow tissue and heart \nmuscle, nerve muscle, reconnect spinal cords. If you kill them, they \ncannot do that. What sheer ignorance was on display by Mr. Snow this \nmorning when he said that.\n  So, Mr. President, I will have more to say about this later. I only \nhave a few minutes now. But I think what the President did is to \ncondemn millions of Americans to suffering--needless suffering--and to \ntake away the hope so many people have that this research could ease \ntheir suffering. I think it was a shameful display.\n  I congratulate the Senate which, in a bipartisan effort--63 votes--\npassed H.R. 810 yesterday. Now the President has vetoed it. We cannot \nbring it up again this year. But I can assure you that this Senate will \ntake it up next January. We will be back, Mr. President. We will be \nback, and we will have more Senators next year willing to stand up--\nwilling to stand up--against ignorance and hypocrisy and cruelty, more \nSenators who will stand up for embryonic stem cell research and help \nthose who are suffering in our society. We will be back next January, \nand we will pass it again. And if this President vetoes it again, we \nwill override it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to respond to the Senator from Iowa \nvery briefly.\n  I voted with the majority. I think we ought to give the President of \nthe United States credit for a firmly based, knowledgeable position on \nthis issue. Reasonable people can disagree on this issue. I think the \ndebate generally that we had was good for America, but I respect the \nPresident's right to carry out his responsibilities as he sees fit. An \nexercise of a veto is within the President's authority.\n  I disagree with the President on this issue, but I respect his views \nand I respect his right to act as he feels is in the Nation's interest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/19/senate-section/article/S7898-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7898-S7899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO WINTHROP PAUL ROCKEFELLER\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from West Virginia \nand my colleagues from Oklahoma and Vermont for allowing us this \nopportunity.\n  Today I rise to pay tribute to one of Arkansas' great public \nservants, business leaders, and philanthropists, our Lieutenant \nGovernor, Winthrop Paul Rockefeller. Winthrop passed away quietly last \nSunday after a period of illness. Words can hardly express the sense of \nloss we in Arkansas feel at the passing of Winthrop.\n  Everyone has heard of the Rockefeller name, there is no doubt. It is \nrenowned the world over. Truth be told, Win could have used that name \nand the family fortune to do whatever he wanted or nothing at all. Many \nin similar circumstances have chosen to indulge themselves in personal \nexcess. But not Win. He chose to live the life of a servant.\n  He had a plaque placed at his home on Petit Jean Mountain in Arkansas \nthat really sums up how he lived and what he believed. The plaque \nquoted Micah, chapter 6, verse 8:\n\n       He has showed us, O man, what is good. And what does the \n     Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy, and to \n     walk humbly with thy God.\n\n  All through his life, you see evidence of his desire to live out that \nScripture. He was compassionate and thoughtful. He showed a strong love \nfor his fellow man and a commitment to leaving this world a better \nplace than he found it. Part of that commitment was expressed through \nhis work at Little Rock-based Winrock International--one of the world's \nleading incubators of economic progress for developing economies.\n  His work there not only has had a profound impact on 107 nations \nspread across the globe but also has impacted Arkansas' rural areas as \nwell. I have worked closely with Winrock International on many of those \ninitiatives and have been proud to do so.\n  His Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation has also helped enrich the \nquality of life for rural America, particularly in the area of home \nownership in my home area; that is, the Mississippi Delta.\n  He also strongly believed in developing the potential in our young \npeople. One of his favorite organizations was the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica. He served on the executive board of the National Council, and \nhe was president of the Quapaw Area Council in 1997 and thereafter was \na vice president. He also founded a program called Books in the Attic \nin which Boy Scouts could collect used books to distribute to families. \nMost importantly, however, he served for many years as an assistant \nScoutmaster for Troop 12, and he attended Scout camp with his son \nregularly, as well as Scout meetings.\n  Win was also the father of two special needs children. His desire to \nsee them and others like them succeed in life moved him to open a \nschool for differently abled children called the Academy at Riverdale \nin Little Rock. This is just another example of the kind of heart he \npossessed.\n  Throughout his lifetime, Win also served in charitable organizations \nin many ways. The list is long, but some of the charities include the \nArkansas State Police Commission, the President's Council on Rural \nAmerica, and on and on. He served as a Texas Christian University \ntrustee and was on the national boards of Ducks Unlimited, and the \nNature Conservancy.\n  He served on the boards of the Arkansas Cancer Research Center and \nthe Arkansas Arts Center Foundation. He was a trustee of the Winthrop \nRockefeller Charitable Trust and Rockefeller Foundation.\n  In his spare time he was one of the finest Lieutenant Governors the \nState of Arkansas has ever known.\n  As I close paying tribute to this thoughtful, kind man, I am reminded \nof the story of David. He was looked upon as the most unlikely of men \nto become king of Israel. In the same way, it was easy for many to \nbelieve that they could look at outward things--Win's money perhaps, \nfamily connections, and his status--and draw conclusions about who he \nwas.\n  But, as with David, man looks on the outside but God looks in the \nheart. Win's heart was always in the proper place, a faithful place. I \ntruly believe that his heart has now found its rightful place in the \nhands of his King.\n  My condolences go out to his lovely wife Lisenne, his three daughters \nand five sons, to his extended family and my very dear friend and \ncolleague, Senator Jay Rockefeller, and I pray the Lord will keep this \nentire Rockefeller family in this time of grief.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to yield to my colleague from the great \nState of Arkansas, Senator Pryor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, we lost a great Arkansan this week and also \na great American. I rise today to give tribute to Winthrop Paul \nRockefeller.\n  When I think of Win Paul, I think of a man who demonstrated \nthroughout the course of his life great faith, courage, and humility. \nHe was a friend to me, but he was a friend to thousands of people \naround our State and around our Nation. He set a high standard for \npublic service and for philanthropy and a high standard for leadership. \nIn fact, he is one of those people who, regardless of his station in \nlife, even had he\n\n[[Page S7899]]\n\nbeen born without a penny to his name, would have been selfless, and he \nwould have lived a sacrificial life just as he did.\n  He has done so many great things for the State of Arkansas, for the \ncountry and for the world. Let me just name a few of the charities that \nhe has been deeply involved with: The Boy Scouts of America, Project \nChildSave, the Arkansas Literary Festival, the President's Council on \nRural America, the Bill Fish Foundation, Ducks Unlimited, the Nature \nConservancy, the Arkansas Coalition for Juvenile Justice--to name just \na few.\n  He has helped so many people along the way. He has inspired people \nwith the time he spent with them but also with his generosity.\n  I experienced that when I was about 10 or so years old. My father was \nthe newly elected Governor of Arkansas and Win Paul walked in, a young \nman, and on the spot he bought for the Governor's mansion and gave to \nthe State of Arkansas a new stove for the kitchen because he thought \nthat Liza Jane Ashley, the cook at Governor's mansion, should not have \nto labor over that old, dilapidated stove she had. That is the way he \nwas. We will never know the thousand acts of kindness he did for \npeople.\n  I have to single out one organization that he loved so much and he is \nclosely identified with in Arkansas and that is the Boy Scouts. He was \ninvolved in that organization for 30 years, and he led by example. The \nBoy Scouts' motto is ``Be prepared.'' I think that Win Paul Rockefeller \nwas always prepared to help his fellow man. He was always looking for \nways to be of service. The Boy Scouts' slogan is ``Do a good turn \ndaily,'' and certainly he lived by that and lived by a very deep faith. \nHe demonstrated his faith every single day that we all knew him.\n  Like my colleague from Arkansas, we extend our prayers to Lisenne, \ntheir children, and to Jay Rockefeller and the entire Rockefeller \nfamily and all of their friends and all the people they have touched. \nWe just want to say we know that he is in a better place. We know that \nhe has been greeted at the Pearly Gates with open arms.\n  We will truly miss Winthrop Paul Rockefeller.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the full \ncommittee and ranking member for their generosity in allowing, \nhopefully, 15 minutes for eulogizing Win Paul. Win Paul was my first \ncousin. I think people need to know, he died from a really horrible \nform of cancer. We knew it was going to be difficult. He went to \nSeattle to get a variety of bone marrow transplants, and wasn't going \nanywhere. So, in effect, he came back to Arkansas, his home. In many \nways like his father, in some ways under the shadow of his father, but \nin all ways committed to the people of Arkansas.\n  He originally came back to Arkansas at the age of 24 when his father \ndied. He wanted to do good. When I think about him, I just think of his \ndesire to be helpful to people. Both of my colleagues from Arkansas \nmentioned his relations, working with the Boy Scouts. One thing he was \nreally proud of is that he racially integrated the Little Rock Boy \nScouts, so that there were two sides.\n  I feel a great sense of loss personally as his first cousin, who knew \nhim very well. He had a great affinity for Arkansas, which is a State \nthat I love because it is very much like West Virginia.\n  He had a wonderful family, eight children. Several of them have very \ndifficult developmental disabilities. He has, for that reason, and I \nthink because of his general humanity, poured himself into people who \ndo have developmental problems. Both Senators from Arkansas mentioned \nthe Riverdale Academy, which I think tripled in size since it was \nfounded in 2004.\n  He was ultimately a Lieutenant Governor who wanted to be Governor to \ndo what all Governors want to do, which is to live out their vision, \nmake his vision for Arkansas come true. He didn't have that chance. He \ngracefully withdrew from the race when it became evident to him that \nthings weren't going to be very good in terms of his health. He came \nback to Arkansas a very, very sick person to die, to his home and to \nhis God.\n  I am going to miss him. I thank my colleagues for indulging in this \nmoment of thought about a family member to me and a political leader \nand friend to my two beloved colleagues from Arkansas.\n  He will be at home in Heaven.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/19/senate-section/article/S7899-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRESIDENTIAL REPORT\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter \nfrom the President of the United States be printed in the Record today \npursuant to the war powers resolution.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     President pro tempore of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Hostilities involving Israeli military \n     forces and Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon commenced on July \n     12, 2006, and have included military operations in the \n     vicinity of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut.\n       Although there is no evidence that Americans are being \n     directly targeted, the security situation has deteriorated \n     and now presents a potential threat to American citizens and \n     the U.S. Embassy. On July 14, the Department of State first \n     requested Department of Defense assistance to support the \n     departure of American citizens from Lebanon. On July 15, U.S. \n     military helicopters temporarily deployed to Cyprus. On July \n     16, these combat-equipped helicopters delivered to U.S. \n     Embassy, Beirut, a contingent of U.S. military personnel who \n     will assist in planning and conducting the departure from \n     Lebanon of U.S. Embassy personnel and citizens and designated \n     third country personnel. The helicopters also transported \n     U.S. citizens from Beirut to Cyprus. It is expected that \n     these helicopters will continue to provide support to the \n     Embassy, including for the departure of additional personnel \n     from Lebanon. It is likely that additional combat-equipped \n     U.S. military forces may be deployed to Lebanon and Cyprus \n     and other locations, as necessary, in order to support \n     further efforts to assist in the departure of persons from \n     Lebanon and to provide security.\n       These actions are being undertaken solely for the purpose \n     of protecting American citizens and property. United States \n     forces will redeploy as soon as it is determined that the \n     threat to U.S. citizens and property has ended and the \n     departure of any persons, as necessary, is completed.\n       I have taken this action pursuant to my constitutional \n     authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations and as Commander \n     in Chief and Chief Executive. I am providing this report as \n     part of my efforts to keep the Congress informed, consistent \n     with the War Powers Resolution.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      George W.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to commend Sharon \nDaly for her more than 30 years of service to those in need. Through \nher tireless advocacy, she has truly made an important contribution to \nthe well-being of real people and has improved the character of this \nNation.\n  Most of those who have benefited from her efforts will never know her \nname or the impact that she had on their lives. That is because Sharon \nwasn't one to seek the limelight or publicity for herself. Instead, she \nhas quietly but determinedly dedicated herself to helping the most \nvulnerable among us--including those with disabilities, the homeless, \nvictims of domestic violence, disadvantaged and abused children, and \nimmigrants. Sharon's leadership and commitment truly exemplifies what \nit means to ``love you neighbor as yourself.''\n  Through her service at the Children's Foundation, the U.S. Conference \nof Catholic Bishops, the Children's Defense Fund, and most recently as \nvice president and then senior public policy advisor at Catholic \nCharities USA she has worked to make Federal programs, including the \nFood Stamps Program, Medicaid, the earned-income tax credit and many \nothers, more responsive to the needs of those facing significant \nchallenges in their lives. She helped Members of Congress and our \nstaffs understand how the support provided by these programs helps low-\nincome families and children address the ravages of poverty.\n  Sharon worked successfully on bipartisan efforts to enact the Family \nand Medical Leave Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. She also \nplayed a lead role in the enactment of a 1993 package of benefits for \nlow-income families with children, including major expansions in the \nearned-income tax credit, food stamps, immunization, and family \npreservation/child welfare services.\n\n[[Page S7900]]\n\n  Mr. President, Sharon Daly is retiring from Catholic Charities USA. \nShe will be deeply missed for her thoughtful guidance and leadership. I \nhave confidence, however, that she will remain an inspiration to those \nwho will follow in her footsteps.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/19/senate-section/article/S7900-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TEEN DRIVER SAFETY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, during the recent district work period, I \nread a front-page Chicago Tribune news article that reminded me of the \nimportance of educating young adults about driving safety. And as \nstudents in Gibson City, IL, can tell you, the story is also a \ntestament to what can be achieved through dedication, perseverance, and \nheart.\n  Summer can be a dangerous time for teen drivers, many of whom are \njust beginning to build their experience behind the wheel. In my home \nState of Illinois, July is the deadliest month for teen drivers. An \naverage of 12 Illinois teens have been killed in car accidents every \nJuly for the last 10 years. We must work to prevent these tragic losses \nby educating America's teenage drivers about driver safety.\n  The Tribune article highlighted the story of the Arends family, of \nGibson City, IL, who have turned an unimaginably heartbreaking tragedy \ninto a successful campaign to save the lives of teen drivers. Three and \na half years ago, 17-year-old twins Greg and Steve Arends were driving \nto work when Greg, the driver, lost control of the car, which slammed \nsideways into a telephone pole at 80 miles per hour. Neither boy was \nunder the influence of drugs or alcohol, and both boys' seatbelts were \nfastened, but unfortunately, Greg's side of the vehicle bore the impact \nof the crash, and he died at the hospital. Miraculously, his twin \nbrother Steve survived, thanks in part to wearing a seatbelt.\n  A year and a half after the accident, despite their immense pain and \ngrief, the Arends family responded to a call from Judy Weber-Jones, a \nteacher at the local high school, who asked if they would be willing to \nhelp launch a teen driver safety campaign in Gibson City. They agreed, \nand Steve Arends even decided to participate in presentations for his \npeers. His is a powerful message, and it is already making a difference \nin the lives of teens in Gibson City. Though the accident left Steve \nwith injuries that he is still trying to overcome, he has displayed \ngreat courage in sharing his unfortunate experience with his peers in \nCentral Illinois.\n  Over the last year and a half, the campaign at Gibson City-Melvin-\nSibley High School, called Project Ignition--License to Live, has grown \nto attract the participation of dozens of students and community \nvolunteers. The Arends family has allowed students to place pictures of \nGreg around the school and gave the group a picture of the car mangled \nin the accident. Roadside signs erected all over town read ``Slow Down. \nBuckle Up. Remember Greg and Steve.'' Students have staged mock car \naccidents and organized demonstrations with crash simulators. The group \nhas also produced videos, PowerPoint presentations, and public service \nannouncements aimed at increasing seatbelt use, reducing speeding, and \npromoting safe driving practices among teens.\n  I commend the Arends family, Ms. Weber-Jones, and all those who \ncollaborate with the Project Ignition--License to Live program for \ntheir work to save the lives of young drivers in Illinois. The \ncampaign's success has been remarkable.\n  Since the start of the Project Ignition--License to Live program, \nseatbelt use among teens at Gibson City-Melvin-Sibley High School has \nincreased at least 20 percent, the number of speeding tickets issued to \nteens has decreased by more than 70 percent, and the number of \naccidents reported to local police departments has dropped by more than \nhalf. This program is indeed saving lives. Six teens were involved in \ncar accidents this past school year, and in all six cases, the teens \nwere wearing their seatbelts and walked away with only minor injuries.\n  So what is Project Ignition--License to Live doing differently than \nother teen driver safety programs? In just a short time, this program \nhas been able to achieve levels of improvement in teen driver safety \nand accident prevention that parents, teachers, law enforcement, and \nother leaders have not been able to accomplish in decades. The most \nnotable difference is that this program is fueled by teens themselves. \nThey have found a way to package messages about wearing seatbelts, \nslowing down, and staying alert that truly resonate among their peers. \nTheirs is a model that I believe should be replicated across the \nNation.\n  The SAFETEA highway and transit bill that Congress passed 1 year ago \nincluded a provision to reward States that have passed strong primary \nseatbelt laws. Such laws allow law enforcement officials to stop, \nticket, and fine drivers for not wearing a seatbelt. My home State of \nIllinois is one of those States that have already passed a primary \nseatbelt law. In 2006, Illinois will receive a one-time payment of $30 \nmillion in Federal funds authorized by SAFETEA. I commend Illinois for \nnot only passing a primary seatbelt law that will save lives but also \nfor dedicating all of the $30 million to highway safety programs. I \nrecently sent a letter to Governor Blagojevich urging him to use the \nfunds to bolster the efforts of groups like Project Ignition License to \nLive.\n  As the example of Gibson City and the Arends family shows, young \nadults take to heart the life lessons of their peers. Therefore, \nGovernor Blagojevich and the State of Illinois would be wise to \ncoordinate with groups such as Project Ignition--License to Live so \nthat young adults can share their personal experiences and remind their \npeers to drive safe and buckle up. I urge my fellow Senators to \ncontinue to fund these important safety programs and to work with their \nState governments to pass primary seatbelt laws so that other States \ncan follow Illinois' example and make highway safety a priority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/19/senate-section/article/S7900-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         Airman Jason J.

He \njoined the Navy immediately following graduation.\n  Airman Doyle had a lifelong interest in flying and in Japanese \nculture.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of \na bipartisan bill to reauthorize the National Veterans Business \nDevelopment Corporation, commonly known as the Vets Corp. This bill, \nthe Veterans Corporation Reauthorization Act of 2006, was developed in \na cooperative fashion by members of the Small Business and Veterans \nAffairs' Committees, in conjunction with Senator Talent who was \ninvolved in the original establishment of the Vets Corp during his \ntenure in the other body.\n  The Vets Corp has a crucial mission--to foster entrepreneurship and \nbusiness opportunities for veterans, with a special focus on service-\ndisabled veterans. During this time of conflict abroad, this mission is \nextremely relevant. A seamless transition from military to civilian \nstatus requires that we give our veterans the tools necessary to \nsucceed in their post-military lives. The Vets Corp seeks to do just \nthis for veteran-owned small businesses.\n\n[[Page S7901]]\n\n  Created by Congress in 1999, the Vets Corp had a slow start. While I \nbelieve that the new Vets Corp leadership is turning things around, \nthere are some lingering concerns about the Vets Corp's funding and \nmission. I am hopeful that this legislation we are introducing today \nwill help remedy these concerns. Under the terms of the legislation, \nthe Vets Corp would be provided matching funds instead of a straight \nallocation. In addition, this bill would clarify the purpose of the \norganization as well as improve the structure of their advisory board.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill.

Mr. President, I am deeply troubled that violence in \nDarfur continues. It is disheartening to learn that the Government of \nSudan continues to serve as an obstacle to the deployment of U.N. \npeacekeeping forces that could bolster the African Union Mission in \nSudan, AMIS. While AMIS has conducted its mission to the best of its \nability, it is clear that it has neither the resources nor the mandate \nto stop the violence that is affecting the lives of millions of \ninnocent people. It remains critical that an international peacekeeping \nforce be allowed to deploy to Darfur to augment the African Union \nMission in Sudan and to establish a lasting and sustainable peace.\n  Peace in Darfur has been elusive, but it is not unattainable. The \nGovernment of Sudan must be a willing partner for peace; it must work \nwith the international community to find an acceptable and expedient \nplan to introduce peacekeeping forces to that region. Until a more \nrobust peacekeeping force can deploy to Darfur, it is important that \nthe international community support continuing AMIS efforts there. \nFinally, parties to the conflict in Darfur must also abide by the \nrecently agreed upon Darfur Peace Agreement, DPA, although it is \napparent that this peace agreement is showing signs of strain.\n  Peace in Darfur is critical for establishing a lasting and \ncomprehensive peace throughout Sudan and the region. That said, we must \nnot ignore the continuing need to press for progress on the North-South \nComprehensive Peace Agreement, CPA. The U.S. Government, with the \ninternational community and the United Nations, must continue to press \nfor progress in implementing the CPA between the north and the south of \nSudan. Unfortunately, well over a year from the signing of the CPA, it \nhas become painfully clear that various important elements of the \nagreement have yet to be implemented, let alone completed. Key issues \nconcerning land tenure rights, critical border agreements, oil revenue \nsharing, and armed militias in southern Sudan have yet to be settled or \naddressed fully.\n  While much of the lack of progress relating to the CPA relates to the \ncomplexity of the peace agreement, much of it relates to the limited \ncapacity of the Government of Southern Sudan, GOSS, to provide \neffective governance, services, and protection of its citizens. There \nremain serious obstacles to the establishment of a viable and strong \nGOSS, including a continuing lack of sufficient infrastructure \nthroughout the south and sporadic violence that disrupts various parts \nof the region. The international community must continue its support of \nSudan's CPA, which means addressing the capacity that parties to the \nagreement have to implement the agreement.\n  The U.S. Government and the international community need to be \nsustained, coordinated, and comprehensive. We cannot dismiss the \nsignificance of the linkages and impact that each of these agreements \nhave on one another, nor their significance for developing a solid \nfoundation for addressing conflict throughout the region. Successful \nimplementation of both the CPA and DPA will provide significant \nbenefits to all communities in Sudan and will set the stage for a new \nera of peace for the entire country and region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/19/senate-section/article/S7901-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7901-S7902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NATIONAL VETERANS BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. The Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business \nDevelopment Act of 1999 created the National Veterans Business \nDevelopment Corporation--The Veterans Corporation--to address gaps in \nproviding small business and entrepreneurship assistance to veterans \nand service-disabled veterans. These services are to be delivered \nthrough newly created, community-based veterans business resource \ncenters, VBRCs. The legislation authorized Federal funding through \nfiscal year 2004, with the requirement that the Corporation ``institute \nand implement a plan to raise private funds and become a self-\nsustaining corporation.''\n  While the Veterans Corporation's purpose and mission are well-\nintentioned, in practice, the Corporation has been unable to become \nself-sustaining and continues to rely on congressional appropriations. \nFurthermore, the Corporation's funding concerns have diminished its \nability to create a vibrant national network of VBRCs. The \nCorporation's struggles have led it astray from the original intent of \nthe law and hurt its delivery of services to our Nation's veterans. As \nsuch, my colleagues and I are introducing legislation to reauthorize \nthe Veterans Corporation and to improve the direction of the \nCorporation as it works to serve veteran and service-disabled veteran \nentrepreneurs.\n  Although the Veterans Corporation has fallen on hard times, its \nvision of assisting veterans with their business needs is still \nadmirable. In fact, according to the Small Business Administration, \nabout 22 percent of veterans were either purchasing or starting a new \nbusiness or considering doing so in 2004. Moreover, almost 72 percent \nof these new veteran entrepreneurs planned to employ at least one \nperson at the outset of their new venture. Supporting veterans' small \nbusiness needs has become increasingly important as soldiers begin to \nreturn from continuing U.S. military operations worldwide.\n  I have worked hard to put the Veterans Corporation on the track to \nsuccess and to support the veteran entrepreneurs and veteran-owned \nsmall businesses that it serves. I have led efforts to ensure proper \noversight of the Corporation, as well as assisted the Corporation \nthrough appropriate legislative action.\n  As Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I requested a Government Accountability Office, GAO, \nstudy, released in August 2004, to ensure that the Veterans Corporation \nwas meeting its responsibilities and the needs of our Nation's \nveterans. The GAO report concluded that the Veterans Corporation faced \na number of challenges in achieving self-sufficiency, noting that \ndramatically lower-than-expected revenues delayed the estimated date \nfor achieving self-sustaining operations from fiscal year 2004 to \nfiscal year 2009. The GAO was also concerned with the Corporation's \ndistinction as a government corporation,'' as determined by the Office \nof Management and Budget and the Department of Justice. This \ndetermination subjected the Corporation to numerous agency requirements \nand drained significant resources away from serving veterans. Again, \nthis designation inhibited the Corporation's ability to become self-\nsustaining.\n  In the fall of 2004, I introduced emergency legislation that was \npassed into law to clarify the Corporation's status as a ``quasi-\nprivate entity,'' not a ``government corporation.'' At the time, this \nlegislation relieved the 12-employee Corporation from burdensome \nFederal agency reporting requirements.\n  Following the enactment of this legislation, many of my colleagues \nand I encouraged the Corporation to work hard to get its fiscal house \nin order and to focus on reaching out to veterans in local communities, \nparticularly through VBRCs. Unfortunately, the Corporation's most \nrecent efforts to become self-sustaining have yielded insufficient \nresults. Furthermore, since its inception, the Corporation has only \nsucceeded in establishing four VBRCs. Therefore, it is appropriate to \nrestructure the corporation to meet the original intent of the law and \nto better serve our veteran entrepreneurs.\n\n[[Page S7902]]\n\n  I would like to thank Senators Kerry, Talent, and Akaka for working \ntogether with me to craft the bipartisan ``Veterans Corporation \nReauthorization Act of 2006.'' We believe that this bill will clarify \ncurrent law directing the Veterans Corporation, improve the \nCorporation's services to veterans by stressing the need to create \nVBRCs, and protecting the American taxpayer by ensuring that the \nCorporation meets its self-sustaining requirement.\n  More specifically, this legislation will focus the Corporation's \npurpose and mission to emphasize establishing a national network of \ninformation and assistance centers for use by veterans and the public.\n  This bill would strictly guide the Corporation's ability to access \npublic funds. Although the legislation would reauthorize funding at $2 \nmillion for fiscal year 2007-fiscal year 2009, the funds would be \ndirected through the Small Business Administration's Office of \nVeterans' Business Development. These funds would only be allocated to \nthe Corporation if it first matches those funds on a dollar-for-dollar \nbasis. Any funds not expended would revert back to the Treasury. \nFurthermore, there is a provision that restricts the amount of revenue \nthe Corporation can raise from fee-for-service tools or direct charge, \nto the veteran receiving services.\n  Our legislation also reinforces current law by requiring that the \nVeterans Corporation must develop a plan to become self-sustaining and \nwould add the requirement that the Corporation include an independent \naudit in its annual report to Congress, and includes a GAO audit to \nensure review and compliance.\n  Finally, the legislation will postpone the transfer of duties from \nthe SBA's Advisory Committee on Veterans Business Affairs to the \nCorporation, and improve notification of the Corporation's services to \nveterans and transitioning service members.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/19/senate-section/article/S7902-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7902-S7905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   VOTING RIGHTS ACT REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, There are few things as critical to our \nNation, and to American citizenship, as voting. Like the rights \nguaranteed by the first amendment, the right to vote is fundamental \nbecause it secures the effective exercise of all other rights. As \npeople are able to register, vote, and elect candidates of their \nchoice, their interests and rights get attention. The very legitimacy \nof our democratic Government is dependent on the access all Americans \nhave to the electoral process.\n  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 transformed the landscape of political \ninclusion. As amended, the act contains important provisions for \nlanguage assistance. Section 203, added as part of the second \nreauthorization of the Voting Rights in 1975, broadened this landscape \nby allowing millions more American citizens to participate fully in our \ndemocracy. Section 203, which requires bilingual voting assistance for \ncertain language minority groups, was enacted to remove obstacles to \nvoting posed by illiteracy and lack of bilingual language assistance \nresulting in large measure from unequal educational opportunities \navailable to minorities. These provisions helped overcome \ndiscriminatory barriers which limited access to the political process \nfor language minority groups and resulted in low turnout and \nregistration. Along with section 4(f)(4), section 203 has led to \nextraordinary gains in representation and participation made by Asian \nAmericans and Hispanic Americans.\n  Hispanic-American populations have been one of the primary minority \nlanguage groups to benefit from the protections of the bilingual \nprovisions of the Voting Rights Act. For example, effective \nimplementation of the bilingual provisions in San Diego County, CA, \nhelped increase voter registration by more than 20 percent. And voter \nturnout among Hispanic Americans in New Mexico rose 26 percent between \n2000 and 2004 after television and radio spots were aired in districts \nwith Spanish-educated listeners about voter registration and absentee \nballots. Yet more needs to be done. Historically, Hispanic Americans \nhave low voter turnout and less than 1 percent of all elected offices \nin the United States are held by Hispanic Americans.\n  I was troubled during the immigration debate that the rhetoric of \nsome Members of the Senate appeared to be anti-Hispanic in supporting \nthe adoption of an English language amendment. Senator Salazar and I \nwrote to the President following up on this provision. We asked whether \nthe President will continue to implement the language outreach policies \nof President Clinton's Executive Order No. 13166. A prompt and \nstraightforward affirmative answer would have gone a long way. Sadly, \nwe have received no response from this White House. I have, however, \nraised the matter when the opportunity presented itself with the \nSecretary of Commerce and the Attorney General and both have assured me \nthat the Bush administration will continue to adhere to the outreach \nefforts of the Clinton Executive order.\n  I understand why those efforts to amend the immigration bill to make \nEnglish the official or national language provoked a reaction and \nseemed mean-spirited to so many. It elicited the extraordinary May 19 \nletter from the League of United Latin American Citizens, the Mexican \nAmerican Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the National Association \nof Latino Elected Officials Educational Fund, the National Council of \nLa Raza and the National Puerto Rican Coalition and from a larger \ncoalition of interested parties from 96 national and local \norganizations.\n  Until that vote, in our previous 230 years we had not found it \nnecessary or wise to adopt English as our official or national \nlanguage. I believe it was in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that the \nState legislature shortly after the Revolutionary War authorized \nofficial publication of Pennsylvania's laws in German as well as \nEnglish to serve the German-speaking population of that State. We have \nbeen a confident Nation unafraid to hear expressions in a variety of \nlanguages and willing to reach out to all within our borders. That \ntradition is reflected in section 203 of the Voting Rights Act and in \nPresident Clinton's Executive Order No. 13166. It is an honorable and \njust tradition.\n  We demean our history and our welcoming tradition when we disparage \nlanguages other than English and those who speak them. I have spoken \nabout our including Latin phrases on our official seal and the many \nStates that include mottos and phrases in Latin, French and Spanish on \ntheir State flags. We need not fear other languages. We would do better \nto do more to encourage and assist those who wish to be citizens to \nlearn English, but we should recognize English, as Senator Salazar's \namendment suggested, as our common and unifying language.\n  I hope that the President will join with us to protect language \nminority voters. As a presidential candidate, then-Governor Bush told a \nNew Hampshire audience in September 1999, ``English-only would mean to \npeople `me, not you.' As the Washington Times noted recently:\n\n       Mr. Bush speaks some Spanish and occasionally peppers \n     speeches and conversations with words and phrases from the \n     language. Speaking to a group of adults taking civics lessons \n     yesterday at the Catholic Charities-operated Juan Diego \n     Center, he lapsed into Spanish. Asked whether Mr. Bush \n     planned to drop Spanish from his stump speeches, a White \n     House spokeswoman said she does not expect that to happen.\n\n  The White House, government agencies and a number of Senators include \nSpanish language outreach on their official government Web sites. I am \nglad that they do. Ironically, some who pushed most strongly for some \nvariant of English-only treatment in the immigration bill have bent our \nrules to address the Senate in Spanish.\n  We have been engaged in a contentious debate about immigrants who are \nnot yet citizens, which is unfortunate. I wish we could join together \nto pass fair and comprehensive immigration reform. But the issue \nrelated to section 203 and section 4(f)4 of the Voting Rights Act \naffects American citizens. These provisions provide assistance to \nNative Americans and indigenous peoples, who speak languages which \npreceded the first English speakers on this continent. These are \ncitizens who are trying to vote but many of them are struggling with \nthe English language due to disparities in education and the \nincremental process of learning. It is imperative that all citizens be \nable to exercise their rights as citizens, particularly a right as \nfundamental as the\n\n[[Page S7903]]\n\nright to vote. Renewing the language provisions of the Voting Rights \nAct that are expiring and continue to be needed, will help make that a \nreality.\n\n  At this time I would like to summarize some of the evidence received \nby the Senate Judiciary Committee demonstrating the continuing need for \nsections 203 and 4(f)4.\n  We received extensive testimony about past and continuing educational \ndisparities in jurisdictions covered by section 203 and section 4(f)4. \nAccording to multiple witnesses, many Alaska Natives, Native Americans, \nAsian Americans and Hispanic Americans suffer from inadequate \neducational opportunities to learn English. Unfortunately, our \nJudiciary Committee record demonstrates that the high illiteracy rates \nexperienced by language minorities result from the failure of State and \nlocal officials to afford equal educational opportunities.\n  Several witnesses testified that these educational disparities are \nthe major form of discrimination against language minorities. John \nTrasvina, president of MALDEF, testified, ``while they may speak \nconversational English well, these U.S. citizens may not be fully \nproficient because they were intentionally denied the academic \ninstruction necessary to vote effectively in English-only elections \nthat employ complicated language and terminology.'' The problem of \nunequal educational opportunities existed before the Voting Rights Act \nwas passed in 1965 and continues today. Language minority children who \nwere educated in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s and given unequal education \nopportunities are the adults that today need the assistance of sections \n203 and 4(f)(4). Children who are in schools today where they receive \nunequal education will need the assistance of these provisions to fully \nparticipate in the political process as adults.\n  Over the course of nine hearings, we heard and received testimony \nthat not only are all states with the most limited English proficient \nstudents covered by section 203, but all the school districts with most \nlimited English proficient students are also covered by section 203. \nThese children will first begin to vote over the next 25 years while \nthis proposed reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act is in effect, \nand they will not have had equal access to education and the \nopportunity to learn English.\n  In Alaska, which has the single largest indigenous population in the \nUnited States, an attorney for Native American Rights Fund testified \nabout the dramatic educational disparity between Native people and non-\nNatives. Only 75 percent of all Alaska Natives completed high school \ncompared to 90 percent of non-Natives. And still Alaska persists in \nholding all-English elections--in violation of section 203--which has \nimpacted Alaska Natives' ability to vote with their turnout lagging \nbehind statewide voter turnout by 17 percent.\n  According to the 2000 Census, the educational attainment of Hispanic \nAmericans nationally is also lacking. Only 52.4 percent of all Hispanic \nAmericans have a high school education or more, compared to 80.4 \npercent for all persons in the United States. Efforts to combat this \neducational disparity have resulted in dozens of lawsuits against \nstates for failing to provide equal education to native and nonnative \nEnglish speakers. We received testimony that successful school funding \ncases have been brought in half of all the section 203 covered States \nand are pending in many others. In Arizona in 2005, a Federal court \ncited the State of Arizona for contempt for failing over the course of \nthe preceding 13 years to provide opportunities for Spanish-language \nstudents to learn English in the public schools. The court has been \nfining the State at least $500,000 a day until the problem is corrected \nand equal opportunities are provided to the 175,000 English language \nlearner students estimated to be in Arizona's schools in 2006.\n  And I personally understand the challenges of learning English as \nyour second language. As I have said before, my wife was born of \nimmigrant parents and English became her second language. My mother was \nborn of immigrant parents, with English as her second language. \nFortunately, they learned it as young people. But for adults learning \nEnglish, it can be much harder.\n  We received extensive testimony that classes for adult students to \nincrease their English proficiency are too few and oversubscribed. \nSenator Kennedy told us that in his own section 203 covered \njurisdiction of Boston, the waiting period for English as a second \nlanguage, ESL, classes is 17,000 students long which translates into a \nwait of as much as 3 years. In New York City, the ESL need is estimated \nto be 1 million, but only 41,347 adults were able to enroll in 2005 \nbecause of limited availability. It is a sad fact that most adult ESL \nprograms no longer keep waiting lists because of the extreme demand, \nbut use lotteries in which at least 75 percent are turned away, and the \nwaiting time can be several years.\n  Continuing acts of discrimination against language minorities, such \nas those contained in the committee record, chill minority voting \nparticipation denying these citizens equal access to the balloting \nprocess. We heard countless examples of the continuing discrimination \nthat minority language citizens face when participating or attempting \nto participate in the political process. These experiences will no \ndoubt stick with each voter for some time.\n  Civil Rights organizations testified about numerous instances of \ndiscrimination that were documented while monitoring elections in \ncovered jurisdictions in New York. For example, in the 2001 elections \nat Public School 228, a polling site coordinator, trying to thwart \nbilingual interpreters from performing their duties, yelled ``You f---\ning Chinese, there's too many of you!'' In 2002, at Public School 82 \nand at the Botanical Garden, some of the comments made to Asian-\nAmerican voters included poll workers calling South Asian voters \n``terrorists'' and mocking the physical features of Asian eyes. While \nmonitoring the 2003 elections, independent observers reported that in \nPublic School 126 in Manhattan's Chinatown, poll inspectors ridiculed a \nvoter's surname--Ho; in Public School 115 in Queens, disparaging \nremarks were directed at South Asian voters, with one coordinator \ncontinuously referring to herself as a ``U.S. citizen'' and that she, \nunlike them, was ``born here'' and that the other workers needed to \n``keep an eye'' on all South Asian voters; at Flushing Bland Center in \nQueens, the site coordinator complained that Asian-American voters \n``should learn to speak English.''\n\n  During the 2004 election, a Hispanic voter in San Antonio, TX, was \ntold by an election judge that she was not on a voter registration list \nand could not cast a provisional ballot, despite the recently enacted \nHelp America Vote Act which provides for provisional ballots in such \nsituations. She and her family had been voting at the same polling \nstation for over 20 years. The election judge refused to unlock the \nprovisional ballot box until a Mexican American Legal Defense and \nEducation Fund--MALDEF--attorney arrived and negotiated on behalf of \nthe voter.\n  And the House of Representatives received equally disturbing \ntestimony which was incorporated into our own Record. In 2003, the \nchairman of the Texas House Redistricting Committee stated that he did \nnot intend to hold redistricting hearings in the Rio Grande Valley in \nSouth Texas, where many U.S. citizens are limited English proficient \nSpanish speakers, because only two members of the Redistricting \nCommittee spoke Spanish. Chairman Crabb stated that the members of the \ncommittee who did not speak Spanish ``would have a very difficult time \nif we were out in an area other than Austin or other English speaking \nareas to be able to have committee hearings to be able to converse with \nthe people that did not speak English.'' Many citizens living in areas \nof Texas with high concentrations of limited English proficient \ncitizens would have been excluded from participating in local \nRedistricting Committee hearings had Hispanic advocates not interceded \non their behalf. In another part of the country, due to a lack of \nsufficient bilingual ballots, Hispanic voters in Pima County, AZ, were \nforced to crowd around one translated poster of more than a dozen \ninitiatives left in a poorly lit area during the 2004 elections.\n  Sadly, these examples are not isolated incidents of discrimination. \nAssistant Attorney General Wan Kim testified that the Department of \nJustice has brought more lawsuits to enforce\n\n[[Page S7904]]\n\nthe language minority provisions of the Voting Rights Act in the \nprevious 5 years than in all previous years combined. These facts and \nall the other testimony we received in Committee clearly demonstrate \nthe ongoing need for section 203's protections and the need that we \nreauthorize these provisions of the Voting Rights Act.\n  Of course there are critics. There are critics who say that the \nlanguage assistance provisions in the Voting Rights Act should be \neliminated entirely because immigrants must learn English to pass the \ncitizenship test and therefore should be able to vote in English. This \nargument is unsound for two reasons.\n  First, we received overwhelming testimony that the level of English \nproficiency required to pass a citizenship test does not approach the \nlevel of proficiency required to register to vote or to understand \nballot measures. Naturalization requires a third or fourth grade \nknowledge of English. Sample test sentences on the Immigration and \nNaturalization Services Web site reveal that no sentence is more than \n10 words long and most are seven or less, containing one or two \nsyllable words. In addition, most candidates for citizenship are exempt \nfrom the English language requirements of the citizenship test because \nthey are over the age of 50. Between 1986 and 2004, 9,055,732 people \nwere naturalized of which 4,925,553 or 54 percent were over the age of \n50.\n\n  Voting requires English proficiency at levels much higher than the \ncitizenship test. A survey of voter registration materials reported on \nthe Warren Institute on Race, Ethnicity and Diversity, admitted into \nour Record, found the English grade level of the materials just to \nregister to vote was much higher than third or fourth grade knowledge. \nIn Texas, a ``covered jurisdiction'' for section 203 purposes, the \nvoter registration material required nearly a twelfth grade English \ncomprehension for completion with an average of 21 words per sentence. \nThe situation is similar in Arizona--ninth grade level with 15 words \nper sentence--California, college freshman level with 22 words per \nsentence, and New Mexico, twelfth grade level with 19 words per \nsentence. This survey only covers materials required to register to \nvote. We also heard testimony about the complexity of actually casting \nvotes on ballot initiatives and directions to operate voting machines \nas examples of other English language barriers to language minority \nvoters. Ballot initiatives are often long and complicated requiring \nhigh school level education or higher. Deborah Wright, Acting Assistant \nRegistrar-Recorder and County Clerk for Los Angeles County, testified \nthat written translations are provided in L.A. County because of the \ncomplex nature of the issues facing the voters in that state.\n  Complex ballots are not limited to California. We received evidence \nof numerous examples. Perhaps the one that struck me the most was a \n2004 Fargo, ND, election ballot, where a single question concerning tax \nincreases for infrastructure improvement was one sentence which \ncontained 150 words written at the graduate school level.\n  Second, most language minorities protected by the Voting Rights Act \nare United States citizens by birth. The vast majority of language \nminorities are not immigrants. In fact, 3.4 million of the 4.5 million \nlanguage minority students in the public schools are native-born U.S. \ncitizens. Hispanic Americans are the single largest minority group \ncovered by Sections 203 and 4(f)(4). According to 2000 Census data, \n84.2 percent of all Hispanic American citizens in the United States \nwere born here. Nearly half of the 11.9 million Asian Americans \ncitizens in the United States were born here. Further, 98.6 percent of \nall Puerto Rican persons in the United States are native born and the \nlanguage of Puerto Rican public schools is Spanish with English taught \nas a subject.\n  The committee received testimony that although there are costs \nassociated with implementing the minority language assistance \nprovisions, they are reasonable. Los Angeles, the largest and most \ndiverse local election jurisdiction in the United States, provides \nassistance to voters in six languages other than English, and its \ncompliance with section 203 requirements costs 10 percent or less of \nits annual election budget. And the Secretary of State for New Mexico \ntestified before the House Judiciary Committee characterizing the costs \nof complying with section 203 as, ``a minimal cost to the State of New \nMexico.''\n  One witness testified that she believed the costs of section 203 to \nbe extremely burdensome. Linda Chavez, president of One Nation \nIndivisible, testified that Los Angeles County spent $3.3 million in \n2002 to comply with section 203, which she thought was too much to ask \nthe County to bear. However, as Deborah Wright's testimony on behalf of \nLos Angeles County made clear this number is a small percentage of the \noverall election budget, and is proportional to the 12.9 million \nlimited English proficient voters in her jurisdiction. Ms. Chavez also \nalleged that ``[f]requently the cost of multilingual voter assistance \nis more than half of a jurisdiction's total election costs,'' citing a \n1997 General Accounting Office report. However, a close look at that \nGAO report shows that only 3 out of the 34 jurisdictions surveyed spent \nover 50 percent of their total election budget on multilingual voter \nassistance. Contrary to Ms. Chavez's testimony, the report reveals that \nthe costs of providing language assistance made up, on average, a \nlittle over 10 percent of total expenditures. Ensuring full access to \nAmerican's right to vote certainly is worth this reasonable cost.\n  For jurisdictions that struggle with the costs of implementing \nsections 203 or 4(f)(4), the Department of Justice, DOJ, provides \ncommendable assistance in managing the costs. Acting Assistant Attorney \nGeneral Bradley Schlozman testified that ``the Civil Rights Division \nrecognizes, of course, that States and municipalities do not have \nunlimited budgets, and we have thus designed our enforcement strategy \nto minimize unnecessary costs for local election officials.''\n  The DOJ urges covered jurisdictions to avoid costly and unhelpful \nexpenditures such as publishing Spanish language notices in English \nlanguage newspapers that are not read by those who rely on the Spanish \nlanguage. Election officials are encouraged to identify the most \neffective and efficient channels of communication that are used by \nprivate enterprise, service providers, tribal governments, and the like \nto get information effectively to the language minority community at \nlow cost.\n  The DOJ also encourages the use of fax and e-mail ``information \ntrees,'' whereby bilingual election notices are sent at no cost to a \nwide array of businesses, unions, social and fraternal organizations, \nservice providers, churches and other organizations with a request that \nthese entities make announcements or otherwise disseminate the \ninformation to their membership's language minority voters. And the DOJ \nhas incorporated ``best practices'' from around the country to help \njurisdictions recruit sufficient numbers of bilingual poll workers. As \na consequence of the testimony submitted on costs of implementation, we \ndetermined that costs are both reasonable and manageable.\n  There has been some discussion about allegations that in some \njurisdictions no one uses the translated materials, but we also \nreceived hard research showing that limited English proficient citizens \nutilize the written and oral assistance offered in jurisdictions, but \nmust be made aware it exists. According to a November 2000 exit survey \nof language minority voters in Los Angeles and Orange Counties in \nCalifornia, 54 percent of Asian and Pacific Islander voters and 46 \npercent of Hispanic voters reported that they would be more likely to \nvote if they received language assistance. These numbers are consistent \nwith other exit surveys done in the same counties in March 2000 and \nNovember 1998.\n  Examples of ``low use'' of bilingual election materials are not \nevidence that bilingual materials are not needed. ``Low use'' more \nlikely suggests that a jurisdiction is not conducting sufficient \noutreach to the communities that would most benefit. In a survey of 810 \nsection 203 covered jurisdictions, nearly two-thirds of election \nofficials admitted they do not engage in community outreach to covered \nlanguage groups. How are people supposed to know the help is there, if \nthere is no community outreach? We can, and we must do better.\n\n[[Page S7905]]\n\n  I am nonetheless happy to report, that when sufficient outreach to \nlanguage minorities is accomplished, materials are being used to assist \nin voting according to evidence received in Committee. In the 1990 \ngeneral election, bilingual assistance was used by 25 percent of \nHispanic voters in the State of Texas, and 18 percent of Hispanic \nvoters in the State of California. In the 1988 general election, \nbilingual assistance was used by 20 percent of Hispanic voters in the \nState of New Mexico, 19 percent of Hispanic voters in the State of \nTexas, and 10 percent of Hispanic voters in the State of California.\n  Being from a small state, I know the importance and the power of \ncommunity involvement, but perhaps the best evidence we heard that \nshows the power of community outreach was the experience of Chinese-\nAmerican voters in King County, WA, which includes the city of Seattle. \nOne witness who urged an opt-out provision in section 203 for low use \ncited King County's experience in 2000, the first year it became a \ncovered jurisdiction for voters who speak Chinese. That year, according \nto the witness, only 24 Chinese ballots were used, demonstrating that \nballots were not needed. But that is not the full story. The real story \nis that after that election, officials in King County worked with \nChinese-American community organizations and increased the publicity \nabout the availability of bilingual election materials. In 2005, the \nnumber of requested Chinese ballots increased by more than 5,800 \npercent. It shows the power of community outreach cannot be overstated.\n  Much has been made by some witnesses in committee, and even in the \npress, that any provision of bilingual election materials contribute to \nthe balkanization of American society. Research offered in committee \nshows this allegation to be faulty. On the contrary, making bilingual \nelection materials available has encouraged more language minorities to \nparticipate in all political aspects of American society. After the \nsection 203 coverage was expanded to include a numeric trigger during \nthe last reauthorization, the number of Asian Americans registered to \nvote increased dramatically. Between 1996 and 2004, Asian Americans had \nthe highest increase of new voter registration--58.7 percent. And we \nreceived testimony that in districts where the Department of Justice \nhas conducted enforcement ensuring bilingual election materials, \nparticipation not only in voting but in running for political office \nhas increased. After an enforcement proceeding in Harris County, TX, \nthe Vietnamese-American voter turnout doubled, and the first \nVietnamese-American candidate in history, Hubert Vo, was elected to the \nTexas Legislature--defeating the incumbent chair of the Appropriations \nCommittee by 16 votes out of over 40,000 cast.\n  These voting rights provisions work--they tell new citizens and \ncitizens by birth who may not always feel they are afforded all of the \nopportunities they deserve that they are welcome to join our political \nprocess. They help new citizens and first time voters to overcome \ncultural differences which further contribute to disenfranchisement for \nlimited English proficient citizens who are often unfamiliar with the \nAmerican voting process and do not know about registration, referenda \nand voting machines. The charge of ``balkanization,'' as one witness \nput it is ``a loaded term of mythical proportions that has absolutely \nno basis in fact, and is used as a divisive measure.'' Based on the \nevidence we received, it is clear that the provisions of Sections 203 \nand 4(f)(4) have led to increased participation and representation. \nThese provisions, that caused significant problems in the House of \nRepresentatives, have enabled language minorities to overcome what are \ntantamount to literacy tests at the polling place so that they can \naccess their fundamental right to vote. Section 203 and section 4(f)4 \nof the Voting Rights Act must be reauthorized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/19/senate-section/article/S7905-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JONATHON SOLOMON\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today in Fort Yukon, people from \nall over the State of Alaska and the country will come together to \ncelebrate the life of a remarkable leader of the Gwich'in Nation, \nJonathon Solomon, who passed away last week at the age of 74.\n  As traditional chief of Fort Yukon, and chairman of the Gwich'in \nSteering Committee, Jonathon was a tireless advocate for the Gwich'in \npeople. Born in Fort Yukon, he was raised to live a traditional \nsubsistence lifestyle, and his upbringing directly influenced his \npassion and work throughout his life. Although Jonathon fought for many \nissues on behalf of the Gwich'in, his life's passion was the protection \nof the porcupine caribou herd and their birthing grounds on the coastal \nplain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Jonathon's efforts to \nprotect the Arctic Refuge began in 1978, as the Alaska National \nInterest Lands Conservation Act was first being negotiated and he \ncontinued this work determinedly throughout his entire life. Among his \nmany accomplishments, he led the 7-year effort to negotiate the U.S.-\nCanada agreement to protect the porcupine caribou herd and its habitat, \nsigned July 1987, and was one of the chief organizers of the first \nGwich'in gathering in 1988, which led to the creation of the Gwich'in \nSteering Committee. It was at this meeting in 1988, that the Gwich'in \nfirst came together as a nation to pass a resolution calling for \npermanent protection of the caribou calving and nursery grounds as \ncongressionally designated wilderness.\n  Jonathon's work took him all over the country, including to \nWashington, DC, where on numerous occasions he spoke to Members of \nCongress and their staffs about the importance of protecting the Arctic \nRefuge. Throughout his life, Jonathon was an inspiration to all who \nknew him. He represented the Gwich'in people with dignity, devotion and \nrespect. While we mourn his loss, I know that his energy will live on \nin all of us who carry on the fight to protect the Arctic Refuge and \nother places throughout the country that are special to all of \nus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/19/senate-section/article/S7905-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 9:32 a,m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 3504.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to \n     reconsidering the decision to exclude Plaquemines Parish from \n     the federal plan to invest $2.5 billion for levee re-\n     enhancement in south Louisiana; to the Committee on Banking, \n     Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 83\n\n       Whereas, as the southernmost land area of Louisiana, \n     Plaquemines Parish creates a corridor surrounding the \n     Mississippi River as it flows to the Gulf of Mexico and the \n     peninsula of saltwater marshes and estuaries forms the rich \n     delta of the river; and\n       Whereas, Plaquemines Parish is the operational center for \n     the offshore oil and gas industry, its port and harbor \n     terminal district is sought after as the coal exporting \n     capital of Louisiana, and the area provides a substantial \n     portion of the state's shrimping industry, the nation's \n     largest, and its commercial fishing is second only to Alaska; \n     and\n       Whereas, the parish's location and geographical structure \n     are vital to Louisiana and the nation as a buffer for \n     tropical storms and hurricanes as without Plaquemines Parish, \n     Hurricane Katrina would have advanced directly into New \n     Orleans with no protection; and\n       Whereas, Hurricane Katrina washed away 57 square miles of \n     the Plaquemines coastline, destroyed barrier islands that \n     once protected the region from storms, and severely damaged \n     levees on both east and west banks of the parish; and\n       Whereas, while Katrina-damaged levees will be ``repaired,'' \n     President Bush has announced he will not seek the $1.6 \n     billion needed to ``upgrade'' levees in the southern half of \n     Plaquemines Parish and it has been proposed to exclude \n     Plaquemines Parish from the $2.5 billion levee re-enhancement \n     in south Louisiana pending further study on cost \n     effectiveness; and\n       Whereas, the Legislature of Louisiana opposes this \n     exclusion and urges the reconsideration of all of Plaquemines \n     Parish as a top priority in the proposed levee upgrades for \n     south Louisiana: therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to reconsider the decision \n     to exclude Plaquemines Parish from the federal plan to invest \n     $2.5 billion for levee re-enhancement in south Louisiana; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-353. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to taking such actions as are necessary to extend \n     Louisiana's seaward boundary in the Gulf of Mexico to twelve \n     geographical miles; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 205\n\n       Whereas, Louisiana's seaward boundary in the Gulf of Mexico \n     has been judicially determined to be three geographical \n     miles, and the United States has jurisdiction outside of \n     three geographical miles; and\n       Whereas, Congress has the power to amend the Submerged \n     Lands Act of 1953 to provide that Louisiana's seaward \n     boundary extends twelve geographical miles into the Gulf of \n     Mexico; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana acts as a significant energy corridor \n     vital to the entire United States and provides intersections \n     of oil and natural gas intrastate and interstate pipeline \n     networks, which serve as references for futures markets, such \n     as the Henry Hub for natural gas, the St. James Louisiana \n     Light Sweet Crude Oil, and the Mars Sour Crude Oil contracts; \n     and\n       Whereas, Louisiana provides storage for the nation's \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve and is the home of the nation's \n     major import terminal for foreign oil, known as the Louisiana \n     Offshore Oil Port; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana and its coastal wetlands provide access \n     to nearly thirty-four percent of the United States natural \n     gas supply and nearly twenty-nine percent of the United \n     States oil supply; and\n       Whereas, the United States' economic growth depends on \n     access to stable supplies of oil and natural gas; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana ranks first in crude oil production, \n     including the outer continental shelf production, and ranks \n     second in natural gas production, including the outer \n     continental shelf production; and\n       Whereas, in 2001, the state of Louisiana received only one-\n     half of one percent of the federal oil and gas revenues from \n     its coast; and\n       Whereas, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have shown that the \n     loss of vital oil and gas infrastructure in Louisiana and the \n     Gulf of Mexico has an immediate and direct impact upon the \n     economy and well-being of the entire country and its \n     citizens; and\n       Whereas, the hurricanes shut-in approximately fifty-three \n     percent of the daily oil production in the Gulf of Mexico and \n     shut-in approximately forty-seven percent of the daily gas \n     production in the Gulf of Mexico; and\n       Whereas, for the time period of August 26, 2005, through \n     November 3, 2005, the cumulative shut-in of oil production \n     was approximately fourteen percent of the yearly oil \n     production in the Gulf of Mexico, and the cumulative shut-in \n     of gas production was approximately eleven percent of the \n     yearly gas production in the Gulf of Mexico; and\n       Whereas, due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Louisiana has \n     suffered loss of life and tremendous devastation to its \n     economy, its citizens, infrastructure, and coastal landscape; \n     and\n       Whereas, the state has provided ten million dollars from \n     our Rapid Response Fund for short-term, interest-free loans \n     to struggling businesses and granted the full Interim \n     Emergency Fund in the amount of sixteen million dollars to \n     local governments in order for the governments' vital \n     services to operate; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana has paid out approximately three hundred \n     million dollars in unemployment benefits to hurricane-\n     affected employees; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana has established a Rainy Day Fund that is \n     worth approximately four hundred sixty million dollars, and \n     the state is in the process of using at least one-third of \n     this fund to balance the state budget; and\n       Whereas, in this regular session the Louisiana Legislature \n     along with the governor are considering other options for \n     balancing the budget, increasing revenues, and funding the \n     massive cleanup, rebuilding, and restoration of southern \n     Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita turned approximately \n     one hundred square miles of southeast Louisiana coastal \n     wetlands into open water and destroyed more wetlands east of \n     the Mississippi River in one\n\n[[Page S7908]]\n\n     month than experts estimated would be lost in over forty-five \n     years; and\n       Whereas, monies are desperately needed to fund the state's \n     cleanup, rebuilding, and restoration of southern Louisiana; \n     and\n       Whereas, the state of Louisiana and its citizens are in a \n     financial crisis; and\n       Whereas, in order to rebuild the state of Louisiana and \n     protect its citizens, the state needs a significant, \n     consistent, and ongoing stream of revenue: and\n       Whereas, the extension of Louisiana's seaward boundary into \n     the Gulf of Mexico for twelve geographical miles will provide \n     such stream of revenue; therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to extend Louisiana's seaward boundary in \n     the Gulf of Mexico to twelve geographical miles; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-354. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Kansas \n     relative to urging the federal government to lift the \n     moratorium on offshore drilling for oil and natural gas; to \n     the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n          Substitute for House Concurrent Resolution No. 5030\n\n       Whereas, policies of the federal government have placed \n     much of the coastal Outer Continental Shelf off limits to oil \n     and natural gas production; and Whereas, development of oil \n     and natural gas resources, where allowed off our shores, has \n     coexisted for decades with recreational and commercial \n     activities while benefiting the entire nation; and\n       Whereas, Offshore oil and natural gas operations have a \n     long history of environmentally sensitive and safe \n     performance; and\n       Whereas, offshore development of oil and natural gas has \n     provided needed supplies of American energy, generated \n     substantial local, state and federal revenues and created \n     thousands of jobs and economic development; and\n       Whereas, America's increased dependence on foreign energy \n     supplies and global competition for oil and natural gas will \n     create a threat to our national security; and\n       Whereas, the nation's farming and ranching sector depend on \n     a reliable and affordable supply of energy to run equipment, \n     fertilize crops and transport products to market; and\n       Whereas, the Economic Research Service of the United States \n     Department of Agriculture estimates that farmers' fuel \n     expenses for 2005 will have exceeded their 2004 fuel expenses \n     by 41 percent, and higher energy prices mean increased costs \n     to farmers and ranchers, who already face tremendous economic \n     challenges; and\n       Whereas, the fertilizer industry depends on natural gas, \n     and since 2002, 36 percent of the U.S. fertilizer industry \n     has been shut down or mothballed and the industry has been \n     forced to move production to other countries, creating a \n     threat to our food security; and\n       Whereas, the Energy Information Administration of the \n     United States Department of Energy projects that the average \n     residential customer this winter will spend approximately 48 \n     percent more on natural gas than last winter, creating a \n     serious hardship for those who lived on a fixed or limited \n     income, especially senior citizens; and\n       Whereas, today, the Outer Continental Shelf represents one \n     of the brightest spots in terms of potential United States \n     energy resources: now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of \n     Kansas, the Senate concurring therein: That the State of \n     Kansas urges the Minerals Management Service of the United \n     States Department of Interior to include all Outer \n     Continental Shelf planning areas in its proposed five-year \n     plan for 2007 through 2012 and approve the broadest possible \n     plan for offshore development; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State is directed to send \n     enrolled copies of this resolution to the United States \n     Secretaries of Commerce, Interior and Energy, and to the \n     administrators of the Minerals Management Service, Federal \n     Energy Regulatory Commission, National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration, and the Environmental Protection \n     Agency, and to the President and Congressional leadership, \n     and to each member of the Kansas congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-355.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to \n     immediately authorizing the Morganza to the Gulf Hurricane \n     Protection Project, and urging and requesting the U.S. Army \n     Corps of Engineers to include such recommendation in its \n     pending interim report to Congress; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 72\n\n       Whereas, an interim report being prepared by the U.S. Army \n     Corps of Engineers as part of the Category 5 Hurricane \n     Protection Study will shortly be submitted to Congress; and\n       Whereas, one purpose of the interim report is to allow \n     Congress to act immediately on recommendations contained in \n     the report; and\n       Whereas, Terrebonne Parish was severely impacted by \n     Hurricane Rita, with flooding affecting approximately ten \n     thousand businesses and homes; and\n       Whereas, with the exception of assistance in the two weeks \n     immediately following the hurricane, Terrebonne Parish has \n     received no further assistance from the federal government to \n     repair flood control infrastructure; and\n       Whereas, funding for such flood control infrastructure has \n     been excluded from significant federal appropriations for \n     Louisiana and from the proposed federal budget for the coming \n     fiscal year; and\n       Whereas, the Morganza to the Gulf Hurricane Protection \n     Project has been ready for authorization for Congress since \n     2002, and was presented to Congress in that year after ten \n     years of study, analysis, and evaluation; and\n       Whereas, such study and analysis shows that immediate \n     implementation of the Morganza to the Gulf Hurricane \n     Protection Project is the best way to obtain Category 5 \n     hurricane protection for affected parts of Terrebonne and \n     Lafourche parishes; and\n       Whereas, without implementation of such project, these \n     areas lack protection from almost any significant storm \n     levels and face potential disaster if implementation is \n     further delayed: therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to immediately authorize \n     implementation of the Morganza to the Gulf Hurricane \n     Protection Project, be it further\n       Resolved, That the interim report being prepared by the \n     U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for Congress as part of the \n     Category 5 Hurricane Protection Study should include a \n     recommendation for immediate authorization of the Morganza to \n     the Gulf Hurricane Protection Project, be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted, to the commander of the U.S. Army Corps of \n     Engineers, the executive office of the New Orleans District \n     of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the secretary of the \n     United States Senate and the clerk of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and to each member of the Louisiana \n     delegation to the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-359. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to taking such actions as are necessary to provide \n     hurricane tidal flood protection to south Louisiana, \n     including requiring the United States Army Corps of Engineers \n     to evaluate both federal and nonfederal tidal levees in south \n     Louisiana, to consider adding nonfederal tidal levees into \n     the federal program, and to fully fund upgrading hurricane \n     tidal flood protection in south Louisiana.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 182\n\n       Whereas, as a result of the massive flooding suffered by \n     the citizens in Orleans, Plaquemines, and St. Bernard \n     parishes due to the overtopping of levees and levee breaches \n     during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the issue and challenge \n     of providing hurricane tidal flood protection for south \n     Louisiana has gotten the attention of the nation; and\n       Whereas, not only were Orleans, Plaquemines, and St. \n     Bernard parishes flooded as a result of the hurricane tidal \n     surge, massive flooding was also prevalent in smaller \n     communities in Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes; and\n       Whereas, the United States Army Corps of Engineers is \n     focusing its attention on repairing the federal levees which \n     breached during the 2005 hurricane season; however, there is \n     also a system of nonfederal tidal levees, which offers a \n     level of protection to the citizens of south Louisiana and \n     which needs to be assessed, and in some cases, needs to be \n     strengthened; and\n       Whereas, nonfederal tidal levees have long been a concern \n     of the local citizens of smaller communities of this state \n     since local and state funds to repair and strengthen such \n     levees have fallen well short of the need; and\n       Whereas, nonfederal tidal levees are a valuable asset for \n     citizens in south Louisiana because in many cases this system \n     of levees is the only hurricane tidal flood protection these \n     citizens enjoy; and\n       Whereas, since the state suffered such massive flooding as \n     a result of the 2005 hurricane season, the need for a \n     greater, more comprehensive hurricane tidal flood protection \n     system for south Louisiana has never been more urgent; and\n       Whereas, the United States Army Corps of Engineers should \n     evaluate both federal and nonfederal tidal levees in south \n     Louisiana and should consider including nonfederal tidal \n     levees in the federal program in order to provide \n     comprehensive hurricane tidal flood protection for all of \n     south Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, in order to avoid the costs of rebuilding entire \n     communities, the federal government should consider fully \n     funding the costs of repairing and upgrading the level of \n     hurricane tidal flood protection for south Louisiana: \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to provide hurricane tidal flood protection \n     to south Louisiana, including requiring the United States \n     Army Corps of Engineers to evaluate both federal and \n     nonfederal tidal levees in south Louisiana, to consider \n     adding nonfederal tidal levees into the federal program, and \n     to fully fund upgrading hurricane tidal flood protection in \n     south Louisiana; be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-360. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to taking such actions as are necessary to ensure \n     that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services do not \n     penalize senior citizens who resided in areas affected by \n     Hurricane Katrina for taking advantage of the special \n     enrollment period set for enrollment in Medicare Part D; to \n     the Committee on Finance.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 203\n\n       Whereas, prescription drug costs have risen at a rapid rate \n     over the past decade; and\n       Whereas, the rising costs of prescription drugs have proven \n     unsustainable for millions of America's senior citizens; and\n       Whereas, in order to curb the ever-increasing burden of \n     prescription drug costs on senior citizens, congress adopted \n     a prescription drug benefit program as part of Medicare; and\n       Whereas, on December 8, 2003, President Bush signed the \n     Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization \n     Act, and this legislation provides senior citizens of the \n     United States with a Medicare prescription drug benefit; and\n\n[[Page S7910]]\n\n       Whereas, the drug benefit, otherwise known as Medicare Part \n     D, is estimated by the Bush administration to currently have \n     thirty-seven million enrollees; and\n       Whereas, Hurricane Katrina put an additional financial \n     burden on many of Louisiana's seniors, as well as \n     exacerbating many of the already severe health concerns of \n     the state's citizens; and\n       Whereas, additional time to review and choose the proper \n     prescription drug benefit is necessary, as many seniors have \n     been occupied by the travails of rebuilding after the \n     devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina; and\n       Whereas, on March 8, 2006, Randy Brauer, the acting \n     director of the division of enrollment and eligibility policy \n     of the CMS issued a letter stating that evacuees of Hurricane \n     Katrina will be granted a special enrollment period in which \n     to enroll in Medicare Part D; and\n       Whereas, the normal deadline for enrollment is May \n     fifteenth, and the extended deadline is over seven months \n     later on December thirty-first; and\n       Whereas, state and local agencies as well as civic and \n     community groups have informed senior citizens of the \n     extended enrollment period; and\n       Whereas, though a special enrollment period has been \n     created, CMS is considering penalizing seniors who decide to \n     take advantage of the extended enrollment period; and\n       Whereas, many of the elderly have experienced financial \n     hardship as a result of the hurricane that makes an increase \n     in the cost of the drug benefit even more pernicious: \n     Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to ensure that the Centers for Medicare and \n     Medicaid Services not penalize senior citizens who resided in \n     areas affected by Hurricane Katrina for utilizing the special \n     enrollment period established for enrollment in Medicare Part \n     D; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-361. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to enacting the Nursing Home Fire Safety Act; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 247\n\n       Whereas, the safety of the elderly and disabled, our most \n     vulnerable citizens, deserves the highest priority and \n     attention. It is estimated that 20 to 30 percent of the \n     nation's 17,000 nursing homes lack sprinkler systems. Such \n     blatant oversights place the residents of these facilities at \n     great risk in the event of a fire; and\n       Whereas, in 2005, legislation was introduced in Congress to \n     enact the Nursing Home Fire Safety Act. It is the intent of \n     Congress, through this legislation, to equip every nursing \n     home in the country with a fire sprinkler system over the \n     next five years, adopt the Life Safety Code, and provide \n     direct loans and sprinkler retrofit assistance grants to \n     assist with installation costs; and\n       Whereas, the bill requires the Center for Medicare and \n     Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency authorized to implement \n     nursing home regulations, to adopt the National Fire \n     Protection Association's (NFPA) new requirement that all \n     existing nursing homes be equipped with automatic fire \n     sprinklers. It also provides the resources that existing \n     nursing homes will need to retrofit their facilities while \n     continuing to care for residents; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact the \n     Nursing Home Fire Safety Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-362. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth \n     of Pennsylvania relative to extending the Medicare Part D \n     prescription drug deadline to December 31, 2006; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 727\n\n       Whereas, Many older and disabled citizens in the United \n     States and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania depend on the \n     Federal Government for assistance with the purchase of \n     necessary prescription drugs; and\n       Whereas, The Federal Medicare Part D prescription drug \n     benefit can help all eligible Americans and Pennsylvanians \n     with the rising out-of-pocket drug costs, especially those \n     persons with limited incomes; and\n       Whereas, Given enough time to eliminate the confusion \n     created by the changes in this prescription drug program, \n     most eligible citizens will sign up or obtain alternative \n     insurance coverage; and\n       Whereas, Beneficiary and caregiver education and counseling \n     is critical to promote informed decision making and smooth \n     transition as this new drug benefit is implemented; and\n       Whereas, The current proposed May 15, 2006, deadline for \n     enrollment in the program or alternative insurance is too \n     soon to include everyone it should because of the confusion \n     and lack of education and counseling for seniors and \n     caregivers: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania urge the Congress of the United \n     States to extend the Medicare Part D prescription drug \n     deadline to December 31, 2006; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of each house of Congress and to each \n     member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-363.

Ed. 2d 690, plaintiffs challenged the \n     content-based speech restrictions of the Child Online \n     Protection Act (COPA), which was designed to protect minors \n     from exposure to pornography on the World Wide Web;\n       Whereas, in that case, the United States Supreme Court \n     invoked a requirement that, in order to prevail in a court \n     challenge, the federal government must demonstrate that less \n     restrictive methods of protecting minors from pornography are \n     not as effective as current law;\n       Whereas, in that case, the United States Supreme Court held \n     that the federal government failed to meet the burden of \n     proving that proposed alternatives such as filtering \n     software, a plausible less restrictive alternative to COPA, \n     would be less effective in protecting minors from exposure to \n     pornography on the Internet;\n       Whereas, child pornography has become a $3 billion annual \n     industry;\n       Whereas, the United States Customs Service estimates that \n     there are more than 100,000 websites offering child \n     pornography, which is illegal worldwide;\n       Whereas, these unlawful sexual images can be purchased very \n     easily at these websites;\n       Whereas, more than 20,000 images of child pornography are \n     posted on the Internet every week;\n       Whereas, one in five children who use computer chat rooms \n     has been approached over the Internet by pedophiles;\n       Whereas, in 2002, the United States Supreme Court stated in \n     another case that virtual pornographic images of children are \n     a victimless crime;\n       Whereas, in many instances it is impossible for a viewer to \n     determine whether an image is a virtual or an actual \n     photographic image;\n       Whereas, the determination of whether the material is \n     ``harmful to minors'' was intended by the United States \n     Supreme Court to be made by lawfully appointed juries made up \n     of, in the Court's own words, ``average person[s], applying \n     contemporary community standards, would find, taking the \n     material as a whole and with respect to minors, is designed \n     to appeal to, or is designed to pander to, the prurient \n     interest'' and ``taken as a whole, lack serious literary, \n     artistic, political, or scientific value for minors'';\n       Whereas, the United States Congress should take deliberate \n     action to protect minors through the passage of a \n     constitutional amendment protecting minors from exposure to \n     pornography; and\n       Whereas, governments and the courts must respond decisively \n     when minors are exposed to material that is harmful to them, \n     in the name of preserving the free speech right of adults: \n     Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah \n     expresses opposition to the United States Supreme Court's \n     decision in Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union, 124 \n     S. Ct. 2783, 159 L. Ed. 2d 690, and other recent cases that \n     claim to preserve the free speech rights of adults while \n     exposing minors to material the United States Supreme Court \n     has stated is ``harmful to minors;'' and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, in \n     order to help protect children, strongly urges the United \n     States Congress to pass a constitutional amendment, if \n     necessary, prohibiting child pornography, actual or \n     simulated; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature strongly urges Congress to \n     pass a constitutional amendment, if necessary, to criminalize \n     the possession or viewing of child pornography, actual or \n     simulated, by any individual; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     Majority Leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, the United States \n     Supreme Court, and to the members of Utah's congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-368. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to taking such actions as are necessary to support \n     and establish a free trade agreement between the United \n     States and Taiwan; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 212\n\n       Whereas, Taiwan has developed steadily into a major \n     internationa1 trading power with over three hundred forty \n     billion dollars in two-way trade and the world's seventeenth \n     largest economy; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan is the United States' eighth largest \n     trading partner, with trade flowing between these nations \n     totaling over fifty-six billion dollars in 2005 alone; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan is the sixth largest market for United \n     States agricultural products, including beef, wheat, corn, \n     and soybeans, and with the strong purchasing power of its \n     twenty-three million people, there are many opportunities to \n     further expand bilateral trade between Taiwan and the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan is the world's largest supplier of computer \n     monitors and is a leading personal computer manufacturer; and\n       Whereas, some of the biggest industries in Taiwan are \n     electronics and computer products, chemicals and \n     petrochemicals, basic metals, machinery, textiles, transport \n     equipment, plastics, and machinery; and\n       Whereas, a United States-Taiwan free trade agreement would \n     lead to further investment by firms in both Taiwan and the\n\n[[Page S7912]]\n\n     United States and would create new business opportunities and \n     new jobs; and\n       Whereas, a United States-Taiwan free trade agreement would \n     encourage greater innovations and manufacturing efficiencies \n     by stimulating joint technological development; and\n       Whereas, the United States International Trade Commission \n     (USITC) and the Institute for International Economics (IIE) \n     estimate that a United States-Taiwan free trade agreement \n     would increase United States exports to Taiwan by about six \n     billion dollars: Therefore be it\n       Resolved, that the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to support and establish a free trade \n     agreement between the United States and Taiwan; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to the \n     presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-369. A concurrent memorial adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Arizona \n     relative to permitting emergency workers and equipment to \n     cross the international border with Mexico to address \n     emergencies that threaten both sides of the border; to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                          Concurrent Memorial\n\n       Whereas, Arizona and Mexico share a border that stretches \n     for more than three hundred fifty miles; and\n       Whereas, the threats from environmental spills, leaks, \n     explosions and similar disasters involving toxic substances \n     in border communities are not constrained by political \n     boundaries and can threaten people and communities on both \n     sides; and\n       Whereas, the threats from fires, floods and similar natural \n     disasters are not constrained by political boundaries and can \n     threaten people and communities on both sides; and\n       Whereas, as a result of a joint legislative protocol \n     session with the members of the Arizona Legislature, on \n     December 1, 2005, the Legislature of Sonora, Mexico adopted a \n     resolution calling on the federal government in Mexico to \n     permit emergency workers and vehicles to cross the \n     international border to fight such environmental and natural \n     disasters as long as they return to their country of origin \n     when the emergency subsides.\n       Whereas, authorizing emergency workers and equipment to \n     cross the international border requires action by the \n     President and Congress of the United States of America.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring, prays:\n       (1) That the President and Congress of the United States of \n     America recognize the importance of authorizing emergency \n     workers and equipment from the United States of America and \n     Mexico to cross their respective international borders \n     whenever an environmental or natural disaster threatens \n     communities on both sides;\n       (2) That the President and Congress of the United States of \n     America take the action necessary to authorize emergency \n     workers and equipment from the United States of America and \n     Mexico to cross their respective international borders \n     whenever an environmental or natural disaster threatens \n     communities on both sides as long as they return to their \n     country of origin when the emergency subsides; and\n       (3) That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona \n     transmit copies of this Memorial to the President of the \n     United States of America, the President of the United States \n     Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives and each Member of Congress from the State of \n     Arizona.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-370. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Utah relative to urging the Bush \n     Administration to support Taiwan's participation in the World \n     Health Organization; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 3\n\n       Whereas, the World Health Organization's (WHO) Constitution \n     states that ``The objective of the World Health Organization \n     shall be the attainment by all peoples of the highest \n     possible level of health'';\n       Whereas, this position demonstrates that the WHO is \n     obligated to reach all peoples throughout the world, \n     regardless of state or national boundaries;\n       Whereas, the WHO Constitution permits a wide variety of \n     entities, including nonmember states, international \n     organizations, national organizations, and nongovernmental \n     organizations, to participate in the activities of the WHO;\n       Whereas, five entities, for example, have acquired the \n     status of observer of the World Health Assembly (WHA) and are \n     routinely invited to its assemblies;\n       Whereas, both the WHO Constitution and the International \n     Covenant of Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) \n     declare that health is an essential element of human rights \n     and that no signatory shall impede on the health rights of \n     others;\n       Whereas, Taiwan seeks to be invited to participate in the \n     work of the WHA simply as an observer, instead of as a full \n     member, in order to allow the work of the WHO to proceed \n     without creating political frictions and to demonstrate \n     Taiwan's willingness to put aside political controversies for \n     the common good of global health;\n       Whereas, this request is fundamentally based on \n     professional health grounds and has nothing to do with the \n     political issues of sovereignty and statehood;\n       Whereas, Taiwan currently participates as a full member in \n     organizations like the World Trade Organization (WTO); Asia-\n     Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and several other \n     international organizations that count the People's Republic \n     of China among their membership;\n       Whereas, Taiwan has become an asset to all these \n     institutions because of a flexible interpretation of the \n     terms of membership;\n       Whereas, closing the gap between the WHO and Taiwan is an \n     urgent global health imperative;\n       Whereas, the health administration of Taiwan is the only \n     competent body possessing and managing all the information on \n     any outbreak in Taiwan of epidemics that could potentially \n     threaten global health;\n       Whereas, excluding Taiwan from the WHO's Global Outbreak \n     Alert and Response Network (GOARN), for example, is dangerous \n     and self defeating from a professional perspective;\n       Whereas, good health is a basic right for every citizen of \n     the world and access to the highest standard of health \n     information and services is necessary to help guarantee this \n     right;\n       Whereas, direct and unobstructed participation in \n     international health cooperation forums and programs is \n     therefore crucial, especially with today's greater potential \n     for the cross-border spread of various infectious diseases \n     through increased trade and travel;\n       Whereas, the WHO sets forth in the first chapter of its \n     charter the objectives of attaining the highest possible \n     level of health for all people;\n       Whereas, Taiwan's population of 23 million people is larger \n     than that of three quarters of the member states already in \n     the WHO and shares the noble goals of the organization;\n       Whereas, Taiwan's achievements in the field of health are \n     substantial, including one of the highest life expectancy \n     levels in Asia, maternal and infant mortality rates \n     comparable to those in western countries, the eradication of \n     such infectious diseases as cholera, smallpox, and the \n     plague, and the first country in the world to provide \n     children with free hepatitis B vaccinations;\n       Whereas, Taiwan is not allowed to participate in any WHO-\n     organized forums and workshops concerning the latest \n     technologies in the diagnosis, monitoring, and control of \n     diseases;\n       Whereas, in recent years, both the Taiwanese Government and \n     individual Taiwanese experts have expressed a willingness to \n     assist financially or technically in WHO-supported \n     international aid and health activities but have ultimately \n     been unable to render assistance;\n       Whereas, the WHO does allow observers to participate in the \n     activities of the organization; and\n       Whereas, in light of all the benefits that participation \n     could bring to the state of health of people not only in \n     Taiwan, but also regionally and globally, it seems \n     appropriate, if not imperative, for Taiwan to be involved \n     with the WHO: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the state of Utah urges the \n     Bush Administration to support Taiwan and its 23 million \n     people in obtaining appropriate and meaningful participation \n     in the World Health Organization (WHO); and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Senate urges that United States' policy \n     should include the pursuit of some initiative in the WHO \n     which would give Taiwan meaningful participation in a manner \n     that is consistent with the organization's requirements; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the United States Secretary \n     of State, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the \n     Majority Leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, the members of \n     Utah's congressional delegation, the Government of Taiwan, \n     and the World Health Organization.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-371.

and\n       Whereas, The World Health Organization (WHO) set forth, in \n     the first chapter of its charter, the objective of attaining \n     the highest possible level of health for all people; and\n       Whereas, The House of Representatives of the Commonwealth \n     of Pennsylvania is justly proud to support the participation \n     of Taiwan in the role of observer in the World Health \n     Organization in the upcoming World Health Assembly (WHA) at \n     its annual summit to be held in Geneva, Switzerland in May \n     2006; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan's population of more than 23 million is \n     larger than that of 75% of the current WHO member states; and\n       Whereas, The United States, in the 1994 Taiwan Policy \n     Review, declared its intention to support Taiwan's \n     participation in appropriate international organizations; and\n       Whereas, The State Department, in its report to the \n     Congress of the United States in April 2005, reaffirmed \n     United States support of Taiwan's observer status in the WHA; \n     and\n       Whereas, Fifty-three members of the United States House of \n     Representatives wrote a letter to Secretary of State \n     Condoleezza Rice on December 16, 2005, expressing their \n     support of observer status for Taiwan at the annual meeting \n     of the WHA; and\n       Whereas, The United States Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention and its Taiwanese counterpart have enjoyed close \n     collaboration on a wide range of public health issues; and\n       Whereas, In recent years Taiwan has expressed a willingness \n     to assist financially and technically in international aid \n     and health activities supported by the WHO; and\n       Whereas, The government and the people of Taiwan have been \n     actively engaged in various activities in the fields of \n     medical assistance and humanitarian relief to countries in \n     Africa, Asia, Central America and the Caribbean in such \n     places as Afghanistan, Chad, El Salvador, Honduras and \n     Liberia and have contributed financial resources to global \n     relief efforts and to combat disease around the world; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan's participation in international health \n     forums and programs is critical, especially with today's \n     greater potential for the cross-border spread of various \n     infectious diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus \n     (HIV), tuberculosis and malaria; and\n       Whereas, Recent outbreaks of the lethal avian flu and \n     severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in East Asia and \n     Southeast Asia have caused panic around the world and have \n     accentuated the importance of Taiwan's participation in \n     international health forums and the inherent danger of \n     nonparticipation; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan's substantial achievements in the field of \n     health include having one of the highest life expectancy \n     levels in Asia and having low maternal and infant mortality \n     rates, eradicating such infectious diseases as cholera, \n     smallpox and plague and being the first to eradicate polio \n     and to provide children with hepatitis B vaccinations;

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah relative to encouraging school boards to \n     adopt policy prohibiting bullying; to the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 1\n\n       Whereas, school bullying, harassment, and intimidation \n     greatly reduce a student's ability to both achieve and \n     surpass academic standards in Utah;\n       Whereas, school bullying, harassment and intimidation can \n     directly affect a student's health and well-being and thus \n     contribute to excess absences from school, physical sickness, \n     mental and emotional anguish, and long-term social and mental \n     consequences;\n       Whereas, bullying, harassment; and intimidation can take \n     physical, verbal, and written forms, including use of \n     electronic media;\n       Whereas, it is long past time for not only society, but \n     also for each community in Utah, down to the individual \n     school community level, to acknowledge that bullying is not \n     some sort of right of passage to be simply ignored or \n     tolerated;\n       Whereas, incidents of reported school-related bullying in \n     the state and throughout the nation are ample evidence of the \n     need for intervention;\n       Whereas, many bullies eventually end up with criminal \n     records and are involved in abusive relationships because \n     they have not learned appropriate social behavior;\n       Whereas, it is within the goals and dictates of the state's \n     public education system to provide a healthy, positive, and \n     safe learning atmosphere for all Utah children in the state's \n     public schools;\n       Whereas, many schools across the state are already engaged \n     in prevention efforts, including Utah's K-12 prevention \n     program, Prevention Dimensions;\n       Whereas, these programs emphasize assessment of the \n     prevalence of bullying incidents and preventive, early \n     intervention strategies; and\n       Whereas, with the help of local school boards, school \n     districts and school personnel, parents, and concerned \n     individuals, school bullying can be effectively addressed: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, express its condemnation of \n     bullying, harassment, and intimidation in Utah schools. Be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor urge school \n     districts, concerned parents, the members of the Utah \n     Substance Abuse and Anti-Violence Coordinating Council, and \n     the members of the Utah Education Coalition, which includes \n     the State Board of Education, the Utah Education Association, \n     the Utah Parent Teacher Association, the Utah School \n     Employees Association, the Utah Association of Elementary \n     School Principals, the Utah Association of Secondary School \n     Principals, the Utah School Boards Association, the Utah \n     State Office of Education, and the Utah School \n     Superintendents Association to work together to further \n     define and understand the multiple aspects of bullying and \n     effectively utilize systems for reporting school-related \n     bullying incidents. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor call upon \n     school districts, concerned parents, the members of Utah \n     Education Coalition, and the members of the Utah Substance \n     Abuse and Anti-Violence Coordinating Council to respond to \n     school-related bullying incidents by implementing a program \n     where victims of bullying can be identified and assisted, and \n     perpetrators educated, in order to create safer schools that \n     provide a positive learning environment. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor encourage \n     these groups to come together to form a coalition whose goal \n     would be to bring about, through education and other means, \n     the end of bullying, harassment, and intimidation in the \n     states public schools. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     State Board of Education, the Utah Education Association, the \n     Utah Parent Teacher Association, the Utah School Employees \n     Association, the Utah Association of Elementary School \n     Principals, the Utah Association of Secondary School \n     Principals, the Utah School Boards Association, the Utah \n     State Office of Education, the Utah School Superintendents \n     Association, the Utah Substance Abuse and Anti-Violence \n     Coordinating Council, each public school district in the \n     state of Utah, and the Utah Charter School Association.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-381. A joint resolution by the Legislature of the State \n     of Utah relative to recognizing the rights of public school \n     students to voluntarily participate in religious expression \n     in public schools; to the Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 9\n\n       Whereas, a firm understanding of the proper and lawful role \n     of religious expression is requisite to full participation in \n     public institutions;\n       Whereas, a state of confusion and in some cases fear among \n     the general citizenry exists as to the proper role of \n     religious expression in public schools and other public \n     settings;\n       Whereas, the free exercise of religion is a fundamental \n     right guaranteed by both the United States Constitution and \n     the Utah Constitution;\n       Whereas, the freedom of speech is a fundamental right \n     guaranteed by both the United States Constitution and the \n     Utah Constitution;\n       Whereas, the First Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution states, ``Congress shall make no law respecting \n     an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free \n     exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of \n     the press; or the right of the people peaceably to \n     assemble'';\n       Whereas, the Utah Constitution states, ``The rights of \n     conscience shall never be infringed. The State shall make no \n     law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting \n     the free exercise thereof; . . . There shall be no union of \n     Church and State, nor shall any church dominate the State or \n     interfere with its functions. No public money or property \n     shall be appropriated for or applied to any religious \n     worship, exercise or instruction, or for the support of any \n     ecclesiastical establishment.'';\n       Whereas, the Utah Constitution also states: ``No law shall \n     be passed to abridge or restrain the freedom of speech or of \n     the press'';\n       Whereas, prayer is fundamental to the exercise of both \n     religion and free speech;\n       Whereas, courts have upheld the right of students to \n     spontaneously and nondisruptively pray in school settings, \n     and school administrators and teachers are in no way \n     permitted to discourage such religious expression, including \n     prayer, by a student;\n       Whereas, in the classroom, instruction covering religious \n     subject matter is permitted, provided the teacher does not \n     advocate religion in general or one or more religions in \n     particular;\n       Whereas, students participating in the singing of songs \n     that are religious in theme, and expressions often related to \n     holidays that are ``religious in nature, also enjoy legal \n     protection under the state and federal constitutions;\n       Whereas, the courts have established a three-part test for \n     determining if a government action violates the establishment \n     of religion clause of the First Amendment to the United \n     States Constitution: (1) the government action must have a \n     secular (nonreligious) purpose; (2) the government action's \n     primary purpose must not be to inhibit or to advance \n     religion; and (3) there must be no excessive entanglement \n     between government and religion; and\n       Whereas, the United States Supreme Court has ruled the \n     union-of-church-and-state ban applies only to circumstances \n     that join a particular religious denomination and the state \n     so that the two function in tandem on an ongoing basis: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah \n     recognizes the right of public school students to voluntarily \n     participate in prayer, and also in the singing of songs and \n     in expressions related to holidays that are religious in \n     nature, in public schools, within known legal limits of \n     religious expression, tolerance, civility, and dignity as \n     contemplated by this nation's founders. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent annually \n     to each student currently enrolled in Utah's public schools, \n     each parent of a student currently enrolled in Utah's public \n     schools, the Utah Parent Teacher Association, the Utah \n     Education Association, the Utah State Board of Education, the \n     Utah State Office of Education, the Utah Association of \n     Counties, and the Utah League of Cities and Towns.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-382. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Hawaii relative to providing states with the \n     necessary funding to implement the goals of the No Child Left \n     Behind Act of 2001 and other education-related programs; to \n     the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 104\n\n       Whereas, the State of Hawaii has long pursued the goal of \n     improving the academic performance of all students, \n     especially those of minority racial and ethnic backgrounds, \n     lower economic status, and limited English proficiency, and \n     those with learning disabilities or challenges; and\n       Whereas, the State of Hawaii, therefore, applauds the \n     President of the United States and Congress for setting the \n     same goals in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, and \n     emphasizing the urgency in closing the achievement gaps for \n     these students; and\n       Whereas, the No Child Left Behind Act has encouraged some \n     needed changes in public education and was initially \n     accompanied by relatively large increases in federal funding \n     for public elementary and secondary education; and\n       Whereas, the increases in federal funding since the first \n     year of implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act have \n     been minimal and insufficient to meet its requirements; and\n       Whereas, the federal government has decreased funding for \n     programs implementing the No Child Left Behind Act in fiscal \n     year 2006 by almost $800,000,000, and for overall public \n     education by $606,000,000, including cuts of more than \n     $165,000,000 from postsecondary education and over \n     $20,000,000 from programs for students with disabilities: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S7917]]\n\n       Resolved, by the Senate of the Twenty-third Legislature of \n     the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2006, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, That the Hawaii Legislature urges \n     the President of the United States and United States Congress \n     to make a serious commitment to improving the quality of the \n     nation's public schools by substantially increasing its \n     funding for implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act, \n     the Higher Education Act, the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act, and other education-related programs; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the State of Hawaii requests that in any \n     year that federal funding for public elementary and secondary \n     education is decreased, the President, United States \n     Congress, and the United States Department of Education \n     create flexibility in No Child Left Behind Act requirements \n     through the use of state waivers, exemptions, or other \n     mechanisms; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States, the President Pro Tempore of the United States \n     Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the United States Secretary of Education, \n     and Hawaii's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-383. A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado relative to requesting the United \n     States Senate to pass the ``Stem Cell Research Enhancement \n     Act of 2005''; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \n     and Pensions.\n\n                   House Joint Resolution No. 06-1034\n\n       Whereas, In May 2005, by a bipartisan vote of 238 to 194, \n     the United States House of Representatives passed H.R. 810, \n     the ``Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005'', and the \n     bill is currently pending in the United States Senate; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 810 would authorize research using embryonic \n     stem cells only if the stem cells are derived from human \n     embryos that have been donated from in-vitro fertilization \n     clinics, are created for the purpose of fertility treatment, \n     and are in excess of the clinical need of the individuals \n     seeking such treatment; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 810 would further require that it be \n     determined that the human embryos used for research are ones \n     that would never be implanted in a woman and would otherwise \n     be discarded, and that the individuals donating the human \n     embryos give written, informed consent to the donation and do \n     not receive any financial or other inducements to make the \n     donation; and\n       Whereas, Stem cell research offers the opportunity to \n     discover cures and treatments for diseases such as \n     Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, ALS, diabetes, spinal cord injury, \n     and many others; and\n       Whereas, We have a responsibility to ensure that this \n     research proceeds with ethical safeguards and strict \n     guidelines, and, by permitting research only on excess \n     embryos created in the in-vitro fertilization process and \n     establishing a clear, voluntary consent process for donors, \n     H.R 810 meets this responsibility; and\n       Whereas, Senator Bill Frist, Senate Majority leader, noted, \n     ``While human embryonic stem cell research is still at a very \n     early stage, the limitations put in place in 2001 will, over \n     time, slow our ability to bring potential new treatments for \n     certain diseases. Therefore, I believe the President's policy \n     should be modified'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Sixty-\n     fifth General Assembly of the State of Colorado, the Senate \n     concurring herein; That the General Assembly of the state of \n     Colorado requests the United States Senate to move \n     expeditiously to pass H.R. 810 and urges all members of the \n     United States Senate to vote in favor of H.R. 810; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Joint Resolution be sent to \n     the President and Vice-President of the United States, the \n     Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate, the Colorado \n     Senate delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-384.

A concurrent memorial adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Arizona \n     relative to permanently repealing the death tax, dissolving \n     United States Membership in the United Nations, and removing \n     specific areas relating to faith from the jurisdiction of the \n     United States Supreme Court; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                   House Concurrent Memorial No. 2011\n\n       Whereas, under tax relief legislation passed in 2001, the \n     death tax was temporarily phased out but not permanently \n     eliminated; and\n       Whereas, farmers and other small business owners will face \n     losing their farms and businesses if the federal government \n     resumes the heavy taxation of citizens at death; and\n       Whereas, this is a tax that is particularly damaging to \n     families who are working their way up the ladder and trying \n     to accumulate wealth for the first time; and\n       Whereas, employees suffer layoffs when small and medium \n     businesses are liquidated to pay death taxes; and\n       Whereas, if the death tax had been repealed in 1996, the \n     United States economy would have realized billions of dollars \n     of extra output each year and an average of 145,000 \n     additional new jobs would have been created; and\n       Whereas, having repeatedly passed in the United States \n     House of Representatives and Senate, repeal of the death tax \n     holds wide bipartisan support.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring, prays:\n       That the Congress of the United States immediately and \n     permanently repeal the death tax.\n       Your memorialist respectfully represents:\n       Whereas, the United States of America became an \n     independent, sovereign nation for the reasons expressed in \n     the Declaration of Independence and as the result of a bloody \n     war to achieve its independence: and\n       Whereas, the Constitution of the United States of America \n     is, and rightfully must remain, the Supreme Law of the Land; \n     and\n\n[[Page S7918]]\n\n       Whereas, the Constitution of the United States of America \n     provides for limited, non-delegable and diffused powers of \n     governments that are separated among the Congress, the \n     President and the judiciary and that preserve the powers and \n     duties of the individual states and the people; and\n       Whereas, the Constitution of the United States of America \n     guarantees personal liberties of each individual citizen; and\n       Whereas, the Charter of the United Nations purports to \n     supersede the independence and sovereignty of the United \n     States and the Constitution of the United States of America \n     and to usurp powers delegated in the Constitution by:\n       1. Concentrating in the United Nations Security Council \n     control and use of certain American military personnel and \n     the military personnel of all member nations for its own \n     purposes without any accountability and in violation of the \n     exclusive power of the United States Congress to declare war.\n       2. Seeking authority to tax citizens of the United States \n     and other member nations directly to support United Nations \n     activities.\n       3. Sponsoring and extending to all nations, whether \n     signatories or not, an International Criminal Court that \n     violates the rights of the accused as well as the \n     Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights; and\n       Whereas, the oil-for-food effort in Iraq has been a global \n     scandal that has enriched Saddam Hussein and his inner \n     circle, leaving the Iraqi people further deprived, and has \n     further enabled him to acquire arms and munitions that have \n     been used against United States forces, all having occurred \n     while under the supervision of the United Nations; and\n       Whereas, Congressman Ron Paul of Texas has introduced a \n     bill in Congress that is known as the American Sovereignty \n     Restoration Act of 2005. This important legislation, H.R. \n     1146, would end the membership of the United States in the \n     United Nations; and\n       Whereas, the only benefit to the United States of America \n     to belong to the United Nations is that we have veto \n     authority on the Security Council to protect our allies, such \n     as the Nation of Israel; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 1146 would repeal the United Nations \n     Participation Act of 1945, the United Nations Headquarters \n     Agreement Act and various other related laws. The bill would \n     prevent the authorization of further monies for United \n     Nations military operations and would terminate the \n     participation of the United States in United Nations \n     peacekeeping operations; and\n       Whereas, the Constitution and bylaws of the United Nations \n     frequently conflict with the Constitution and laws of the \n     United States. Over the years, past presidents have \n     unconstitutionally transferred their authority to United \n     Nations commanders without the consent of Congress; and\n       Whereas, the enactment of H.R. 1146, the American \n     Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2005, would end the usurpation \n     of American powers by the United Nations and would reaffirm \n     the sovereignty of the United States.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring, prays:\n       That upon such time that the United States of America \n     ceases to use its veto authority on the United Nations \n     Security Council to protect Israel, the Congress of the \n     United States take immediate steps to ensure the passage of \n     H.R. 1146, the American Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2005, \n     and take any other measures necessary to dissolve the \n     membership of the United States in the United Nations.\n       Your memorialist also respectfully represents:\n       Whereas, on June 27, 2005, the United States Supreme Court, \n     in two razor thin majorities of 5-4 concluded that it is \n     consistent with the First Amendment to display the Ten \n     Commandments in an outdoor public square in Texas, but not on \n     the courthouse walls of two counties in Kentucky; and\n       Whereas, many Americans are deeply puzzled as to how the \n     Court could produce two opposite results involving the same \n     Ten Commandments; and\n       Whereas, it is appropriate to observe that, based on the \n     Kentucky decision, it is acceptable to display the Ten \n     Commandments in a county courthouse, provided you do not \n     believe in God; and\n       Whereas. Justice Scalia, in the Kentucky case, used these \n     words to emphasize the importance of the Ten Commandments to \n     most Americans: ``The three most popular religions in the \n     United States, Christianity, Judaism and Islam--which \n     combined account for 97.7% of all believers--are monotheistic \n     . . . [a]ll of them, moreover (Islam included), believe that \n     the Ten Commandments were given by God to Moses, and are \n     divine prescriptions for a virtuous life''; and\n       Whereas, very recent polling data by a major Washington, \n     D.C. paper revealed that a huge majority of the American \n     people supports posting the Ten Commandments; and\n       Whereas, S520 and HR1070 are bills that would allow the \n     display of the Commandments in public places in America. The \n     operative language provides: ``. . . [t]he Supreme Court \n     shall not have jurisdiction to review, by appeal, writ of \n     certiorari, or otherwise, any matter to the extent that \n     relief is sought against an entity of Federal, State, or \n     local government, or against an officer or agent of Federal, \n     State, or local government (whether or not acting in official \n     or personal capacity), concerning that entity's, officer's, \n     or agent's acknowledgment of God as the sovereign source of \n     law, liberty, or government''; and\n       Whereas, hearings were held on the same language in June \n     2004 in the Constitution, Civil Rights and Property Rights \n     Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Hearings were \n     also held on this language in September 2004 in the Courts \n     Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee: and\n       Whereas, former Chief Justice Rehnquist, in the Texas case, \n     used the following words to describe the obvious duplicity of \n     the United States Supreme Court in telling local governments \n     in America that they may not display the Ten Commandments in \n     local buildings in their communities while at the same time \n     allowing the Ten Commandments to be present on the building \n     housing the United States Supreme Court: ``Since 1935, Moses \n     has stood, holding two tablets that reveal portions of the \n     Ten Commandments written in Hebrew, among other lawgivers in \n     the south frieze. Representations of the Ten Commandments \n     adorn the metal gates lining the north and south sides of the \n     Courtroom as well as the doors leading into the Courtroom. \n     Moses also sits on the exterior east facade of the building \n     holding the Ten Commandments tablets.''; and\n       Whereas, the Kentucky decision will be used by litigants \n     who want to remove God from the public square in America. \n     Sooner or later, this effort will take place in our states. \n     Reports have indicated that efforts to remove the Ten \n     Commandments from public buildings or public parks are now \n     underway in at least twenty-five different places in America.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring, prays:\n       That the United States Congress adopt S520 and HR1070, and \n     in so doing, protect the ability of the people of this state \n     and nation to display the Ten Commandments in public \n     buildings, to express their faith in public, to retain God in \n     the Pledge of Allegiance and in the national motto, and to \n     use article III, section 2.2, United States Constitution, to \n     remove these areas from the jurisdiction of the United States \n     Supreme Court.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring, prays:\n       That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona \n     transmit copies of this Memorial to the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives and each Member of Congress from the State \n     of Arizona.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-387. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to making the Republic of Poland eligible for the \n     United States Department of State Visa Waiver Program; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                          House Resolution 269\n\n       Whereas, The Republic of Poland is a free, democratic, and \n     independent nation. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 paved \n     the way for Poland to break free from Soviet control and \n     pursue its own destiny. In 1999, the United States and the \n     Republic of Poland became formal allies when Poland was \n     granted membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. \n     Since that historic occasion, the Republic of Poland has \n     proven to be an indispensable ally in the global campaign \n     against terrorism. Poland actively participated in Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom and the Iraqi reconstruction mission, shedding \n     blood along with American military personnel; and\n       Whereas, From the beginning of Poland's new independence, \n     the Polish people have expressed their wishes for close ties \n     with America. On April 15, 1991, the Republic of Poland \n     unilaterally repealed the visa obligation for United States \n     citizens traveling to Poland. The United States has not \n     reciprocated this gesture. Our Department of State's Visa \n     Waiver Program currently allows citizens from 27 countries to \n     travel to the United States for tourism or business for up to \n     90 days without first obtaining visas for entry. The \n     countries that currently participate in the Visa Waiver \n     Program include Andorra, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brunei, \n     Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, \n     Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, \n     New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, San Marino, Singapore, \n     Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom; \n     and\n       Whereas, the President of the United States and other high \n     ranking officials have rightly described Poland as ``one of \n     our closest friends.'' After emerging from five decades of \n     foreign domination, the people of Poland have made great \n     strides in building a free and prosperous nation to stand by \n     America's side in the great struggle of our day. It is \n     appropriate that the Republic of Poland be made eligible for \n     the United States Department of State Visa Waiver Program: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the President of the United States and the United \n     States Congress to make the Republic of Poland eligible for \n     the United States Department of State Visa Waiver Program; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, the members of the Michigan congressional \n     delegation, and the Ambassador of the Republic of Poland to \n     the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-388.

to the Committee on \n     the Judiciary.\n\n                           Senate Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the struggle to establish democracy and secure the \n     rights and liberties of Americans began in Massachusetts; and\n       Whereas, the Declaration of Rights of the inhabitants of \n     the Commonwealth of Massachusetts was the first enumeration \n     of the civil rights and liberties of Americans, provided a \n     model for the United States Constitution and its Bill of \n     Rights, and continues to serve the Citizens of the \n     Commonwealth; and\n       Whereas, every duly elected public official in \n     Massachusetts has sworn to uphold the Constitution of the \n     United States and the Constitution of the Commonwealth; and\n       Whereas, in response to the terrorist attacks of September \n     11, 2001, the United States Congress passed, without public \n     hearings and with little debate, the USA PATRIOT Act (Public \n     Law 107-56), provisions of which threaten the fundamental \n     rights and liberties of citizens and non-citizens; and\n       Whereas, through executive orders, changes in procedures, \n     and other actions, the United States Department of Justice \n     has adopted practices which infringe upon the rights and \n     liberties of citizens and non-citizens;

and\n       Whereas, on November 2, 2004, in the 9 State legislative \n     districts where it appeared on the ballot, voters approved, \n     by overwhelming margins, a referendum question requesting \n     legislators to support a Massachusetts resolution asserting \n     that the campaign against terrorism should not be waged at \n     the expense of civil rights and liberties, and to support \n     legislation barring the use of State resources for racial and \n     religious profiling, for secret investigations without \n     reasonable grounds, and for maintaining files on individuals \n     and organizations without reasonable suspicion of criminal \n     conduct; and\n       Whereas, the States of Alaska, Hawaii, Vermont, Maine, \n     Montana, Idaho and Colorado have passed resolutions opposing \n     provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act and Federal practices which \n     threaten our civil liberties; and\n       Whereas, in recent testimony and through legislative \n     initiatives, the United States Department of Justice has \n     indicated an intention to seek even greater powers of \n     surveillance, investigation and prosecution; now there be it\n       Resolved, That the Massachusetts State Senate hereby \n     affirms the rights and liberties of the people of \n     Massachusetts and our system of checks and balances as \n     specified in the United States Constitution, the Bill of \n     Rights, and the Constitution of the Commonwealth of \n     Massachusetts; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Massachusetts State Senate hereby \n     affirms that measures taken to protect our local and national \n     security must be guided by and must respect principles of \n     American liberty and the rights of persons as enshrined in \n     the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the \n     United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Massachusetts State Senate hereby \n     requests that the State and local law enforcement authorities \n     refrain from actions that impinge and infringe upon and \n     violate constitutional rights, such as racial and religious \n     profiling, conducting warrantless searches and maintaining \n     files on individuals and organizations without reasonable \n     suspicion of criminal conduct; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Massachusetts State Senate hereby urges \n     the United States Congress to allow to sunset, to repeal or \n     to amend those sections of the USA PATRIOT Act which allow \n     the executive branch to infringe upon the rights and \n     liberties of persons as specified in the United States \n     Constitution, the Bill of Rights and the Constitution of the \n     Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and to oppose any additional \n     legislation that would infringe upon these rights and \n     liberties; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Massachusetts State Senate hereby urges \n     the United States Department of Justice and other Federal \n     agencies and departments to refrain from any investigations, \n     procedures or prosecutions which infringe upon the liberties \n     of persons as specified in the United States Constitution, \n     the Bill of Rights and the Constitution of the Commonwealth \n     of Massachusetts, or which single out individuals for legal \n     scrutiny or enforcement activity based upon their race, \n     religion, ethnicity or country of origin;

We should \n     consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity with our \n     debts, and morally bound to pay for them ourselves.''; and\n       Whereas state legislatures overwhelmingly recognize the \n     necessity of maintaining a balanced budget; whether through \n     constitutional requirement or by statute, 49 states require a \n     balanced budget; and\n       Whereas in promoting the broadest principles of a \n     government of, by, and for the people, one of the core \n     functions of the United States Constitution is to enumerate \n     and limit federal power; and\n       Whereas the federal government's unlimited ability to \n     borrow involves decisions of such magnitude, with such \n     potentially profound consequences for the nation and its \n     people, today and in the future, that it is an appropriate \n     subject for limitation by the United States Constitution; and\n       Whereas the United States Constitution vests the ultimate \n     responsibility to approve or disapprove amendments to the \n     Constitution with the people of the several states, as \n     represented by their elected legislatures: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the One Hundred Fourth General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee, the House of \n     Representatives Concurring, that we hereby strongly urge the \n     United States Congress to propose, adopt, and submit to the \n     states for ratification an amendment to the United States \n     Constitution requiring a balanced federal budget on an annual \n     basis, except in times of extreme national emergency; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, that an enrolled copy of this resolution be \n     transmitted to the President and the Secretary of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker and the Clerk of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and each member of Tennessee's \n     Congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-392.

A bill to establish a grant program to provide vision care \nto children, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, children endure a lot. They cannot always \ntell us what is wrong. Often they do not know themselves. So it takes a \nspecial person to work with young people and help identify their \nproblems. Every child deserves the opportunity to reach their full \npotential, but it takes more than a bookbag full of pencils, paper, \nbooks and rulers to equip children with the tools necessary to succeed \nin school.\n  The most important tool kids will take to school is their eyes. Good \nvision is critical to learning. Eighty percent of what kids learn in \ntheir early school years is visual. Unfortunately, we overlook that \nfact sometimes. According to the CDC only one in three children receive \nany form of preventive vision care before entering school. That means \nmany kids are in school right now with an undetected vision problem. \nOne in four children has a vision problem that can interfere with \nlearning. Some children are even labeled ``disruptive'' or thought to \nhave a learning disability when the real reason for their difficulty is \nan undetected vision problem.\n  Without any vision care, some of our children will continue to fall \nthrough the cracks. I sympathize with these kids because I suffer from \npermanent vision loss in one eye as a result of undiagnosed Amblyopia \nin childhood. Amblyopia is the No. 1 cause of vision loss in young \nAmericans. If discovered and treated early, vision loss from Amblyopia \ncan be largely prevented. Had I been identified and treated before I \nentered school, I could have avoided a lifetime of vision loss. Parents \nare not always aware that their child may suffer from a vision problem. \nBy educating parents on the importance of vision care and recognizing \nsigns of visual impairment we can help children avoid unnecessary \nvision loss.\n  To ensure that children get the vital vision care that they need to \nsucceed, today I am introducing the Vision Care for Kids Act of 2006 \nwhich will establish a grant program to complement and encourage \nexisting state efforts to improve children's vision care. More \nspecifically, grant funds will be used to: (1) provide comprehensive \neye exams to children that have been previously identified as needing \nsuch services; (2) provide treatment or services necessary to correct \nvision problems identified in that eye exam; and (3) develop and \ndisseminate educational materials to recognize the signs of visual \nimpairment in children for parents, teachers, and health care \npractitioners.\n  We need to do this. We must improve vision care for children to \nbetter equip them to succeed in school and in life. The Vision Care for \nKids Act, endorsed by the American Academy of Ophthalmology, American \nOptometric Association, and Vision Council of America, will make a \ndifference in the lives of children across the country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 3688. A bill to preserve the Mount Soledad Veterans Memorial in \nSan Diego, California, by providing for the immediate acquisition of \nthe memorial by the United States; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr President, today I am introducing legislation to \npreserve the Mount Soledad Veterans Memorial in San Diego, CA. I am \npleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Graham.\n  Since 1913, a series of crosses have stood on top of Mount Soledad, \nproperty owned by the city of San Diego. In April of 1954, the site was \ndesignated to commemorate the sacrifices made by members of the Armed \nForces who served in World War II, as well as the Korean war.\n  In 1989, one individual filed suit against the city claiming that the \ndisplay of the cross by he city was unconstitutional and, therefore, \nviolated his civil rights. In 1991, a Federal judge issued an \ninjunction prohibiting the permanent display of the cross on city \nproperty. Since that time, the city has repeatedly tried to divest \nitself of the property through sale or donation. But the plaintiff \ncontinued to mount legal challenges to every attempted property \ntransfer--revealing that his true objection is not to the city's \ndisplay of the cross, but to the cross itself. The legal wrangling over \nthis memorial continues today.\n  The Mount Soledad Memorial is a remarkably popular landmark. On two \ndifferent occasions, the voters of San Diego passed, by votes of 76 \npercent, ballot measures designed to transfer the property to entities \nthat could maintain it.\n  I do not believe that the Mount Soledad cross violates the \nConstitution. Consequently, I do not believe there is just cause for \nremoving it from its position as the centerpiece of the\n\n[[Page S7923]]\n\nSoledad Veterans Memorial. Therefore, given the many years of legal \ndisputes regarding this issue, I believe it is past time it is \nresolved.\n  The bill I am introducing would bring the Mount Soledad cross under \nthe control of the Federal Government, and specifically the Department \nof Defense. The process set forth in the bill is consistent with \nanalysis provided by the Department of Justice's Office of Legislative \nAffairs in a recent letter to the chairman of the House Armed Services \nCommittee. In that letter, the OLA stated, ``we would . . . point out \nthat Congress could enact the necessary authority [to acquire the Mount \nSoledad Memorial] through an immediate legislative taking. . .''\n  This bill would allow for the just compensation for the property in \nquestion. It also would address the required maintenance for the \nmemorial and the surrounding property through a memorandum of \nunderstanding between the Secretary of Defense and the Mount Soledad \nMemorial Association. The minimal financial commitment required in this \nlegislation will ensure the endurance of this memorial which serves as \na reminder of the hundreds of thousands of men and women who made \nenormous sacrifices when our country called upon them.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation, \nwhich will ensure the preservation of an important tribute to our men \nand women of the Armed Forces.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS:\n  S. 3689. A bill to establish a national historic country store \npreservation and revitalization program; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have long been a proponent of measures \nthat support historic preservation and economic development. In keeping \nwith that tradition, I rise today to introduce the National Historic \nCountry Store Preservation and Revitalization Act of 2006.\n  This bill establishes a national program to support historic country \nstore preservation and will aid in the revitalization of rural villages \nand community centers nationwide.\n  For many Americans, the country store brings to mind days that have \nsince passed, before much of this country became stamped with shopping \nmalls and the ``big-box'' store. But for thousands of people living in \nVermont and for millions more living in rural communities across the \nUnited States, a visit to the local country store is a regular part of \none's daily life.\n  In my hometown of Shrewsbury, VT, the Pierce Store was the hub of our \nsmall community when my wife Liz and I settled there in 1963. Run by \nthe four Pierce siblings--Marjorie, Glendon, Marion and Gordon--the \nstore was the place to go for a neighborly chat as much as for your \nmilk and butter. Unfortunately, the Pierce Store closed its doors some \nyears back and Shrewsbury lost a vital part of its identity.\n  Yet while some country stores have been forced to close their doors, \nothers have shown incredible resiliency.\n  They have survived floods and fires, overcome economic downturns, and \nreformulated their inventories to meet modern needs. According to the \nVermont Grocers' Association, country stores account for an estimated \n$55 million annually in retail sales in Vermont alone.\n  But with increased competition and additional costs to maintain aging \nstructures, today's remaining country store owners are hard-pressed to \novercome these unprecedented challenges.\n  My legislation authorizes the U.S. Economic Development \nAdministration to make grants to national, state and local agencies and \nnon-profit organizations to support historic country store preservation \nefforts. In addition, the bill establishes a revolving loan fund. The \nfund will be used for research, restoration work that will improve our \nunderstanding of existing needs and provide the assistance required to \naddress them. The bill promotes the study of best practices for \npreserving structures, improving profitability and promoting \ncollaboration among country store owners.\n  My legislation unites small business development and historic \npreservation principles to sustain these invaluable community \ninstitutions. I encourage my colleagues to join me in my efforts to \nprotect our rural heritage by preventing the further loss of our \nNation's historic country stores.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3689\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Historic Country \n     Store Preservation and Revitalization Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) historic country stores are lasting icons of rural \n     tradition in the United States;\n       (2) historic country stores are valuable contributors to \n     the civic and economic vitality of their local communities;\n       (3) historic country stores demonstrate innovative \n     approaches to historic preservation and small business \n     practices;\n       (4) historic country stores are threatened by larger \n     competitors and the costs associated with maintaining older \n     structures; and\n       (5) the United States should--\n       (A) collect and disseminate information concerning the \n     number, condition, and variety of historic country stores;\n       (B) develop opportunities for cooperation among proprietors \n     of historic country stores; and\n       (C) promote the long-term economic viability of historic \n     country stores through the provision of financial assistance \n     to historic country stores.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Small Business Act, to reform and \nreauthorize the National Veterans Business Development Corporation, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, I am joined today by my colleagues \nSenators Snowe, Akaka, and Talent to introduce the Veterans Corporation \nReauthorization Act of 2006.\n  This legislation is the product of lengthy bipartisan discussions \nabout how we might be able to restore and revitalize the mission of The \nVeterans Corporation. Established in 1999 through Public Law 106-50, \nThe National Veterans Business Development Corporation, commonly known \nas The Veterans Corporation, TVC, is charged with the task of assisting \nthe men and women who have served this country in the military by \nhelping them create and expand their own businesses. There are over 5 \nmillion veteran entrepreneurs across the country--over 550,000 in the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts alone--and approximately 200,000 veterans \nare expected to retire in 2006. Additionally, 2004 data from the Small \nBusiness Administration, SBA, shows that approximately 22 percent of \nveterans in the U.S. household\n\n[[Page S7925]]\n\npopulation purchased or started a new business, or were considering \ndoing so. This legislation ensures that necessary steps are taken to \ncontinue fostering entrepreneurship and business ownership among a \nveterans population that can clearly benefit from such assistance \nnationwide.\n  My distinguished colleagues and I feel that TVC is an organization \nworth reinvigorating. In fiscal year 2005, TVC reached out to over \n18,000 current and potential veteran entrepreneurs, and opened three \nVeteran Business Resource Centers in Boston, MA; Flint, MI; and San \nDiego, CA, in addition to the flagship location in St. Louis, MO. In my \nhome State of Massachusetts, TVC has close to 100 business owners and \nover 400 registered members.\n  Yet, in recent years, TVC has come under criticism for its overall \nperformance. Many within the veterans community, and indeed some of my \ncolleagues in Congress, do not believe TVC has produced results that \nwarrant the millions of dollars in funding the organization has \nreceived. I understand this sentiment, and share in the desire to \nensure taxpayer dollars are well-spent. This was among my primary \nconcerns as we approached reauthorizing TVC. However, my colleagues and \nI came to the conclusion that by reauthorizing the organization, \nCongress could ensure greater oversight and accountability on the part \nof TVC and its use of Federal dollars--ultimately resulting in better \nservice for our veterans. This is exactly what the Veterans Corporation \nReauthorization Act of 2006 aims to do.\n  This legislation builds on the preexisting TVC program in order to \nexpand its reach nationwide, so that more veterans can have the tools \nthey need to realize their entrepreneurial aspirations. Through a \nseries of provisions that target the weaknesses of TVC and develop \nsound policies to strengthen them and clarify the organization's \nmission within the veterans community it serves, this bill makes \nseveral key improvements to the corporation.\n  In its inception, we envisioned that TVC would establish centers \nacross the country to help assist veteran entrepreneurs with their \nsmall business needs. Unfortunately, the organization has shifted its \nprimary focus toward the development of online programs in recent \nyears. Although it is a good thing that TVC has four centers across the \ncountry, clearly more needs to be done to build upon these and develop \na substantial number of new centers and networking opportunities for \nveterans nationwide. That is why this bill clarifies the role TVC \nshould have in local communities. In rewriting the purpose of TVC in \nthis capacity, our legislation explicitly states that the organization \nshould be actively working to form more centers in order to build and \ncreate a national network linking veterans to the information, \ncounseling, and assistance they need in starting and maintaining their \nbusinesses.\n  A recurring frustration that echoes from many veterans nationwide is \nthat they are often unable to gain access to the Federal contracting \nand procurement realm. It is downright shameful that so many servicemen \nand women feel as though a government they fought so hard to protect \nall but abandons them--continuing to award myriad contracts to big \nbusinesses. By law, the Federal Government has a 3-percent contracting \ngoal for service-disabled veterans. However, in 2004 only 0.38 percent \nof government contracts were awarded to service-disabled veterans. \nPatterns such as this are all too common--replaying themselves year in \nand year out. Clearly, more ought to be done to help those veterans who \nare looking to gain access to Federal contracts. Given this, our \nlegislation directs TVC to assist veterans, particularly service-\ndisabled veterans, with Federal contracting opportunities.\n  We received numerous complaints from veterans about the way the \nadministration has chosen to interpret the current law such that it \nseverely limits Congress's role in appointing board members. In this, \nTVC had experienced significant staffing changes on its Board of \nDirectors since 1999. Our legislation ensures that the President works \nwith the chair and ranking members of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship and/or the Senate Committee on Veterans \nAffairs, and their House counterparts, to appoint nine members of the \nboard with 4-year terms. Additionally, our legislation dictates that in \nthis nomination process, the President and Congress consult with \nveterans groups nationwide. Furthermore, the Veterans Corporation \nReauthorization Act of 2006 stipulates that no more than five of the \nnine board members be from the same political party and that all have \nbusiness experience, knowledge of veterans issues, as well as the \nwherewithal to raise private funds for TVC. I firmly believe that this \nprovision will ensure that TVC has top-notch board members, who can \noffer the best service to those who have already served our country.\n  This legislation authorizes $2 million in Federal funds annually from \nfiscal years 2007 through 2009. Additionally, because TVC was \noriginally to become a self-sustaining entity, our bill requires that \nfor all Federal dollars received, the organization match those dollar \namounts with private funds. Since its authorization expired in 2004, \nTVC's original matching requirement vanished, and the organization \ninstead received Federal funding without any private fundraising \nrequirement. We felt that this matching requirement needed to be \nreinstated to better enable TVC to become fully self-sustaining. Thus, \nour legislation forces TVC to function in a way similar to the SBA's \nWomen's Business Centers and Small Business Development Centers. The \nleveraging of Federal dollars enables TVC to expand its donor base so \nthat it can achieve the goal of self-sustainability. Additionally, it \nhas come to our attention through conversations with the veterans \ncommunity, that servicemen and women are being charged high fees for \nusing TVC services. That was never the intention when this program was \nconceptualized, and it is wrong for TVC to earn its private funds on \nthe backs of veterans. We fix that in this bill by limiting the amount \nof non-Federal funds that TVC can raise in the form of fees to veterans \nto no more than 33 percent of the organization's total revenue.\n  In addition to the matching-fund requirement within our bill, it also \nrequires that TVC develop a comprehensive plan for privatization within \n6 months of the enactment of the Veterans Corporation Reauthorization \nAct of 2006. To ensure that TVC is in full compliance with the \nprovisions in our bill, and that its self-sustaining plan demonstrates \na certain degree of feasibility, we have asked the Government \nAccountability Office to conduct an audit of the organization no later \nthan one year after date of enactment.\n  Finally, this bill extends the SBA's Veterans Advisory Committee, \nwhich the administration planned on terminating as of this year. \nOriginally established through Public Law 106-50, this committee was to \nadvise and counsel the SBA Administrator and the agency's Associate \nAdministrator for Veterans' Business Development on the entrepreneurial \nneeds and concerns of veteran small business owners and to monitor \npublic and private plans that have the potential to impact veteran \nentrepreneurs from obtaining capital, credit, and to access markets. \nAdditionally, it was to roll into TVC by September 30, 2004. However, \nwhen this date came around, it was clear that TVC was in no position to \ntake on more responsibilities. Thus, Congress reauthorized the Veterans \nAdvisory Committee and postponed the transfer date until this year. As \nthe deadline closes in, we thought it best to reauthorize Veterans \nAdvisory Committee and again postpone the transfer.\n  America's veterans and service-disabled veteran communities deserve a \nresource to assist them in bringing their entrepreneurial ideas into \nfruition. Nationwide, more and more veterans are turning to small \nbusinesses as a means of carving out their piece of the American dream, \ndespite the many barriers they face upon reentering civilian life. The \nstrengthening and revitalization of TVC that this legislation proposes, \nis one way that Congress can help in this effort and ensure greater \neffectiveness and accountability within the organization in the years \nahead.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in support of this bipartisan Veterans \nCorporation Reauthorization Act of 2006--because in helping TVC \nsucceed, we are ultimately helping veterans succeed and prosper.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7926]]\n\n                                S. 3691\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to increase fuel economy standards for automobiles, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, 33 years ago, this Nation faced a crisis \nthat touched every American. In 1973, in the shadow of a war against \nIsrael, the Arab nations of OPEC decided to embargo shipments of crude \noil to the West.\n  The economic effects were devastating. For American drivers, the \nprice at the gas pump rose from a national average of 38.5 cents per \ngallon in May 1973 to 55.1 cents per gallon in June 1974. The stock \nmarket fell, and countries across the world faced terrible cycles of \ninflation and recession that lasted well into the 1980s.\n  Lawmakers in Washington reacted by calling for a nationwide daylight \nsavings time and a national speed limit. They established a new \nDepartment of Energy that eventually created a strategic petroleum \nreserve. Perhaps most important, Congress enacted the Corporate Average \nFuel Economy standards, or CAFE, the first-ever requirements for \nautomakers to improve gas mileage on the vehicles we drive.\n  At the time, auto executives protested, saying there was no way to \nincrease fuel economy without making cars smaller. One company \npredicted that Americans would all be driving sub-compacts as a result \nof CAFE. But CAFE did work, and under the direction of Congress, the \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHSTA, nearly doubled \nthe average gas mileage of cars from 14 miles per gallon in 1976 to \n27.5 mpg for cars in 1985. Today, CAFE standards save us about 3 \nmillion barrels of oil per day, making it the most successful energy-\nsaving measure ever adopted.\n\n[[Page S7927]]\n\n  Now 30 years later, Americans again are feeling the pain at the pump. \nThe price of oil has reached $78 a barrel, and Americans are paying \nmore than $3.00 a gallon for gas. America's 20-million-barrel-a-day \nhabit costs our economy $800 million a day, or $300 billion annually. \nBecause we import 60 percent of our oil, much of it from the Middle \nEast, our dependence on oil is also a national security issue as well. \nAl-Qaida knows that oil is America's Achilles heel. Osama bin Laden has \nurged his supporters to ``Focus your operations on oil, especially in \nIraq and the gulf area, since this will cause them to die off.''\n  At a time when the energy and security stakes couldn't be higher, \nCAFE standards have been stagnant. In fact, because of a long-standing \ndeadlock in Washington, CAFE standards that initially increased so \nquickly have remained stagnant for the last 20 years.\n  Since 1985, efforts to raise the CAFE standard have been stymied by \nopponents who have argued that Congress does not possess the expertise \nto set specific benchmarks and that an inflexible congressional mandate \nwould result in the production of less safe cars and a loss of American \njobs. This has been a bureaucratic logjam that has ignored \ntechnological innovations in the auto industry and crippled our ability \nto increase fuel efficiency.\n  To attempt to break this two-decade-long deadlock and start the U.S. \non the path towards energy independence, I have joined with Senators \nLugar, Biden, Smith, Bingaman, Harkin, Coleman, and Durbin to introduce \nthe Fuel Economy Reform Act of 2006. This bill would set a new course \nby establishing regular, continual, and incremental progress in miles \nper gallon, targeting 4 percent annually, but preserving NHTSA \nexpertise and flexibility on how to meet those targets.\n  Over the past 20 years, NHTSA's efforts to improve fuel economy have \nbeen encumbered with loopholes and resistance. With this bill, CAFE \nstandards would increase by 4 percent every year unless NHTSA can \njustify a deviation in that rate by proving that the increase is \ntechnologically unachievable, does not materially reduce the safety of \nautomobiles manufactured or sold in the U.S., or can prove it is not \ncost-effective when comparing with the economic and geopolitical value \nof a gallon of gasoline saved. We specifically define the grounds upon \nwhich NHTSA can determine cost-effectiveness. By flipping the \npresumption that has served as a barrier to action, we replace the \nstatus quo of continued stagnation with steady, measured progress.\n  Under this system, if the 4 percent annualized improvement occurs \nover ten years, this bill would save 1.3 million barrels of oil per \nday--or 20 billion gallons of gasoline per year. If gasoline is just \n$2.50 per gallon, consumers will save $50 billion at the pump in 2018. \nBy 2018, we would be cutting global warming pollution by 220 million \nmetric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent gases.\n  The Fuel Economy Reform Act also would provide fairness and \nflexibility to domestic automakers by establishing different standards \nfor different types of cars. Currently, manufacturers have to meet \nbroad standards over their whole fleet of cars. This disadvantages \ncompanies like Ford and General Motors that produce full lines of small \nand large cars and trucks rather than manufacturers that only sell \nsmall cars.\n  In order to enable domestic manufacturers to develop advanced-\ntechnology vehicles, this legislation provides tax incentives to retool \nparts and assembly plants. This will strengthen the U.S. auto industry \nby allowing it to compete with foreign hybrid and other fuel efficient \nvehicles. It is our expectation that NHTSA will use its enhanced \nauthority to bring greater market-based flexibility into CAFE \ncompliance by allowing the banking and trading of credits among all \nvehicle types and between manufacturers.\n  Finally, the bill also would expand the tax incentives that encourage \nconsumers to buy advanced technology vehicles. The bill would lift the \ncurrent 60,000-per-manufacturer cap on buyer tax credits to allow more \nAmericans to buy ultra-efficient vehicles like hybrids.\n  By ending a 20-year stalemate on CAFE, the Fuel Economy Reform Act \nwill recapture the innovation that Congress and the auto industry \nlaunched in response to the OPEC crisis. In the process, we will \nsafeguard our national security, protect our economy, reduce consumer \npain at the pump, and protect our climate, environment, and public \nhealth. I urge my colleagues to join our bipartisan coalition and \nsupport the Fuel Economy Reform Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 3695. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Ad to \nprohibit the marketing of authorized generic drugs; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Schumer \nand Leahy to introduce an important piece of legislation for seniors, \nindividual with disabilities, children, and anyone who is taking a \nbrand name prescription drug with a generic equivalent. The bill we are \nintroducing today would outlaw the latest in a long line of loopholes \nthat brand name manufacturers have found to limit generic drug access \nto the market.\n  Our legislation would prohibit brand name manufacturers from \nintroducing so-called ``authorized generics'' during the 180-day period \nthat Congress intended true generics to have exclusive market rights. \nSome of my colleagues may be wondering what an ``authorized generic'' \nis.\n  An authorized generic drug is a brand name prescription drug produced \nby the same brand manufacturer on the same manufacturing lines, yet \nrepackaged as a generic in order to confuse consumers and shut true \ngenerics out of the market. This is a huge problem and one that is \nbecoming even more prevalent as patents on some of the best-selling \nbrand name pharmaceuticals start to expire.\n  Pravachol, Zocor and Zoloft have patents that have expired or will \nexpire this year. Together, these drugs account for approximately $9 \nbillion in sales annually. In 2007, another top-selling brand name \ndrug, Norvasc, will lose its patent protection, followed by Advair the \nfollowing year.\n  When brand name drugs lose patent rights, this opens the door for \nconsumers, employers, third-party payers, and other purchasers to save \nbillions--between 50 and 80 percent on the costs of prescriptions--by \nusing generic versions of these drugs. Brand name drug companies are \nexpected to lose as much as $75 billion over the next 5 years as some \nof their best sellers go off-patent and generic competition increases. \nSo, not surprisingly, these big pharmaceutical companies are \ndesperately trying to protect their market share and prevent consumers \nfrom cashing in on savings from generic drugs.\n  We have addressed this issue before. In 1984, Congress passed the \nHatch-Waxman legislation to provide consumers greater access to lower \ncost generic drugs. The intent of this law was to improve generic \ncompetition, while preserving the ability of brand name manufacturers \nto discover and market new and innovative products. As part of this \nlaw, the first generic company on the market after challenging an \nexpiring brand name patent is granted 180-days of exclusive market \nrights, which is just a fraction of the up to 20 years of exclusive \nmarket rights afforded brand companies.\n  This 6-month incentive is crucial to maintaining the balance between \nencouraging brand drug companies to make new drugs and encouraging \ngeneric drug companies to make existing drugs more affordable. \nChallenging a brand name drug's patent takes time, money, and involves \nabsorbing a great deal of risk. Generic drug companies rely on the \nadded revenue provided by the l80-day exclusivity period to recoup \ntheir costs, fund new patent challenges where appropriate, and \nultimately pass savings onto consumers.\n  This latest attempt by big drug companies to protect their profits \nputs billions of dollars in savings for consumers in jeopardy. The bill \nwe are introducing today eliminates the authorized generic loophole, \nprotects the integrity of the 180 days, and improves consumer access to \nlower-cost generic drugs. I urge my colleagues to support this timely \nand important piece of legislation.\n\n[[Page S7928]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3695\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROHIBITION OF AUTHORIZED GENERICS.\n\n       Section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 355) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(o) Prohibition of Authorized Generic Drugs.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, no holder of a new drug application approved under \n     subsection (c) shall manufacture, market, sell, or distribute \n     an authorized generic drug, direct or indirectly, or \n     authorize any other person to manufacture, market, sell, or \n     distribute an authorized generic drug.\n       ``(2) Authorized generic drug.--For purposes of this \n     subsection, the term `authorized generic drug'--\n       ``(A) means any version of a listed drug (as such term is \n     used in subsection (j)) that the holder of the new drug \n     application approved under subsection (c) for that listed \n     drug seeks to commence marketing, selling, or distributing, \n     directly or indirectly, after receipt of a notice sent \n     pursuant to subsection (j)(2)(B) with respect to that listed \n     drug; and\n       ``(B) does not include any drug to be marketed, sold, or \n     distributed--\n       ``(i) by an entity eligible for exclusivity with respect to \n     such drug under subsection (j)(5)(B)(iv); or\n       ``(ii) after expiration or forfeiture of any exclusivity \n     with respect to such drug under such subsection \n     (j)(5)(B)(iv).''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, recently I was pleased to introduce with \nSenators Kohl, Grassley and Schumer, the Preserve Access to Affordable \nGenerics Act of 2006, S. 3582. That bill was designed to improve the \ntimely and effective introduction of generic pharmaceuticals into the \nmarketplace.\n  It is no secret that prescription drug prices are rapidly increasing \nand are a source of considerable concern to many Americans, especially \nsenior citizens and families. In a marketplace free of manipulation, \ngeneric drug prices can be as much as 80 percent lower than the \ncomparable brand name version. Unfortunately, there are still some \ncompanies driven by greed that may be keeping low-cost, life-saving \ngeneric drugs off the marketplace, off pharmacy shelves, and out of the \nhands of consumers by carefully crafted anticompetitive agreements \nbetween drug manufacturers.\n  In 2001, and last Congress, I introduced a related bill, the \nCompetition Act. That bill, which is now law, is small in terms of \nlength but large in terms of impact. It ensured that law enforcement \nagencies could take quick and decisive action against companies seeking \nto cheat consumers by delaying availability of generic medicines. It \ngave the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department access to \ninformation about secret deals between drug companies that keep generic \ndrugs out of the market--a practice that not only hurts American \nfamilies, particularly senior citizens, by denying them access to low-\ncost generic drugs, but also contributes to rising medical costs.\n  The Drug Competition Act, which was incorporated in the Medicare \nModernization Act, was a bipartisan effort to protect consumers in need \nof patented medicines who were being forced to pay considerably higher \ncosts because of collusive secret deals designed. It is regrettable \nthat we must come to the floor again today and take additional action \nto prevent drug companies from continuing to find and exploit \nloopholes.\n  The bill I am introducing tonight with Senators Rockefeller and \nSchumer is very important. It will provide incentives for generic \ncompanies to make the investments needed to introduce low-cost generic \nmedicines for all our citizens.\n  The bill assures all Americans that the original intent of the Hatch-\nWaxman law is carried out. That law was to provide incentives for \ngeneric companies to challenge the validity of patents on medicines and \nprovide incentives for generic companies to manufacture low-cost \nmedicines. That incentive was simple.\n  Under Hatch-Waxman law, the first generic company, called the first-\nfiler, which successfully develops a generic version of a patented drug \nand meets certain other requirements, can get a 180-day exclusivity \nperiod to be the only generic company to have permission to make and \nsell that generic drug.\n  That was called an exclusivity period because that is what the \nCongress intended--that generic company would have the exclusive right \nfor 180 days to make the generic version of the patented medicine.\n  The problem is that recently brand-name companies have been labeling \ntheir own patented drugs also as a generic version of itself, or \nlicensing others to make it, and selling both the brand-name version \nand the so-called generic version. This undercuts the potential profits \nof the ``real'' generic company and denies them what the Hatch-Waxman \nlaw promised and for a long time delivered--an exclusivity period \nlasting up to 180 days.\n  When the brand-name company offers a competing ``fake'' generic \nversion of the drug, that can cut the profits of the real generic \nmanufacturer greatly--thus making it less likely that a real generic \ncompany will even want to make the product.\n  The Rockefeller bill prevents the brand-name company from doing that \nfor the 180-day exclusivity period. I hope my colleagues will join me \nin supporting this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/19/senate-section/article/S7928-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7928-S7929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 110--COMMEMORATING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF \n THE HISTORIC 1946 SEASON OF MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL HALL OF FAME MEMBER \n  BOB FELLER AND HIS RETURN FROM MILITARY SERVICE TO THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. DeWINE submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Judiciary Committee \nunanimously approved the Copyright Royalty Judges Program Technical \nCorrections Act, H.R. 1036, a bi1l that makes several important, \nnoncontroversial, technical corrections to the Copyright Royalty and \nDistribution Reform Act of 2004. In particular, I am grateful to \nSenators Specter and Hatch for their efforts in the important work we \nhave done, on this bill and so many others, over the years to \nstrengthen our Nation's intellectual property laws. When Senators from \ndifferent parties can collaborate as productively as we have on these \ntough issues, the legislative process is working the way it should.\n  The Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004, which \nSenator Hatch and I jointly authored, modernized and improved the \nprocess by which certain royalty rates, such as those for small \nwebcasters, are determined. Passage of the act was an important step \ntoward creating laws that adequately protect and compensate makers of \ncreative works. The Technical Corrections Act, H.R. 1036, makes truly \ntechnical corrections that shore up those laws and further preserve the \ntraditional role of important intellectual property protections.\n  In addition to these technical corrections, I, along with Chairman \nSpecter and Senator Hatch, offered an amendment that makes one more \ncorrection. Several copyright holders had brought it to our attention \nthat under current laws, copyright royalty judges do not have the \nability to allocate portions of cable and satellite royalties before \nthe end of royalty distribution proceedings. This has resulted in more \nthan $1 billion in cable and satellite royalties being withheld from \nrightful recipients. Our amendment rectified the problem by providing \ncopyright royalty judges with explicit statutory discretion for partial \ndistribution of royalties and was included in the legislation that the \nJudiciary Committee approved last week.\n  Now that the bill is on the floor, I urge my colleagues to move it \nquickly, by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee-reported amendment be agreed to, the bill as amended by read \nthe third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate will pass a \nbill providing needed corrections to the Violence Against Women Act, \nVAWA, and the Department of Justice authorization bill we passed last \nyear.\n  Among the improvements made in the amendment, the changes ensure that \nthe VAWA public housing provisions allow a landlord to bifurcate a \nlease to evict an abuser while allowing a cosigning lessee as well as \nan authorized resident to remain as tenants. The bill also makes \ntechnical improvements in the administration of STOP grants and the \nCampus Grant Program. The bill improves the administration of grants to \ntribal governments and ensures that the 10-percent designation of VAWA \ngrants to Indian tribes applies throughout all sections of the law.\n  I commend the efforts of all those who worked hard to improve this \nimportant law, and I am glad to support the improvements in this \namendment that will sustain this law as a vital tool in our efforts to \nput an end to domestic violence.\n  In the last 25 years I believe that we have only been successful \ntwice in passing authorization bills for the Department of Justice. I \nwas pleased to be involved in both of them, working with Chairman \nSensenbrenner and the Republican leader on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee at the time. This bill improves the most recent authorization \nwe considered and passed in a bipartisan manner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/19/senate-section/article/S7941-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7941-S7944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MILITARY PERSONNEL FINANCIAL SERVICES PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, a few hours ago, the President used his \nfirst ever veto in his 6 years of being in office to kill H.R. 810, the \nStem Cell Research Enhancement Act, a bill that is supported by over 70 \npercent of the American public, a bill that was supported by a \nbipartisan majority of the House, a bill that was supported by a \nbipartisan, big majority in the Senate--63 Members of the Senate, \nRepublicans and Democrats, voted for it yesterday--and is supported by \n591 different patient advocacy groups, research institutions, \nuniversities, scientific organizations, biomedical research \ninstitutions--everything from Alzheimer's to Parkinson's to cancer, \nspinal cord injuries, you name it. This bill has almost been \nuniversally supported. Over 80 Nobel laureates support this bill. \nVirtually every reputable scientist in America supports this bill.\n  I will mince no words about the President's action today. The veto he \ncast is a shameful display of cruelty, hypocrisy, and contempt for \nscience. It is cruel because it denies hope to millions of Americans \nwho suffer from Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, who have already received \nthe death sentence of Lou Gehrig's disease, kids suffering from \njuvenile diabetes all over America, those suffering from cancer and \nspinal cord injuries, and many other diseases and injuries.\n  The best scientists in the world, as I said, including many dozens of \nNobel Prize winners and every Director at the National Institutes of \nHealth say that embryonic stem cell research offers enormous potential \nto cure these illnesses, to ease suffering, to make the lame walk \nagain.\n  H.R. 810 would have expanded Federal funding to pursue this research. \nBut with the stroke of his pen today, the President vetoed this bill \nand dashed the hopes of millions of Americans.\n  This veto displays hypocrisy because the President describes the \nresearch as immoral. He himself provided Federal funding for it. His \npress Secretary, Tony Snow, claimed yesterday that using leftover \nembryos, even those already slated to be discarded, is tantamount to \nmurder. That is the word he used. Here is his own words. Mr. Snow said:\n\n       The President believes strongly that for the purpose of \n     research, it is inappropriate for the Federal Government to \n     finance something that many people consider murder.\n\n  Mr. Snow went on to say that the President is one of those people who \nconsider the practice to be murder.\n  This is a very bizarre statement. First, H.R. 810 would not allow \nFederal funding to be used to derive human embryos. That is already \nprohibited by existing law. And I couldn't believe my ears today when I \nheard the President say that H.R. 810--which passed with 63 Senate \nvotes, and passed with the majority of the House--would overturn over \n10 years of Federal prohibitions against deriving embryos.\n  I couldn't believe the President said that. The bill expressly does \nnot do that. How could he say that? Either A, he did not read the bill; \nB, his assistants didn't read the bill; or C, he is purposely \nmisleading the American public.\n  We do not overturn what is called the so-called Dickey-Wicker \namendment that prohibits Federal funds from deriving stem cells. That \nis existing law. Federal funding can only be used to conduct research \non stem cell lines, not to derive them. That derivation has to be \nfunded privately. The President himself has already supported that.\n  What is even stranger and more bizarre and more hypocritical is that \nthe President has already endorsed embryonic stem cell research. Under \nthe policy that he announced 5 years ago, on August 9, 2001--I remember \nit well. I was in Iowa. I was listening to the radio, listening to his \nspeech because this was an area of interest to me. Senator Specter and \nI had the first hearings in 1998, right after Doctors Gearhart and \nThomson had derived the first human embryonic stem cells at the \nUniversity of Wisconsin. That was in November of 1998. We commenced \nhearings after that, and when I was\n\n[[Page S7945]]\n\nchairman I continued the hearings. So I was chairman of the committee \nat the time--and of the subcommittee--that funded these programs at the \ntime, so I was listening to the President's speech.\n  Under the policy that he announced nearly 5 years ago, he allowed \nFederal funding--get this--he allowed Federal funding for research on \nembryonic stem cell lines that were derived before 9 p.m, August 9, \n2001, but no Federal funding for any research on any lines derived \nafter that date and time.\n  So let's look at this. Here is the stem cell hypocrisy. The President \nof the United States--President Bush--said that all the stem cell lines \nderived before August 9, 2001, at 9 p.m.--is morally acceptable. If \nthey are derived after 9 p.m. on August 9, 2001, they are morally \nunacceptable. Who drew this line, I ask? What right does the President \nof the United States have to say that something is moral before 9 p.m. \nand immoral afterward? I mean, what about the lines that were derived \nat 9:05 p.m. or 9:30 p.m? Why is that line there? It is because the \nPresident arbitrarily drew it.\n  So I ask, if using discarded embryos to extract stem cells is murder, \nisn't it then immoral to allow Federal research on existing lines of \nembryonic stem cells, as the current administration policy permits? \nMurder is murder, Mr. President. So if you, Mr. President, are saying \nthat it is all right for Federal funds to be used for research on stem \ncell lines derived before August 9, 2001, at 9 p.m., why is that any \ndifferent from afterward? Why isn't it here murder and here it is not? \nAnd isn't it immoral to allow privately funded embryonic stem cell \nresearch to continue?\n  Now, again, as we heard many times on the Senate floor over the last \ncouple of days of debate, privately funded embryonic stem cell research \ngoes on in the United States, but according to the President, this is \nmurder. And if it is really murder to take left over human embryos and \ncause them to cease to be embryos, but to take the stem cells out, why \nisn't the President using his authority, his moral authority to shut \ndown all the in vitro fertilization clinics in America?\n  By his definition of murder, these clinics are institutions of mass \nmurder because they routinely dispose of countless unwanted embryos. \nVirtually every time a couple goes to a fertility clinic, left over \nembryos are created. That is how the IVF--in vitro fertilization--\nprocess, works. Eventually, after moms and dads have had their \nchildren, when they have had all the children they want, they either \ncall the clinic or the clinic calls them--someone has to pay to keep \nthese frozen, so the clinic may call and say: Well, we have all these \nembryos left over. Do you want to continue to pay to have them frozen?\n  No, we don't want them anymore. You have our consent to discard them.\n  Every day this happens. If that is murder, then how can the President \npermit it to continue? Where is his outrage? Where is his outrage at \nthe IVF clinics in this country? Why isn't he here proposing \nlegislation to shut down in vitro fertilization in this country, make \nit a crime, a Federal crime to conduct in vitro fertilization?\n  In the President's narrow moral universe, it seems to be fine to \ndestroy embryos--to throw them away as the byproduct of producing \nbabies through IVF, but it is murder to use the embryos to conduct \nlifesaving research. Someone please explain the logic of that to me.\n  One more time: In the President's narrow moral universe, to take \nthese unwanted embryos that are left over from in vitro fertilization \nclinics, throw them away, flush them down the drain, that is OK. To \ntake the same embryos, extract the stem cells, keep them alive, keep \nthem growing, to perhaps discover something that will save someone's \nlife, that is murder.\n  I don't get it. Who gave the President the authority to draw that \nline? He may be the President of the United States, but he is not the \nmoral authority for all Americans. I say, Mr. President, you are not \nour moral Ayatollah. You don't have that right, and you don't have that \npower. Oh, you can veto legislation. You can veto it. But you notice, \nwhen the President vetoed the bill today, he didn't veto it on the \ngrounds it was unconstitutional. He did not veto it on the grounds it \nspent too much money. He did not veto it on any grounds that Congress \nexceeded its authority, none of the usual reasons that a President \ngives for vetoing a bill. He vetoed it because he said it is immoral, \ntantamount to murder.\n  No. I am sorry. It is hypocrisy at the extreme for the President to \ntake that position. As I said, if you take the lines before August 9 at \n9 p.m., it is OK; after August 9 at 9 p.m., it is not OK. No, you are \nnot our moral Ayatollah, Mr. President. You may be our President, and I \nrespect you for being the President of the United States. I respect the \noffice. But I don't pay any respect to someone trying to dictate to me \nthe moral authority of the President of the United States; that somehow \nyou can define what is moral and what is immoral. Leave that to our \nreligious leaders. Leave that to our theologians.\n\n  Why isn't the President prosecuting the many thousands of American \nmen and women who use these IVF clinics? If their attempts to have \nchildren result in leftover embryos and their embryos eventually get \ndiscarded, aren't they complicit in murder? Let's say a couple had in \nvitro fertilization; they wanted to have children. They finally have \ntheir children, and they say: We don't want the rest of those embryos, \nyou can discard them--because they have to approve it. Are they \ncomplicit in murder?\n  Under the President's narrow moral logic--I hate to call it logic--\nunder the President's narrow moral view, any man or woman who allows \ntheir embryos to be discarded, something that happens every single day \nall over the country, is authorizing murder. Why is the President \nstanding idly by? Why isn't he putting all these men and women in jail? \nI would have to warn him, though, there are over 50,000 babies born \nevery year to couples via IVF. We are going to have to build a lot of \njails if you are going to throw them all in jail for murder.\n  As I have said, the President's veto is cruel for dashing the hopes \nof millions of Americans who suffer. It is hypocritical, as I pointed \nout here, because the President says it is OK in one moment but it is \nnot OK here.\n  I want to point out another thing the President gave misinformation \nabout today. He said today that there were 22 lines, stem cell lines \nfor research--from here on this chart. That is OK, you understand. That \nis morally OK because, according to the President, it was before 9 p.m. \nof August 9. I still don't understand that, but somehow that is morally \nOK. What he didn't tell you is that when he made this decision at 9 \np.m. on August 9, at that time he said there were 78 lines. Now he says \nthere are 22.\n  There is one other thing the President didn't say today and we all \nknow is a scientific fact: Every single one of those stem cell lines is \ncontaminated because they were all grown in Petri dishes with mouse \ncells to energize them and grow them--so they are all contaminated. \nThey will not be used for human therapies. Many of those stem cell \nlines are sick. They are not viable. He didn't tell you that, either, \ndid he? He didn't tell you that they are all contaminated with mouse \ncells. He didn't say that.\n  As I have said, it is cruel, it is hypocritical, and his veto today \nshows a shocking contempt for science, a disdain for science. I don't \nknow who the President's science teachers were when he was in school, \nbut I will bet none of them are bragging about it.\n  The President's political adviser, Karl Rove, told the Denver Post \nlast week that researchers have found ``far more promise from adult \nstem cells than from embryonic stem cells.'' I hate to disagree with \nsuch a renowned biomedical expert as Karl Rove but, frankly, he does \nnot know what he is talking about and his statement is absolutely, \ntotally, irrevocably false.\n  Here is what Dr. Michael Clarke of Stanford University said about Mr. \nRove's claim: It is ``just not true.'' I will take Dr. Clarke's word \nover Mr. Rove's any day of the week. Dr. Clarke is the director of the \nStanford stem cell institute, and he published the first study showing \nhow adult stem cells replicate themselves. So here is an authority on \nadult stem cells basically saying what Karl Rove said is just not true. \nYet Karl Rove says it.\n  Dr. Stephen Teitelbaum also disagrees with Mr. Rove. Dr. Teitelbaum\n\n[[Page S7946]]\n\nis a professor of pathology at the Washington University School of \nMedicine in St. Louis, a former President of the Federation of American \nSocieties for Experimental Biology. I spoke with him on the phone \nyesterday. He said something that struck me, and I wrote it down. He \nsaid if people want to disagree on moral grounds, that is fine. If \npeople want to have a certain moral view of something, that is their \nright in our society. But they don't have the right to buttress their \nclaims with misinformation and falsehoods. In other words, the \nPresident and Mr. Rove are entitled to their own moral opinions, \nwhatever they may be. However narrow they may be, they are entitled to \nthem. But they are not entitled to mislead the public with \nmisinformation and falsehoods. And that is what the President did \ntoday. That is what the President did today.\n  The facts are that virtually every reputable scientist in this \ncountry believes in the promise of embryonic stem cell research to cure \nand treat diseases. It has the greatest potential to do so. By vetoing \nH.R. 810, the President is closing his heart and his mind to the facts, \nto the science, and to the strict ethical guidelines we put in the \nbill.\n  By his veto today, the President has put himself in some very \nillustrious company down through history, people such as Cardinal \nRoberto Bellarmino, who told Galileo that it was heresy for him to \nclaim that the Earth went around the Sun. Religious teaching at that \ntime said that the Earth was the center of the universe and everything \nrevolved around the Earth. We forget that Galileo was sentenced to life \nin prison.\n  The President also puts himself in the company of people such as Pope \nBoniface VIII, who banned the practice of cadaver dissection in the \n1200s, and for 300 years it was banned. There was no dissection of \ncadavers until finally someone came along who decided to do it and \ndiscovered all of the different ways the muscles work in the body. Of \ncourse, now we know that cadaver dissection from donated cadavers has \nled us to all kinds of medical breakthroughs and the understanding of \nhow the human body works. But here was a Pope who said: No, you can't \ndo it. Just like the President today--no, you can't do it. So the \nPresident can take his place alongside Pope Boniface VIII.\n  The President could also take his spot alongside people such as Rev. \nEdward Massey, who had this to say in 1722 in response to the new \nscience of vaccination. Here is what Reverend Massey said:\n\n       Diseases are sent by providence for the punishment of sin \n     and a proposed attempt to prevent them is a diabolical \n     operation.\n\n  Imagine how many millions of lives would have been lost if the \nReverend Massey's ignorance had prevailed, if a President of the United \nStates had said: You know, Reverend Massey is right, we are not going \nto permit vaccinations. Think of it. President Bush, take your place \nright alongside him.\n  I might add you don't even have to go back so far. The President has \ncompany in more recent times. Just a few decades ago, many religious \npeople considered heart transplants to be immoral--heart transplants to \nbe immoral. Others objected on moral grounds to the use of anesthesia \nduring childbirth, saying that the Bible held that women were meant to \nsuffer when delivering babies.\n  Many people opposed in vitro fertilization, one of those being Dr. \nLeon Kass. Guess what he was. He was the head of this President's \nBioethics Council. Years ago, he opposed in vitro fertilization. Do you \nget the picture? And the President made him the head of his Bioethics \nCouncil.\n  I guess, Mr. President, you can take your place alongside Leon Kass, \ntoo. Tell all those wonderful families out there who have had babies \nthrough IVF, tell them that they were wrong, they should not have had \nthem.\n  In all of these cases, we look back with a sense of astonishment that \npeople could be so blinded by a narrow view of religion or ideology \nthat they could stand in the way of scientific progress that has saved \nlives, eased pain and made life better for so many people.\n  Twenty or 30 years from now, history books will ask the same question \nabout this President. People will wonder: How could he have objected to \nresearch that has led to so much good for so many people?\n  Maybe not in my lifetime--I don't know how long God will give me here \non Earth. But maybe these young people's lifetimes here, the pages, \nmaybe in their lifetime through the embryonic stem cell research that \nis being done in Great Britain, Korea, Singapore, and other places \naround the world where a number of scientists--because they are \nhandcuffed to do that research here--will find a way of taking \nembryonic pluripotent stem cells and finding how they make nerve cells. \nAnd guess what. Just as they have done with rats--we have seen the \nfilms of rats with their spinal cords severed, taking embryonic stem \ncells from other rats and putting them into these rats and watching \nthem walk again. As my departed friend Christopher Reeve, the first \nSuperman, said after that, ``Oh, to be a rat.''\n  You all remember the tragedy of Christopher Reeve. He was paralyzed \nfrom the neck down. He fought so hard for embryonic stem cell research.\n  It has been said that we are 99 percent rat. I don't mean just us \npoliticians. I mean humans. And politicians, maybe more. I don't know. \nBut it is said of humans that we are basically 99 percent the same DNA \nas a rat. We can do it for rats. It is not hard to think that the same \nthing can be done for humans.\n  It is going to happen in their lifetimes--the lifetimes of these \nyoung people here today. Somewhere, in Great Britain, somewhere, they \ncan do this research and we will find out how to take these cells--\npeople like my nephew Kelly who hasn't walked for 27 years because of a \nspinal cord injury--and make it possible for people like him to walk \nagain.\n  People will say, What was this President thinking? Like Pope Boniface \nVIII, like Cardinal Bellarmino, like Reverend Massey--how could the \nPresident have objected to this ethical good research that has led to \nso much good for so many people?\n  Let's be clear. Nothing could be more pro-life than signing this bill \ninto law.\n  We all know people--friends or family members--with ALS or \nParkinson's or juvenile diabetes or a spinal cord injury. What could be \nmore pro-life than using the scientific tools that God has given us to \nhelp heal them?\n  White House spokesperson Tony Snow said yesterday, ``The President is \nnot going to get on the slippery slope of taking something that is \nliving and making it dead for the purpose of research.''\n  Again, I want to emphasize a couple of things. We carefully crafted \nH.R. 810 to impose strict ethical standards on embryonic stem cell \nresearch. This bill would not allow Federal funds to be used to create \nor destroy human embryos. The only embryos we are talking about are \nthose already slated for destruction in the clinics. It is right there \nin the bill. Let me read it:\n\n       Prior to the consideration of embryo donation and through \n     consultation with the individuals seeking fertility \n     treatment, it was determined that the embryos would never be \n     implanted in a woman and would otherwise be discarded.\n\n  It is right there in the bill.\n  All we are saying is, instead of discarding some 400,000 embryos that \nare currently sitting frozen in storage, let us use some of them--as \nlong as the donors give written informed consent--to help people who \nare suffering from diseases. I think it is this choice that is truly \nrespectful of human life.\n  Besides, the stem cells that come from those embryos don't die. That \nis the amazing thing about stem cells. They keep reproducing \nthemselves. They just keep reproducing themselves. They will be more \nalive when used as treatment in research than if they were washed down \na drain or sit in storage for another hundred years.\n  Think about that. They talk about destroying these embryos. If you \ntake an embryo from an IVF clinic and destroy it, wash it down the \ndrain, that is the end of it. That really does destroy the embryo. That \ndoes kill it. That ends it.\n  But if you take that embryo and take the stem cells out--talking \nabout a blastocyst which has about 100 or 200 cells--take some of those \ncells out, those cells live. They are alive. They do not die. They \nlive. They grow. They became tissue, nerve tissue, bone tissue, or \nmaybe they became other\n\n[[Page S7947]]\n\nthings that we can use to help cure disease. They live. It seems to me \nthat it is the pro-life position. Using research to improve people's \nlives is a true pro-life position.\n  Once again, the President has staked out an extreme ideological \nposition--a position that flies in the face of science and common \nsense. He refuses to listen to any other point of view, including the \npleas of Nancy Reagan, Republican supporters of the bill, scientists \nall over America, and people at NIH.\n\n  I was told that some Republican supporters of this bill requested an \nopportunity to talk with the President, and they were turned down. He \ndidn't even want to talk to them.\n  As I have said, President Bush's veto is cruel, hypocritical, and \nabsolutely disdainful of science. But I guess most of all, it is just \nsad. It is just sad.\n  On Monday and Tuesday, we had a great debate. On Tuesday we had a \ngreat bipartisan vote, 63 Senators, Republicans, Democrats, liberals, \nconservatives, pro-life, pro-choice, all came together to support life-\nsaving research. That was also supported by more than 70 percent of \nAmericans. It was a huge debate for millions of Americans suffering \nfrom disease and paralysis who might be cured by this life-saving \nresearch.\n  After the vote, I went upstairs. There was a young woman in a \nwheelchair. She must have been upstairs watching the vote. I didn't ask \nher name. She was using a wheelchair, and she said, ``Thank you--thank \nyou for giving me hope.''\n  Today, the President slammed the door. He took that hope away. How \nsad. How sad.\n  The President insists that he knows better than the American people; \nhe knows better than all of the scientists; he knows better than all \nthe directors at the National Institutes of Health; he knows better \nthan 63 Senators; he knows better than the majority of the House.\n  So with one arrogant stroke of his pen, he dashed the bill, dashed \nthe hopes of millions of Americans. He vetoed the hopes. It wasn't just \na veto of the bill. He vetoed the hopes of millions of Americans living \nwith Parkinson's, ALS, juvenile diabetes, and spinal cord injuries.\n  Where is the President's compassion? How dare the President refer to \nhimself as a compassionate conservative.\n  I don't think you can get much more conservative than Senator Orrin \nHatch, Senator Smith, Senator Lott, and a number of Senators here. I \nnamed them because they are cosponsors of the bill. You don't get much \nmore conservative than that. Can you get much more conservative than \nNancy Reagan? I don't think so. They were compassionate. They were \ntruly compassionate.\n  My message to my nephew Kelly who waited 27 years, my message to \nmillions of others whose hopes were raised this week and then sadly \ncrushed today, my message is this: The President's veto is not the \nfinal word. It may be this year because to get the agreement to bring \nup the bill we had to agree that we wouldn't bring it up again this \nyear. So it is over for this year. Perhaps next year, when Senator \nSpecter and I will reintroduce this bill along with others in January, \nwe will have more Senators here. We will have more Senators who \nrepresent the true wishes of the American people, who understand the \nnecessity for moving ahead on stem cell research.\n  Maybe the voters this fall will speak about that. All those families \nwho have someone with Parkinson's, Alzheimer's or juvenile diabetes, \nmaybe they will say, Look, we need people in the Senate and in the \nHouse who will help us get over this veto.\n  The President's veto is not the final word. Science is on our side. \nEthics is on our side. There is an election in November. It will be \nknown where every candidate, where he or she stands on embryonic stem \ncell research. We will introduce it again in January. We will be back. \nWe will not go away. And just perhaps we will have a few more Senators \nand a few more Members of the House who want to do the ethical, right \nthing, and help cure disease and suffering with the potential of \nembryonic stem cell research.\n\n  It is a sad day, a sad day, indeed. We will be back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/19/senate-section/article/S7947-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.
