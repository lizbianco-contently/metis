Mr. President, I am delighted that our opening prayer \nthis morning was so eloquently delivered by the Reverend Ken Dutille of \nSwans Island Atlantic Baptist Church in my home State of Maine. It is a \ngreat pleasure to welcome him to the Senate today. In fact, as he \noffered the invocation in this Chamber 11 years ago, on October 18, \n1995, it is a pleasure to welcome him back to the Senate today.\n  Pastor Dutille's words give direction and purpose to our work. His \nactions also inspire us; they are a vivid reminder of the commitment \nand compassion that exists among people of faith throughout our Nation.\n  His ministry is truly unique. His church is joined with churches on \nthree other islands to form the Maine Sea Coast Mission. This \nnondenominational organization was founded more than a century ago to \nprovide spiritual guidance and educational opportunities to the remote \nseafaring communities of Downeast Maine. In its early years, the \nmission's boat, which was called Hope, would deliver a minister to \nisolated island communities where there were no churches and books \nwhere there were no libraries.\n  Today, the Sunbeam V not only continues that vital work, but it also \nserves as a mobile health clinic bringing medical services--including \nscreenings, inoculations, and telemedicine--to four islands that \notherwise would not have access to medical services.\n  Pastor Dutille is the founder of another outstanding mission project, \nthe Bread of Life Food Pantry on Swans Island. The food pantry is often \nall that stands between the pangs of hunger and a healthy meal for some \npeople in this disadvantaged area of my State. Although the demands \nupon the food pantry are always considerable, they increased \nexponentially this last July when the only grocery store on Swans \nIsland was destroyed by fire. The pastor and the rest of the mission \ncommunity immediately rose to the challenge with a major fundraising \ncampaign. The power of God was evident in their strength of purpose as \nthey responded to this crisis.\n  The pastor is a fisher of people and a person of many \naccomplishments. He is a graduate of the Baptist Bible College in \nSpringfield, MO, as well as of the University of Maine. He holds a \nmaster's degree from the California Graduate School of Theology. He has \nserved in churches throughout Maine and has\n\n[[Page S5904]]\n\npreached throughout New England. He is a published author, too, and a \nsuccessful small business owner. He has also had experience that all of \nus can relate to. In a previous community, he served as a town \nselectman, so he has a keen understanding of the challenges of public \nservice, as his opening prayer demonstrated today.\n  It is a great pleasure to have such a dedicated spiritual and civic \nleader with us today and giving the opening prayer. I am sure I speak \nfor all of my colleagues in extending him a warm welcome and in giving \nthanks for his inspiring prayer.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/15/senate-section/article/S5904-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I just got word that the 2,500th soldier \nwas killed in Iraq. It is a milestone, obviously, that we all mourn \ndeeply in this country. And that is what I rise to talk about, as a few \nof those who have died in the line of duty were from my State.\n  Mr. President, May was an especially difficult month for our home \nState of Nevada. We mourn the loss of four soldiers and marines who \nwere killed in action in Iraq and Afghanistan. One soldier was killed \nduring training. And just last week, another soldier from Winnemucca, \nNV, was killed. While there is incomparable grief following these \ndeaths, there is also strength and pride that never ceases to amaze me.\n  I had the opportunity to attend two of the recent funerals: the \nfuneral of 1SG Carlos Saenz at Arlington National Cemetery and the \nfuneral of SGT John Griffith at the Southern Nevada Veterans Memorial \nCemetery in Boulder City. Each funeral I have attended and each family \nwho grieves finds a very special place in my heart, and they will \nalways stay with me.\n  1SG Sergeant Carlos Saenz was born in Mexico. He became a naturalized \ncitizen and considered himself extremely lucky and proud to have been \nan American, as we all should. And for more than 25 years, he dedicated \nhimself to serving this country. His wife Nanette is a woman of great \nstrength who understood her husband's determination and commitment to \nour country. They actually met during the first Persian Gulf war. She \nis proud of him, and we are all blessed that he came to the United \nStates and was willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for his new \nNation.\n  SGT John Griffith lived in Las Vegas most of his life. He told his \nwife Christa that he was fighting this war so their son would not have \nto. I will never forget the image of his two young daughters, just as \nthe funeral had ended and they were taking the coffin out. As they were \nputting it into the hearse, I heard his two young daughters crying, and \nI heard one of them say: Don't let them take daddy.\n  That is the real pain of war coming home to a family, and we should \nall remember the sacrifices that not only the men and women in uniform \nwho have died have made but also the sacrifices and the pain their \nfamilies go through.\n  I also had the opportunity to speak with Victoria Legaspi, the mother \nof SSG Emmanuel Legaspi. Manny was born in the Philippines and signed \nup in the Army at the age of 32, after living in the United States for \nonly 1 year. He wanted to give back to this country, and he wanted to \nshow his appreciation. Manny should make all of us a little more proud \nto be Americans.\n  We live in the greatest country in the world--where brave Americans \nsuch as Carlos, John, and Manny, and so many others believe so deeply \nin our freedom that they are willing to sacrifice their lives so that \nwe can all live safe and free. These men follow a distinguished line of \ncourageous men and women who have paid that ultimate price for this \nNation.\n  They are not the only ones who have made this sacrifice. As I \nmentioned before, the families, and one woman in particular, Helena \nLukac, have touched my heart. Helena Lukac moved to the United States \nin 1983 from the former Communist Czechoslovakia. Her son John was \nkilled by a roadside bomb attack in Iraq. He was just 19 years old. \nHelena knows what it means to be free better than most of us. On \nMemorial Day, just a few weeks ago, Helena said:\n\n       I'm really grateful that we are here, even with this loss. \n     I miss him so much, I feel it on my own skin. This freedom is \n     not free.\n\n  Mr. President, freedom is not free. The brave men and women in our \nmilitary and their families sacrifice greatly for us, and we can never \nthank them enough, but we can express our gratitude to them.\n  So today I again say thank you to the men and women who stand tall in \ndefense of this Nation and in support of our freedom. You make us \nproud. And with a very heavy heart, I thank the families across America \nand across my State whose pain I cannot even begin to imagine. Your \nloss is our Nation's loss. God bless you all, and God bless this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the Senate is going to be considering in \njust a few minutes the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act. I do \nwant to be clear that like most of my colleagues, I will be voting for \nthis bill because it does provide the funding for our troops that is \ncritically needed to carry out their mission and because it supports \nrecovery efforts along the coast. I do wish to express three concerns I \nhave with the conference report.\n  First, this bill continues the charade that this war should be funded \noff budget. Instead of including the money our troops need in the \nregular budget as requested by the President and sent to us, we keep \ngetting sent emergency supplemental requests. It is clear to me, having \nbeen here for 13\\1/2\\ years, that emergency spending bills used to be \nfor emergencies, things we could not foresee such as natural disasters. \nThe need for funding for the war in Iraq is not a surprise. It is not \nlike responding to an earthquake or tornado. By funding the war off \nbudget, I fear we continue to hide the true cost of the war. It is \nimperative that the Senate and the House get a budget from the \nPresident that gives us the true cost of what we need to be funding.\n  In addition, the administration should not have the sole authority to \ndecide what is worthy of emergency funding and what is not. We have \nemergencies in our backyard as well as overseas. We should not hand \nover to the President the final authority on what deserves emergency \nfunding.\n  The second concern I have is that this bill leaves out very critical \nfunding for areas we considered and adopted in the Senate. They were \nremoved once the bill went to conference. Funding for health care, for \nport security, emergency transportation assistance in the gulf coast--\nmuch of the progress we made in the Senate was thrown out. Why? To meet \nan arbitrary limit set by the President. That is going to hurt many of \nour communities in the coming months.\n  Part of what we did in the Senate in April was to overwhelmingly pass \nthe Murray-Akaka amendment that ensured our veterans would get the help \nthey need. That amendment had broad bipartisan support on the Senate \nfloor. It was removed in conference in the middle of the night. That is \na huge setback for the men and women who are coming home from the war \ntoday and entering a VA system that is overwhelmed and underfunded. In \nMarch, the VA told us they are seeing 38 percent more Iraqi war \nveterans than they budgeted for. Veterans now have to wait a year to \nget the specialty care they deserve. Some are waiting more than 18 \nmonths before they get the benefits they have been promised. On top of \nthat, we have waiting lists that are thousands of names long at major \nVA hospitals. I am frustrated that the\n\n[[Page S5905]]\n\nfunding we secured for America's veterans is no longer in the bill \nbefore us. Our veterans deserve better.\n  Funding was also removed for emergency transportation relief in the \ngulf. In the Senate, we passed $200 million in emergency assistance for \ntransit authorities in the gulf region. FEMA, which is helping to fund \ntransit service in New Orleans, is going to stop the funding for that \nat the end of this month. That is going to force New Orleans to cut \nback transit service even more. Cutting off transit routes is not going \nto help our gulf coast cities recover. Throwing busdrivers on \nunemployment lines is not going to help them recover.\n  Another item cut from the legislation was tenant-based rental \nassistance for the gulf. That funding was intended to serve about \n44,000 families, including families that received HUD funding prior to \nKatrina and many homeless families. The bill we passed in the Senate \nexpanded the purposes of that money to include the reconstruction and \nrepair of HUD projects in the afflicted region, many of them damaged \nconsiderably. It provided vouchers for about 4,500 needy citizens in \nthe region, particularly the disabled and homeless. That funding is now \ngone, and we are going to see some pretty vulnerable families in the \ngulf coast without any ability to stay in the homes in which they \ncurrently are trying to stay.\n  Finally, this bill improperly includes a budget ceiling that is going \nto affect every single spending bill we do this year. I believe the \nsupplemental emergency spending bill is the wrong place to enact a \nbudget that never passed the Senate floor. It is going to be hard \nenough to produce appropriations bills this year that will get broad \nbipartisan support at the levels the Senate approved back in March. It \nwill be almost impossible to do so if we ignore amendments adopted on \nthe Senate floor and impose the spending ceiling proposed by the \nPresident that is now included in the bill.\n  I am frustrated that the administration keeps funding this war off \nbudget. I am frustrated that critical investments which we approved in \nthe Senate were removed from the bill. I am very frustrated that this \nbill is now going to result in our hands being tied throughout the \nappropriations process. I hope in the future we can do much better.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/15/senate-section/article/S5905-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the hour of 10 \na.m. having arrived, the Senate will proceed to vote on the conference \nreport to accompany H.R. 4939, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     4939) making emergency supplemental appropriations for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2006, and for other \n     purposes, having met, have agreed that the House recede from \n     its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate and agree to \n     the same with an amendment, and the Senate agree to the same, \n     signed by a majority of the conferees on the part of both \n     Houses.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I intend to vote for this emergency \nsupplemental appropriations conference agreement because of the \ncritical funding it will provide to our troops. Our men and women in \nuniform, and their families, deserve our support, not just in words but \nwith deeds. This bill also provides important support to our fellow \nAmericans in the gulf coast region who continue to rebuild their \ncommunities after the devastation of the 2005 hurricane season.\n  But I am disappointed that important provisions included in the \nSenate bill were stripped out in conference. With nearly 150,000 U.S. \ntroops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is shameful that this \nconference report stripped out $430 million for veterans health care. \nAnd I am concerned that this bill short changes the U.S. Coast Guard \nand important port security measures. Through the regular \nappropriations process, I will continue to fight for our veterans, and \nto ensure the security of our coast and our ports.\n  In this bill, we have provided over $15 billion to fix or replace \nequipment that has been damaged during combat operations and to buy \nadditional force protection equipment desperately needed by our brave \nmen and women on the battlefield.\n  To help protect our troops from deadly improvised explosive devices, \nIEDs, this bill creates the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat \nFund and provides the fund with nearly $2 billion to develop and field \nthe necessary tactics, equipment, and training to defeat these deadly \nweapons.\n  To ensure that we do all we can to care for soldiers when they are \ninjured, this bill includes an additional $1 billion for the Defense \nHealth program. This money ensures that we can continue to provide \nworld-class services including rapid aero-medical evacuation to our \nmost severely wounded soldiers.\n  The veterans health care system is stretched to the limit at a time \nwhen more and more veterans are turning to VA. That is why I \ncosponsored an amendment by Senator Akaka to increase veterans funding \nby $430 million to meet the health care needs of soldiers returning \nfrom Iraq and Afghanistan and other war veterans. I am very \ndisappointed that this funding was removed in conference but will \ncontinue to fight for our veterans to ensure they have the funding \nneeded to receive the care they deserve.\n  The rank-and-file employees of the Federal Government are the unsung \nheroes of this country. Unfortunately, they are often required to work \nin substandard or often hazardous conditions. It was recently reported \nthat employees within this very building are forced to enter tunnels \nfull of asbestos and on the verge of collapse. That is why I co-\nsponsored an amendment by Senator Allard that provides over $27 million \nfor critical emergency structural repairs to the Capitol Complex \nutilities tunnels. I will continue to fight for our Federal workforce \nto ensure they have safe working environments and proper safety \nequipment.\n  We know that nearly 40 percent of the soldiers deployed today in Iraq \nand Afghanistan are citizen soldiers who come from the National Guard \nand Reserves. More than half of these will suffer a loss of income when \nthey are mobilized because their military pay is less than the pay from \ntheir civilian job. Many patriotic employers and State governments \neliminate this pay gap by continuing to pay them the difference between \ntheir civilian and military pay. The reservist pay security amendment, \nwhich I worked on with Senator Durbin, was designed to ensure that the \nU.S. Government also makes up for this pay gap for Federal employees \nwho are activated in the Guard and Reserves. Again, this important \npiece of legislation was removed from the bill during conference, but \nit is not dead with me. I will continue to push for equitable treatment \nfor our Guard and Reserve troops who selflessly serve their Nation.\n  After 9/11, we realized that our borders were not secure. Since then, \nwe have waged the war on terror and made great strides in protecting \nour homeland. We have made significant investments in law enforcement \nand security; however, the infrastructure that supports our border \nsecurity has been allowed to crumble.\n  To counter this, I supported an amendment proposed by Senators Gregg \nand Byrd to add $1.9 billion for border security initiatives to include \nbuying additional vehicles, airplanes, helicopters, and ships. This \namendment also provided $600 million for the U.S. Coast Guard, the \nborder protector of our waters. Of this amount, $12 million was for the \nMission Effectiveness Program at the U.S. Coast Guard Yard at Curtis \nBay, MD. This project is designed to extend the service life and \nincrease the mission performance of the Coast Guard's aging fleet of \nmedium endurance cutters. I regret that in conference the House and \nSenate agreed to\n\n[[Page S5906]]\n\nthe President's border security proposal which solely focuses on \nbeefing up the National Guard and border agents along the Nation's \nsouthwest border.\n  I am also disappointed that $648 million for additional port security \ninitiatives was stripped from the final conference agreement. The Port \nof Baltimore, in my hometown, recently celebrated its 300th \nanniversary. It is my responsibility to see to it that the Baltimore \ncommunity celebrates the port's 400th anniversary. We must continue to \nprovide adequate funding for our ports in the manner we are for our \nborders.\n  We have all seen the devastating effects of natural disasters and \nterrorism and are working hard to prevent future occurrences from \naffecting our Nation and the world. We have recently learned of another \npotential threat: a worldwide flu epidemic that could cost millions of \nlives if we are unprepared. In response to this threat, this bill \nprovides $2.3 billion to prepare for and respond to an influenza \npandemic. Making this money available now will help expand the domestic \nproduction capacity of influenza vaccine and will help develop and \nstockpile the right vaccines, antivirals, and other medical supplies \nnecessary to protect and preserve lives in the event of an outbreak.\n  Mr. President, this bill is a Federal investment in supporting our \ntroops and their families and providing relief for those impacted by \nthe devastating hurricanes.\n  We support our troops by getting them the best equipment and the best \nprotection we can provide. We support them by making it easier for our \ncitizen soldiers in the National Guard and Reserves to serve their \ncountry. And we support them by ensuring they are cared for with the \nbest possible medical system when they are injured or ill.\n  With this bill, we are also helping our neighbors rebuild their \nhomes, their communities, and their lives, and I am proud to give it my \nsupport.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the conference report we have before us \ncontains $94.5 billion in funding for the war on terror, hurricane \nrecovery in the gulf coast, pandemic flu preparation, and border \nsecurity.\n  We have to fund our troops. Therefore, I will support passage of this \nconference report. But I do so with reservations, mainly because \nresources for the training and equipping of the Iraqi army have been \nfunded well below the level requested by the President. As all of my \ncolleagues know, training and equipping the Iraqi army is imperative to \nthe ultimate success of our mission there. The security of the Iraqi \npeople, ensured by a properly trained and equipped Iraqi army, is our \nexit strategy.\n  Unfortunately, the must-pass nature of this bill has led to the \ninclusion of hundreds of millions of dollars in unrequested, \nnonemergency spending and typical run-of-the-mill earmarks. Examples of \nunrequested and nonemergency additions to this emergency spending bill \ninclude three Marine Corps V-22 tilt rotor aircraft, two KC-130J tanker \naircraft, four C-130J cargo aircraft, the advance procurement of seven \nC-17 cargo aircraft, and one Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, UAV. It \nalso includes $975 million for SINCGARS tactical radios, $675 million \nin Army tank and Bradley Fighting Vehicle upgrades, $130 million for \nArmy STRYKER vehicles above combat losses, and $567 million for Army \ntrucks. None of these were requested by the administration, and they \nare not critically needed to aid in the war on terror.\n  Let's take a closer look at just one of these add-ons. The conference \nreport includes $230 million to buy three Marine Corps V-22s. The \nPresident did not request any money for the V-22 Osprey, which is still \nin the development and testing stage. In fact, the V-22 has not even \nbeen deployed to an operational squadron yet. If continued development \nand testing goes well, the Marine Corps will send the V-22 to an \noperational squadron in the summer or fall of 2007. I have to question \nwhy funding for a nonoperational aircraft that is still in the \ndevelopment stages is considered to be an emergency in this bill. The \nanswer is that there is no emergency need for this aircraft--if there \nwas, I am more than confident that the President would have requested \nthe appropriate funding in the emergency supplemental submitted last \nFebruary.\n  Additionally, the conference report contains a provision which \nauthorizes the Secretary of the Navy to reimburse shipbuilding \ncontractors for ``business disruptions'' that were incurred during and \nafter Hurricane Katrina. This provision may increase Navy shipbuilding \ncosts by $140 million over what the administration had requested. The \nprovision is expected to primarily benefit Northrop Grumman's shipyard \nin Pascagoula, MS. This language substitutes Government funding for \nwhat insurers would pay to shipbuilders. Northrop Grumman is suing its \ninsurer, Factory Mutual, for those costs associated with Hurricane \nKatrina. However, in the near term, the appropriators have decided the \nbest course is to arrange a giveaway to an insurance company and a \nshipbuilder.\n  Furthermore, the explanatory statement accompanying this conference \nreport contains language stating that the conferees agree with House \nand Senate language delaying the Department of Transportation, DOT, \nrulemaking which proposes to give domestic air carriers with foreign \ninvestors more control over business matters. Yet this legislative \nlanguage does not include any related provisions, and rightly so, in my \nview. This greater control would only be granted for business matters \nthat do not relate to safety or security and only when the investors' \nhome countries provide our airlines with investment and market access. \nI assure my colleagues this statement was not included by accident, and \nits intent seems to be to signal to DOT that Congress does not approve \nof its proposed rulemaking.\n  Here are some other notable projects funded as ``emergencies'' in \nthis measure: $16 million for hurricane repair in the State of \nPennsylvania; $40 million for sugar and sugarcane disaster assistance \nin Florida, which was not requested; $40 million for sugar and \nsugarcane disaster assistance in Louisiana, which was not requested by \nthe President; $400,000 for disaster assistance to sugar cooperatives \nin Texas, which was not requested by the President. $400,000 to the \nChicago Sanitary and Ship Canal Demonstration barrier, which was not \nrequested by the President; $9 million in drought emergency assistance \nto communities in Nevada and New Mexico; $225,000 to the Missouri \nSoybean Association for the purchase of a building for use as an \nincubation center in the Kansas City metropolitan statistical area; \n$100,000 to the Boys and Girls Club of Greater Washington in Silver \nSpring, MD for renovation of Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Washington \nClubhouse No. 2, Clubhouse No. 4, Clubhouse No. 10, Clubhouse No. 11, \nand Clubhouse No. 14 in the District of Columbia; $100,000 to Wesleyan \nCollege in Macon, GA, for facility renovation, buildout, and \nconstruction; $125,000 to Craig County, VA, for purchase, renovation, \nbuildout, and upgrade of a library.\n  I think we can fund this war--and indeed win this war--while also \nbudgeting for this war. We know the war is going to cost more than the \nover $400 billion we will have appropriated to date upon enactment of \nthis conference report, and we know that the war is not going to end as \nquickly as most of us would prefer. But we need to continue our \nmilitary operations until the job is done. Withdrawing our military \npresence prematurely is not an option in my view, the view of many of \nmy colleagues, nor the view of the President or his advisers. We are in \nit to win.\n  Instead of fixing the problem, and fixing it will not be easy, we \nhave only succeeded in making it bigger, more unstable, more \ncomplicated, and much more expensive. And adding hundreds of billions \nof dollars that are more conveniently designated as emergency \nexpenditures--so that they don't have to be budgeted for along with \nother national priorities--is only making the fiscal problem that much \ngreater.\n  Again, Mr. President, it is unfortunate that, at a time of war and \nwith such a huge deficit and burgeoning debt, we continue to fund \nunnecessary projects and load up emergency supplemental appropriations \nbills with nonemergency items. We need to concentrate on providing the \nresources necessary for our young men and women swerving in Iraq to \nsuccessfully complete their mission, so that they\n\n[[Page S5907]]\n\ncan return safely to their families, and a grateful Nation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the conference report provides needed \nfunds to meet a number of our national security needs. It includes \n$65.8 billion of funding for ongoing military operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, to give our troops the armored vehicles, ammunition, \nmedical supplies, and other materials essential for their operations.\n  The legislation also provides funds for the Commander's Emergency \nResponse Program, which enables commanders on the ground to pay for \nurgently needed infrastructure, and also to make condolence payments to \nIraqi civilians who are injured or killed. That program is intended to \nbuild good will with the Iraqis, and I commend the Appropriations \nCommittee for taking such a strong interest in it.\n  During consideration of the bill, we had a strong debate about \nwhether the nondefense items in the bill were truly emergencies and \nbelonged in this legislation. Most of us believe they do because the \nbudget process does not allow us to respond quickly to urgent needs, \nand the emergency supplemental process is the only way we can address \nthem.\n  It is clear that border security, hurricane relief, and pandemic flu \npreparations all affect our national security. The need for these funds \ncannot easily be assessed in advance and made part of the regular \nbudget. But no one can disagree that each has a profound impact on our \nNation and has to be addressed.\n  I commend Senator Harkin for his leadership on the needed funding to \nprepare for a pandemic flu. Those of us on the authorizing committee \nlook forward to continuing to work with Senator Burr to see that these \nfunds are used effectively to increase the Nation's readiness for this \nmajor disease threat.\n  I am disappointed that the conference report rejected our Senate \namendment to compensate first responders injured by experimental flu \nvaccines. If pandemic flu reaches our shores, Americans will have to \nrely heavily on nurses, paramedics, emergency technicians, and other \nfirst responders. The question is whether these first responders will \nrisk taking an experimental vaccine so that they can stay on the job \nand protect us all. The least these brave first responders deserve is \nfair compensation if they are harmed by the vaccine. We know from past \nexperience that without such a compensation program, first responders \nwill be reluctant to take experimental vaccines. The Senate did the \nright thing, to fund a compensation program, but Republican leaders \ninexplicably allowed the House conferees to reject the funds. The \nmessage we are sending to first responders is obvious--``You're on your \nown'' and a pandemic will be even more disastrous if it hits.\n  I am very pleased, however, that our colleagues on the Appropriations \nCommittee included critical funding to provide relief to elementary and \nsecondary schools in the gulf region and to schools across the country \nthat generously opened their doors to young students whose lives were \nturned upside down by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. This additional \nfunding will help ensure that the schools that educated displaced \nstudents are reimbursed for the additional costs incurred during this \nschool year so that they can continue to provide good education for all \nthe children they serve.\n  The schools, colleges, and universities are a cornerstone of the gulf \ncommunities, and their recovery is essential to the successful \nrebuilding of the region. I am disappointed that the conferees rejected \na Senate provision that would have leveraged hundreds of millions of \ndollars of low-cost loans for these colleges and universities. I am \npleased, however, that the conferees increased the grant aid in the \nbill to help these colleges and universities rebuild. These funds are a \nstep in the right direction to enable these institutions to remain a \nvital part of the gulf coast.\n  On the issue of education, we know that countless families across \nAmerica are struggling to put their children through college. The last \nthing they need is an increase in interest rates on student loans. I \ncommend the Appropriations Committee for expanding loan consolidation \noptions and resisting efforts by lenders to increase the burden of \ncollege debt. Last February, Congress perpetrated the biggest raid on \ncollege aid in the history of the program, cutting $12 billion from \nstudent loan programs to help pay for tax giveaways to the wealthy. We \nneed to do more to help struggling families afford college, and the \ncommittee's action on this bill is a step in the right direction.\n  This bill includes an important provision to support our objective of \npromoting democracy in Iraq. It includes $50 million for American \nnongovernmental organizations helping Iraqis to create the essential \nbuilding blocks of democracy. The funds will go to seven \nnongovernmental organizations doing excellent work in Iraq on democracy \nand reconciliation under extremely difficult and dangerous conditions. \nWe must be clear in our commitment to stand by these organizations that \nare serving on the front lines in the struggle for democracy in Iraq \nevery day. We need to demonstrate to the Iraqi people that we are \ncommitted to Iraq's long-term democratic development. We must have a \nlong-term strategy backed by appropriate resources, and this bill is a \nstart toward achieving our goal.\n  While this bill contains much that is positive, I strongly oppose the \ndecision of our Republican colleagues to include a deeming resolution \nin this conference report that will impose an unreasonably low limit on \ndiscretionary spending for next year. This cap means that critical \ndomestic programs will be cut. It is a sorry substitute for a real \nbudget.\n  The deeming resolution completely ignores the Senate-passed budget. \nIt sets a spending cap $16 billion below the level approved by a \nbipartisan majority of Senators in the Senate budget resolution. It \nwipes out an amendment passed by the Senate to add $7 billion for \nurgent health and education needs. It cuts funding for vital medical \nresearch by the National Institutes of Health. It underfunds the No \nChild Left Behind education initiative by $55.7 billion over the next 5 \nyears. It sets the wrong priorities for America.\n  This deeming resolution indicates a willingness on the part of \nRepublicans in Congress to blindly follow the Bush administration's \nreckless strategy of cutting essential domestic programs American \nfamilies depend upon while providing more and more tax breaks for the \nwealthiest taxpayers in the country. It is outrageous. It is one more \nfailure for a Republican leadership that consistently takes the country \nin the wrong direction.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to acknowledge a tangible result \nof our Federal Government's investment in preparing for a possible flu \npandemic. This week, the U.S. Agency for International Development, \nUSAID, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, in \npartnership with the Wildlife Conservation Society launched the Global \nAvian Influenza Network for the Surveillance of wild birds, or the \nGAINS program.\n  GAINS systematically tests and monitors wild and dead birds to \nidentify the viral strains they carry, to share the virus samples in \norder to continually update vaccine production options, and to \ndisseminate lab results on a map-based publicly accessible database. \nMajor flyways around the world will be monitored including those \nrunning north-south through the Americas.\n  I wish to recognize Chairman Cochran from Mississippi and Senator \nByrd from West Virginia, along with my colleagues, Senator Harkin from \nIowa, Senator Specter from Pennsylvania, and Senator Brownback from \nKansas, for their commitment to avian flu preparedness and for putting \nin place an effective system for the surveillance of wild birds. GAINS \nis instrumental to our capacity to prepare communities in the wake of \nwild birds moving with the virus for a potential outbreak.\n  At the same time we work to develop a vaccine and procure antivirals, \nwe can also track the movement of the virus in wild birds. GAINS can \ntrack wild birds in the same way the National Hurricane Center tracks \nhurricanes. By analyzing, storing, and reporting using a real-time \ncomputerized data mapping system and interface, we can see the viral \nstrains wild birds carry, where they are carrying the virus along \nmigratory routes, and how the virus is genetically evolving. This will \nmake it possible for us to develop\n\n[[Page S5908]]\n\nvaccines more quickly using the most recent strain available and will \nhelp us warn vulnerable populations in wild bird flightpaths should the \navian flu strain turn deadly.\n  I am happy to report that the GAINS program and Dr. William Karesh at \nthe Wildlife Conservation Society have already contributed vital \ndisease samples of the highly pathogenic H5Nl virus from Mongolian \nswans to the efforts currently under way to develop a human vaccine for \navian influenza.\n  The Wildlife Conservation Society has partnered with USAID and the \nCDC to spearhead this effort. They are an international conservation \norganization headquartered at the Bronx Zoo in New York and have \noffices across the world, including my home State of Connecticut. With \nmore than 3,000 full-time staff working in 60 countries around the \nworld on more than 400 field conservation projects, the Wildlife \nConservation Society is well positioned to lead the global efforts to \nmonitor the disease in birds and provide key information to local \ncommunities to mitigate the effects of future outbreaks. Our \nGovernment's capacity to build partnerships such as this one and \ncontinue to fund them with nongovernmental organizations with \ntremendous expertise and others in the private sector is key to \neffectively fighting a potential pandemic.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, this supplemental appropriation \nprovides funds that are urgently needed by our Armed Forces to sustain \nthe global war on terror and our operations to stabilize Iraq and \nAfghanistan. The $70 billion provided in this appropriation for \nmilitary operations brings America's investment in this fight to over \n$445 billion since September 11, 2001. Included in this appropriation \nare funds necessary to keep our Guard strong and ready and to ensure \nthat our reservists have access to essential medical coverage for \nthemselves and their families.\n  With respect to domestic assistance in this bill, while it is not \nperfect, because it removed funding for port security and veterans' \nhealth care, and greatly reduced the amount of agriculture assistance \nthat was originally included in the Senate passed bill, it does provide \nimmediate aid to the people of the gulf coast to help in their \ncontinuing effort to recover from last year's hurricanes.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Cochran of Mississippi and Senator Byrd of West \nVirginia, for their leadership and even handedness in crafting this \nsupplemental measure. They have been very kind towards my constituents \nand I am most appreciative of their efforts. This supplemental \naddresses three areas critical to the continued recovery and vitality \nof Florida.\n  Florida was hit by eight hurricanes in 15 months and the recovery \ncontinues, even as Tropical Storm Alberto traversed the State \nyesterday. I know that my colleagues from the gulf coast are also well \naware of the long-term challenges facing their States and are bracing \nthemselves for another active hurricane season. We all learned valuable \nlessons from the disasters of the past 2 years and we will face the \ncoming months together.\n  I am pleased that this supplemental includes some relief for the \nState of Florida's hard hit agriculture industry. In 2005 as in 2004, \nthe Florida agriculture industry sustained more than $2 billion in \nlosses. One of the hardest hit industries was the sugar industry, so \nthe $40 million in assistance this bill provides to the sugar producers \nwill be critical. Our specialty crops and nursery growers also will \nreceive a much-needed share of the $95 million provided in the bill.\n  The measure also provides the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, NOAA, with emergency funding. I cannot emphasize how \nimportant the work of this agency is to Florida. It includes the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service, NMFS, that plays a key role in \nFlorida because of our significant fishing industry--both recreational \nand commercial. And the National Weather Service whose hurricane \nforecasts many times mean the difference between life and death for \nFloridians. This emergency supplemental provides $150 million for \nmapping for debris removal, oyster bed and shrimp ground \nrehabilitation, the repair and reconstruction of the NOAA science \nfacility on the Gulf of Mexico and a replacement emergency response \nmapping aircraft to provide information about hurricane damage--all \ndesperately needed.\n  Additionally, the conference report maintains the Senate funding \nlevel of $5.2 billion for the Community Development Block Grant, CDBG, \nprogram. The President's original request was for $4.2 billion to \naddress the utter devastation caused by Katrina in Louisiana. Yet unmet \nneeds from the previous Gulf of Mexico hurricanes still remain in \nFlorida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas. This level of CDBG funding \nwill ensure that all States harmed by last year's hurricanes will \nreceive an adequate level of continued support so that they may \ncontinue to invest in long-term recovery efforts, provide housing and \nbusiness assistance, perform infrastructure reconstruction, and \nundertake mitigation efforts.\n  Specific to Florida, additional CDBG funds will greatly help \nPanhandle communities impacted by Hurricane Dennis, who were not \neligible for the last round of disaster CDBG funds, and the heavily \npopulated areas of South Florida where insured damages from Wilma were \nestimated at $7.4 billion. Hurricane Wilma was a major hurricane, the \nfinal major storm of last season, causing the highest amount of insured \nlosses to southeast Florida since Hurricane Andrew over a decade ago.\n  Chairman Bond and Ranking Member Murray included a provision in the \nbill that will help address the backlog of emergency highway repairs. I \nthank them for their efforts, as this provision is vital to Florida's \nPanhandle which was pummeled by Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and then by \nDennis in 2005. It includes language lifting the mandatory cap of $100 \nmillion in spending per state. Florida has about $118 million in \ndamages left over from Dennis, most of it concentrated along US-98, \nwhich runs along the coast of Florida from Tallahassee to Pensacola, a \ndistance of over 200 miles.\n  The assistance contained in the supplemental will go a long way \ntowards the recovery of the gulf coast and I will support this measure.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is approving \ntoday the conference report on this supplemental appropriations bill.\n  The bill provides funding to replenish the spending accounts of the \nDepartment of Defense, the Department of State, as well as other \nagencies and departments of the Government which are engaged in the war \non terror. The conference report also makes available needed funding \nfor efforts to repair and rebuild the homes, businesses, and public \nfacilities that were damaged by hurricanes that struck the Gulf Coast \nregion last year.\n  A bipartisan majority of the conferees have reconciled the \ndifferences between the two bills and reached agreement on the \nconference report. The House also approved the conference report by a \nvote of 351 to 67.\n  The conference agreement provides a total of $94.519 billion. Of this \namount, over $70 billion is provided to carry out the global war on \nterror and to cover the expenses of ongoing operations and \nreconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Title II of the agreement provides $19.338 billion for hurricane \nrelated damage and recovery costs. Title III provides $500 million for \nagriculture disaster assistance to hurricane affected areas. Title IV \nincludes $2.3 billion for influenza pandemic preparation and response \nactivities. Title V provides $1.9 billion for various border security \ninitiatives. Title VI includes $27.6 million for the Architect of the \nCapitol to address health and safety concerns in the utility tunnels in \nthe Capitol complex. Finally, title VII includes general provisions and \ntechnical corrections.\n  This conference agreement is the result of hard work and true \ncompromise between the House and Senate, and I am pleased the Senate is \nprepared to approve it.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n\n[[Page S5909]]\n\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, today I voted in favor of the fiscal \nyear 2006 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the \nGlobal War on Terror, and Hurricane Recovery conference report despite \nmy serious reservations about using an emergency supplemental bill to \nfund ongoing U.S. operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and despite the \nfact that the bill fails to change the flawed and dangerous policy in \nIraq that this administration is pursuing. That policy is taking a \ntremendous toll on our Nation's resources and our national security, \nand I will continue to look for every opportunity to force the Senate \nto debate and vote on changing that policy.\n  I supported the conference report because it included necessary \nfunding for our troops, along with vital assistance to those \ncommunities devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and to those \nsuffering in war-torn countries and those countries in need of \nimmediate funding for their newly formed democracies. I am particularly \npleased to see that $618 million is being provided for establishing \npeace in Darfur and $63 million for supporting the nascent Liberian \nGovernment that was recently elected.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I thank all Senators for their patience \nand support during our deliberations on this conference report. I think \nthe vote reflects strong sentiment that we have reached an agreement \nthat is fair. It reflects respect for the administration's budget \nrequest and remaining within that budget request.\n  I appreciate the cooperation of all members of our Appropriations \nCommittee and the full Senate as well.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Department \nof Defense authorization bill is the pending business before the \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/15/senate-section/article/S5909-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5909-S5921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2007\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, he is not on the floor, but Senator Warner \nand I have been discussing this amendment. I would like to at least \nleave open the option that he will join me in cosponsoring it. It is a \nbipartisan amendment which I would like to describe at this point, if I \ncan, and ask the Senator from Oklahoma if I may have a few minutes to \ndescribe the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes. Before the Senator from Illinois proceeds, I would \nlike to comment. The Senator has worked very hard on this amendment. \nThere is a problem that the Senator is seeking to correct, and I \nbelieve the amendment does correct it. I join him as a cosponsor of \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you very much. I am honored that the Senator from \nOklahoma would join me as a cosponsor.\n  In speaking to this amendment, this morning's Washington Post had a \nfront-page story that should startle and trouble all of us. It is a \nstory about the status of emergency rooms in hospitals across America. \nThe organization that represents the emergency rooms and their \nphysicians across America has issued a troubling report which suggests \nthat many of those emergency rooms are not really adequately staffed or \nprepared to deal with emergencies. Too often, the men and women who are \nbrought there in terrible medical situations can't find the help they \nneed. As a result, they are shipped off to other hospitals or they wait \nsometimes up to 2 days before they are admitted to a bed in the regular \nhospital. It is a serious problem.\n  You might ask: What does that have to do with the Department of \nDefense authorization bill? Part of the problem facing the emergency \nrooms is also facing hospitals and clinics across America, and the \nproblem is this: We don't have enough health care professionals; in \nparticular, we don't have enough nurses in America. We know this is a \nfact.\n  Just last week, an administrator of a major hospital in Chicago came \nto see me. She is a wonderful woman. She is a Catholic nun who runs a \nhospital in one of the toughest parts of Chicago--Inglewood--and she \nhas kept that hospital open. I don't know how she has done it. It has \nbeen nothing short of a miracle. The biggest single problem that she \nfaces year in and year out is not just coming up with money but finding \nnurses.\n  I said to her: What do you pay a nurse?\n  And she said: About $50,000 a year. But, she said, if I can't hire \nthat nurse for $50,000 a year, I have to buy what we call contract \nnurses. There are companies which, when hospitals don't have enough \nnurses, will send a nurse in to work for a day, a week, or a month. But \nthe contract nurses cost three times as much, $150,000 annualized \nsalary.\n  She said to me: Senator, I don't know if I can keep this hospital \nopen if I can't find nurses.\n  This isn't just a problem at that hospital. It is a problem across my \nState and across our Nation. I am from downstate Illinois, a part of \nour State dominated by smaller towns, rural areas, struggling to keep \nhospitals open. We know better than most that when one of our neighbors \ngoes into labor, she may not have the time to make it to the big city \nwhere there is a big hospital. She is counting on that rural hospital \nbeing open. When she gets there, she is counting on finding a nurse and \na doctor to help her.\n  In many places in rural Illinois and across our country, the same \nchallenge that faces the administrator of that hospital in the \nInglewood section of Chicago is facing them: inadequate supplies of \nprofessionals, health care professionals.\n  The ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have increased the need \nfor qualified nurses in military medical facilities. Unfortunately, the \nmilitary faces the same difficulty in recruiting and in the retention \nof nurses as the civilian medical facilities which I just described. \nNeither the Army nor the Air Force has met their nurse recruitment \ngoals since the 1990s. In 2004, the Navy nurse core recruitment fell 32 \npercent below its target, while the Air Force missed its nurse \nrecruitment target by 30 percent.\n  Have you seen this special on HBO called ``Baghdad ER''? I have \nwatched a little bit of it. As you watch it, you realize the heroic \nefforts that are being made by the men and women in the military who \nare providing emergency medical care to our soldiers who are shot in \nIraq. It is incredible. It is heartbreaking to think about what they go \nthrough every day.\n  Now, put it in the context where the major sources of military nurses \nare telling us they can't recruit enough nurses fast enough. Last year, \nthe Army experienced a 30-percent shortage of certified registered \nnurse anesthetists, as one example.\n\n[[Page S5911]]\n\n  I have talked about civilian hospitals. According to the American \nCollege of Health Care Executives, 72 percent of hospitals have been \nexperiencing a nursing shortage since 2004, and it is growing. This \nchart that I will show you is an indication of the projected shortfalls \nand shortages in registered nurses. The dark blue indicates the supply \nof nurses, which continues to decline, and, of course, the lighter \nblue, the shortage, which continues to increase. As you can see, our \nneed for nurses is growing, and it is no surprise. We have an aging \npopulation that needs help: specialized medical care that requires \nspecialized nurses. Time and again we find ourselves relying and \ncounting on those nurses to be there, and we see from this chart as we \nproject forward for the next 15 years that the problem is going to get \nmuch worse.\n\n  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services looked at all \nlicensed nurses, both civilian and military. They found that in the \nyear 2000, our country was 110,000 nurses short of the number needed to \nadequately provide quality health care--110,000 across our Nation. Five \nyears later, that shortage had doubled to 219,000 nurses that we needed \nand didn't have in America. By the year 2020, we will be more than 1 \nmillion nurses short of what is necessary for quality health care.\n  Now, the National Institutes of Health can engage in medical research \nto find new cures and treatments for diseases, and God bless them for \nall the work they do. The best and brightest minds can get together in \nlaboratories and find new pharmaceuticals and new medical devices that \ngive us a new lease on life. But we know that when the moment comes, \nwhen we need this help, we need a nurse. And if we find ourselves in a \nfew short years with a million fewer nurses than we actually need, it \nwill compromise the quality and availability of health care in America. \nIt is not just a problem for the military, as I mentioned earlier, it \nis a nationwide problem.\n  To avoid the vast shortages the Department of Health and Human \nServices is projecting, we have to make a significant and substantial \nincrease in the number of nurses graduating and entering the workforce \neach year. Just to replace the nurses who are retiring, we need to \nincrease student enrollment at nursing schools by 40 percent. This \nchart is an indication of where we are, starting in the year 2000. This \nshows the baseline supply of nurses across America, which you can see \nis declining. This next line, the green line, shows the demand which is \ngoing up dramatically for nurses in our society, and this purple line \nshows what happens if 90 percent--the supply if 90 percent more grads \ntake place. So even increasing graduate nurses by 90 percent over the \nnext 15 years will still leave us short of our national goal.\n  Clearly, this is an emergency which has to be addressed. The baseline \ndemand for nurses is rising; the supply is falling. If we increase the \nnumber of nurses graduating from nursing school by 90 percent by 2020, \nwe are still not going to have enough.\n  I might add parenthetically, there is another element to this issue. \nI have been involved in this as long as I have been in public service. \nSmall hospitals, small towns come to you desperate because they have \nlost their doctor. They need a doctor, and I do my best to find a \ndoctor. But in 9 cases out of 10, the doctor you find comes from a \nforeign land. Many doctors have come to the United States from India, \nfrom Asia, from Africa, and we welcome them. We greet their families \nwarmly as they have come to our country, and they are meeting our \nneeds. And I thank them for making the decision to come and be a part \nof the solution to America's health care problem. But I have come to \nlearn that there are two sides to this equation. The other side of the \nequation, of course, is that these doctors and nurses and health care \nprofessionals are leaving a land, too.\n  Last year, and over the last several years, we have taken 20,000 \nhealth care professionals out of Africa; doctors and nurses, people who \nreally are essential in the frontline of defense when it comes to \nmedical care. We have attracted them to the United States, to England, \nto Germany, and to France, and it is no surprise that they want to be \nhere. Doctors in central Africa are paid $600 a month by the \nGovernment, if they are paid. They work in substandard conditions. \nDespite their education, they struggle to provide even the most basic \ncare. In the area of eastern Congo in Goma, where I visited with \nSenator Brownback just a few months ago, we learned that there was one \ndoctor for every 160,000 people. Think about that: one doctor for every \n160,000 people. What is the number in the United States? We have 549 \ndoctors for every 100,000 people. Also, think about what it means when \nit comes to specialties like surgery.\n  I asked them in this hospital in Goma in Congo--where women were \nlined up in long lines praying that this would be the day or the week \nor the month when they would finally have the necessary surgery that \nthey had been waiting so long for--I asked them: How many surgeons do \nyou have in this part of Africa? This doctor said to me: We have one \nsurgeon for every 1 million people--one surgeon for every 1 million. \nWhat does that mean? It would mean in the United States, three surgeons \nfor the entire city of Chicago. Think about what those poor people face \nwithout those medical professionals.\n  So those who argue that the answer to our need in the United States \nwill be bringing in nurses and doctors and professionals from around \nthe world have to understand that this equation is not a zero sum. We \nend up bringing in these health care professionals at the expense of \nother countries and other people who face many more medical challenges \nthan in the United States.\n  Some would say: Well, that is their problem. They ought to pay their \ndoctors more or train more. But it is our problem, too. If an avian flu \nepidemic, God forbid, should ever start, if there would be a \ntransmission from an animal to a human, it would likely occur in one of \nthese developing nations. If they don't have the capacity to move \nimmediately to contain that crisis to make sure there are public health \nofficials and doctors and nurses present, and if they don't do it \nwithin 21 days, that epidemic can circle the world.\n  Diseases which used to die on immigrant ships coming across the ocean \nlive quite well, unfortunately, on the airliners that crisscross this \nglobe every single day. So if you take away the medical professionals \nin some of the poorest nations on Earth, you are opening the \npossibility that the dread diseases in that part of the world will make \nit to our part of the world. That is part of this shrinking globe on \nwhich we live.\n  The problem, when you look at the United States, is that there are \nnot enough teachers at schools of nursing. Last year, nursing colleges \nacross America denied admission to 35,000 qualified applicants for \nnursing school simply because they didn't have enough teachers at the \nnursing schools. Think about that: 35,000 more nurses that we could \ntrain and have serving us and others in the military and civilian life.\n  In my home State of Illinois, schools of nursing are denying \nqualified students admittance because they don't have enough teachers. \nLast year, 1,900 qualified student applicants were rejected from \nIllinois nursing schools because there weren't enough professors. \nNorthern Illinois University in Dekalb, one of our best, was forced to \nturn down 233 qualified nursing applicants because they didn't have \nenough teachers and financial resources.\n\n  Illinois State University, another top university in our State, \nincreased its enrollment by 50 percent in nursing over the past 5 years \nby working with health care systems and seeking grants, but last year, \nISU was still forced to reject 100 qualified nursing applicants because \nthey didn't have enough faculty and fiscal resources.\n  Take a look at this chart which is an indication of what we are being \ntold by nursing schools. Sixty-six percent, or two out of three nursing \nschools across the United States, tell us that they need additional \nfaculty. We find that in some schools there are no vacancies and no \nadditional faculty needed. That is 18 percent. And in 15 percent, \nalmost 16 percent, there are no vacancies, but they could use \nadditional faculty. They could expand. The American Association of \nColleges of Nursing surveyed more than 400 schools of nursing last \nyear. As I said, two out of three reported vacancies in their faculty. \nFifteen percent said they are fully staffed\n\n[[Page S5912]]\n\nbut could use more faculty. These statistics paint a bleak picture for \nthe availability of nursing faculties now and into the future.\n  Take a look at this final chart I will show you which is showing that \nthere is, as in most things in America, a graying of the population \nthat serves us. The median age of doctorally prepared nursing faculty \nmembers is 52. The average age of retirement for faculty at nursing \ninstitutions is 62. It is expected that 200 to 300 doctorally prepared \nfaculty will be eligible for retirement each year from 2005 to 2012, \nreducing faculty, even though more than a million are needed. The \nmilitary recruits nurses.\n  I want to thank all the men and women who are in nursing in the \nmilitary and all in our medical professions. But they recruit from the \nsame place that doctors and hospitals also recruit: civilian nursing \nschools.\n  Unless we address the lack of faculty, there is going to be a \nshortage of nurses everywhere. In 1994, the Department of Defense \nestablished a program which is a terrific idea. It is called Troops to \nTeachers. It serves the dual purpose of helping relieve the shortages \nof math, science, and special education teachers in high-poverty \nschools and assists military personnel in making transitions from the \nmilitary to a second career in teaching. It is a terrific idea. As of \nJanuary 2004--listen to this--more than 6,000 former soldiers have been \nhired as teachers through the Troops to Teachers Program, and an \nadditional 6,700 are now qualified teachers looking for placements. We \nneed teachers, and the men and women trained and educated in the \nmilitary who want to serve bring a special quality to this mission.\n  The amendment which I have before the Senate will set up a pilot \nprogram--we call it Troops to Nurse Teachers--to encourage nurses in \nthe Reserves, retiring nurses, or those leaving the military, to pursue \na career teaching the future nurse workforce. More than 300 nurses left \nthe Army last year. Historically, about 330 nurses leave the Air Force \neach year. Between 30 and 40 percent of the nurses in the Navy leave \nafter they fulfill their initial obligation.\n  The Troops to Nurse Teachers Pilot Program will provide transitional \nassistance for servicemembers who already hold a master's or Ph.D. in \nnursing or related field and are qualified to teach. Eligible \nservicemembers can receive career placement assistance, transitional \nstipends, and educational training from accredited schools of nursing \nto expedite their transition. Troops to Nurse Teachers will also \nestablish a pilot scholarship program that will provide financial \nassistance to officers of the armed services who have been involved in \nnursing during their military service and help them obtain the \neducation necessary to become nursing educators. Tuition stipends and \nfinancing for educational expenses would be provided. Recipients of \nscholarships must commit to teaching at an accredited school of nursing \nfor at least 3 years in exchange for the educational support they \nreceive. The Secretary of Defense may also require them to continue \ntheir service in selected reserve areas or perform other public service \nin exchange for this program.\n  The supporters of this amendment include the American Nurses \nAssociation, the American Hospital Association, the American \nAssociation of Colleges of Nursing, the American Organization of Nurse \nExecutives, the American Health Care Association, and the National \nLeague for Nursing.\n  Let me conclude. We must increase the number of teachers preparing \ntomorrow's nursing workforce. With the aging of the baby boom \ngeneration, long-term needs of growing numbers of wounded veterans and \nmilitary and civilian health care systems will need qualified nurses \nmore than ever in the years to come. Let's take quality men and women \nserving in the armed services, who gave so much to this country, and \ntell them that when they leave the armed services there is an option \nwhere they can continue to serve America as professors and teachers in \nour nursing schools. This will increase the capacity of these nursing \nschools, provide more nurses for America, which is what we need, and \nlessen the demand for nurses to come from overseas where they are also \ndesperately needed. I think this is a winning opportunity all across \nthe board, and I encourage my colleagues from both sides of the aisle \nto support this bipartisan amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first of all, let me acknowledge to my \nfriend from Illinois he is attempting to, and I believe will \nsuccessfully, resolve a problem. I happen to be more sensitive to this \nthan most people. Two of my kids are doctors, and they assure me that \nthis nurse shortage is nationwide. It is all out there.\n  One of the concerns I had when this came up was I would not want this \nto detract from any of the other programs. Right now I have been one to \nsay our military budget, our Defense authorization bill, is really not \nquite adequate as it is. It is my understanding the Senator has been \nvery cooperative to make sure this doesn't happen.\n  I have added my name as a cosponsor, and it is my understanding \nSenator Warner is going to be here shortly and wants to add his name. \nSo the amendment would give the discretion to the DOD, working with the \nDepartment of Education, to structure a program that would achieve the \ndual goals of creating more nurse educators and more Reserve officers. \nI think we have the support of the committee on both sides, and I \ncommend the Senator for bringing up this solution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I spoke with Senator Warner about this amendment. I would \nreally appreciate his cosponsorship, but I don't want to ask his name \nbe added until we are certain. If there are any difficulties on this \namendment, I stand ready to change it. We want to find a good \nbipartisan response. There are just a few elements we are still working \non.\n  I don't know if the Senator from Oklahoma thinks this is the time for \nus to move for passage of the amendment or whether we should wait?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I respond I personally think it is time to pass it. We \nhave limited time. This is one that enjoys support from both sides of \nthe aisle. I am sure the Senator from Virginia can put his name on this \nand will make his own expression when he gets here.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise in support of this amendment to \ncreate a pilot program on troops to nurse teachers. America is facing a \nnursing shortage and it is getting worse. America's nurses are \noverworked, underpaid, and undervalued yet nursing schools are still \nforced to turn away qualified students. More than 30,000 qualified \napplicants were turned away last year. In Maryland, nursing programs \nturned away more than 2,000 qualified students last year. Why are they \nturning away all of these qualified applicants? Because there aren't \nenough teachers to teach them. This is the biggest bottleneck in ending \nthe nursing shortage.\n  The military is also facing a nursing shortage. Medicine is a 24-hour \njob. Military medicine is even harder. Our military medical \nprofessionals have accomplished something truly remarkable in this war: \ninjured troops who make it to a field hospital have a 96 percent rate \nof survival. That is a testament to our military doctors and nurses on \nthe front lines.\n  We need to make sure there are enough military nurses to continue to \nprovide this outstanding care. Neither the Army nor the Air Force have \nmet their nurse recruitment goals since the 1990s. In 2004, Navy Nurse \nCorps recruitment fell 32 percent below its target. The Air Force and \nArmy are also 30 percent below their targets. All branches of the \nmilitary are offering incentives for nurses to join the Armed Forces. \nBut there simply aren't enough nurses to fill those jobs because there \naren't enough teachers to train them. There is a pool of potential \nnurse educators in our retired nurse corps. We should take advantage of \ntheir experience and their dedication to teach the next generation of \nmilitary nurses.\n  This amendment would help to train the next generation of military \nnurses and help to curb the nursing shortage by encouraging nurse corps \nofficers to become nurse educators. It establishes a ``Troops to Nurse \nTeachers'' pilot program which will provide scholarships and other \nfinancial assistance to\n\n[[Page S5913]]\n\nnurse corps officers so that they can get advanced degrees to become \nnurse educators. In exchange for these scholarships, they must teach \nfor at least 3 years in a school of nursing and continue service in \neither the reserves or another form of public service. This is modeled \nafter the ``Troops to Teachers'' program which gives incentives to \npeople leaving the military to become teachers. Since 1994, more than \n8,000 former soldiers have been hired as teachers through this program.\n  We must make sure our troops have enough nurses to keep them safe. \nThe nursing shortage affects every State, every city, every town. And \nit affects our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. There are so many \ndedicated military nurses that still want to give back to their \ncountry. They can do this by teaching the next generation of military \nnurses. But we must empower them to choose nurse education--making it \nmore affordable, providing opportunities for advancement--so nurses can \nmove up instead of moving on and so our troops get the care that they \nneed. I thank my colleagues for accepting this amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4253) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I was outraged this morning when I \nread a Washington Post article that suggests that the Prime Minister of \nIraq is willing to allow an amnesty for those who have taken American \nlives. In this article, the Prime Minister of Iraq is quoted as saying:\n\n       Reconciliation could include an amnesty for those ``who \n     weren't involved in the shedding of Iraqi blood. . . .''\n\n  That is where his quote ends. Mr. Prime Minister, how about American \nblood? Are you willing to have reconciliation on the pool of American \nblood that has been spilled to give your people and your country a \nchance for freedom?\n  Then to read on in this article, where a top adviser to Prime \nMinister Maliki is asked about clemency for those who attack U.S. \ntroops, he is quoted as saying:\n\n       ``That's an area where we can see a green line. There's \n     some sort of preliminary understanding between us and the \n     MNF-I,'' the U.S.-led Multi-National Force-Iraq, ``that there \n     is a patriotic feeling among the Iraqi youth and the belief \n     that those attacks are legitimate acts of resistance and \n     defending their homeland. These people will be pardoned \n     definitely, I believe.''\n\n  Pardoned definitely? So those who were armed and killed Iraqis, they \nwill not be pardoned. Those who were armed and killed Americans, they \nwill be pardoned? That is outrageous. President Bush, you went to Iraq \nand you said you wanted to look into the eyes of Prime Minister Maliki \nto know that he is a man you can trust, a man who will move us forward. \nI don't know how deep you looked into his soul, but you have to pick up \nthe phone today and tell Prime Minister Maliki that we will not have \nthe ability to pardon anyone with the blood of American soldiers on \ntheir hands.\n  Today we have hit the mark of 2,500 Americans who have given their \nlives to give the Iraqi people a chance. We have thousands of our young \nmen and women who have returned to America wounded, who have lost their \nlegs, who have lost their limbs, lost their sight, have had half of \ntheir faces blown off. Their blood was shed in Iraq. Are we going to \nstand by and permit an amnesty to be given to those who killed our \nfellow countrymen?\n  I intend to, with Senator Nelson, offer a resolution that makes it \nvery clear that the Senate believes the Iraqi Government should not \ngrant amnesty to persons who have attacked, killed, or wounded members \nof the U.S. Armed Forces serving heroically in Iraq to provide all \nIraqis a better future, and that President Bush should immediately \nnotify the Government of Iraq that the U.S. Government opposes granting \namnesty in the strongest possible terms. This has to end immediately.\n  I hope, when we offer that resolution, the Senate will speak with one \nclear and unequivocal voice that the blood of Americans and the lives \nof Americans is not subject to any pardoning, and is certainly not part \nof an offer that can be made that stains the honor and the sacrifices \nmade by Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4192\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I call up my amendment numbered 4192.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4192.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the redeployment of United States forces from \n                       Iraq by December 31, 2006)\n\n       At the end of subtitle I of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1084.

Mr. President, I would like to withdraw that amendment. \nI had intended to call up another amendment which has to do with the \nspecial inspector general for Iraq. Will the Chair tell me what the \nnumber of that amendment is? I have to clarify the number of this \namendment. In light of that, I yield the floor so Senator Schumer can \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I read, as many did, in the newspapers \nthis morning that the Prime Minister of Iraq has proposed giving \namnesty to those incarcerated by the Iraqi Government who have killed \nor maimed Americans. It was stated that if Iraqis killed Iraqis they \nwould not be given amnesty, but if Iraqis killed Americans, they would.\n  That is an outrageous statement. For the Prime Minister of Iraq to \noffer a ``get out of jail free'' card to those who have killed American \nsoldiers is an insult to the soldiers, their families, and every \nAmerican.\n  Just 2 days ago, the Prime Minister stood with President Bush, and \nPresident Bush said he looked in his eyes\n\n[[Page S5914]]\n\nand saw that he was a good man. We are urging that President Bush call \nup the Prime Minister of Iraq immediately and get him to retract this \npernicious, nasty statement which basically abdicates the great \nsacrifices that have been made by American soldiers for the people of \nIraq.\n  It is just mind-boggling to believe that the Iraqi Prime Minister \nwould decide that it would be OK to give amnesty to those who hurt \nAmericans. What kind of ally is this? Will he turn on us in 2 months or \n6 months? He seems to be the new hope of the new government, and within \n24 hours after President Bush leaves Iraqi soil, he defames the \nsacrifices of American soldiers and their families.\n  President Bush, you should call your friend the Prime Minister and \nget him to retract this evil statement immediately. How can we ask \nAmerica's young men and women to risk their lives in Iraq if those who \nseek to shoot at them are then absolved of any blame?\n  This is a statement which should really go down in infamy, and I hope \nand plead with the President to urge the Iraqi Prime Minister to \nwithdraw the statement and figure out what consequences should follow \nif the Prime Minister refuses.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 4192, withdrawn\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For clarification, the amendment No. 4192 \noffered by the Senator from Wisconsin was withdrawn.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

STRENGTHENING THE SPECIAL INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR \n                   IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION.\n\n       For purposes of discharging the duties of the Special \n     Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction under subsection \n     (f) of section 3001 of the Emergency Supplemental \n     Appropriations Act for Defense and for the Reconstruction of \n     Iraq and Afghanistan, 2004 (5 U.S.C. 8G note), and for \n     purposes of determining the date of termination of the Office \n     of the Special Inspector General under subsection (o) of such \n     section, any funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     for fiscal year 2006 for the reconstruction of Iraq, \n     regardless of how such funds may be designated, shall be \n     treated as amounts appropriated or otherwise made available \n     for the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their \npatience. I had identified the wrong amendment. I got that clarified.\n  What I wish to tell my colleagues is that this amendment strengthens \nthe Special Inspector General for Iraq and ensures that U.S. taxpayer \ndollars will be spent wisely, efficiently, and within the law.\n  The Special Inspector General for Iraq, known as ``SIGIR,'' was \nestablished in 2003. I worked hard with a few of my colleagues in \ncreating this office to monitor, audit, and report on the expenditure \nof billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars that this body appropriated to the \nIraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund.\n  My amendment is relatively simple. It recognizes the fact that we \nneed to continue to ensure oversight and monitoring of U.S. taxpayer \ndollars that continue to support reconstruction efforts in Iraq, which \nincludes over $1.6 billion in the latest supplemental for Iraq \nreconstruction and in the fiscal year 2006 foreign operations bill. It \nincreases the mandate of the Special Inspector General for Iraq, while \nalso extending the period for which that office will be in existence.\n  This amendment will strengthen the capabilities of the Special IG to \nmonitor, audit, and inspect funds made available for assistance for \nIraq in both the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund--IRRF--and in \nother important accounts.\n  I offer this amendment today because it is my firm belief that we \nshould not be pouring tens of billions of dollars into Iraq \nreconstruction without ensuring there is appropriate oversight and \nauditing. American taxpayers deserve to know where their money is going \nin this costly war and that it is being used effectively and \nefficiently and ending up in the right place.\n  The SIGIR's work to date has been extremely valuable to the U.S. \nGovernment and to Congress. The SIGIR has now completed over 55 audit \nreports, issued over 165 recommendations for program improvement, and \nhas seized $13 million in assets. Overall, the SIGIR estimates that its \noperations have resulted in saving the U.S. Government over $24 \nmillion, in addition to the considerable wasteful or fraudulent \nspending that office has uncovered.\n  Throughout 2005, the Iraq IG provided aggressive oversight to prevent \nwaste, fraud and abuse in the at-times lethal operating environment in \nIraq. Its emphasis on real-time auditing--where guidance is provided \nimmediately to management authorities upon the discovery of a need for \nchange--provides for independent assessments while effecting rapid \nimprovements.\n  In its January report to Congress, the SIGIR concluded that massive \nunforeseen security costs, administrative overhead, and waste have \ncrippled original reconstruction strategies and have prevented the \ncompletion of up to half of the work originally called for in critical \nsectors such as water, power, and electricity. The Iraq IG's work has \nresulted in the arrest of five individuals who were defrauding the U.S. \nGovernment, and it has shed light on millions of dollars of waste. It \nis this kind of investigation and reporting that helps shape the \ndirection of reconstruction funding and ensures that the money is being \nused and allocated as transparently and effectively as possible.\n  I pushed to create the Special Inspector General for Iraq in order to \nensure that there is critical oversight of the Iraq Relief and \nReconstruction Fund allocated for Iraq reconstruction projects. Last \nyear I fought to extend the life of this office, and my amendment today \nwill ensure that the SIGIR has the capability and the life-span to \nfinish up work associated with monitoring, evaluating, and reporting on \nhow U.S. taxpayer dollars are being spent in Iraq for reconstruction \npurposes.\n  Let me talk briefly about what my amendment actually does. Because \ncurrent legislation requires that the SIGIR continue its work until 80 \npercent of the IRRF had been expended, and unless we do something to \nchange this, the SIGIR will cease to exist before U.S. taxpayer dollars \ngoing to Iraq reconstruction have been expended. This means that \ndespite the fact that we continue to support Iraq reconstruction \nefforts, we are removing our ability to oversee billions of taxpayer \ndollars.\n  To help avoid this potentially costly and unnecessary challenge, this \namendment considers any money going to Iraq reconstruction efforts--\nregardless of whether or not it is in the IRRF--be subject to the \nSIGIR's oversight mandate. It will also help determine when we can ask \nthe SIGIR to stand down.\n  This amendment is common sense. The SIGIR's great work has more than \npaid for itself, and it has developed a capacity that is unparalleled \nby either DoD or State's inspector general offices. The SIGIR is doing \ngreat work, and I, along with my distinguished colleagues Senator Levin \nand others, believe that this small change in the law will allow us to \ntell our constituents that we are making every effort to ensure that \ntheir hard-earned taxpayer dollars are being used in the most effective \nway possible. Let's support the SIGIR, and lets give it the time and \nmandate to monitor Iraq reconstruction funds.\n\n[[Page S5915]]\n\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we should consult with leadership. The \nyeas and nays having been ordered, I wonder if the Senator would be \ngracious enough to allow the Senator from Michigan and myself to \nconsult with leadership as to the time for a vote.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, if it is all right with the Senator from \nVirginia, it is my understanding that it will be taken by voice vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. Is that the intent?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I want to be make sure it has been cleared on the other \nside.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it was my understanding that this was \neither cleared or was going to be supported by the chairman. I did not \nconfirm that with my friend. That is a little bit in limbo. I very much \nsupport the Senator's amendment. I hope it can be cleared. If so, \napparently the Senator is willing to take a voice vote.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if I could proceed with my remarks in support of \nthe amendment while they discuss it.\n  I support the Feingold amendment to ensure that the Special Inspector \nGeneral for Iraq Reconstruction has jurisdiction over funds \nappropriated for the reconstruction of Iraq.\n  As the Senator from Wisconsin has mentioned, Congress established the \nSpecial Inspector General position in a fiscal year 2004 emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill to ensure effective oversight and \naudit of relief and reconstruction efforts in Iraq. The Special \nInspector General reports jointly to the Secretaries of Defense and \nState and has responsibility for oversight of operations and programs \nfunded by the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund. The Senator from \nWisconsin last year offered an amendment to extend the position. It was \nvery welcome. It was a very useful and important contribution. I \ncommend him for it. It is unfortunate that the most recent emergency \nsupplemental which we just passed today would appropriate funds for \nIraq reconstruction without including those funds in the Iraq Relief \nand Reconstruction Fund. It is important that this amendment be agreed \nto so as to ensure that this Special Inspector General for Iraq \nReconstruction has jurisdiction over all funds appropriated for the \nreconstruction of Iraq.\n  Under current law, this funding approach would have the effect of \nexcluding reconstruction projects using these new funds from the \njurisdiction of the Special Inspector General.\n  The State Department says that its Inspector General would be \nresponsible for auditing the use of these funds. However, the State \nDepartment IG, unlike the Special Inspector General, does not have a \nsignificant presence in Iraq and does not have experience in auditing \ncontracts and ferreting out fraud in the unique environment of Iraq.\n  For the last 3 years, the Special Inspector General has been the only \nsource of consistent, independent, on-the ground review of \nreconstruction activities in Iraq. As a result, the Special Inspector \nGeneral has reported case after case of criminal fraud and egregious \nwaste that would otherwise have gone unremedied. Report after report \ndocuments cases--at al Hillah General Hospital, Babylon Policy Academy, \nKarbala Library, Baghdad International Airport and elsewhere--in which \nwe paid contractors millions of dollars for work without making site \nvisits, issuing performance reports, preparing post-award assessments, \nor taking other steps to ensure that the work we paid for was actually \nperformed. In case after case, the Special Inspector General determined \nthat either the contractor's performance was deficient or the work was \nnot performed at all.\n  One particularly egregious case reviewed by the Special Inspector \ninvolved a $75 million contract with Kellogg Brown and Root, KBR, to \ndevelop a Pipeline River Crossing at Al Fatah, Iraq. The Special \nInspector General reported that the project ailed because subsurface \ngeologic conditions made it impossible to carry out the project design. \nThese conditions were identified by a consultant before work commenced, \nbut neither the Army Corps of Engineers nor KBR acted on the \nconsultant's recommendation to perform additional research that would \nhave prevented the failure.\n  A subject matter expert for the Coalition Provision Authority \nrecognized that KBR had limited experience in this type of project and \nadvised that the project would probably fail because design \nrestrictions provided no flexibility to accommodate site conditions. \nHowever, KBR refused to conduct design reviews requested by the subject \nmatter expert.\n  The Army Corps of Engineers awarded KBR a firm fixed price contract \nwith no performance requirements. As a result, KBR was assured that it \nwould get paid the full contract amount, regardless whether it \nsuccessfully completed the project.\n  A KBR subcontractor identified problems with the site conditions at \nthe outset of the project and suggested alternative drilling sites, but \nwas turned down by KBR. KBR prohibited the subcontractor from talking \ndirectly to the Army Corps of Engineers and told the Army Corps that \ndetailed cost reports would not be provided, because they were not \nrequired by the contract.\n  As a result, we spent the entire $75 million allocated to the \nproject, but achieved only 28 percent of the planned pipeline \nthroughput. According to the Inspector General, the lack of pipeline \ncapacity resulted in the loss of more than $1.5 billion in potential \noil revenues to the Iraqi government.\n  The Special Inspector General is the only U.S. audit and \ninvestigative authority with a significant on-the-ground presence in \nIraq. He is the only inspector general who has an experienced staff \nwith hands-on knowledge of how things work in Iraq. He is the only \ninspector general who has shown the capacity and the desire to turn \nover rocks in Iraq to identify and address problems of fraud and \ncriminal conduct.\n  If we are serious about protecting the taxpayer and preventing \ncontractor abuses in Iraq, we will adopt this amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Feingold amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  We are trying to work this out. There is a problem. The problem is \nnot to the generic virtues of Senator Feingold's amendment--which, \nincidentally, I support--but it is a question of the allocation of some \nfunding in it and how that impacts on other areas of funding. As soon \nas I can work that out, I will advise the Senate. I am hopeful we can \neventually go to a vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, while that is being worked on--I hope we \ncan resolve that because this is a very important amendment. We want \nthat Special Inspector General, who is really doing the only \nsignificant oversight on the expenditure of these billions of dollars \nin Iraq, to perform the same oversight functions on the appropriations, \nfor instance, which we just adopted.\n  I again commend the Senator from Wisconsin. It was at his instigation \nand his initiative that we extended this Special Inspector General's \nOffice last year, and it was that initiative which has paid off so \nhandsomely for us. This initiative is critically important or else we \nmight, I think inadvertently, not have the same watchdog looking over \nthe most recent appropriations we adopted.\n  I also believe the Special Inspector General actually testified \nbefore the Chair's subcommittee earlier this year, so the Presiding \nOfficer has had the ability to hear firsthand from the Special \nInspector General about his operations.\n  By the way, I commend our Presiding Officer for those hearings. They \nwere very helpful.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are prepared to go ahead with a voice \nvote at this time, if it is agreeable. I add my endorsement of the \nbasic thrust of the amendment. Like others, I have had the opportunity \nto be debriefed by the inspector general, and I am very impressed with \nhis conscientious service on this matter. He periodically goes over to \nIraq, that theatre, and Afghanistan, for periods of time. He has \naccepted the challenges of this post with enormous enthusiasm and \nskill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank both the ranking member and \nchairman for their comments and support.\n\n[[Page S5916]]\n\n  My understanding is the chairman wants to take this by voice vote. \nTherefore, I ask the yeas and nays be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4256) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the leadership and the managers have \nreached a recommended unanimous consent request which I now propound.\n  I ask unanimous consent at 12 noon today the Senate proceed to a vote \nin relation to Santorum amendment No. 4234, to be followed by a vote in \nrelation to a first-degree amendment to be offered by Senator Biden \nrelated to the same subject; further, I ask unanimous consent that the \ntime until 12 be equally divided between myself, representing Senator \nSantorum and others, and Senator Levin, with no second degrees in order \nto either amendment prior to the votes; provided there be 2 minutes for \ndebate equally divided between the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, is it my \nunderstanding that following the disposition of these two amendments \nthat then a Democratic amendment would be the next in order?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am not able to answer that question. I \nbelieve that would be correct. I would be perfectly willing to have it \nthat way because I know we did Senator Durbin's this morning.\n  Mr. LEVIN. With that understanding--and there will be a Senator \nNelson of Florida amendment, so you are on notice relative to that--I \nhave no objection.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I first want to apologize to the chairman \nand ranking member that I came to the floor and realized they were in \nthe process of doing this because I certainly would have spoken to them \nin advance before making this request. But I hope they will agree to \nthis request.\n  We have just been informed at the Department of Defense that we have \nnow lost our 2,500th soldier in Iraq. Last October, when we lost our \n2,000th, the Senate observed a moment of silence in respect for all of \nthe soldiers and those serving in uniform and their families. I would \nlike to ask if the chairman would consider amending his request so that \nbetween the two rollcalls, when Members are on the floor, that they \nwould come to their chairs and we would observe a moment of silence in \nrespect for our troops and for this notification that we have reached \nthis sad milestone.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I so amend the unanimous consent request \nthat there be a time not to exceed whatever is appropriate for this \nproper recognition by the Senate of the loss of life.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for this \nsuggestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think we are ready for the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let it be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today for two purposes: one is to \nspeak against the Santorum amendment relating to Iran--the Iran \nsanctions--and, two, to offer an amendment relating to the negotiations \nthat are now underway by the President of the United States.\n  Let's cut right to it, if I may. Are we going to stand aside while \nthe President of the United States of America is trying to stop the \ndevelopment of a nuclear bomb in Iran? The President of the United \nStates of America has made a judgment--I would argue, finally, but he \nhas made a judgment--that the best way to keep the worst thing from \nhappening is to cooperate with our friends to put pressure on the bad \nguy.\n  What do I mean by that? The President of the United States, I assume \nat the urging of the Secretary of State--although it is not relevant, \nactually--the President of the United States took a more aggressive \ncourse about a month ago in attempting to stop the Iranians from \ndeveloping a nuclear weapon, a weapon that, if developed in conjunction \nwith a missile, could change, in a material way, the dynamics in the \nMiddle East and particularly relating to our interests, notwithstanding \nthe fact that it might not be able to strike the United States--a \ndevelopment that if it occurred would almost assuredly put great \npressure on the Sunni Arabs in the region, who have lots of money, to \njoin with possibly Egypt or another country to develop a Sunni bomb. \nThis is not a good thing.\n  So the President, in conjunction with France, Germany, and the United \nKingdom, our three largest European allies, along with China, and \nRussia, has agreed to and has been sitting down and making a specific \nproposal, which the President of the United States has pledged the \nUnited States to, in order to both entice as well as dissuade the \nIranians from pursuing their course. There are two pieces to it. One, \nit says to the Iranians: If you cooperate and verifiably cease and \ndesist, we, the United States, the three European countries, China, and \nRussia, will move forward with the following incentives to move you \ncloser to the family of nations as a responsible nation. And there are \na set of very specific incentives that the President of the United \nStates of America has signed on to--quote, an ``offer,'' if you will, \nto the Iranian Government.\n  It also says, as was reported in the New York Times and the \nWashington Post today, that the Chinese, as well as the Americans and \nRussians, have communicated a second piece of information to the \nIranians: If you do not cease and desist, these bad things are going to \nhappen to you, and we are all jointly--jointly--going to impose them on \nyou.\n  I think that was a stroke of significant diplomacy on the part of the \nPresident, which basically, as I understand it, the Europeans, \nRussians, and Chinese said: Will you join us in some of the carrots? \nAnd the President, as I understand it, said: Yes, if you join me in the \nstrikes. It is carrots and sticks.\n  I know of no way to avoid one of two alternatives: one is the \nresignation to the acceptance of an Iranian weapon, and relying upon \ndeterrence; or, two, the use of military force against Iran to prevent \nthe development of that weapon.\n  My friend from Pennsylvania, as well as all of us on this floor, have \nreceived, I expect, the same extensive briefings I have on just how \nlimited those alternatives are at this point militarily.\n  So I think the President has chosen a very reasonable course here. \nBut even if you disagree with it, one of the things that--and I have \nbeen here during seven Presidents, and I have been very critical of \nthis President's foreign policy--but the idea, in the midst of a \nnegotiation, at the point at which the world is expecting and waiting \nand wondering what Iran's response will be, that the U.S. Senate would \ngo on record as tying the President's hands in this negotiation--I find \nthat amazing, absolutely amazing.\n\n[[Page S5917]]\n\n  I spoke this morning with the Secretary of State who authorized me to \nsay, unequivocally, the administration opposes this amendment. It \nlimits their flexibility in doing what we all want: preventing the \nconstruction of a nuclear weapon in Iran. How much clearer can the \nadministration be? And as my Grandfather Finnegan from my home State of \nPennsylvania used to say: Who died and left you boss? Since when do we \nnegotiate for a President? We are in the midst of a negotiation. The \nonly thing we have going for us now, with China, Russia, and Europe all \nsiding with us, we are about to mess up? Folks, I think this is such a \ntragic mistake--well-intended but tragic. The underlying amendment, Mr. \nSantorum's amendment, in my view, and in the view of the Secretary of \nState, actually advocates a policy that would jeopardize President \nBush's initiative and, I believe, play directly into the hands of \nIranian hard-liners.\n  I think if you read the language, it also has the potential to damage \nrelations with some of the key countries whose cooperation we need to \npressure Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions. If this approach were \nadopted, we would be in the untenable position of sanctioning companies \nlocated in countries that we are asking to impose sanctions on Iran if \nthey fail to accept the offer put forward by Russia, China, Europe, and \nthe United States.\n  It does not, with all due respect to my friend, because I have joined \nhim in Iran sanctions legislation in the past--I have joined him--but \nthis is a different amendment and it is a fundamentally different time.\n  I remember going down to see the President when he was making his \nfirst trip to Europe. He asked whether I would come down and speak with \nhim and his staff and I did. It was very gracious of him to ask my \nopinion, which was very nice of him. He said he was going to Germany. \nAnd he said--I am paraphrasing--I understand you have been asked to \nspeak to the Bundestag, the German Parliament.\n  I said: Yes, I have, Mr. President.\n  He said: I understand you have turned it down.\n  I said: Yes, I have, Mr. President.\n  He said: Why?\n  I said: Mr. President, we only have one President. You are my \nPresident. My disagreements with you on foreign policy--at that time it \nrelated to the Balkans and some other things--I think it is totally \ninappropriate, while you are in Europe, while you are in discussions \nwith the very people who invited me to speak, for me to go and publicly \nafront you in a foreign capital before their--their--Parliament, the \nvery Parliament you are going to be speaking to. I am not President. \nYou are our President. And he pressed: Well, why?\n  And I said, somewhat facetiously--and I have had this discussion with \nNewt--I am not Newt Gingrich. I don't go to the Middle East and speak \nto Middle Eastern Parliaments while the previous Secretary of State is \nthere negotiating. I think it is inappropriate.\n  The President of the United States is in the midst of the most \nimportant negotiations, absent Korea--and not much is going on there--\nthat we have had since he has been President. And even if everything in \nhere makes sense, why would we now do this?\n  My plea to my friend from Pennsylvania is: Withhold this amendment. \nSee what happens in the negotiations. If, in fact, they fail--as they \nhave an overwhelming prospect that could happen--then come back to the \nSenate and the Congress to put on these restrictions.\n  Mr. President, may I ask how much time the Senator from Delaware has \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 50 seconds.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I say to my friend from Pennsylvania--I have not had a \nchance to speak to him personally--I say to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, I have an amendment.\n  Mr. President, have I sent my amendment to the desk? Is the Biden \namendment at the desk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is at the desk but not called up.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4257\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I call up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden], for himself, Mr. \n     Hagel, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Levin, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4257.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1231. UNITED STATE'S POLICY ON THE NUCLEAR PROGRAMS OF \n                   IRAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that:\n       (1) The pursuit by the Iranian regime of a capability to \n     produce nuclear weapons represents a threat to the United \n     States, the Middle East region, and international peace and \n     security.\n       (2) On May 31, 2006, Secretary of State Rice announced that \n     the United States would join negotiations with Iran, along \n     with the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, provided that \n     Iran fully and verifiably suspends its enrichment and \n     reprocessing activities.\n       (3) On June 1, 2006, President George W. Bush stated that \n     ``Secretary Rice, at my instructions, said to the world that \n     we want to solve the problem of the Iranian nuclear issue \n     diplomatically. And we made it very clear publicly that we're \n     willing to come to the table, so long as the Iranians \n     verifiably suspend their program. In other words, we said to \n     the Iranians [that] the United States of America wants to \n     work with our partners to solve the problem''.\n       (4) On June 1, 2006, the United States, the United Kingdom, \n     France, Germany, the People's Republic of China, and the \n     Russian Federation agreed upon a package of incentives and \n     disincentives, which was subsequently presented to Iran by \n     the High Representative of the European Union, Javier Solana.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--\n       (1) endorses the policy of the United States, announced May \n     31, 2006, to achieve a successful diplomatic outcome, in \n     coordination with leading members of the international \n     community, with respect to the threat posed by the efforts of \n     the Iranian regime to acquire a capability to produce nuclear \n     weapons;\n       (2) calls on Iran to suspend fully and verifiably its \n     enrichment and reprocessing activities, cooperate fully with \n     the International Atomic Energy Agency, and enter into \n     negotiations, including with the United States, pursuant to \n     the package presented to Iran by the High Representative of \n     the European Union; and\n       (3) urges the President and the Secretary of State to keep \n     Congress fully and currently informed about the progress of \n     this vital diplomatic initiative.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, what my amendment does is speak to and \nsupport the President's present negotiation. It gives full support to \nthe President of the United States, because if there was ever a time \nthe President should have the world know the Nation stands behind him, \nit is now. It is now in this negotiation. I don't have time to read the \namendment, but I promise you, it is a rendition of the administration's \nposition on negotiations and compliments him for it and says we support \nhim.\n  Although Senator Hagel is in a hearing and on his way, there will \nprobably not be much time for him to speak. But he is a cosponsor, \nalong with Senators Levin and Dodd. I am sure there are others, and I \nask unanimous consent that they be able to be added later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I also want to point out that the \ndistinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, if I am not \nmistaken, yesterday raised significant concerns with the Santorum \namendment as well. As I look at the Record, they all are pertinent and \naccurate.\n  I will conclude by saying, this is no time to be meddling in the \nmidst of a negotiation on one of the most important issues facing the \nUnited States, when the President has newly initiated a specific \nproposal. I urge my friend from Pennsylvania to withhold his amendment \nuntil we see what turns out there. If he thinks it is necessary after \nthe negotiations succeed or fail, then come back.\n  I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for allowing me to probably run \nover a minute or so.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4234\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield such time as our colleague wishes. \nI ask unanimous consent that each manager have at least 3 minutes to \naddress this at the conclusion of the remarks by the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n\n[[Page S5918]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. With respect to the Biden amendment, I was handed a \ncopy of it a couple minutes ago. But having read it, it is a sense of \nthe Senate. I don't see any reason not to support the Biden amendment. \nI have no problem with the language. It basically says that we hope for \na resolution to the diplomatic efforts under way, a positive resolution \nwith respect to Iran not pursuing nuclear weapons. That is no problem \nfor me. But it doesn't do anything other than say we wish you well.\n  The amendment I have offered is an amendment that is in substance the \nbill that passed the House of Representatives in April with over 300 \nvotes. At the time it passed, prior to the negotiations that were \ncommenced at the end of May by the administration, as the Senator from \nDelaware suggested, when it passed in April, the administration opposed \nit. I suspect, although I will let the Senator from Delaware speak for \nhimself, I know he is not a cosponsor of my bill that is in the Foreign \nRelations Committee, and, to my knowledge, Senator Lugar has not \nsupported this legislation. The State Department has not supported my \nlegislation. It is not surprising to me that they don't support this \namendment. They don't generally support amendments that have to do with \nsanctions and forcing them to do things they don't want to do.\n  We are a coequal branch of Government, and it is vitally important \nfor us at a critical time--and I agree with the Senator from Delaware \non this, this is a critical time. I disagree with him on several \nthings. One of the things on which I disagree with him, I think these \nnegotiations are more important than North Korea. I think the threat of \nIran and Islamic fascism is more significant than the threat posed by \nNorth Korea.\n  I believe this is a vitally important negotiation. I think it is \nvitally important during the course of these negotiations to speak to \nthem and to speak in support not only in words but in deeds of what the \nPresident is trying to accomplish. The deeds here are very clear. It is \ntwofold. The Senator from Delaware suggested there are not very many \ngood options on the table.\n  The two options on the table, other than military force, are in this \namendment. Those two options are to support prodemocracy efforts within \nIran, to try to see if we can get a peaceful transformation of that \ngovernment. The second is to try to dissuade the Iranians from moving \nforward and dissuade others, companies and countries, from working with \nthem in development of their nuclear weapons program. Those are the \noptions.\n  The President is trying to do it through a diplomatic arrangement. I \nwish him the very best. But I remind everybody here who is going to \nvote, this is not going to the President today. It is not going to the \nPresident next week. It is not going to the President next month. This \nis an amendment to the Defense authorization bill. It will be months, I \nam sure. I would be amazed if we were able to get this done before \nSeptember or October. This bill is not going to be decided upon, this \namendment is not going to be concluded and passed on to the President \nbefore these negotiations come to a conclusion. What we do here is put \nourselves in a position to have an amendment in conference ready to \nmove if these negotiations do not work.\n  Putting off this amendment is not such an easy thing to do. Putting \noff this amendment and finding a vehicle to attach it to, particularly \nover the next few weeks, is not going to be easy to do, as we bring up \nappropriations bills. So this may be the last vehicle between now and \nthe summer recess in August and potentially the rest of this Congress \nto debate this issue. It is important for us to speak to this issue \nnow.\n\n  This is not a radical piece of legislation. This is a piece of \nlegislation that has 61 cosponsors that passed with over 300 votes in \nthe House of Representatives. It has broad bipartisan support. I \nunderstand it is opposed by the Department of State. Senator Warner was \nkind enough to show the letter that came from the Department suggesting \ntheir opposition. I remind all Members, they opposed this bill and have \nconsistently, not just because of these negotiations but have opposed \nthis bill, period. They opposed it when the House passed it in April. \nSo this is nothing new.\n  I suggest that the opportunity we have on the most important national \nsecurity issue facing this country, the threat of Islamic fascism and \nthe threat of Iran as the principal cog in orchestrating, supporting, \nfinancing, and encouraging this type of behavior, is to speak into the \nmoment where we are confronting them right now with our administration \nin their development of nuclear weapons. For the Congress to remain \nsilent, for the Congress to step back and say: We wish you well, Mr. \nPresident, but we are not going to go on record of really supporting \nyou, in deed not just in word, will be interpreted one way, in my \nopinion, the way words are always interpreted. I think the Senator from \nDelaware said that this will play into the hardliners in Iran. Let me \nremind the Senator from Delaware, the hardliners run Iran. The \nhardliner is the President of Iran. The hardliners are the mullahs who \nrun the country. There are not hardliners and then the governing powers \nof Iran. The hardliners are the governing powers of Iran. They are the \nones making the decision. We are not playing into their hands. We are \ntelling them we are serious, as serious as the President is about doing \nsomething about their development of nuclear weapons and their desire \nand explicit statements about their willingness to use those weapons on \nthe State of Israel and others.\n  This is a very serious debate. This is a very serious vote. This is a \nvery serious message that we either will or will not send. Are we going \nto send a message to the Iranian hardliners that we are going to stand \nby our President in word and action and that we are not going to let \ntheir talk of maybe possibly down the road potentially coming and \ntalking to us, which is all they are talking about right now, dissuade \nus from acting while they are acting right now in developing nuclear \ncapability, which they are. They are acting right now. They are \ndeveloping. They are pursuing. They are saying they are going to use \nit. All we are going to say is: Well, your talk about maybe talking to \nus in the future will dissuade us from acting? No, it should not. We \nshould act today. We have 61 cosponsors of this legislation. I hope \nthat all 61 and then some stand by and say to the Iranian hardliners/\ngovernment that we will stand with our President in word and deed and \nmake sure that we do everything we can through peaceful means, and that \nis what this amendment is about, to stop them from getting nuclear \nweapons.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I ask to speak for up to 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I appreciate the time from the \ndistinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n  I rise to strongly support the Biden amendment. It is the responsible \nand appropriate position for this body to take on a very serious issue. \nIt is important that we recognize, just as the distinguished Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania has noted, that we support our President. I believe \nPresident Bush's actions and directions, as they are now playing out, \nare, in fact, the appropriate, responsible, and relevant actions to \ntake.\n  I also rise to strongly oppose the Santorum amendment. Again, noting \nwhat the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania said, that we should \nsend a strong message to the world that we are supporting our \nPresident, I am not certain how that is accomplished by supporting the \nSantorum amendment. In fact, as has been noted on the floor this \nmorning, the President's senior foreign policy agent, the Secretary of \nState, Dr. Rice, is opposed. The Secretary of State of the United \nStates Government is opposed to the Santorum amendment. I am not \ncertain how that connects with what my distinguished colleague from \nPennsylvania has noted.\n  What we are dealing with in the Santorum amendment is a very \nirresponsible, dangerous direction to take.\n\n[[Page S5919]]\n\nLet me remind colleagues that we already are at war in two nations. We \nhave 130,000 American troops engaged now in a war in Iraq. The Middle \nEast is in turmoil. We have 20,000 troops in Afghanistan. NATO is in \nAfghanistan. Many of our allies are with us in Iraq.\n  We better be careful here. We better be careful in how we are dealing \nwith this issue. It is a serious issue. It is dangerous. But it is \ncomplicated. Iran is not a monolithic government that we can ascribe \nmotives to, agreements to. Our best course of action is exactly where \nthe President is going. And that is, engaging Iran, engaging with our \nallies, strengthening our alliances. If we are not careful, we will \nfind America isolated in the world at a very dangerous time. That is \nwhat the Santorum amendment is about.\n  This is not helping our President. Our President is opposed to it. He \nis taking a different direction.\n  Let's be careful. This is not just some amendment. This is the force \nof the U.S. Senate that could be put into a law in fact limiting the \nPresident's options. Is that what we want to do and is that how we \ndescribe supporting the President, limiting the President's options? I \ndon't think so. This is dangerous business, very dangerous business. \nBefore our colleagues vote, they better understand what is going to be \nrequired.\n  Again, I thank my distinguished colleague from Virginia for the time. \nI hope our colleagues, before they vote, will understand the \nconsequences of a dangerous amendment like this. I shall oppose it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first, I ask the distinguished Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, in fairness, I think he should wrap this debate up. \nHow many minutes does he desire?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I understand I have 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator has 4 minutes, and \nthe managers have 3 minutes left.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let us establish the hour of 12:15 for the \nvote, with 5 minutes at the conclusion for the distinguished Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania and 5 minutes under the control of the Senator from \nVirginia and 5 minutes under the control of Senator Levin. I ask \nunanimous consent that be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my distinguished colleagues here \nthat in the course of this debate, I have studied this matter very \ncarefully. I spoke out on it yesterday expressing my concerns. I do \nbelieve the actions proposed by the Senator from Pennsylvania are not \nirresponsible. They are a clear matter of conscience and what he thinks \nis in our best interest.\n  My concern, which I think is the Senator's concern, is that the \ntiming is unwise. I support the Senator from Nebraska in that \nobservation, as I do the Senator from Delaware, because we have a \nnegotiation of great sensitivity underway at the direction of the \nPresident, who, under the Constitution of the United States, has the \nprimary responsibility in the matter of conducting foreign affairs. His \nchief designee, the Secretary of State, has spoken through Senator \nBiden.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter \naddressed to me, to which I will refer momentarily, from the Department \nof State.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Department of State,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 2006.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: It is our understanding that the Iran \n     Freedom Support Act (S. 333) will soon be offered as an \n     amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for FY \n     2007 (S. 2766). The Administration has serious concerns about \n     S. 333, and therefore opposes its inclusion in S. 2766.\n       As Secretary Rice recently announced, Iran is being offered \n     a choice: either continue to pursue nuclear weapons and face \n     isolation and progressively stronger sanctions, or verifiably \n     abandon uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities and \n     receive civil nuclear energy and economic cooperation from \n     the international community. We are in agreement with our \n     European partners on the elements of the benefits if Iran \n     makes the right choice, and the costs if it does not. More \n     broadly, we have found support from Russia and China for this \n     approach.\n       The amendment runs counter to our efforts and those of the \n     international community to present Iran with a clear choice \n     regarding their nuclear ambitions. This amendment, if \n     enacted, would shift unified international attention away \n     from Iran's nuclear activities and create a rift between the \n     U.S. and our closest international partners. Moreover, it \n     would limit our diplomatic flexibility.\n       By contrast, we endorse the concept of providing support \n     for democracy and human rights in Iran. The Administration \n     has worked closely with the Congress to include funding in \n     the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2006 (H.R. \n     4939) to increase our support for democracy and improve radio \n     broadcasting, expand satellite television broadcasting, and \n     increase contacts through expanded fellowships and \n     scholarships for Iranian students.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the presentation of this letter from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's Program.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Jeffrey T. Bergner,\n\n                                              Assistant Secretary,\n                                              Legislative Affairs.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I strongly believe the Senator from Pennsylvania is of \nclear conscience on this matter.\n  Regarding the fact that he had these cosponsors and the fact that the \nHouse spoke on this in April, since the April timeframe--and I believe \nhis earlier amendment had 60 cosponsors--much has transpired. That has \nbeen addressed here today, the sensitivity of these negotiations \nbetween our Nation and other nations in line for the interests of the \nUnited States and the Government of Iran. Therefore, my concern about \nthis amendment is the timing of it.\n  I now would like to refer to the letter forwarded to me as chairman, \ndated today, which was printed in the Record. One paragraph reads:\n\n       The amendment runs counter to our efforts and those of the \n     international community to present Iran with a clear choice \n     regarding their nuclear ambitions. The amendment, if enacted, \n     would shift unified international attention away from Iran's \n     nuclear activities and create a rift between the U.S. and our \n     closest international partners. Moreover, it would limit our \n     diplomatic flexibility.\n\n  Mr. President, I have to accept the good faith of the Secretary of \nState on this matter and as communicated to this Chamber.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am one who has cosponsored a version of \nthe Iranian sanctions amendment which Senator Santorum offered now over \na year ago. I believed then and I believe now that it may well be \nnecessary for sanctions to be imposed on Iran.\n  However, I cannot support the amendment that has been offered by \nSenator Santorum for two reasons. One is the fact that it is \nsignificantly broader than the other amendment that was introduced by \nSenator Santorum, the Iran Freedom and Support Act of 2005. In many \nways, it is broader and it interjects an unrelated issue with respect \nto Russian pricing for nuclear reactor fuel. It removes the requirement \nthat a person have actual knowledge of the actions for which he is \ngoing to be sanctioned. There is a direction here to a United Nations \nrepresentative, which was not present in the amendment I cosponsored. \nIt changes the threshold which makes it more difficult for the \nPresident to waive sanctions. So there are a number of significant \ndifferences between this and an amendment I cosponsored.\n  The other difference is that, of course, there has been significant \nchange which occurred since that time. Senator Warner has outlined that \npoint. That change is now the decision of the administration--which I \nsupport--to engage or participate in direct talks with Iran under \nspecified circumstances. I think that is a policy which should be given \na chance to work, and if the policy doesn't succeed and Iran does not \nwork out a negotiation and agreement with all the countries with which \nthere are discussions going on, at that point, it seems to me there is \na greater chance we will get those other countries, including Russia, \nto support sanctions if, in fact, the negotiations and discussions with \nIran do not succeed.\n  So those discussions the President has decided to engage upon are \nactually a prelude to a much stronger chance to succeed with sanctions \ndown the road because countries that might support us on sanctions, and \nwhose\n\n[[Page S5920]]\n\nsupport would be extremely helpful, would then realize we had gone \nthrough the negotiation and discussion route with Iran. I believe that \npolicy is wise. It will strengthen our position in getting sanctions, \nshould that be necessary. Also, it is the best chance of having the \nsolution here, which will avoid greater and greater conflict down the \nroad. While it is with some reluctance that I cannot support a sanction \namendment relating to Iran, nonetheless, because this is broader than \nthe one that previously I cosponsored, and mainly because of the \nongoing negotiations which will strengthen our position if they do not \nlead to a good resolution, I cannot support the Santorum amendment. I \nwill support the Biden amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I will address the comments made by my \ncolleagues. I appreciate their thoughtful comments.\n  First, this is not just a sanctions amendment. This is a sanctions \namendment which imposes additional sanctions, but it also has a large \nprodemocracy component to support prodemocracy efforts and public \ndiplomacy within Iran.\n  Second, with respect to the sanctions, I agree with some of the \ncriticisms leveled by Senator Levin that it adds things which were not \nin the previous versions. One thing it adds is a nuclear components \nprovision, which says that if you are going to be a company that is \ndoing business with Iran in the development of their nuclear weapons \ncapability, you cannot do business with us in America. If that is \nobjectionable to folks, I find it somewhat remarkable that we would \nwant companies doing business in Iran doing business here. But that is \na new sanction; he is correct.\n  What he is not correct about is that we make it more difficult to \nwaive these sanctions. In fact, we have made it easier to waive \nsanctions. We have given the President more time to waive sanctions. In \nfact, the big difference between the House bill and ours is we are much \nmore liberal with respect to the waiver authority of the President. In \nthat respect, the House bill passed--I have the exact vote--by a vote \nof 397 to 21. That is the bill which passed in the House of \nRepresentatives just 2 months ago. It has, with the exception of what I \nhave said, a more liberal waiver authority component that deals with \nnuclear technology because of, obviously, this concern about the major \ndifference between the two. I suspect that both the increased \nflexibility and the nuclear component provision would have very strong \nsupport in the Senate.\n\n  The other thing I wish to talk about is what Senator Warner referred \nto in the letter from the Secretary of State. I remind everybody that \nthe Secretary and the State Department have opposed this legislation \nfrom the day I have introduced it.\n  No. 2, I have had discussions with the Secretary personally over at \nthe State Department, and we have had ongoing discussions. They support \naspects of this bill. They don't like some of the sanction provisions, \nspecifically the codification of Executive orders. I understand that. \nThat has been sort of an intractable problem we have had during these \nnegotiations.\n  I also remind everybody here that I bet I could pull out a letter \nidentical to the letter just read by the Senator from Virginia on the \nissue of the Syrian Accountability Act, which passed here after about \n3\\1/2\\ years or 2\\1/2\\ years of work, to try to get the administration \non board with that legislation. The State Department opposed it, \nopposed it, opposed it. The President opposed it. They thought it was \nthe wrong time, something we shouldn't do.\n  I had three conversations with the President on the Syrian \nAccountability Act. The first two times, he about tore my head off, \nsaying how inappropriate it was for Congress to act in this regard and \ntry to impose sanctions and mess around with foreign policy. The third \nconversation I had with him was a conversation where he said he would \nsign it. Six months later, he gave the State of the Union Address and \ntook credit for the Syrian Accountability Act as one of the great \naccomplishments of his administration in foreign policy.\n  I believe the impact of the Syrian Accountability Act is pretty \ndiscernible--what happened with the withdrawal of Syrian troops from \nLebanon. The Congress, when we act and do so in a responsible fashion, \ncan make a difference. I believe this is an appropriate time and \nappropriate subject for us to make a difference.\n  Iran is the great threat before us. If anyone believes that by being \nweak, by not acting, by not stepping forward, and by not getting \ninvolved and saying we are going to hold those who cooperate with the \nIranians accountable for their cooperation, if we think that by backing \noff on that somehow or another we will create some good will with the \nhardliners who control Iran, you have not been watching how the \nIranians behave. They respect one thing and one thing only--we are \nabout to give it to them, I hope--and that is action, deeds, and a \ncredible threat that we will impose sanctions and we will hurt their \ncapability if they do not change their course. That is what we have an \nopportunity to do here in about 2 minutes. I hope we take that \nopportunity and do not simply say that we like what the President is \ndoing and we are all for negotiation and we hope everything goes well. \nIt will be interpreted as stepping back, as weakness. We cannot afford \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Biden \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Also, I ask unanimous consent, I believe with the \nagreement of the chairman, that Senator Lautenberg, who has been \npromised 3 minutes, be given those 3 minutes, and that if Senator \nSantorum needs a minute or two to respond to Senator Lautenberg, he be \ngiven it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, 3 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey, with an \nadditional 3 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania, and then the \nvote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will try to be quick. I listened \nwith interest to the Senator from Pennsylvania and his presentation. I \nalso looked at the amendment he has produced. In that amendment, we are \ngoing to administer sanctions against companies doing business with \nIran.\n  Now, the surprise here is that three times before, when I had an \namendment, the Senator from Pennsylvania voted against it, would not \ninclude it, didn't want to discriminate against firms that do business \nwith Iran and that provide revenues that kill our kids in Iraq. And now \nwe have a flimsy aspect. We say we are going to impose sanctions; \nhowever, it will be out of reach of American jurisdiction. It, \ntherefore, will not apply to the company that owns it--in this case it \nhappens to be a Halliburton--that has a sham corporation operating in \nDubai based originally in the Cayman Islands. That should not be \nallowed, that the grasp of the U.S. Government cannot reach these \nperpetrators of the kind of indecency that places our soldiers at risk \nbecause they are doing business with an avowed enemy of the United \nStates that is providing funds that are lethal to our troops over \nthere.\n\n  I hope everybody will take a good close look at this amendment and \nvote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this goes under the old rubric of no \ngood deed goes unpunished. We have attempted in this amendment to meet \nthe Senator from New Jersey halfway. The Senator's amendment has \nconsistently been voted on. I have opposed it and so has most of the \nSenate, which suggests that those who are currently doing business and \nhave invested should be penalized for their investment. What we say is \nthat on any future investment, you will be penalized. We make the \nLautenberg language prospective.\n  In attempting to meet the Senator from New Jersey halfway, we find \nout\n\n[[Page S5921]]\n\nthat this is not sufficient and, therefore, we should oppose this \namendment. I would think half a loaf is better than no loaf. This, by \nthe way, was not in the Iran Freedom and Support Act. This is one of \nthe provisions Senator Levin mentioned that was added, frankly, out of \nrespect for the concerns the Senator from New Jersey raised and has \nraised on the floor repeatedly.\n  This is an attempt to make a good-faith attempt--and I do mean that--\na good-faith attempt to meet the Senator from New Jersey halfway and to \ntake his policy and put it in place in a prospective manner. If that is \nnot sufficient for the Senator from New Jersey, that is fine. He is \nwelcome to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, is the Senator aware that the \nexemption in his amendment would make it almost impossible to hold a \nU.S. company liable for doing business with Iran through a foreign \nsubsidiary?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. My understanding is that we crafted this language \npursuant to the language the Senator from New Jersey used in the past \nand put a threshold we thought was--I think it was a $20 million \nthreshold we put in place which we thought was a reasonable threshold \nof investment to reach the level of sanction.\n  If the Senator from New Jersey would like to toughen that language or \nchange the threshold, I would be happy to sit down and talk with him \nabout it. I am open to discussion.\n  My only point, and I think the point we have had in this discussion \nin the past, is I don't believe it is proper to penalize companies that \nhave investments there, in many cases longstanding investments. What we \nwant to do is discourage future investment. That is what we attempt to \ndo in this amendment. If the Senator does not believe it has been \neffectively written, I will be happy to sit down with him, in all \nsincerity, and work to make it effective that future investments are \ndiscouraged.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have another question, if I may, and \nthat is, would the Senator be willing to move the vote back, if we can \ndo it, so we can discuss the language?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are under a unanimous consent \nagreement. The time, I believe, has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 6 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield back the 6 seconds so we can get \nto the vote? I regret we have to move forward.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator has heard his answer.\n  Mr. WARNER. There are Senators who have to go to the Pentagon for a \nmemorial service. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there are a number of differences between \nS. 333 and the Santorum amendment. These differences include a number \nof new provisions in the amendment that are not in the S. 333. Some of \nthem are:\n  Remove the requirement that a parent or a subsidiary of a person \nagainst whom sanctions have been issued must have actual knowledge of \nthe activities before sanctions can be issued against them.\n  Remove the requirement that an affiliate of the Company against which \nsanctions have been issued must have actual knowledge of the activities \nbefore sanctions can be issued against them.\n  Remove Libya from the scope and title of the Iran Libya Sanctions \nAct.\n  Would impose an additional condition on the exercise of the \nPresident's waiver authority by imposing an additional element in the \nreport that must be submitted to Congress prior to the waiver going \ninto effect. Current law requires, among other elements of the report, \nan assessment of the significance of the assistance provided to the \ndevelopment of Iran's petroleum production. The new requirement would \nalso require an assessment of the significance of the assistance to the \ndevelopment of Iran's weapons of mass destruction or other military \ncapabilities.\n  Reduces operations and maintenance funding for the Army for Iraq and \nAfghanistan by $100 million.\n  In other instances, there are modifications to provisions in the \namendment that are included in S. 333. For instance, both S. 333 and \nthe Santorum amendment would expand the universe of persons against \nwhom sanctions could be imposed to include a private or government \nlender, insurer, underwriter, reinsurer, or guarantor of a person \nsanctioned. S. 333 would require that these persons would have to have \nactual knowledge of the activities of the person sanctioned; the \nSantorum amendment does not include the requirement of actual \nknowledge.\n  Both S. 333 and the Santorum amendment would expand the definition of \na person to include a financial instution, insurer, underwriter, \nreinsurer, guarantor. The Santorum amendment would also include any \nother business organization, including any foreign subsidiaries of the \nforegoing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 4234. The yeas and nays have been ordered. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE GRANTING OF AMNESTY TO \n                   PERSONS KNOWN TO HAVE KILLED MEMBERS OF THE \n                   ARMED FORCES IN IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Armed Forces of the United States and coalition \n     military forces are serving heroically in Iraq to provide all \n     the people of Iraq a better future.\n       (2) The Armed Forces of the United States and coalition \n     military forces have served bravely in Iraq since the \n     beginning of military operations in March of 2003.\n       (3) More than 2,500 members of the Armed Forces of the \n     United States and members of coalition military forces have \n     been killed and more than 18,000 injured in operations to \n     bring peace and stability to all the people of Iraq.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Government of Iraq should not grant amnesty to \n     persons known to have attacked, killed, or wounded members of \n     the Armed Forces of the United States; and\n       (2) the President should immediately notify the Government \n     of Iraq that the Government of the United States strongly \n     opposes granting amnesty to persons who have attacked members \n     of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, a significant hubbub has \noccurred as a result of stories that have appeared in this morning's \nWashington Post that directly affect the defense posture of this \ncountry. It is stated in the Washington Post that the Prime Minister of \nIraq is expected to release within days a ``plan [that] is likely to \ninclude pardons for those who had attacked only U.S. troops'' in Iraq. \nThat is according to a top adviser.\n  As a matter of fact, the Prime Minister of Iraq is quoted as saying--\nand I will get to the quote--reconciliation could include an amnesty \nfor those ``who weren't involved in the shedding of Iraqi blood.'' \nErgo, there would be amnesty for those who would have been involved in \nthe shedding of American blood.\n  Now, it is possible--and this Senator hopes that something was lost \nin the translation because I cannot imagine the Prime Minister of Iraq \nturning on his heel away from American troops and suddenly--as he is \ntrying to bring about reconciliation in his country--trying to then say \nas part of that reconciliation we are going to give amnesty for anybody \nwho killed American men and women.\n  Well, naturally the Government of the United States should not stand \nfor this. That is why Senator Menendez and I are offering this \namendment to the Defense authorization bill, so that we can clearly set \nforth the policy--in this case, the sense of the Senate--that we will \nnot stand for this.\n  By the adoption of this sense of the Senate amendment, clearly our \nPresident should speak to the Iraqi Prime Minister, who he just spoke \nwith a couple of days ago, and he should speak with him immediately to \nget him to retract this statement. There should be no amnesty for those \nwho murder American troops. American troops continue to serve bravely, \nand they are fighting for the freedom of all Iraqis. So it brings us to \na point that is pretty clear. The Senate should go on record as having \nsaid that we repudiate that statement.\n  I will very clearly state what the Senate sense of the Congress is, \nthat the Government of Iraq should not grant amnesty to persons known \nto have attacked, killed, or wounded members of the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States and that the President should immediately notify the \nGovernment of Iraq that the Government of the United States strongly \nopposes granting amnesty to persons who have attacked members of the \nArmed Forces of the United States.\n  It is fairly straightforward. I could go on and on with comments. I \nam awaiting the arrival of Senator Menendez because I want him to make \nsome comments as well.\n  If you do what a number of us in this body have done in visiting \neither with the families of those who have borne the brunt of the \nfighting and have given the ultimate sacrifice or if you have visited \nwith those who return wounded and maimed, then there is no question \nthere should be no obfuscation as to the policy of granting amnesty to \nthose who have killed Americans.\n  I remember going back to the time that I served as a captain in the \nArmy, which was years and years ago. One of the most dread duties I had \nwas to be the officer who was given the task of notifying the loved \nones in the family of a service person who was killed. That, of course, \nis an exceptionally emotional event. And although it was decades ago, \nthose experiences are seared in my memory because of the\n\n[[Page S5923]]\n\ntrauma and the emotion when you meet with the grieving family of a \nloved one.\n  By the same token, there are over 18,000 of our service people who \nhave been wounded. And many of them, because the body armor is working \nand saving the vital organs, their lives are being saved, but they have \nbeen maimed. The extremities are often the part of the body that is the \ncasualty since the body armor is saving the vital organs. As a result, \nwhat we see is a lot of soldiers and sailors and Marines who come back, \nand they are just as optimistic as they can be in their outlook and yet \nthink of the life that they will live with the maiming that has \noccurred. Their life was spared, but their life is going to be clearly \ndifferent for the future.\n  Anyone who would dare suggest that in the formulation of a new \ngovernment of Iraq, which we, the United States Government, clearly \nsupport, anyone who would even contemplate that that government have a \npolicy that, as they try to build reconciliation, they are going to \ngrant amnesty to those who have killed Americans, as we say in the \nSouth, they have to have another thing coming, because we are not going \nto tolerate it.\n  I offer a simple resolution on behalf of the Senate. I hope it is not \ngoing to be controversial. I hope it will be accepted.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I had my fourth trip to Iraq recently \nand met with a number of leaders over there. I have been impressed with \nthem and have enjoyed them. I know Senator Nelson has also. He and I \nare the chair and ranking member respectively of the Strategic Forces \nSubcommittee. We have worked together on many important issues.\n  I wanted to say a couple things. First, the amendment he has is of \nvalue and will be something that can be accepted. I believe it should \nbe. You worry a little bit that maybe language difficulties come into \nplay in how miscommunications can occur. Even among those of us who \nspeak English together, we can have misunderstandings.\n  I was just handed a CNN interview today. It just came across the \nwire. It was by a reporter, Daryn Kagan, with the new national security \nadviser to Prime Minister Maliki in Iraq. He was asked about this very \nsubject because the reporter obviously felt some of the same concerns \nthe Senator from Florida raised. He said this to him.\n  The reporter:\n\n       Doctor, I know there's a big effort by your government in \n     your country to try to prevent civil war. And as a part of \n     that, the Washington Post reports today that your Prime \n     Minister is considering offering amnesty to Sunnis or to \n     others who perhaps attacked only U.S. troops. This, not \n     surprisingly, is causing great consternation here in the \n     U.S., even talking about it and being raised on the floor of \n     the U.S. Senate today. Is this, indeed, the case? Is your \n     government thinking about offering amnesty to those that \n     attacked only U.S. military?\n\n  This is Dr. Rubaie's reply:\n\n       This is not the case. I'm sorry to say that the prime \n     minister of Iraq has been misquoted and misunderstood. He did \n     not mean to give amnesty to those who killed Americans.\n       As a matter of fact, if you go there in his meeting with \n     the President Bush a couple of days ago, he looked the \n     president in the eye and he said, thank you very, very much \n     for liberating our country. Please thank the American wives \n     and American women and American mothers for the treasure and \n     blood they have invested in this country. It's well worth \n     investing, of liberating 30 million people in this country. \n     And we are ever so grateful.\n       And we will--the blood of the Iraqi soldier and the blood \n     of Iraqi civilian soldier is as sacred to us as the American \n     soldier. We are fighting the same war, we are fighting \n     together, and this is a joined responsibility. And we will \n     never give amnesty to those who have killed American soldiers \n     or killed Iraqi soldier or civilian.\n       What the prime minister is going to give amnesty to are \n     those who have not committed the crimes, rather they're \n     against Iraqis or coalition. Those who have--still carry arms \n     and they might have probably done some minor mistakes in \n     storing some arms or allowing some terrorists to stay \n     overnight or shelter, give shelter to some of these \n     insurgents. That's it. Basically, it's a goodwill gesture \n     he's extending to the Sunni community, to those who have \n     committed some mistakes in the past.\n\n  I don't know exactly how it all came about or how the comments were \nmade. Mr. Maliki is new to being Prime Minister. There are language \ndifficulties. I hope this reflects the firm view of the people of Iraq. \nI find it consistent with the responses I have had when I talked to the \nIraqi leadership.\n  I thank the Senator from Florida for raising the question. I am \npleased to see this very strong response from the national security \nadviser, Prime Minister Maliki's top adviser on national security.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. This Senator hopes, too, as I said at the \noutset of this Senator's remarks, that there is something lost in the \ntranslation, a mistake. But if there is, it is time for Prime Minister \nMaliki to step forward and clarify it. He can easily clarify it. But \nthat does not diminish the need for the sense of Congress that says \nthat the Government of Iraq should not grant amnesty to persons known \nto have attacked, killed, or wounded members of the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Florida.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \namendment Senator Nelson and I have offered on this issue of amnesty \nfor those who have killed American soldiers.\n  I know the latest statements that have come out. I hope that is \nultimately where the intention is. But it became very clear to me. I \nhope my colleagues have had the opportunity to read today's Washington \nPost article. It says: ``Iraq Amnesty Plan May Cover Attacks On U.S. \nMilitary.'' When you read the statements there, I have to be honest, \nthey were very unequivocal but unequivocal in a way that we could not \naccept as the U.S. Senate.\n  As I continued to reread this article, my anger grew. In the article \nit refers to the Prime Minister of Iraq acknowledging that \nreconciliation could include an amnesty for those ``who weren't \ninvolved in the shedding of Iraqi blood.'' That is where the quote \nends. There is not one single mention of American blood. Is that a \nmisinterpretation? Is that an oversight on the day on which we \nrecognize the loss of 2,500 American soldiers and the thousands and \nthousands who have shed their blood and come back injured? Is that an \noversight?\n  How about American blood and American lives, Mr. Prime Minister? Are \nyou willing to have reconciliation on the pool of American blood that \nhas been spilled to give your country and your people a chance for \nfreedom? Is there so little value to the 2,500 American lives that have \nbeen lost and the over 18,000 wounded on behalf of your country that \nyou wouldn't even think about including American lives when you were \ntalking about Iraqi lives? No way. No way.\n  Then I look at the article and look at the quotes attributed to Adnan \nKadhimi, a top adviser to Maliki. What does he say? He says:\n\n       The government has in mind somehow to do reconciliation, \n     and one way to do it is to offer an amnesty . . .\n\n  Then he goes on to talk about amnesty. He says:\n\n       We can see if somehow those who are so-called resistance \n     can be accepted if they have not been involved in any kind of \n     criminal behavior, such as killing innocent people or \n     damaging infrastructure, and even infrastructure, if it is \n     minor, will be part of it.\n\n  So we have this elaborate plan that talks about even infrastructure, \nbut doesn't talk about American lives. And then, when asked about \nclemency for those who attacked U.S. troops, he goes on to say--the \nadviser to the Prime Minister--that ``that's an area where we can see a \ngreen line.''\n  There is some sort of preliminary understanding between us and the \nU.S.-led multinational force in Iraq that there is ``a patriotic \nfeeling among the Iraqi youth and the belief that those attacks are \nlegitimate acts of resistance and defending their homeland. These \npeople will be pardoned definitely, I believe.''\n  Well, who in the U.S.-led multinational force has an understanding\n\n[[Page S5924]]\n\nwith the Iraqis that it is OK to offer amnesty for those who have \nkilled Americans? I would like to know the answer to that question.\n  I do believe very strongly that Senator Nelson's and my amendment \nshould be embraced by the entire Senate. We cannot allow to chance that \nthose statements attributed on the record--one directly by the Prime \nMinister and one directly by his top adviser--can be equivocated on. We \nhave to send a very strong message that we will not tolerate amnesty to \nthose who have taken the lives of American soldiers and for those who \nhave spilled American blood in defense of their country.\n  Just a little while ago, we had a moment of silence for the 2,500 \nAmerican soldiers who have died in Iraq. Let's do much more than have a \nmoment of silence in the face of these statements. Let's make sure the \ntaking of American lives can never be rewarded with amnesty. The Senate \nhas an opportunity to make a clear, unequivocal statement that it is \nunacceptable, and I believe that it should take this opportunity. It is \nnot only with a moment of silence that we show our respect, it is with \nour deeds that we show our respect.\n  Let the Senate act unanimously and speak with one voice to make it \nvery clear that this should not even be a thought on behalf of the \nIraqi Government. Then we will have honored the lives of those people, \nour fellow Americans, who gave the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of \ntheir country.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday afternoon, I placed a call to a \nNevada mother, Jennifer Laybourn. These calls are not easy; they are \nhard. Like many other Nevada mothers, she lost a boy, 19 years old, her \nson David, in Iraq. He was performing his duties as a soldier when he \nwas killed by an improvised explosive device. Again, he was 19 years \nold.\n  Nevada has lost 39 soldiers in Iraq. Nevada is a small, sparsely \npopulated State. Thirty-nine is a lot of funerals, a lot of sorrow for \nthose of us from Nevada. There is no way we can ever repay those 39 \nNevada heroes and their parents, siblings, family, and friends for \ntheir sacrifices. But we must always make sure their service is \nhonored, which is why today I compliment and applaud Senators Nelson \nfrom Florida and Menendez from New Jersey, and to express my complete \nshock and outrage that the Iraqi Prime Minister has even considered \ngranting amnesty to the insurgents who have killed our troops.\n  Up to this day, today, we have lost 2,500 soldiers in Iraq. The mere \nidea that this proposal would go forward is an insult to the brave \nNevadans who have died in the name of Iraqi freedom, and this doesn't \ntake into consideration those Nevadans who have been grievously wounded \nin battle. It is my hope the President will denounce this proposal \nimmediately--not wait for a retraction by the Iraqis but denounce it \nimmediately. We should remember that the majority of Nevadans killed in \nIraq were not killed in acts of warfare, as we historically have known \nwarfare. They were killed in acts of terror.\n  All of us who are committed to freedom and democracy should recognize \nthat their murders, 39 Nevadans, deserve justice. While I support \nreconciliation efforts to bring Iraqi political factions together, I \ndon't support amnesty for those who commit acts of terror against \nAmericans.\n  It sends the wrong signal to our troops, the wrong signal to the \nIraqis, and it sends the wrong signal to all Americans. It certainly \nsends a wrong signal to the insurgents who have now been given the \nmessage that they can attack our forces without consequence.\n  President Bush continually makes a point of saying that a free Iraq \nmeans the United States will have a friend in the Middle East. This \namnesty proposal is no sign of friendship; it is a sign of hostility \nwhich dishonors the sacrifice of our troops. Our troops deserve better. \nAgain, I urge the President to tell the new Iraqi Government to stand \ndown. America will not stand as our troops are dishonored in this way.\n  It seems so unfortunate that after the President's visit in Iraq, a \nday later this is floated through the Iraqi Government. It is too bad. \nWe deserve better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have listened with interest to my \ngood friend from Nevada. I hope Senators will be more supportive of our \nelected allies who are the Government of Iraq. The national security \nadviser for the Government of Iraq just said a few hours ago:\n\n       And we will never give amnesty to those who have killed \n     American soldiers or killed Iraqi soldiers or civilians.\n\n  So this notion of amnesty about a new, duly-elected Iraqi Government \nis a sideshow, an effort to divert our attention away from the core \nissue. Over in the House of Representatives today, they are having a \nmuch needed debate on the Iraq war. I had hoped that we would have that \ndebate in the Senate. I read that several of our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle were interested in offering an amendment that \nwould codify what they have said publicly, which is that the troops \nought to be out by the end of this year. I hope they will come down and \noffer that amendment. I hope we will have that debate. I think it is a \ngood time to have that debate.\n  It is a good time to remind the American people that it is no \naccident that we have not been attacked again since 9/11. Nobody would \nhave predicted that in the fall of 2001. If we asked for a show of \nhands in the Senate of how many Senators thought we would be attacked \nagain that year, I think every hand would have gone up. Certainly, the \nAmerican people expected another attack. By going on the offense, which \nthe President suggested we do shortly after 9/11, we have succeeded \ndramatically in the principal reason for advancing the war on \nterrorism, and that was to protect us at home. Almost 5 years later, we \nhave not been attacked again. While nobody will predict that we will \nnever be attacked again, it is noteworthy that we have not been \nattacked again. Believe me, it is not an accident. Why have we not been \nattacked again? Because we went into Afghanistan and into Iraq. We \nliberated 50 million people. A lot of the terrorists are dead. Several \nare at Guantanamo. Many are hiding in their caves. Yes, some are still \naround doing mischief in Baghdad rather than in Washington or New York.\n  This is the time we ought to be having the debate about Iraq \nstrategy. We are on the Defense authorization bill. Colleagues on the \nother side have said they were going to offer an amendment to advocate \nwithdrawal by the end of the year. Let's have that debate. I cannot \nthink of a better time.\n  Right now in Iraq, according to the latest AP story, since we were \nable to get Zarqawi last week, we have carried out 452 raids; 104 \ninsurgents were killed during those actions; we have discovered 28 \nsignificant arms caches; 255 of the raids were joint operations, with \n143 of them carried out by Iraqi forces alone; and the raids resulted \nin casualties of 759 anti-Iraqi elements. That is just in the last \nweek. So we have them on the run in Iraq.\n  Why would anybody want to suggest that we ought to run when we have \nthem on the run? But I think that is a legitimate debate. I hoped that \nwe would have it. It is 2:10. I have been waiting anxiously all day, \nassuming that we would have that amendment laid down by those on the \nother side of the aisle and get on about the debate. Maybe we should \nhave it in any event because it is time to step up and be counted.\n  Do we want to stay and finish the job and continue to protect America \nor do we want to send a message to the terrorists, when we have them on \nthe run, that we are about to cut and run and leave them there to their \nown devices? I don't know any responsible countries in the world at \nthis point, regardless of how they may have initially felt about the \ndecision to go into Iraq, that think it is a good idea to leave now--\nparticularly as we are making dramatic progress with their new \nconstitution; a new, fully staffed government; the death of the most \nnotorious terrorist in the country; these successful raids that have \nbeen carried out in the last week; and the effort underway to clean \nBaghdad out.\n  Why in the world would we want to say to those elements in Iraq, \nwhich want the country to be a haven for terrorism forever, that you \ncan count on\n\n[[Page S5925]]\n\nus to be out of here by the end of the year; that we are giving you \nadequate notice that we are leaving by the end of the year?\n  I see my colleague from Texas on the Senate floor. I wondered if he \nhad a question.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Yes. Will the Senator yield for a question at this point?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished majority whip, \nisn't the real difference between those of us who believe war is bad \nand must never be fought and those of us who believe that war is bad \nbut must sometimes be fought for the right reasons? What is the \nalternative to fighting the good fight that our troops are fighting in \nIraq now? I just ask whether the Senator has heard any alternatives \noffered by our friends on the other side of the aisle?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Texas, the only \nalternative I heard suggested, I have read about it in the press--I \nhave not heard it offered on the floor yet--is that we essentially give \nthe terrorists advance notice that we are going to be out of the \ncountry by the end of the year.\n  Look, we all hate, as the Senator from Texas indicated, to read \nreports of the death of any of our troops. We value human life in this \ncountry greatly. We do not, however, honor those who have given their \nlives in this great cause by giving up when we are making dramatic \nprogress. And it is also important to remember that while we value \nevery single life, we have lost fewer of our soldiers liberating \nAfghanistan and Iraq--50 million people liberated--than we lost on 9/11 \nin one morning or in Normandy during the invasion in World War II.\n  So while we value every life and we regret the loss of each soldier, \nit is extremely difficult to fight a war and lose absolutely no one.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for an \nadditional question, I ask the distinguished majority whip, what does \nhe believe the consequences in Iraq to be--and not just to Iraq, but to \nAmerica itself in terms of our own security--if we were to \nprecipitously draw down our forces and leave a void there that might \nthen be filled by enemies of our country and, indeed, terrorists akin \nto those who attacked our country on 9/11?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Texas, I think \none thing that is pretty obvious is the terrorists would have a haven \nfrom which to operate, once again, such as they had in Afghanistan for \na number of years prior to our clearing that out and giving those folks \nan opportunity to set up a democratic government. They would have a \nbase of operations right in the Middle East from which to attack our \nneighbors, to attack the Europeans, and probably attack us again. That \nwould be the consequence of cutting and running just on the heels of \nmaking dramatic forward progress in Iraq.\n  Mr. CORNYN. If the Senator will yield for one final question, I just \nwant to be sure I understood his earlier comments from the National \nSecurity Adviser for the Government of Iraq.\n  There had been some suggestion that the Iraqis were planning on \ngranting amnesty to those who had killed American soldiers. But if I \nunderstood the distinguished majority whip, the National Security \nAdviser said:\n\n       And we will never give amnesty to those who killed American \n     soldiers or who killed Iraqi soldiers or civilians.\n\n  If that language is true, that they would never do that, would the \nSenator care to venture a guess as to what the reason for this supposed \nsense of the Senate is to condemn some amnesty that will never be \ngiven?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It sounds to me, I answer my good friend from Texas, \nas some kind of diversion from the core issue we ought to be debating \nin the Senate, which is these suggestions that have been made by a \nnumber of our colleagues that we ought to have all the troops out by \nthe end of the year. It is time to have that debate in the Senate, not \na sense-of-the-Senate resolution about a proposal, as the Senator from \nTexas points out, that has been shot down today by the National \nSecurity Adviser in Iraq who, as the Senator from Texas indicated, said \ntoday:\n\n       And we will never give amnesty to those who have killed \n     American soldiers or who killed Iraqi soldiers or civilians.\n\n  What part of ``never give amnesty'' do our colleagues not understand?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID addressed the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe I have the floor. Would someone like to ask \na question?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to my friend from Florida for a question.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. This Senator clearly doesn't support pulling \nthe troops out of Iraq by the end of the year. This Senator offered an \namendment which is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment that the Government \nof Iraq should not grant amnesty to persons known to have attacked, \nkilled, or wounded members of the Armed Forces of the United States \nbased on this morning's story in this newspaper that indicates comments \nthat were made by the Prime Minister.\n  Is the Senator suggesting that he does not agree with the sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution being expressed in this amendment as laid down by \nthis Senator from Florida?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, answering the question, let me just \nrepeat what the National Security Adviser in Iraq has just said:\n\n     And we will never give amnesty to those who killed American \n     soldiers or who killed Iraqi soldiers or civilians.\n\n  Is it helpful to be passing resolutions condemning our allies in Iraq \nfor positions that the National Security Adviser says the Government \ndoesn't hold?\n  I am pleased to hear that my good friend from Florida opposes the \namendment that I hope will be offered later today that calls for an \nAmerican troop withdrawal by the end of the year. That is a debate I \nthought we were going to be having, rather than adopting resolutions \ncondemning one part of the Iraqi Government or another--the Iraqi \nGovernment, of course, being a great ally of the United States in the \nwar on terrorism.\n  Maybe that debate will occur later in the day, and I look forward to \nhearing from the Senator from Florida when we have that debate. I am \nsure he will be arguing the vote on that should be no, and the Senator \nfrom Florida, of course, will be entirely correct; that is exactly how \nthat amendment should be dealt with. I hope it will be defeated \noverwhelmingly.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Does the Senator have a question or is he seeking the \nfloor?\n  Mr. REID. I thought the Senator was finished.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Kentucky and my friend from \nTexas are involved in a debate that doesn't exist. The amendment before \nthe Senate, which will require a vote, is based on a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution offered by the Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson, and \nthe Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez. Here is what the matter \npending before the Senate now says:\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Armed Forces of the United States and coalition \n     military forces are serving heroically in Iraq to provide all \n     the people of Iraq a better future.\n       (2) The Armed Forces of the United States and coalition \n     military forces have served bravely in Iraq since the \n     beginning of military operations in March of 2003.\n       (3) More than 2,500 members of the Armed Forces of the \n     United States and members of the coalition forces have been \n     killed and more than 18,000 injured in operations to bring \n     peace and stability to all the people of Iraq.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that\n       (1) the Government of Iraq should not grant amnesty to \n     persons known who have attacked, killed, or wounded members \n     of the Armed forces of the United States; and\n       (2) the President should immediately notify the Government \n     of Iraq that the Government of the United States strongly \n     opposes granting amnesty to persons who have attacked members \n     of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n\n  That is very clear. That is what we are going to be called to vote \non.\n  Why do we have this before us? Because last night a man by the name \nof Adnan Ali al-Kadhimi, a top adviser to the Prime Minister of Iraq, \nsaid, among other things, the following:\n\n       Asked about clemency for those who attacked U.S. troops, he \n     said: ``That's an area\n\n[[Page S5926]]\n\n     where we can see a green line. There's some sort of \n     preliminary understanding between us and the MNF-I,'' the \n     U.S.-led Multinational Force-Iraq, ``that there is a \n     patriotic feeling among the Iraqi youth and the belief that \n     those attacks are legitimate acts of resistance and defending \n     their homeland. These people will be pardoned definitely.\n\n  That is the reason for this resolution. It is not about an amendment \nthat will be offered and there will be some other debate. It is about \nwhether the people of Iraq, who are running that government, should \npardon those people, grant amnesty to the people who have attacked our \nforces either through snipers, armed combat, or explosive devices. It \nis a simple vote.\n  Further, the man went on to say they would consider taking a look at \nIraqi forces who were attacked. They wouldn't necessarily be given \namnesty like those who attacked Americans.\n  That is a pretty clear vote, Mr. President. And that is the issue \nbefore the Senate, not some make-believe thing that will come at some \nlater time, maybe. The issue before the Senate today is whether this \nresolution will be approved, yes or no, based upon statements made by \nofficials in Iraq.\n  Someone has since then said: We don't like that. Good. We should \nadopt this resolution anyway. This is no attack on the Iraqi Government \nother than to say: Be careful, don't tread on our soldiers' graves.\n  This is the debate before us. I talked about a woman I called \nyesterday in Nevada who lost her 19-year-old son in Iraq, and to think \nthat anyone in the Iraqi Government--anyone in the Iraqi Government--\nshould pardon an Iraqi who killed this young man is repulsive. That is \nwhat the debate is about today. It is not about these terms that my \nfriends like to throw around--cut and run, tax and spend.\n  The American people know what is going on here. They know what is \ngoing on. We all want the Iraqi issue to proceed even though it is \ncosting us $2.5 billion a week, 2,500 dead soldiers, 18,000 or 20,000 \nwounded, a third of them grievously wounded, 20 percent of them coming \nback from Iraq with post-traumatic stress syndrome with a Veterans' \nAdministration that is underfunded.\n  That is what this is all about. It is not about some other issue. It \nis about whether the Government of Iraq, now or at any other time in \nthe future, should pardon people who harm our soldiers.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, what is the agreement at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the Nelson of Florida amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator from Georgia is here. I think he would like \nto offer an amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no unanimous consent request pending.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be set aside and that I be allowed to call up an amendment of \nmine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Then Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, since we are going to be on the amendment \nof the Senator from Florida for a few minutes, I have a couple other \nthoughts I would like to offer to our colleagues in response to those \noffered by the Democratic leader.\n  First of all, I don't know why, after the Iraqi officials have \ndisclaimed any intent whatsoever to offer amnesty to those who have \nkilled an American soldier, we would gratuitously offer a sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment to condemn them for doing something they said they are \nnot going to do, unless we are engaged more in gamesmanship than we are \nin working and passing serious legislation.\n  The comment was made earlier that perhaps this is just a diversion. I \nthought we were going to have a serious debate about whether we were \ngoing to bring our troops back home and on what kind of timetable we \nwere going to do that, whether it is some arbitrary timetable or, \ninstead, whether it is based on conditions on the ground. I thought \nthat was the kind of debate we were going to have today, not some sort \nof manufactured debate offering a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to \ndivert public attention from an issue that does not exist about this \namnesty that has been suggested which has been expressly disclaimed by \nthe Iraqi leadership.\n  My suggestion is that we move on to the serious work that the people \nof this country sent us here to do and not to engage in sideshows, \nwhich is clearly what this sense-of-the-Senate proposition is designed \nto do.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will be glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, since this Senator from Florida \nis the author of the amendment, I would recall, for the consideration \nof the distinguished Senator from Texas, that there is nothing in this \nresolution that says anything about condemnation of the Iraqi \nGovernment. It says: It is the sense of Congress that the Government of \nIraq should not grant amnesty to persons known to have attacked, \nkilled, or wounded members of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n  I would further call to the attention of the distinguished Senator \nthat the yeas and nays have been ordered on the amendment, and as soon \nas the leadership is ready to dispose of the amendment, we can vote.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I don't know what the question was, but \nlet me just respond to the distinguished Senator from Florida. It makes \nno sense for the Senate to shake its finger at the new Government of \nIraq and to criticize them, whether it is a condemnation or a criticism \nor an admonishment or whatever you want to call it, for something that \nthey have expressed that they have no intention of doing. I don't \ndispute from a procedural standpoint the Senator's right at some point, \nperhaps, to have a vote on the sense-of-the-Senate amendment, but I \njust question the wisdom of proceeding in this way when we are a nation \nat war.\n  We have done everything that we could to help the Iraqi people help \nthemselves, from training their security forces to encouraging them and \nhelping them in the development of a new government, something that is \nreally a miracle to behold, if you think about it. Three years ago, \nthey had a blood-thirsty dictator with his boot heel on the back of the \nneck of the Iraqi people, responsible for killing hundreds of thousands \nof Iraqis, and a threat to the entire world because of the potential \npartnerships with terrorists who might export their terror to places \nsuch as the United States. Why we would gratuitously take an occasion \nlike this, to distract us from the important business that we are \nabout, to criticize in one way, form, or fashion the new Iraqi \nGovernment which is just beginning to show that they are able to take \nthe first small steps toward self-determination and self-governance, \nwhy we would take this occasion to admonish them for something they \nhave expressly indicated no intention of doing is beyond me.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I know the Senator from Texas and I covered this a few \nmoments ago, but I would ask the Senator from Texas again if it is not \nthe case that the national security adviser to the Iraqi Government \njust this very day said the following: And we will never give amnesty \nto those who have killed American soldiers or killed Iraqi soldiers or \ncivilians?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would answer the distinguished majority \nwhip by saying, that is exactly the quotation. The same individuals \nwent on to say that who the Prime Minister is going to give amnesty to \nare those who have not committed the crimes, whether against Iraqis or \ncoalition forces. He went on to say, they might probably have done some \nminor mistakes in storing some arms or allowing some terrorist to stay \novernight or provided shelter. But he has expressly said: We will never \ngive amnesty to those who have killed American soldiers or killed Iraqi \nsoldiers or civilians.\n\n[[Page S5927]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator from Texas yield for an additional \nquestion?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Might it not be just as useful an exercise to try to \npass a resolution commending the Iraqi Government for the position they \nhave taken today with regard to this discussion of amnesty?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would answer the distinguished majority whip and say, I \nwould feel much better about something that was constructive and \nencouraging in assisting the Iraqi Government in their determination \nnot to give amnesty than I would in offering criticism where it appears \nto be gratuitous and where it is a distraction from the debate that I \nthink the American people would want us to have; that is, under what \nconditions do we want to leave Iraq, and are some of the proposals that \nsome of our colleagues on the Senate floor have made about setting \ntimetables, are those in the best interests of the American people or \ndo they endanger America by allowing perhaps those who are America's \nenemies, the enemies of all civilization, to plot and plan, and then \nuse that failed state as a platform to export their terrorist \nactivities to other parts of the world?\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4269 to Amendment No. 4265\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk to the \nunderlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4269 to amendment No. 4265.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require the withdrawal of United States Armed Forces from \n             Iraq and urge the convening of an Iraq summit)\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. UNITED STATES POLICY ON IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Withdrawal of Troops From Iraq.--\n       (1) Schedule for withdrawal.--The President shall reach an \n     agreement as soon as possible with the Government of Iraq on \n     a schedule for the withdrawal of United States combat troops \n     from Iraq by December 31, 2006, leaving only forces that are \n     critical to completing the mission of standing up Iraqi \n     security forces.\n       (2) Consultation with congress required.--The President \n     shall consult with Congress regarding such schedule and shall \n     present such withdrawal agreement to Congress immediately \n     upon the completion of the agreement.\n       (3) Maintenance of over-the-horizon troop presence.--The \n     President should maintain an over-the-horizon troop presence \n     to prosecute the war on terror and protect regional security \n     interests.\n       (b) Iraq Summit.--The President should convene a summit as \n     soon as possible that includes the leaders of the Government \n     of Iraq, leaders of the governments of each country bordering \n     Iraq, representatives of the Arab League, the Secretary \n     General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, \n     representatives of the European Union, and leaders of the \n     governments of each permanent member of the United Nations \n     Security Council, for the purpose of reaching a comprehensive \n     political agreement for Iraq that addresses fundamental \n     issues including federalism, oil revenues, the militias, \n     security guarantees, reconstruction, economic assistance, and \n     border security.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the amendment I have sent to the desk \nis the amendment that I believe the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKerry, had indicated he was going to be offering today so that we can \nhave an appropriate debate on this very important day about whether it \nis appropriate to withdraw American troops by the end of 2006. That is \nthe second-degree amendment that I just sent to the desk.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I don't have a dog in this fight, you \nmight say, but I have been listening to this debate, and I wonder about \nhistory. I wonder about the amendment of the Senator from Florida. I \nremember reading so clearly that after the War Between the States, the \nNorth lined up those from the South and took their guns and let some of \nthem take them home. I remember so well that after World War II, we \nwent through a process of trying to urge the governments involved in \nthe access to obtain a pledge from the former members of the military \nthat they would support the new democracy. That was amnesty.\n  In Japan, we certainly had a period under General MacArthur which was \nprobably the greatest period of amnesty that has ever been known. We \nhelped that country immediately to form a democracy and we never \nprosecuted the people who killed Americans.\n  I wonder seriously about what the Senator from Florida is doing by \ntelling this new fledgling democracy that they cannot go through the \nprocess of cleansing, go through the process of trying to get people \nwho were misguided, who were part of coalitions that they now are \nwilling to recant, if they are, to come forward and support this new \ndemocracy. What are we doing anyway on the floor of the Senate trying \nto tell the new democracy what they can and can't do? I didn't like \nthat story when I read it in the paper this morning, but I was happy to \nsee the new statement from the security people that clarified what they \nintend to do.\n  But the time will come, if that democracy is going to succeed, when \nthey are going to have to fold into their population those who are \nwilling now to give up terrorism, those who are willing to put aside \nthe activities of the past which led them to attack Americans as well \nas any other--there are 34 other nations over there. Are we saying just \nthose who did kill Americans, they can't get amnesty, but the rest of \nthem can?\n  What are we doing on the floor of the Senate trying to debate an \nissue as to how this country is going to come back together again? I am \nsort of appalled at it, really. I don't know if anyone else is. But it \nseems to me that we ought to do everything we can to encourage them to \nbring their people together, to forget the sins of the past, to forget \nthe terrorists of the past, and to pledge themselves to a new future of \ndemocracy and have people come forward and say: I am willing to support \nthis new democracy. And if they do, and demonstrate that they do after \na period of time, shouldn't they be recognized as being loyal citizens \nof the new democracy?\n  This is a debate that disturbs me. It disturbs me to think we are \nwilling to just seize the moment and make a political point--seize the \nmoment and make a point--and not think. It is time we started thinking \nabout how we can assure and take steps to help this country survive as \na democracy. If it becomes a democracy in that part of the world, it \nwill be a marvelous success, and I think it will lead to greater \nconsideration by other countries of liberalization of their concepts \nand giving the people more power.\n  I believe we ought to try to find some way to encourage that country, \nto demonstrate to those people who have been opposed to what we are \ntrying to do, that it is worthwhile for them and their children to come \nforward and support this democracy. And if that is amnesty, I am for \nit, I would be for it. And if those people who come forward and want to \nobtain a better life for their families in the future are willing to \nsupport that democracy--if they bear arms against our people, what is \nthe difference between those people who bore arms against the Union in \nthe War Between the States? What is the difference between the Germans \nand the Japanese and all the people we have forgiven?\n  When I left the war and came home, I had a deep hatred for the \nJapanese. Today, Mr. President, I have a granddaughter who is Japanese. \nI have a daughter-in-law who is Japanese. And her parents were involved \nin World War II. Now, are we to understand that time can heal, heal the \npain of the past?\n  I really wish the Senator from Florida would have the courage to \nwithdraw the amendment, just withdraw it and say it was a political \neffort. This is nothing but politics. I will vote to table it or vote \nagainst it in good conscience.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, will the Senator from Alaska yield for \na question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Is it not true, Mr. President, that today we have \nIraqis who are fighting the war against the\n\n[[Page S5928]]\n\ninsurgents who at one time fought against American troops and other \ncoalition troops as they were marching to Baghdad, who have now come \nover to our side and are doing one heck of a job of fighting alongside \nthe Americans and coalition forces, attacking and killing insurgents on \na daily basis?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is absolutely true. I would say to the Senator, I \nwas there and participated in the conversation with some of our \nmilitary people who were trying to find ways to help the Iraqis take \ninto the regular armed services some of those people who served in the \nRed Guard under Saddam Hussein. But they are willing to come forward \nnow and see that there is a country they would like to support. And if \nthey asked my opinion about that, I would say I would encourage it. I \nwould encourage it. I think if there is anything that can bring about \nstability in that country and have them support this new democracy, we \nshould encourage it.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, will the Senator from Alaska yield for \na question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will, Mr. President.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Alaska \nwould agree that as he goes through the history of countries that have \nbeen torn apart by war, including our country in the Civil War and \nJapan, after the Second World War, and the processes of reconciliation, \nwhether South Africa might not be an example. And is it not true that \nNelson Mandela's courage and his ability to create a process of \nreconciliation and forgiveness was a major factor in what has been a \npolitical miracle in Africa, where White and Black people now are able \nto live together in a democracy? Is not that process of reconciliation \none of the most admired processes in the last century? Nelson Mandela, \nthe winner of a Nobel Peace Prize just for this sort of gesture, would \nhe not fit into the series of examples that the Senator from Alaska \nused a few moments ago?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Absolutely. Mr. President, I would say it falls under \nthe concept of the Christian ethic. We are people who believe that you \ncan be converted. You can be a nonbeliever and then become a believer. \nWhat is the difference between that and amnesty, between those people \nwho may have been on the wrong side and then will come forward and \nbelong to this new government? And if they pledge and demonstrate to do \nit, I think it is up to the Iraqis to determine when and how they \nbecome full-fledged citizens of the new democracy.\n  But this amendment would have us say if they indicate they are going \nto grant amnesty to them, that is wrong. Amnesty ought to be a reward \nfor a pledge of cooperation and support. In this context, the military \ncontext, I think you can go through history and find time after time \nafter time where it was successful. But this amendment is a political \namendment, and I am tired of these political things coming on the \nfloor. The minute something comes in the paper, before it can even be \ncorrected by the country, we have an amendment saying, oh, here, let's \nforce the majority to vote against this amendment. Baloney. I am proud \nto vote against it.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I just came to the Chamber a few moments \nago. I understand the pending amendment is the Kerry amendment, and \nalthough I have not reviewed it in its entirety, I see that it reads \nthat the President----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader will be corrected; the \npending amendment is the McConnell amendment.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I understand. I will speak to the Kerry \namendment. I will read that amendment just so my colleagues will be \nclear what I am talking to. The amendment says:\n\n       The President shall reach an agreement as soon as possible \n     with the Government of Iraq on a schedule for the withdrawal \n     of United States combat troops from Iraq by December 31, \n     2006, leaving only forces that are critical to completing the \n     mission of standing up Iraqi security forces.\n\n  As I look at this amendment, as we evaluate it, I think the first \nthing we must do is say: What if we did cut and run? I know we hear \nthat discussion of a rapid withdrawal. In many ways, I am glad this \namendment has come to the floor, that it has been put on the floor by \nSenator Kerry. I think we do have to grasp what is at stake, and if we \nwithdraw from Iraq----\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend.\n  Does the majority leader yield for a parliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. FRIST. I will shortly. Let me finish my statement because I think \nit is important to look at the issue that has been put on the floor. I \nwill be very brief. Then we can do the parliamentary inquiries back and \nforth.\n  If we withdraw from Iraq before the Iraqi Government and the Iraqi \npeople are capable of defending their new democracy, I am absolutely \nconvinced that the terrorists would see this as a vindication, a \nvindication of their strategy of intimidation, of confrontation, and \nthat they would take that vindication and continue to challenge us \nelsewhere in the world--in Afghanistan, in other countries in the \nregion, overseas, and, indeed, right here at home. If we were to cut \nand run, the violence in Iraq would certainly increase.\n  We know there is violence there, and we know how tough it is on our \ntroops who are there and the American people who watch this violence. \nBut I am absolutely convinced that if we cut and run, violence will \nincrease in Iraq, terrorists will increase their attacks on the Iraqi \npeople and on that brandnew Iraqi Government. Clearly, it has only been \n5 days. Clearly, the Government itself is not able, completely alone, \nto defend itself. Chaos would result. Bloody civil war would result. \nTerrorists and rival militia would tear the country apart. They would \nkill thousands of innocent Iraqis, and that terrorism would spread \nthrough that region, around the world, and, indeed, I believe right \nhere at home.\n  The unity of Iraq that we celebrated on this floor, the unity of Iraq \nthat has resulted from a democratically elected government through \nthree elections, would be destroyed, would be torn apart; sectarian \nviolence would ensue and would explode. It would split the country \napart into segments that, yes, probably would be controlled, but they \nwould be controlled by terrorists, ethnic militias, tribal militias. I \nam convinced parts of Iraq would become safe havens for terrorists who \nhave spelled out--and we think of the letters and the words of \nZarqawi--who have spelled out what their intentions are in terms of us \nhere, right here in the United States.\n  I believe terrorist bases in Iraq would threaten Middle East \nsecurity. Although it may be a secondary issue, we do know that energy \nsupplies ultimately would be disrupted. We have seen supply go down, \ndemand go up, and a disruption of energy sources all over the country. \nIndeed, I believe it would result in a skyrocketing of gas prices in \nthis country.\n  The terrorists affiliated with bin Laden and Zarqawi have stated in \ncrystal clear terms what their objectives are, their aim of \noverthrowing moderate governments.\n  Given the presence in Iraq of many of Saddam Hussein's former weapons \nscientists--remember Saddam Hussein? Forget about weapons of mass \ndestruction right now, but we actually know that Saddam Hussein and his \nscientists have developed weapons of mass destruction, chemical and \nbiological weapons, and he has used both of those on his own people. \nThose scientists are still around. If we cut and run, I believe those \nscientists once again will pursue and will have the freedom to pursue \nthose weapons of mass destruction: saran gas, anthrax, biological \nweapons.\n  President Bush has repeatedly stated that the potential combination \nof terrorism and weapons of mass destruction does pose the greatest \nthreats to the United States. I believe cutting and running would allow \nthose weapons of mass destruction and that terrorism intent to come \nback together, to endanger the people of the region but also the people \nright here in the United States of America.\n  In some ways, I am glad this amendment has come to the floor, this \nmodification of the amendment. It is clear that those calling for an \nearly withdrawal of American troops from Iraq failed to fully play out, \nto fully understand the potential implications of\n\n[[Page S5929]]\n\nleaving prematurely. Cutting and running before Iraq can really defend \nitself threatens the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority reader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, two things that do not exist in Iraq and \nhave not are weapons of mass destruction and cutting and running.\n  This is the McConnell amendment. It is not the Kerry amendment. \nPeople have the right to file amendments. They can decide whether they \nwant to offer them or modify them or change them.\n  I move to table the McConnell amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I reoffer my motion to table. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. Is \nthere a sufficient second?

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KERRY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my understanding is the Senate now turns \nto the measure by the Senator from Florida, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. I understand that. I ask the indulgence of the Senator if, \nafter he has finished his business, I could just have a moment.\n  Mr. WARNER. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, what is ``a moment''?\n  If the Senator propounds a unanimous consent for an amount of time, I \nwould be glad to not object. I wonder what a moment is?\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to have 5 minutes.\n  I thought the concept of ``a moment'' was not incomprehensible even \nin the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, following that, I ask unanimous consent \nthe Senator from Arizona be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me just say if I may, earlier today, \nthe distinguished chairman and manager of this legislation came to me \nand asked me if I was prepared to put my amendment in. I told him then, \nas he knows, that I said no, because a number of Members were talking, \nas is the right of the Senator with respect to any amendment filed. So \nthe chairman, the manager, was on notice that we were, in fact, in the \nprocess of working on this.\n  I voted no on this because any Senator reserves that right, No. 1; \nand No. 2, this is a debate I look forward to. This is a debate I want \nto have on the floor of the Senate. This is a debate we will have on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  I resent the fact that some Senators think the business of the United \nStates is somehow better done by calling up another Senator's \namendment, that may or may not be the language presented to the Senate, \nand having a fictitious vote on it. It is not unlike the war itself \nwhere we are in the third war: The first being about Saddam Hussein and \nweapons of mass destruction; the second being about al-Qaida; and the \nthird, now, the sectarian violence.\n  I look forward to having a debate on the floor of the Senate. But I \nlook forward to having a debate on the language that I, as a U.S. \nSenator, present to the Senate in an amendment that bears my name and \nthe name of other Senators that joined me. That has always been the \nprerogative of the Senator, and it is one that ought to be protected.\n  I respect and I understand completely what the distinguished minority \nleader did. He did it in consultation with me. I think it was the \nappropriate measure for him to take to protect my interests and the \ninterests of those on our side.\n  The Senate ought to give a more appropriate kind of seriousness of \npurpose to debate of this kind of consequence. This will be the first \ntime in some time that we will have debated this issue. I suggest some \nof my colleagues go back and reread the resolution which gave the \nPresident the authority to go into Iraq. There is nothing in that \nresolution that gives authority for what we are doing today.\n  So, in effect, this is a war of evolution, a war of transformation, \nand it deserves the kind of serious debate that it will get next week \nin the Senate.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator from Arizona yield to me for a few \nminutes?\n  Mr. McCAIN. For a moment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts and I did \nhave a brief conversation just before the conclusion of the vote in the \nmiddle of the noon hour. I, in an effort to try and keep momentum on \nthe bill, did inquire of the desire to move forward with his amendment. \nI only conveyed his response to me, which was not at this time--he was \nin consultation with colleagues--to my distinguished ranking member, \nadvising him we best look at other amendments to keep the momentum \ngoing forward. I then departed for the memorial services at the \nDepartment of Defense honoring those who lost their lives on 9/11. And, \ntherefore, when I arrived back we were in the middle of the debate that \nhas been described by the Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank you for the recognition, and I \nthank the distinguished chairman for his explanation of what just \ntranspired.\n  Mr. President, I rise to discuss the pending Nelson amendment. I \nthink it is very important that, first of all, we try not to react on \nthe floor of the Senate to the headlines that appear in the morning \npaper--whether they happen to be totally accurate or not.\n  The second thing I want to point out is that all of us--all of us--\nare pained\n\n[[Page S5930]]\n\nwhen a brave American is killed in this terrible, long, drawn-out \nconflict which has divided America and cost us so much in American \nblood and treasure. All of us--no matter where we stand on this \nconflict--feel the utmost sorrow and regret at the loss or wounding of \na single brave, young American man or woman. So this debate is \ncertainly not about the enormous sacrifice that has already been made \nand probably will be made in the course of this conflict.\n  But I think we have to be realistic about the way out of this \nconflict, the way out we have seen time after time throughout history \nof other conflicts, especially those that in many respects are civil \nwars.\n  Nelson Mandela probably had the greatest reason to seek revenge and \nfull accounting not only for the years of imprisonment and mistreatment \nhe personally received but also because of the hundreds if not \nthousands of his countrymen who were brutalized, mistreated, kept in \ninferior status, and, in some cases, even massacred by the minority \ngovernment that ruled his country.\n  When Nelson Mandela was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, it was not \nonly because of his bravery and courage while he underwent unspeakable \nunpleasantries and indignities as a prisoner--I believe the number was \n27 years--but primarily because Nelson Mandela realized he had to knit \nand heal the wounds that had so badly scarred his nation.\n  Nelson Mandela, in the spirit of forgiveness, for the good of his \ncountry, put his personal injuries aside because he realized the only \nway his nation could move forward is to put those terrible things that \nhappened behind him.\n  We also saw terrible things happen in El Salvador's civil war. Jose \nNapoleon Duarte, a name that some of us have forgotten, was elected \nPresident of the country. And he did two things. He vigorously \nprosecuted the insurgency, and then he reached out his hand to the \ninsurgents because he knew if they did not forgive and even try to \nforget, that nation would continue a bloodletting that had afflicted it \nfor a long period of time.\n  In Colombia, the President of Colombia has just attested that 40,000 \npeople--paramilitaries and guerrillas who, again, have carried out \nthese same kinds of attacks and murder and mayhem in their country--\nhave laid down their arms because of an amnesty program that he has \nextended to them.\n  I could go on about many of the conflicts in our history. But the \nfact is that wars end when enemies stop killing each other. After Pearl \nHarbor we talked with the Japanese. After years of war in Vietnam, we \ntalked to the North Vietnamese in Paris. Time and again, there reaches \na point where enemies must if not be forgiven at least be included, as \nhostilities come to an end and peace begins.\n  Our brave men and women are working with Iraqis to build a new \ncountry, and by co-opting the insurgents, perhaps we can save the lives \nand fortunes of our own and those who we support.\n  Things are very difficult in Iraq. And we are angered when we hear of \nan IED that blows up and kills and maims innocent Americans. We are \nsometimes driven to frustration and incredible--incredible--sorrow when \nwe hear of the loss of these precious young men and women.\n  But we also know that the insurgency does not end until the \ninsurgents stop fighting. And the sooner the new Prime Minister, freely \nelected--freely elected--Mr. Maliki, is able to bring his country back \ntogether, the sooner we will find peace, and the sooner Americans can \nbe withdrawn, and the sooner American casualties will end.\n  I am confident the amendment by the Senator from Florida amendment is \nwell-meaning, and I understand the intentions behind it. But I think it \nis important we look back and recognize that not only do times change, \nas in the case of Vietnam--our Secretary of Defense just in the last \nweek visited Vietnam, as we have renewed our relationships, as we have \nhealed the wounds of the Vietnam war, and moved forward in partnership \nwith the Vietnamese.\n  Mr. President, from a personal standpoint, there are a few Vietnamese \nI would very much like to see again, people I may not have the most \npeaceful intentions toward. But the reality is--the reality is--we must \nheal the wounds of war if we are going to unite a nation and move \nforward. And that is the case with Iraq, as it has been with almost \nevery other nation in history.\n  I finally add, as a footnote, I am not sure we here in the U.S. \nSenate should be dictating to the leaders of Iraq how they should \nconduct their affairs as they, the freely elected leaders of that \nnation, attempt to bring about peace and reconciliation in their \nnation.\n  But the larger issue here is, I believe, that our goal is to bring an \nend to the conflict as quickly as possible in Iraq. If that means, in \nreturn for laying down their arms, that some are allowed an amnesty or \nallowed to reenter the society of Iraq, in a peaceful manner, in a \nproductive manner, as has happened in South Africa, El Salvador--and is \nhappening in Colombia--and many other insurgencies throughout history, \nthen I think we should welcome it. And as we place our confidence in \nthe new Government of Iraq, perhaps we should give them some latitude.\n\n  I would also like to add, by the way, that that quote in the press \nmay not have been exactly right as to who might be eligible for amnesty \nand who might not. At least that should be cleared up. But it doesn't \nobscure the fact that the freely elected government, that we support, \nof the country of Iraq is now reaching out to attempt to end the \nfighting and the conflict. I do not think we should be micro managing \nthat from the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  I am sure that the enemies we faced in World War II--who the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee fought against in that great \nwar--that there was a time where we had reconciliation with our enemies \non both sides of the Atlantic.\n  Now, were people who were guilty of specific war crimes brought to \ntrial? Absolutely, and punished, in some cases, to the point of \nexecution. But those who fought against us are clearly now our friends.\n  So I hope that we would understand that this amendment would not be \nhelpful to the process of peace, would not be an endorsement of the \nfreely elected leaders of the country of Iraq, and might even serve, in \nan unintended fashion, as an impediment to a process of peaceful \nreconciliation in Iraq rather than helping it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my very good and longtime friend, \nwe have known each other since the closing months of the war in Vietnam \nwhen I was Secretary and he was serving in our naval service and \nreturned. So I just think sometimes of the great fortune of this body \nto have men such as John McCain, Daniel Inouye, and Ted Stevens, and \nothers, who have experience firsthand. I do not claim that same \nexperience that these men had in the mortal combat of the wars.\n  Senator McCain recounts the history of our Nation very accurately; \nthat is, when the conflicts are over, it has always been the stature \nand the greatness of this Nation to bind the wounds of war and to move \nforward with peace.\n  I say to the Senator from Florida, I have just handed him the \ncorrections that are now in the press, corrected by the national \nsecurity adviser to the new Prime Minister of Iraq, in which it is very \nexplicit that there was an error in translation. Some misfortune. But \nhe sets it forth here with absolute clarity, and I think that I would \nwant to state for my colleagues exactly what he said. He said the \nfollowing--and he said it, I presume, with the full knowledge of the \nPrime Minister.\n  He said: We thank--and the quote is--``the American wives and \nAmerican women and American mothers for the treasure and the blood they \nhave invested in this country . . . of liberating 30 million people in \nthis country. And we are ever so grateful.''\n  And further, he affirmed their position of the government that they \n``will never give amnesty to those who have killed American soldiers or \nkilled Iraqi soldiers or civilians.''\n  It seems to me that puts to rest, as my colleague from Arizona said, \nthis issue. And I wonder if the Senator would consider the withdrawal \nof his amendment to obviate the necessity on our side to take other \nsteps, and let us move forward with the bill.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n\n[[Page S5931]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Does the Senator from Florida have the floor \nor----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator from Florida has been seeking \nrecognition for the past hour and has not been able to speak.\n  Will the Senator from Virginia, the distinguished chairman of our \nArmed Services Committee, agree to a unanimous consent request that the \nSenator from Florida would be allowed to speak on this issue \nimmediately after the comments of the Senator from Virginia?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am delighted to accommodate my \ncolleague. I would hope we could discourse this matter in the \ntraditional way of a colloquy, but if you want the exclusive right to \nthe floor--if that is your desire--then I yield the floor, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Is that your desire?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. It is.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, what I understand of the \nparliamentary procedure is that the majority will offer an additional \namendment that will be a side-by-side and be voted upon, and the Senate \ncan make its choice.\n  In the case of the amendment that is being proffered by the \nmajority--indeed, in the copy that has been represented to me as being \nthe accurate one--it will recite the comments of the gentleman to whom \nin Iraq the chairman has just referred.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, that is the \nnational security adviser.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. And that side-by-side amendment will state \nthat the national security adviser of Iraq, on today, had ``thanked \n`the American wives and American women and American mothers for the \ntreasure and the blood they have invested in the country . . . of \nliberating 30 million people in this country . . . And we are ever so \ngrateful.' '' And that affirms their position that they will never give \namnesty to those who would kill American soldiers or those who have \nkilled Iraqi soldiers or civilians. I think that is all well and good. \nThis Senator would certainly intend to vote yes on that side-by-side \namendment.\n\n  The reason the Senator from Florida has been seeking recognition for \nthe last hour is this Senator's amendment has been characterized in \nways that defy what the amendment says. The amendment clearly said that \nit is the sense of Congress that ``the Government of Iraq should not \ngrant amnesty to persons known to have attacked, killed, or wounded \nmembers of the Armed Forces of the United States; and the President \nshould immediately notify the Government of Iraq that the Government of \nthe United States strongly opposes granting amnesty to persons who have \nattacked members of the Armed Forces of the United States.''\n  That is what the amendment says.\n  What this has been causing is a brouhaha because of something being \nread in to a simple little amendment that came as a result of a front-\npage story today in the Washington Post in which a top adviser to the \nPrime Minister, Mr. Adnan Ali al-Kadhimi, who happens to be the former \nchief of staff to the previous Prime Minister, a high-ranking official \nin the Dawa Party, he is the one who is quoted in the article as going \non to say, when asked about clemency for those who attacked U.S. \ntroops:\n\n       That's an area where we can see a green line. There's some \n     sort of preliminary understanding between us and the MNF-1 \n     that there is a patriotic feeling among Iraqi youth and the \n     belief that those attacks are legitimate acts of resistance \n     and defending their homeland. These people will be pardoned \n     definitely, I believe.\n\n  Now, it is very enlightening that the national security adviser has \ntried to clarify Prime Minister Maliki's comments. The Prime Minister \ncan certainly clarify his own comments. But here we have a high-ranking \nIraqi official who is quoted on the front page of the paper today as \nsaying amnesty for those who would have killed American men and women.\n  This Senator's name has been invoked by several speakers, including \nthe distinguished Senator from Alaska, who I have the greatest and \nutmost respect for, in talking about the reconciliation process as if \nthis were contrary to the reconciliation process. The Senator from \nAlaska was even quoting the reconciliation that took place after the \nCivil War, on which we all agree. The Senator from Alaska was talking \nabout the reconciliation that has taken place in South Africa, of which \nwe all agree, even talk of the reconciliation that took place with \nregard to Germany and Japan. But that didn't stop those who were \nresponsible for war crimes and the killings of Americans to be brought \nto justice; in other words, not to have amnesty granted for them. That \nwas not the case in South Africa where they had a process that those \nwho did those criminal acts were brought to justice. That was certainly \nnot the case in Germany after World War II where those who had \ncommitted those atrocities were brought to justice.\n  It just simply, in the opinion of this Senator, ought to be that a \npolicy of the very government that we have helped and have liberated a \npeople should not be amnesty for those who have killed Americans. How \nmuch more simple could it be? Yet I suspect, as others have implied \npolitics, I suspect politics has a way of taking over and starting to \nmake something seem like it isn't. It certainly wasn't the intention of \nthis Senator.\n  As I understand, my wonderful chairman of the committee is going to \noffer a second-degree or will offer another amendment that will be a \nside by side amendment to that which I have offered, and we can vote \nfor both. It would be the intention of this Senator to vote for both.\n  I said at the outset of my remarks, the first thing out of my mouth \nwhen I offered the amendment was, I hope there was something lost in \nthe translation of what was reported in this morning's Post.\n  I don't understand--or maybe I do--all the brouhaha that has occurred \nover the course of the last 2 hours on such a simple amendment as \nsaying that it is the sense of Congress that the Government of Iraq \nshould not grant amnesty to persons known to have attacked, killed, or \nwounded members of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first I would like to say to my colleague, \nwe have had a very strong, fervent and heartfelt debate, not a brouhaha \nby any definition of the use of those terms. We have heard from two of \nthe most respected combat veterans currently serving in this Chamber. \nIt was not in the nature of a brouhaha. They were simply reciting the \nhistory of this great Republic since its inception as to how it has \ndealt with adversaries in the several conflicts that we have had.\n  I first say to the Senator, I hope that you will reconsider the use \nof that term.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, of course.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. This Senator is referring to the rhubarb that \nhas occurred for the last 2 hours on the floor, where statements were \nmade about my amendment that mischaracterized the amendment and that \nfurther, then, allowed a totally different issue, an issue on which \nthis Senator agrees with the chairman of the committee, not withdrawing \nall of the troops by the end of the year.\n  The Senator can characterize it as he would like. This Senator will \ncharacterize it as he would like.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I so note his comments.\n  Again, addressing the Senator's amendment, it clearly, in my \njudgment, restricts in some respects the recognition that this is a \nsovereign government in Iraq today, in the hands of a duly elected \nPrime Minister and others, and that this amendment could well be \nconstrued as restricting what they can and cannot do. That was so \neloquently stated by Senator McCain. I wondered if the Senator would \ncare to try and revise the amendment so it is consistent with the \nlongstanding practices of our country with respect to our adversaries, \nin some way to recognize that it is not in conflict with that?\n\n[[Page S5932]]\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. If the Senator would like, we could have a \nquorum call and discuss exactly that matter.\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, as a coauthor of the amendment of my \ndistinguished colleague from Florida, I hope he will continue to pursue \nhis amendment. It is incredibly important to send a very clear message \non behalf of the United States about what is and is not acceptable as \nit relates to the future of our young men and women in the armed \nservices of the United States.\n  We are told on the Senate floor: Don't react to the morning's papers. \nBut, in fact, it is our reaction to it that brings about a \nclarification from the National Security Adviser of the Iraqi \nGovernment that moves us in the direction which should have been the \nposition of the Iraqi Government from the outset.\n  I am amazed how I have heard some of my colleagues in this Chamber \nstretch and twist and turn to justify a position which even now the \nIraqi Government supposedly rejects. We had some history lessons about \namnesty. Most of those were as it related to civil wars. But I remember \nhow President Bush started this engagement. He said to the Nation: You \nare either with the terrorists or you are with us.\n  As I listened to my colleagues suggest that amnesty is something we \nshould actually be in favor of for those who have committed acts \nagainst the Armed Forces of the United States, for those who have \nkilled American soldiers, for those who have wounded American soldiers, \nit is beyond my imagination that there are Members of the Senate who \nbelieve that is the signal we want to send throughout the world. What \nhappened to ``you are either with the terrorists or you are with us''? \nWhat happened to making it very clear that our men and women are not \nsitting ducks for those who think they could ultimately seek to kill \nthem and then walk away and get amnesty? I don't understand--if a \nterrorist survives our arrest or attack, does that mean that if they \nsuddenly see the light, we will say: Yes, it is up to the Iraqis to \ngive them amnesty? Is that the message the Senate wants to send?\n  It is beyond my imagination--we hear about the challenges of \ndemocracy in Iraq. Democracy is about the rule of law, and then \nultimately we would set aside the rule of law and say you can kill \nAmerican soldiers and we will have no say. Imagine that as the Nation \nsends its sons and daughters abroad to shed their blood and to give \ntheir lives, that we should have no say? That is what we heard on the \nSenate floor, that we should have no say, that we should let the Iraqi \nGovernment pursue even a course which might include amnesty against \nthose who kill American soldiers. That is the message we want to send? \nI think not.\n  The essence of the message we want to send is that we do not believe \nand do not accept and are outraged by the fact that there may have even \nbeen a consideration that there could be amnesty for those who killed \nAmerican soldiers but not amnesty for those who killed Iraqis. That is \nthe world's worst message we could send. We have to send a very clear \nmessage that we will not allow our sons and daughters to have their \nlives lost, and that their lives are not expendable and cannot be \nbartered for amnesty. That is what Senator Nelson is trying to do with \nthis amendment. Why it is so difficult for the Senate to come together \nin a bipartisan effort to send that very clear message, not only in \nIraq but throughout the world, that this is simply not a standard which \nis acceptable, is beyond belief.\n  This amendment is very clear, it is very simple, but it is also very \npowerful. It is a message that you can't kill our soldiers and walk \naway with impunity. Truly, you are either with the terrorists or you \nare with us, but you can't be a terrorist and then suddenly get caught, \nsee the light, and then ultimately walk away with amnesty. That would \nbe a horrible message for the Senate to send.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMcConnell now be recognized, that the pending amendments be set aside, \nand that Senator McConnell then offer an amendment which is relevant to \nthe Nelson amendment; provided further that if and when the McConnell \nand Nelson amendments are scheduled for votes--that would be sometime \nnext week--the McConnell amendment would be voted on first. Finally, I \nask unanimous consent that following the offering of the amendment, \nSenator Chambliss be recognized in order to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have no objection.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might amend the UC to delete the last \nsentence which reads:\n\n       Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following the \n     offering of the amendment, Senator Chambliss be recognized in \n     order to offer an amendment.\n\n  I ask that sentence be dropped.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4272\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, pursuant to the agreement just entered \ninto, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment will be set aside. The \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4272.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I have an amendment to provide compensation \nfor civilian veterans of the Cold War who contracted cancer as a result \nof their work at our nuclear weapons facilities.\n  My amendment will ensure that employees who worked at the Nevada Test \nSite during the years of above- and below-ground nuclear weapons \ntesting and suffer from radiation-induced cancers as a result of that \nwork finally receive the compensation they deserve. These Cold War \nveterans sacrificed their health and well-being for their country. We \ncan wait no longer to acknowledge those sacrifices and to try, in some \nsmall way, to compensate for the cancers they have suffered as a result \nof their service to their country.\n  U.S. citizens have served their country working in facilities \nproducing and testing nuclear weapons and engaging in other atomic \nenergy defense activities that served as a deterrent during the Cold \nWar. Many of these workers were exposed to cancer-causing levels of \nradiation and placed in harm's way by the Department of Energy and \ncontractors, subcontractors, and vendors of the Department without the \nknowledge and consent of the workers, without adequate radiation \nmonitoring, and without necessary protections from internal or external \noccupational radiation exposures.\n  Six years ago, I worked with President Clinton to pass The Energy \nEmployees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000, \nEEOICPA, to ensure fairness and equity for the men and women who \nperformed duties uniquely related to the nuclear weapons production and \ntesting programs by establishing a program that would provide timely, \nuniform, and adequate compensation for 22 specified radiation-related \ncancers.\n  Research by the Department of Energy, the National Institute for \nOccupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, NIOSH's contractors, the \nPresident's Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health, and \ncongressional committees indicates that workers were not adequately \nmonitored for internal or external exposures to ionizing radiation to \nwhich the workers were exposed and records were not maintained, are not \nreliable, are incomplete, or fail to indicate the radioactive isotopes \nto which workers were exposed.\n  Because of the inequities posed by the factors described above and \nthe resulting harm to the workers, EEOICPA has an expedited process for \ngroups of workers whose radiation dose cannot be estimated with \nsufficient accuracy or whose dose cannot be estimated in a timely \nmanner. These workers are placed into a Special Exposure Cohort, SEC. \nWorkers in an SEC do not have to go through the dose reconstruction \nprocess, which can take years and be extremely difficult as these \nworkers are often unable to produce information because it was or is \nclassified.\n  Congress has already legislatively designated classes of atomic \nenergy veterans at the Paducah, Kentucky, Portsmouth, Ohio, Oak Ridge \nK-25, Tennessee, and the Amchitka Island, AK, sites as members of the \nspecial exposure cohort under EEOICPA. Amchitka Island was designated \nbecause three underground nuclear tests were conducted on the Island.\n  Nevada Test Site workers deserve the same designation.\n  I and many other Nevadans remember watching explosions at the Nevada \nTest Site. We were struck with awe and wonder at the power and strength \nof these explosions. Little did we know that there was another side to \nthose atomic tests--the exposure of men and women working at the site \nto cancer-causing substances. Now, hundreds, perhaps thousands, of \nthese Cold War veterans face deadly cancers. Many have already passed \naway.\n  The contribution of the State of Nevada to the security of the United \nStates throughout the Cold War and since has been unparalleled. In \n1950, President Harry S. Truman designated what would later be called \nthe Nevada Test Site as the Nation's nuclear proving grounds and, a \nmonth later, the first atmospheric test at the Nevada Test Site was \ndetonated. The United States conducted 100 aboveground and 828 \nunderground nuclear tests at the Nevada Test Site from 1951 to 1992. \nOut of the 1054 nuclear tests conducted in the United States, 928, or \n88 percent, were conducted at the Nevada Test Site.\n\n[[Page S5938]]\n\n  Unfortunately, Nevada Test Site workers, despite having worked with \nsignificant amounts of radioactive materials and having known exposures \nleading to serious health effects, have been denied compensation under \nEEOICPA as a result of flawed calculations based on records that are \nincomplete or in error as well as the use of faulty assumptions and \nincorrect models.\n  It has become evident that it is not feasible to estimate with \nsufficient accuracy the radiation dose received by employees at the \nDepartment of Energy facility in Nevada known as Nevada Test Site at \nall in some cases and in others in a timely manner. In fact, the \nadministration has admitted that it cannot construct internal radiation \ndose for workers employed on the site during the aboveground test and \nyet is still balking at full compensation for all of these workers. \nThere are many reasons for this, including inadequate monitoring, \nincomplete radionuclide lists, and DOE's ignoring nearly a dozen tests \nconducted at the site that vented. Because of these problems, Nevada \nTest Site workers have been denied compensation under the act, some of \nwhich have waited for decades for their Government to acknowledge the \nsacrifices they made for their country and compensate them.\n  Unfortunately, 6 years since the passage of EEOICPA and in some cases \ndecades after their service to their country, very few of those Nevada \nTest Site Cold War veterans who have cancer have received compensation. \nIn fact, Nevada Test Site workers are receiving compensation at a rate \nlower than the national average, and many who have waited decades are \nbeing told that they have to wait longer. And many have already died \nwhile waiting for their compensation.\n  Last November, I sent a letter to President Bush asking him to \ninitiate this process himself. He still has not responded. However, his \nadministration is trying to rewrite the law via regulation and cut \nfunding to this program in order to delay compensation further and halt \nit for some workers altogether.\n  This is unacceptable.\n  That is why I am committed to ensuring that Nevada Test Site workers \nthrough 1993 are designated as a ``special exposure cohort.'' This will \nstreamline and speed up the recovery process for those workers.\n  My amendment would ensure employees and survivors of employees who \nworked at the Nevada Test Site through 1993 that they receive \ncompensation. They helped this country win the Cold War, sacrificing \ntheir personal health in the process, and after decades of waiting and \nsuffering, it is time the Government honored these sacrifices.\n  This bill would include within the special exposure cohort Nevada \nTest Site workers employed at the site from 1950 to 1993 who were \npresent during an atmospheric or underground nuclear test or performed \ndrillbacks, reentry, or cleanup work following such tests; present at \nan episodic event involving radiation release; or employed at Nevada \nTest Site for at least 250 workdays and in a job activity that was \nmonitored for exposure to ionizing radiation or worked in a job \nactivity that is or was comparable to a job that is, was, or should \nhave been monitored for exposure to ionizing radiation.\n  The Nevada Test Site has served, and continues to serve, as the \npremier research, testing, and development site for our nuclear defense \ncapabilities. The Nevada Test Site and its workers have been, and are, \nan essential and irreplaceable part of our Nation's defense \ncapabilities. This bill would honor the service of our atomic energy \nveterans and provide them with the compensation they deserve.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished ranking member \nfor his always cooperative efforts to move this bill along. I think we \nhave made progress on the bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Somehow or other, we did make progress.\n  Mr. WARNER. We did make progress. There will be a briefing in S-407 \ntomorrow with regard to operations in Iraq. Members of the Senate are \ninvited. I expect we will convene in the morning under an order later \nthis evening from the leadership, but we will be back on the bill for \nsome period of time tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, you can imagine the surprise, the \nconsternation of so many who woke up this morning and read on the front \npage of the Washington Post that the Prime Minister of Iraq suggested \nhe would grant amnesty to those who killed, maimed, hurt Americans. \nThis was just appalling.\n  I rise in support of the resolution offered by my colleagues from \nFlorida and New Jersey to, first, condemn those despicable remarks, \nand, second, to importune our President, President Bush, to make sure \nthe Prime Minister of Iraq retracts those remarks and registers the \nstrong disapproval of this Senate and of our Nation about what \nhappened.\n  To give those who shot at, sometimes killed, often maimed Americans a \nget-out-of-jail-free card is nothing short of despicable and a slap in \nthe face to all Americans. We have been told we are in Iraq for the \nnoblest of purposes--to bring peace and democracy. When the head of \nstate of that country says it is okay if you shot at American troops, \nit defies belief, it defies credibility.\n  The bottom line is our President stood with Prime Minister Maliki \njust a day or two ago and said he looked him in the eye and saw he was \na good man. President Bush must have missed something. Clearly, no one \ncan be a good man and state that it would be okay to give amnesty to \nthose who shot at our soldiers.\n  This is something which calls into question the whole endeavor in \nIraq. If this is the man we are relying on to get us out of the morass, \nto lead a government, and he is able to say that those who shot at our \nsoldiers should be given amnesty while those who shot at Iraqis should \nnot, something is dramatically wrong.\n  I will never forget when our President said he met President Putin, \nlooked in his eye, and found he was a good man. Yet we have had trouble \nwith President Putin ever since.\n  Something is desperately the matter. We need to do a few things. We \nneed to pass this resolution immediately and register our condemnation \nof the remarks.\n  President Bush, America is asking you to demand a retraction from the \nPrime Minister of Iraq of these despicable words or America can no \nlonger support sending soldiers to defend Iraqi freedom, to defend \nIraqi peace. How can we, our soldiers, and their families go over to \nIraq if, when they are shot at by renegade Iraqis, those Iraqis may be \ngiven amnesty and a pat on the back? That is despicable. It is so \nwrong.\n  I have spent time with families who have lost loved ones in Iraq. I \nhave spent hours seeing our soldiers off to victory, watching as their \nfamilies, their wives, their husbands, and their children, with tears \nin their eyes, watched them board the planes and the transports. For \nthese families, while their beloved men and women are over there, to \nread that the Prime Minister of Iraq would grant amnesty to someone who \ntried to kill that soldier who is bravely serving, how would they feel?\n  President Bush must get on the phone, if he has not already, with the \nIraqi Prime Minister and demand a retraction. If not, the American \npeople, and particularly the soldiers and their families, deserve an \nexplanation about what is going on over there. Again, to give a get-\nout-of-jail-free card to those who shoot at American soldiers while \nthose soldiers are trying to defend freedom and peace in Iraq boggles \nthe mind.\n  Another question: How can we rely on this man, this new Prime \nMinister Maliki, as an ally if he says this? My faith in him is shaken \nto the core. What will happen 2 months from now or 6 months from now?\n  This is a serious issue. I hope my colleagues will pay attention. It \nis serious\n\n[[Page S5939]]\n\nbecause of the honor of our soldiers. It is serious because it casts \ndoubt on the future of whatever plan there is in Iraq. It is serious \nmostly because it is an inhumane and nasty comment that negativizes all \nthe sacrifices our people have made.\n  I hope our President will act. He has been silent today. There is no \nclarification. There is no discussion of a phone call. There is no \nexpression of outrage from the White House. I hope that will change and \nchange soon. If it doesn't, it has to call into doubt everything we are \ntrying to do over there. This was not a happy day for what is going on \nin Iraq because of that awful newspaper story this morning and what it \nreported. I hope, I pray, things will change.\n  I certainly urge my colleagues to support unanimously the resolution \noffered by my colleague from Florida and my colleague from New Jersey, \nthat I am proud to support, asking for that change.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I understand the Senate is in morning \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send to the desk an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson], for himself and Mr. \n     Menendez, proposes an amendment numbered 4265.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of Congress that the Government of Iraq \nshould not grant amnesty to persons known to have attacked, killed, or \n       wounded members of the Armed Forces of the United States)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title XII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1209. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE GRANTING OF AMNESTY TO \n                   PERSONS KNOWN TO HAVE KILLED MEMBERS OF THE \n                   ARMED FORCES IN IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Armed Forces of the United States and coalition \n     military forces are serving heroically in Iraq to provide all \n     the people of Iraq a better future.\n       (2) The Armed Forces of the United States and coalition \n     military forces have served bravely in Iraq since the \n     beginning of military operations in March of 2003.\n       (3) More than 2,500 members of the Armed Forces of the \n     United States and members of coalition military forces have \n     been killed and more than 18,000 injured in operations to \n     bring peace and stability to all the people of Iraq.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Government of Iraq should not grant amnesty to \n     persons known to have attacked, killed, or wounded members of \n     the Armed Forces of the United States; and\n       (2) the President should immediately notify the Government \n     of Iraq that the Government of the United States strongly \n     opposes granting amnesty to persons who have attacked members \n     of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, a significant hubbub has \noccurred as a result of stories that have appeared in this morning's \nWashington Post that directly affect the defense posture of this \ncountry. It is stated in the Washington Post that the Prime Minister of \nIraq is expected to release within days a ``plan [that] is likely to \ninclude pardons for those who had attacked only U.S. troops'' in Iraq. \nThat is according to a top adviser.\n  As a matter of fact, the Prime Minister of Iraq is quoted as saying--\nand I will get to the quote--reconciliation could include an amnesty \nfor those ``who weren't involved in the shedding of Iraqi blood.'' \nErgo, there would be amnesty for those who would have been involved in \nthe shedding of American blood.\n  Now, it is possible--and this Senator hopes that something was lost \nin the translation because I cannot imagine the Prime Minister of Iraq \nturning on his heel away from American troops and suddenly--as he is \ntrying to bring about reconciliation in his country--trying to then say \nas part of that reconciliation we are going to give amnesty for anybody \nwho killed American men and women.\n  Well, naturally the Government of the United States should not stand \nfor this. That is why Senator Menendez and I are offering this \namendment to the Defense authorization bill, so that we can clearly set \nforth the policy--in this case, the sense of the Senate--that we will \nnot stand for this.\n  By the adoption of this sense of the Senate amendment, clearly our \nPresident should speak to the Iraqi Prime Minister, who he just spoke \nwith a couple of days ago, and he should speak with him immediately to \nget him to retract this statement. There should be no amnesty for those \nwho murder American troops. American troops continue to serve bravely, \nand they are fighting for the freedom of all Iraqis. So it brings us to \na point that is pretty clear. The Senate should go on record as having \nsaid that we repudiate that statement.\n  I will very clearly state what the Senate sense of the Congress is, \nthat the Government of Iraq should not grant amnesty to persons known \nto have attacked, killed, or wounded members of the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States and that the President should immediately notify the \nGovernment of Iraq that the Government of the United States strongly \nopposes granting amnesty to persons who have attacked members of the \nArmed Forces of the United States.\n  It is fairly straightforward. I could go on and on with comments. I \nam awaiting the arrival of Senator Menendez because I want him to make \nsome comments as well.\n  If you do what a number of us in this body have done in visiting \neither with the families of those who have borne the brunt of the \nfighting and have given the ultimate sacrifice or if you have visited \nwith those who return wounded and maimed, then there is no question \nthere should be no obfuscation as to the policy of granting amnesty to \nthose who have killed Americans.\n  I remember going back to the time that I served as a captain in the \nArmy, which was years and years ago. One of the most dread duties I had \nwas to be the officer who was given the task of notifying the loved \nones in the family of a service person who was killed. That, of course, \nis an exceptionally emotional event. And although it was decades ago, \nthose experiences are seared in my memory because of the\n\n[[Page S5923]]\n\ntrauma and the emotion when you meet with the grieving family of a \nloved one.\n  By the same token, there are over 18,000 of our service people who \nhave been wounded. And many of them, because the body armor is working \nand saving the vital organs, their lives are being saved, but they have \nbeen maimed. The extremities are often the part of the body that is the \ncasualty since the body armor is saving the vital organs. As a result, \nwhat we see is a lot of soldiers and sailors and Marines who come back, \nand they are just as optimistic as they can be in their outlook and yet \nthink of the life that they will live with the maiming that has \noccurred. Their life was spared, but their life is going to be clearly \ndifferent for the future.\n  Anyone who would dare suggest that in the formulation of a new \ngovernment of Iraq, which we, the United States Government, clearly \nsupport, anyone who would even contemplate that that government have a \npolicy that, as they try to build reconciliation, they are going to \ngrant amnesty to those who have killed Americans, as we say in the \nSouth, they have to have another thing coming, because we are not going \nto tolerate it.\n  I offer a simple resolution on behalf of the Senate. I hope it is not \ngoing to be controversial. I hope it will be accepted.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I had my fourth trip to Iraq recently \nand met with a number of leaders over there. I have been impressed with \nthem and have enjoyed them. I know Senator Nelson has also. He and I \nare the chair and ranking member respectively of the Strategic Forces \nSubcommittee. We have worked together on many important issues.\n  I wanted to say a couple things. First, the amendment he has is of \nvalue and will be something that can be accepted. I believe it should \nbe. You worry a little bit that maybe language difficulties come into \nplay in how miscommunications can occur. Even among those of us who \nspeak English together, we can have misunderstandings.\n  I was just handed a CNN interview today. It just came across the \nwire. It was by a reporter, Daryn Kagan, with the new national security \nadviser to Prime Minister Maliki in Iraq. He was asked about this very \nsubject because the reporter obviously felt some of the same concerns \nthe Senator from Florida raised. He said this to him.\n  The reporter:\n\n       Doctor, I know there's a big effort by your government in \n     your country to try to prevent civil war. And as a part of \n     that, the Washington Post reports today that your Prime \n     Minister is considering offering amnesty to Sunnis or to \n     others who perhaps attacked only U.S. troops. This, not \n     surprisingly, is causing great consternation here in the \n     U.S., even talking about it and being raised on the floor of \n     the U.S. Senate today. Is this, indeed, the case? Is your \n     government thinking about offering amnesty to those that \n     attacked only U.S. military?\n\n  This is Dr. Rubaie's reply:\n\n       This is not the case. I'm sorry to say that the prime \n     minister of Iraq has been misquoted and misunderstood. He did \n     not mean to give amnesty to those who killed Americans.\n       As a matter of fact, if you go there in his meeting with \n     the President Bush a couple of days ago, he looked the \n     president in the eye and he said, thank you very, very much \n     for liberating our country. Please thank the American wives \n     and American women and American mothers for the treasure and \n     blood they have invested in this country. It's well worth \n     investing, of liberating 30 million people in this country. \n     And we are ever so grateful.\n       And we will--the blood of the Iraqi soldier and the blood \n     of Iraqi civilian soldier is as sacred to us as the American \n     soldier. We are fighting the same war, we are fighting \n     together, and this is a joined responsibility. And we will \n     never give amnesty to those who have killed American soldiers \n     or killed Iraqi soldier or civilian.\n       What the prime minister is going to give amnesty to are \n     those who have not committed the crimes, rather they're \n     against Iraqis or coalition. Those who have--still carry arms \n     and they might have probably done some minor mistakes in \n     storing some arms or allowing some terrorists to stay \n     overnight or shelter, give shelter to some of these \n     insurgents. That's it. Basically, it's a goodwill gesture \n     he's extending to the Sunni community, to those who have \n     committed some mistakes in the past.\n\n  I don't know exactly how it all came about or how the comments were \nmade. Mr. Maliki is new to being Prime Minister. There are language \ndifficulties. I hope this reflects the firm view of the people of Iraq. \nI find it consistent with the responses I have had when I talked to the \nIraqi leadership.\n  I thank the Senator from Florida for raising the question. I am \npleased to see this very strong response from the national security \nadviser, Prime Minister Maliki's top adviser on national security.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. This Senator hopes, too, as I said at the \noutset of this Senator's remarks, that there is something lost in the \ntranslation, a mistake. But if there is, it is time for Prime Minister \nMaliki to step forward and clarify it. He can easily clarify it. But \nthat does not diminish the need for the sense of Congress that says \nthat the Government of Iraq should not grant amnesty to persons known \nto have attacked, killed, or wounded members of the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Florida.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \namendment Senator Nelson and I have offered on this issue of amnesty \nfor those who have killed American soldiers.\n  I know the latest statements that have come out. I hope that is \nultimately where the intention is. But it became very clear to me. I \nhope my colleagues have had the opportunity to read today's Washington \nPost article. It says: ``Iraq Amnesty Plan May Cover Attacks On U.S. \nMilitary.'' When you read the statements there, I have to be honest, \nthey were very unequivocal but unequivocal in a way that we could not \naccept as the U.S. Senate.\n  As I continued to reread this article, my anger grew. In the article \nit refers to the Prime Minister of Iraq acknowledging that \nreconciliation could include an amnesty for those ``who weren't \ninvolved in the shedding of Iraqi blood.'' That is where the quote \nends. There is not one single mention of American blood. Is that a \nmisinterpretation? Is that an oversight on the day on which we \nrecognize the loss of 2,500 American soldiers and the thousands and \nthousands who have shed their blood and come back injured? Is that an \noversight?\n  How about American blood and American lives, Mr. Prime Minister? Are \nyou willing to have reconciliation on the pool of American blood that \nhas been spilled to give your country and your people a chance for \nfreedom? Is there so little value to the 2,500 American lives that have \nbeen lost and the over 18,000 wounded on behalf of your country that \nyou wouldn't even think about including American lives when you were \ntalking about Iraqi lives? No way. No way.\n  Then I look at the article and look at the quotes attributed to Adnan \nKadhimi, a top adviser to Maliki. What does he say? He says:\n\n       The government has in mind somehow to do reconciliation, \n     and one way to do it is to offer an amnesty . . .\n\n  Then he goes on to talk about amnesty. He says:\n\n       We can see if somehow those who are so-called resistance \n     can be accepted if they have not been involved in any kind of \n     criminal behavior, such as killing innocent people or \n     damaging infrastructure, and even infrastructure, if it is \n     minor, will be part of it.\n\n  So we have this elaborate plan that talks about even infrastructure, \nbut doesn't talk about American lives. And then, when asked about \nclemency for those who attacked U.S. troops, he goes on to say--the \nadviser to the Prime Minister--that ``that's an area where we can see a \ngreen line.''\n  There is some sort of preliminary understanding between us and the \nU.S.-led multinational force in Iraq that there is ``a patriotic \nfeeling among the Iraqi youth and the belief that those attacks are \nlegitimate acts of resistance and defending their homeland. These \npeople will be pardoned definitely, I believe.''\n  Well, who in the U.S.-led multinational force has an understanding\n\n[[Page S5924]]\n\nwith the Iraqis that it is OK to offer amnesty for those who have \nkilled Americans? I would like to know the answer to that question.\n  I do believe very strongly that Senator Nelson's and my amendment \nshould be embraced by the entire Senate. We cannot allow to chance that \nthose statements attributed on the record--one directly by the Prime \nMinister and one directly by his top adviser--can be equivocated on. We \nhave to send a very strong message that we will not tolerate amnesty to \nthose who have taken the lives of American soldiers and for those who \nhave spilled American blood in defense of their country.\n  Just a little while ago, we had a moment of silence for the 2,500 \nAmerican soldiers who have died in Iraq. Let's do much more than have a \nmoment of silence in the face of these statements. Let's make sure the \ntaking of American lives can never be rewarded with amnesty. The Senate \nhas an opportunity to make a clear, unequivocal statement that it is \nunacceptable, and I believe that it should take this opportunity. It is \nnot only with a moment of silence that we show our respect, it is with \nour deeds that we show our respect.\n  Let the Senate act unanimously and speak with one voice to make it \nvery clear that this should not even be a thought on behalf of the \nIraqi Government. Then we will have honored the lives of those people, \nour fellow Americans, who gave the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of \ntheir country.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday afternoon, I placed a call to a \nNevada mother, Jennifer Laybourn. These calls are not easy; they are \nhard. Like many other Nevada mothers, she lost a boy, 19 years old, her \nson David, in Iraq. He was performing his duties as a soldier when he \nwas killed by an improvised explosive device. Again, he was 19 years \nold.\n  Nevada has lost 39 soldiers in Iraq. Nevada is a small, sparsely \npopulated State. Thirty-nine is a lot of funerals, a lot of sorrow for \nthose of us from Nevada. There is no way we can ever repay those 39 \nNevada heroes and their parents, siblings, family, and friends for \ntheir sacrifices. But we must always make sure their service is \nhonored, which is why today I compliment and applaud Senators Nelson \nfrom Florida and Menendez from New Jersey, and to express my complete \nshock and outrage that the Iraqi Prime Minister has even considered \ngranting amnesty to the insurgents who have killed our troops.\n  Up to this day, today, we have lost 2,500 soldiers in Iraq. The mere \nidea that this proposal would go forward is an insult to the brave \nNevadans who have died in the name of Iraqi freedom, and this doesn't \ntake into consideration those Nevadans who have been grievously wounded \nin battle. It is my hope the President will denounce this proposal \nimmediately--not wait for a retraction by the Iraqis but denounce it \nimmediately. We should remember that the majority of Nevadans killed in \nIraq were not killed in acts of warfare, as we historically have known \nwarfare. They were killed in acts of terror.\n  All of us who are committed to freedom and democracy should recognize \nthat their murders, 39 Nevadans, deserve justice. While I support \nreconciliation efforts to bring Iraqi political factions together, I \ndon't support amnesty for those who commit acts of terror against \nAmericans.\n  It sends the wrong signal to our troops, the wrong signal to the \nIraqis, and it sends the wrong signal to all Americans. It certainly \nsends a wrong signal to the insurgents who have now been given the \nmessage that they can attack our forces without consequence.\n  President Bush continually makes a point of saying that a free Iraq \nmeans the United States will have a friend in the Middle East. This \namnesty proposal is no sign of friendship; it is a sign of hostility \nwhich dishonors the sacrifice of our troops. Our troops deserve better. \nAgain, I urge the President to tell the new Iraqi Government to stand \ndown. America will not stand as our troops are dishonored in this way.\n  It seems so unfortunate that after the President's visit in Iraq, a \nday later this is floated through the Iraqi Government. It is too bad. \nWe deserve better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have listened with interest to my \ngood friend from Nevada. I hope Senators will be more supportive of our \nelected allies who are the Government of Iraq. The national security \nadviser for the Government of Iraq just said a few hours ago:\n\n       And we will never give amnesty to those who have killed \n     American soldiers or killed Iraqi soldiers or civilians.\n\n  So this notion of amnesty about a new, duly-elected Iraqi Government \nis a sideshow, an effort to divert our attention away from the core \nissue. Over in the House of Representatives today, they are having a \nmuch needed debate on the Iraq war. I had hoped that we would have that \ndebate in the Senate. I read that several of our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle were interested in offering an amendment that \nwould codify what they have said publicly, which is that the troops \nought to be out by the end of this year. I hope they will come down and \noffer that amendment. I hope we will have that debate. I think it is a \ngood time to have that debate.\n  It is a good time to remind the American people that it is no \naccident that we have not been attacked again since 9/11. Nobody would \nhave predicted that in the fall of 2001. If we asked for a show of \nhands in the Senate of how many Senators thought we would be attacked \nagain that year, I think every hand would have gone up. Certainly, the \nAmerican people expected another attack. By going on the offense, which \nthe President suggested we do shortly after 9/11, we have succeeded \ndramatically in the principal reason for advancing the war on \nterrorism, and that was to protect us at home. Almost 5 years later, we \nhave not been attacked again. While nobody will predict that we will \nnever be attacked again, it is noteworthy that we have not been \nattacked again. Believe me, it is not an accident. Why have we not been \nattacked again? Because we went into Afghanistan and into Iraq. We \nliberated 50 million people. A lot of the terrorists are dead. Several \nare at Guantanamo. Many are hiding in their caves. Yes, some are still \naround doing mischief in Baghdad rather than in Washington or New York.\n  This is the time we ought to be having the debate about Iraq \nstrategy. We are on the Defense authorization bill. Colleagues on the \nother side have said they were going to offer an amendment to advocate \nwithdrawal by the end of the year. Let's have that debate. I cannot \nthink of a better time.\n  Right now in Iraq, according to the latest AP story, since we were \nable to get Zarqawi last week, we have carried out 452 raids; 104 \ninsurgents were killed during those actions; we have discovered 28 \nsignificant arms caches; 255 of the raids were joint operations, with \n143 of them carried out by Iraqi forces alone; and the raids resulted \nin casualties of 759 anti-Iraqi elements. That is just in the last \nweek. So we have them on the run in Iraq.\n  Why would anybody want to suggest that we ought to run when we have \nthem on the run? But I think that is a legitimate debate. I hoped that \nwe would have it. It is 2:10. I have been waiting anxiously all day, \nassuming that we would have that amendment laid down by those on the \nother side of the aisle and get on about the debate. Maybe we should \nhave it in any event because it is time to step up and be counted.\n  Do we want to stay and finish the job and continue to protect America \nor do we want to send a message to the terrorists, when we have them on \nthe run, that we are about to cut and run and leave them there to their \nown devices? I don't know any responsible countries in the world at \nthis point, regardless of how they may have initially felt about the \ndecision to go into Iraq, that think it is a good idea to leave now--\nparticularly as we are making dramatic progress with their new \nconstitution; a new, fully staffed government; the death of the most \nnotorious terrorist in the country; these successful raids that have \nbeen carried out in the last week; and the effort underway to clean \nBaghdad out.\n  Why in the world would we want to say to those elements in Iraq, \nwhich want the country to be a haven for terrorism forever, that you \ncan count on\n\n[[Page S5925]]\n\nus to be out of here by the end of the year; that we are giving you \nadequate notice that we are leaving by the end of the year?\n  I see my colleague from Texas on the Senate floor. I wondered if he \nhad a question.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Yes. Will the Senator yield for a question at this point?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished majority whip, \nisn't the real difference between those of us who believe war is bad \nand must never be fought and those of us who believe that war is bad \nbut must sometimes be fought for the right reasons? What is the \nalternative to fighting the good fight that our troops are fighting in \nIraq now? I just ask whether the Senator has heard any alternatives \noffered by our friends on the other side of the aisle?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Texas, the only \nalternative I heard suggested, I have read about it in the press--I \nhave not heard it offered on the floor yet--is that we essentially give \nthe terrorists advance notice that we are going to be out of the \ncountry by the end of the year.\n  Look, we all hate, as the Senator from Texas indicated, to read \nreports of the death of any of our troops. We value human life in this \ncountry greatly. We do not, however, honor those who have given their \nlives in this great cause by giving up when we are making dramatic \nprogress. And it is also important to remember that while we value \nevery single life, we have lost fewer of our soldiers liberating \nAfghanistan and Iraq--50 million people liberated--than we lost on 9/11 \nin one morning or in Normandy during the invasion in World War II.\n  So while we value every life and we regret the loss of each soldier, \nit is extremely difficult to fight a war and lose absolutely no one.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for an \nadditional question, I ask the distinguished majority whip, what does \nhe believe the consequences in Iraq to be--and not just to Iraq, but to \nAmerica itself in terms of our own security--if we were to \nprecipitously draw down our forces and leave a void there that might \nthen be filled by enemies of our country and, indeed, terrorists akin \nto those who attacked our country on 9/11?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Texas, I think \none thing that is pretty obvious is the terrorists would have a haven \nfrom which to operate, once again, such as they had in Afghanistan for \na number of years prior to our clearing that out and giving those folks \nan opportunity to set up a democratic government. They would have a \nbase of operations right in the Middle East from which to attack our \nneighbors, to attack the Europeans, and probably attack us again. That \nwould be the consequence of cutting and running just on the heels of \nmaking dramatic forward progress in Iraq.\n  Mr. CORNYN. If the Senator will yield for one final question, I just \nwant to be sure I understood his earlier comments from the National \nSecurity Adviser for the Government of Iraq.\n  There had been some suggestion that the Iraqis were planning on \ngranting amnesty to those who had killed American soldiers. But if I \nunderstood the distinguished majority whip, the National Security \nAdviser said:\n\n       And we will never give amnesty to those who killed American \n     soldiers or who killed Iraqi soldiers or civilians.\n\n  If that language is true, that they would never do that, would the \nSenator care to venture a guess as to what the reason for this supposed \nsense of the Senate is to condemn some amnesty that will never be \ngiven?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It sounds to me, I answer my good friend from Texas, \nas some kind of diversion from the core issue we ought to be debating \nin the Senate, which is these suggestions that have been made by a \nnumber of our colleagues that we ought to have all the troops out by \nthe end of the year. It is time to have that debate in the Senate, not \na sense-of-the-Senate resolution about a proposal, as the Senator from \nTexas points out, that has been shot down today by the National \nSecurity Adviser in Iraq who, as the Senator from Texas indicated, said \ntoday:\n\n       And we will never give amnesty to those who have killed \n     American soldiers or who killed Iraqi soldiers or civilians.\n\n  What part of ``never give amnesty'' do our colleagues not understand?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID addressed the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe I have the floor. Would someone like to ask \na question?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to my friend from Florida for a question.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. This Senator clearly doesn't support pulling \nthe troops out of Iraq by the end of the year. This Senator offered an \namendment which is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment that the Government \nof Iraq should not grant amnesty to persons known to have attacked, \nkilled, or wounded members of the Armed Forces of the United States \nbased on this morning's story in this newspaper that indicates comments \nthat were made by the Prime Minister.\n  Is the Senator suggesting that he does not agree with the sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution being expressed in this amendment as laid down by \nthis Senator from Florida?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, answering the question, let me just \nrepeat what the National Security Adviser in Iraq has just said:\n\n     And we will never give amnesty to those who killed American \n     soldiers or who killed Iraqi soldiers or civilians.\n\n  Is it helpful to be passing resolutions condemning our allies in Iraq \nfor positions that the National Security Adviser says the Government \ndoesn't hold?\n  I am pleased to hear that my good friend from Florida opposes the \namendment that I hope will be offered later today that calls for an \nAmerican troop withdrawal by the end of the year. That is a debate I \nthought we were going to be having, rather than adopting resolutions \ncondemning one part of the Iraqi Government or another--the Iraqi \nGovernment, of course, being a great ally of the United States in the \nwar on terrorism.\n  Maybe that debate will occur later in the day, and I look forward to \nhearing from the Senator from Florida when we have that debate. I am \nsure he will be arguing the vote on that should be no, and the Senator \nfrom Florida, of course, will be entirely correct; that is exactly how \nthat amendment should be dealt with. I hope it will be defeated \noverwhelmingly.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Does the Senator have a question or is he seeking the \nfloor?\n  Mr. REID. I thought the Senator was finished.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Kentucky and my friend from \nTexas are involved in a debate that doesn't exist. The amendment before \nthe Senate, which will require a vote, is based on a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution offered by the Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson, and \nthe Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez. Here is what the matter \npending before the Senate now says:\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Armed Forces of the United States and coalition \n     military forces are serving heroically in Iraq to provide all \n     the people of Iraq a better future.\n       (2) The Armed Forces of the United States and coalition \n     military forces have served bravely in Iraq since the \n     beginning of military operations in March of 2003.\n       (3) More than 2,500 members of the Armed Forces of the \n     United States and members of the coalition forces have been \n     killed and more than 18,000 injured in operations to bring \n     peace and stability to all the people of Iraq.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that\n       (1) the Government of Iraq should not grant amnesty to \n     persons known who have attacked, killed, or wounded members \n     of the Armed forces of the United States; and\n       (2) the President should immediately notify the Government \n     of Iraq that the Government of the United States strongly \n     opposes granting amnesty to persons who have attacked members \n     of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n\n  That is very clear. That is what we are going to be called to vote \non.\n  Why do we have this before us? Because last night a man by the name \nof Adnan Ali al-Kadhimi, a top adviser to the Prime Minister of Iraq, \nsaid, among other things, the following:\n\n       Asked about clemency for those who attacked U.S. troops, he \n     said: ``That's an area\n\n[[Page S5926]]\n\n     where we can see a green line. There's some sort of \n     preliminary understanding between us and the MNF-I,'' the \n     U.S.-led Multinational Force-Iraq, ``that there is a \n     patriotic feeling among the Iraqi youth and the belief that \n     those attacks are legitimate acts of resistance and defending \n     their homeland. These people will be pardoned definitely.\n\n  That is the reason for this resolution. It is not about an amendment \nthat will be offered and there will be some other debate. It is about \nwhether the people of Iraq, who are running that government, should \npardon those people, grant amnesty to the people who have attacked our \nforces either through snipers, armed combat, or explosive devices. It \nis a simple vote.\n  Further, the man went on to say they would consider taking a look at \nIraqi forces who were attacked. They wouldn't necessarily be given \namnesty like those who attacked Americans.\n  That is a pretty clear vote, Mr. President. And that is the issue \nbefore the Senate, not some make-believe thing that will come at some \nlater time, maybe. The issue before the Senate today is whether this \nresolution will be approved, yes or no, based upon statements made by \nofficials in Iraq.\n  Someone has since then said: We don't like that. Good. We should \nadopt this resolution anyway. This is no attack on the Iraqi Government \nother than to say: Be careful, don't tread on our soldiers' graves.\n  This is the debate before us. I talked about a woman I called \nyesterday in Nevada who lost her 19-year-old son in Iraq, and to think \nthat anyone in the Iraqi Government--anyone in the Iraqi Government--\nshould pardon an Iraqi who killed this young man is repulsive. That is \nwhat the debate is about today. It is not about these terms that my \nfriends like to throw around--cut and run, tax and spend.\n  The American people know what is going on here. They know what is \ngoing on. We all want the Iraqi issue to proceed even though it is \ncosting us $2.5 billion a week, 2,500 dead soldiers, 18,000 or 20,000 \nwounded, a third of them grievously wounded, 20 percent of them coming \nback from Iraq with post-traumatic stress syndrome with a Veterans' \nAdministration that is underfunded.\n  That is what this is all about. It is not about some other issue. It \nis about whether the Government of Iraq, now or at any other time in \nthe future, should pardon people who harm our soldiers.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, what is the agreement at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the Nelson of Florida amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator from Georgia is here. I think he would like \nto offer an amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no unanimous consent request pending.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be set aside and that I be allowed to call up an amendment of \nmine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Then Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, since we are going to be on the amendment \nof the Senator from Florida for a few minutes, I have a couple other \nthoughts I would like to offer to our colleagues in response to those \noffered by the Democratic leader.\n  First of all, I don't know why, after the Iraqi officials have \ndisclaimed any intent whatsoever to offer amnesty to those who have \nkilled an American soldier, we would gratuitously offer a sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment to condemn them for doing something they said they are \nnot going to do, unless we are engaged more in gamesmanship than we are \nin working and passing serious legislation.\n  The comment was made earlier that perhaps this is just a diversion. I \nthought we were going to have a serious debate about whether we were \ngoing to bring our troops back home and on what kind of timetable we \nwere going to do that, whether it is some arbitrary timetable or, \ninstead, whether it is based on conditions on the ground. I thought \nthat was the kind of debate we were going to have today, not some sort \nof manufactured debate offering a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to \ndivert public attention from an issue that does not exist about this \namnesty that has been suggested which has been expressly disclaimed by \nthe Iraqi leadership.\n  My suggestion is that we move on to the serious work that the people \nof this country sent us here to do and not to engage in sideshows, \nwhich is clearly what this sense-of-the-Senate proposition is designed \nto do.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will be glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, since this Senator from Florida \nis the author of the amendment, I would recall, for the consideration \nof the distinguished Senator from Texas, that there is nothing in this \nresolution that says anything about condemnation of the Iraqi \nGovernment. It says: It is the sense of Congress that the Government of \nIraq should not grant amnesty to persons known to have attacked, \nkilled, or wounded members of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n  I would further call to the attention of the distinguished Senator \nthat the yeas and nays have been ordered on the amendment, and as soon \nas the leadership is ready to dispose of the amendment, we can vote.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I don't know what the question was, but \nlet me just respond to the distinguished Senator from Florida. It makes \nno sense for the Senate to shake its finger at the new Government of \nIraq and to criticize them, whether it is a condemnation or a criticism \nor an admonishment or whatever you want to call it, for something that \nthey have expressed that they have no intention of doing. I don't \ndispute from a procedural standpoint the Senator's right at some point, \nperhaps, to have a vote on the sense-of-the-Senate amendment, but I \njust question the wisdom of proceeding in this way when we are a nation \nat war.\n  We have done everything that we could to help the Iraqi people help \nthemselves, from training their security forces to encouraging them and \nhelping them in the development of a new government, something that is \nreally a miracle to behold, if you think about it. Three years ago, \nthey had a blood-thirsty dictator with his boot heel on the back of the \nneck of the Iraqi people, responsible for killing hundreds of thousands \nof Iraqis, and a threat to the entire world because of the potential \npartnerships with terrorists who might export their terror to places \nsuch as the United States. Why we would gratuitously take an occasion \nlike this, to distract us from the important business that we are \nabout, to criticize in one way, form, or fashion the new Iraqi \nGovernment which is just beginning to show that they are able to take \nthe first small steps toward self-determination and self-governance, \nwhy we would take this occasion to admonish them for something they \nhave expressly indicated no intention of doing is beyond me.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I know the Senator from Texas and I covered this a few \nmoments ago, but I would ask the Senator from Texas again if it is not \nthe case that the national security adviser to the Iraqi Government \njust this very day said the following: And we will never give amnesty \nto those who have killed American soldiers or killed Iraqi soldiers or \ncivilians?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would answer the distinguished majority \nwhip by saying, that is exactly the quotation. The same individuals \nwent on to say that who the Prime Minister is going to give amnesty to \nare those who have not committed the crimes, whether against Iraqis or \ncoalition forces. He went on to say, they might probably have done some \nminor mistakes in storing some arms or allowing some terrorist to stay \novernight or provided shelter. But he has expressly said: We will never \ngive amnesty to those who have killed American soldiers or killed Iraqi \nsoldiers or civilians.\n\n[[Page S5927]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator from Texas yield for an additional \nquestion?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Might it not be just as useful an exercise to try to \npass a resolution commending the Iraqi Government for the position they \nhave taken today with regard to this discussion of amnesty?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would answer the distinguished majority whip and say, I \nwould feel much better about something that was constructive and \nencouraging in assisting the Iraqi Government in their determination \nnot to give amnesty than I would in offering criticism where it appears \nto be gratuitous and where it is a distraction from the debate that I \nthink the American people would want us to have; that is, under what \nconditions do we want to leave Iraq, and are some of the proposals that \nsome of our colleagues on the Senate floor have made about setting \ntimetables, are those in the best interests of the American people or \ndo they endanger America by allowing perhaps those who are America's \nenemies, the enemies of all civilization, to plot and plan, and then \nuse that failed state as a platform to export their terrorist \nactivities to other parts of the world?\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4269 to Amendment No. 4265\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk to the \nunderlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4269 to amendment No. 4265.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require the withdrawal of United States Armed Forces from \n             Iraq and urge the convening of an Iraq summit)\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. UNITED STATES POLICY ON IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Withdrawal of Troops From Iraq.--\n       (1) Schedule for withdrawal.--The President shall reach an \n     agreement as soon as possible with the Government of Iraq on \n     a schedule for the withdrawal of United States combat troops \n     from Iraq by December 31, 2006, leaving only forces that are \n     critical to completing the mission of standing up Iraqi \n     security forces.\n       (2) Consultation with congress required.--The President \n     shall consult with Congress regarding such schedule and shall \n     present such withdrawal agreement to Congress immediately \n     upon the completion of the agreement.\n       (3) Maintenance of over-the-horizon troop presence.--The \n     President should maintain an over-the-horizon troop presence \n     to prosecute the war on terror and protect regional security \n     interests.\n       (b) Iraq Summit.--The President should convene a summit as \n     soon as possible that includes the leaders of the Government \n     of Iraq, leaders of the governments of each country bordering \n     Iraq, representatives of the Arab League, the Secretary \n     General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, \n     representatives of the European Union, and leaders of the \n     governments of each permanent member of the United Nations \n     Security Council, for the purpose of reaching a comprehensive \n     political agreement for Iraq that addresses fundamental \n     issues including federalism, oil revenues, the militias, \n     security guarantees, reconstruction, economic assistance, and \n     border security.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the amendment I have sent to the desk \nis the amendment that I believe the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKerry, had indicated he was going to be offering today so that we can \nhave an appropriate debate on this very important day about whether it \nis appropriate to withdraw American troops by the end of 2006. That is \nthe second-degree amendment that I just sent to the desk.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I don't have a dog in this fight, you \nmight say, but I have been listening to this debate, and I wonder about \nhistory. I wonder about the amendment of the Senator from Florida. I \nremember reading so clearly that after the War Between the States, the \nNorth lined up those from the South and took their guns and let some of \nthem take them home. I remember so well that after World War II, we \nwent through a process of trying to urge the governments involved in \nthe access to obtain a pledge from the former members of the military \nthat they would support the new democracy. That was amnesty.\n  In Japan, we certainly had a period under General MacArthur which was \nprobably the greatest period of amnesty that has ever been known. We \nhelped that country immediately to form a democracy and we never \nprosecuted the people who killed Americans.\n  I wonder seriously about what the Senator from Florida is doing by \ntelling this new fledgling democracy that they cannot go through the \nprocess of cleansing, go through the process of trying to get people \nwho were misguided, who were part of coalitions that they now are \nwilling to recant, if they are, to come forward and support this new \ndemocracy. What are we doing anyway on the floor of the Senate trying \nto tell the new democracy what they can and can't do? I didn't like \nthat story when I read it in the paper this morning, but I was happy to \nsee the new statement from the security people that clarified what they \nintend to do.\n  But the time will come, if that democracy is going to succeed, when \nthey are going to have to fold into their population those who are \nwilling now to give up terrorism, those who are willing to put aside \nthe activities of the past which led them to attack Americans as well \nas any other--there are 34 other nations over there. Are we saying just \nthose who did kill Americans, they can't get amnesty, but the rest of \nthem can?\n  What are we doing on the floor of the Senate trying to debate an \nissue as to how this country is going to come back together again? I am \nsort of appalled at it, really. I don't know if anyone else is. But it \nseems to me that we ought to do everything we can to encourage them to \nbring their people together, to forget the sins of the past, to forget \nthe terrorists of the past, and to pledge themselves to a new future of \ndemocracy and have people come forward and say: I am willing to support \nthis new democracy. And if they do, and demonstrate that they do after \na period of time, shouldn't they be recognized as being loyal citizens \nof the new democracy?\n  This is a debate that disturbs me. It disturbs me to think we are \nwilling to just seize the moment and make a political point--seize the \nmoment and make a point--and not think. It is time we started thinking \nabout how we can assure and take steps to help this country survive as \na democracy. If it becomes a democracy in that part of the world, it \nwill be a marvelous success, and I think it will lead to greater \nconsideration by other countries of liberalization of their concepts \nand giving the people more power.\n  I believe we ought to try to find some way to encourage that country, \nto demonstrate to those people who have been opposed to what we are \ntrying to do, that it is worthwhile for them and their children to come \nforward and support this democracy. And if that is amnesty, I am for \nit, I would be for it. And if those people who come forward and want to \nobtain a better life for their families in the future are willing to \nsupport that democracy--if they bear arms against our people, what is \nthe difference between those people who bore arms against the Union in \nthe War Between the States? What is the difference between the Germans \nand the Japanese and all the people we have forgiven?\n  When I left the war and came home, I had a deep hatred for the \nJapanese. Today, Mr. President, I have a granddaughter who is Japanese. \nI have a daughter-in-law who is Japanese. And her parents were involved \nin World War II. Now, are we to understand that time can heal, heal the \npain of the past?\n  I really wish the Senator from Florida would have the courage to \nwithdraw the amendment, just withdraw it and say it was a political \neffort. This is nothing but politics. I will vote to table it or vote \nagainst it in good conscience.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, will the Senator from Alaska yield for \na question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Is it not true, Mr. President, that today we have \nIraqis who are fighting the war against the\n\n[[Page S5928]]\n\ninsurgents who at one time fought against American troops and other \ncoalition troops as they were marching to Baghdad, who have now come \nover to our side and are doing one heck of a job of fighting alongside \nthe Americans and coalition forces, attacking and killing insurgents on \na daily basis?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is absolutely true. I would say to the Senator, I \nwas there and participated in the conversation with some of our \nmilitary people who were trying to find ways to help the Iraqis take \ninto the regular armed services some of those people who served in the \nRed Guard under Saddam Hussein. But they are willing to come forward \nnow and see that there is a country they would like to support. And if \nthey asked my opinion about that, I would say I would encourage it. I \nwould encourage it. I think if there is anything that can bring about \nstability in that country and have them support this new democracy, we \nshould encourage it.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, will the Senator from Alaska yield for \na question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will, Mr. President.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Alaska \nwould agree that as he goes through the history of countries that have \nbeen torn apart by war, including our country in the Civil War and \nJapan, after the Second World War, and the processes of reconciliation, \nwhether South Africa might not be an example. And is it not true that \nNelson Mandela's courage and his ability to create a process of \nreconciliation and forgiveness was a major factor in what has been a \npolitical miracle in Africa, where White and Black people now are able \nto live together in a democracy? Is not that process of reconciliation \none of the most admired processes in the last century? Nelson Mandela, \nthe winner of a Nobel Peace Prize just for this sort of gesture, would \nhe not fit into the series of examples that the Senator from Alaska \nused a few moments ago?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Absolutely. Mr. President, I would say it falls under \nthe concept of the Christian ethic. We are people who believe that you \ncan be converted. You can be a nonbeliever and then become a believer. \nWhat is the difference between that and amnesty, between those people \nwho may have been on the wrong side and then will come forward and \nbelong to this new government? And if they pledge and demonstrate to do \nit, I think it is up to the Iraqis to determine when and how they \nbecome full-fledged citizens of the new democracy.\n  But this amendment would have us say if they indicate they are going \nto grant amnesty to them, that is wrong. Amnesty ought to be a reward \nfor a pledge of cooperation and support. In this context, the military \ncontext, I think you can go through history and find time after time \nafter time where it was successful. But this amendment is a political \namendment, and I am tired of these political things coming on the \nfloor. The minute something comes in the paper, before it can even be \ncorrected by the country, we have an amendment saying, oh, here, let's \nforce the majority to vote against this amendment. Baloney. I am proud \nto vote against it.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I just came to the Chamber a few moments \nago. I understand the pending amendment is the Kerry amendment, and \nalthough I have not reviewed it in its entirety, I see that it reads \nthat the President----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader will be corrected; the \npending amendment is the McConnell amendment.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I understand. I will speak to the Kerry \namendment. I will read that amendment just so my colleagues will be \nclear what I am talking to. The amendment says:\n\n       The President shall reach an agreement as soon as possible \n     with the Government of Iraq on a schedule for the withdrawal \n     of United States combat troops from Iraq by December 31, \n     2006, leaving only forces that are critical to completing the \n     mission of standing up Iraqi security forces.\n\n  As I look at this amendment, as we evaluate it, I think the first \nthing we must do is say: What if we did cut and run? I know we hear \nthat discussion of a rapid withdrawal. In many ways, I am glad this \namendment has come to the floor, that it has been put on the floor by \nSenator Kerry. I think we do have to grasp what is at stake, and if we \nwithdraw from Iraq----\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend.\n  Does the majority leader yield for a parliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. FRIST. I will shortly. Let me finish my statement because I think \nit is important to look at the issue that has been put on the floor. I \nwill be very brief. Then we can do the parliamentary inquiries back and \nforth.\n  If we withdraw from Iraq before the Iraqi Government and the Iraqi \npeople are capable of defending their new democracy, I am absolutely \nconvinced that the terrorists would see this as a vindication, a \nvindication of their strategy of intimidation, of confrontation, and \nthat they would take that vindication and continue to challenge us \nelsewhere in the world--in Afghanistan, in other countries in the \nregion, overseas, and, indeed, right here at home. If we were to cut \nand run, the violence in Iraq would certainly increase.\n  We know there is violence there, and we know how tough it is on our \ntroops who are there and the American people who watch this violence. \nBut I am absolutely convinced that if we cut and run, violence will \nincrease in Iraq, terrorists will increase their attacks on the Iraqi \npeople and on that brandnew Iraqi Government. Clearly, it has only been \n5 days. Clearly, the Government itself is not able, completely alone, \nto defend itself. Chaos would result. Bloody civil war would result. \nTerrorists and rival militia would tear the country apart. They would \nkill thousands of innocent Iraqis, and that terrorism would spread \nthrough that region, around the world, and, indeed, I believe right \nhere at home.\n  The unity of Iraq that we celebrated on this floor, the unity of Iraq \nthat has resulted from a democratically elected government through \nthree elections, would be destroyed, would be torn apart; sectarian \nviolence would ensue and would explode. It would split the country \napart into segments that, yes, probably would be controlled, but they \nwould be controlled by terrorists, ethnic militias, tribal militias. I \nam convinced parts of Iraq would become safe havens for terrorists who \nhave spelled out--and we think of the letters and the words of \nZarqawi--who have spelled out what their intentions are in terms of us \nhere, right here in the United States.\n  I believe terrorist bases in Iraq would threaten Middle East \nsecurity. Although it may be a secondary issue, we do know that energy \nsupplies ultimately would be disrupted. We have seen supply go down, \ndemand go up, and a disruption of energy sources all over the country. \nIndeed, I believe it would result in a skyrocketing of gas prices in \nthis country.\n  The terrorists affiliated with bin Laden and Zarqawi have stated in \ncrystal clear terms what their objectives are, their aim of \noverthrowing moderate governments.\n  Given the presence in Iraq of many of Saddam Hussein's former weapons \nscientists--remember Saddam Hussein? Forget about weapons of mass \ndestruction right now, but we actually know that Saddam Hussein and his \nscientists have developed weapons of mass destruction, chemical and \nbiological weapons, and he has used both of those on his own people. \nThose scientists are still around. If we cut and run, I believe those \nscientists once again will pursue and will have the freedom to pursue \nthose weapons of mass destruction: saran gas, anthrax, biological \nweapons.\n  President Bush has repeatedly stated that the potential combination \nof terrorism and weapons of mass destruction does pose the greatest \nthreats to the United States. I believe cutting and running would allow \nthose weapons of mass destruction and that terrorism intent to come \nback together, to endanger the people of the region but also the people \nright here in the United States of America.\n  In some ways, I am glad this amendment has come to the floor, this \nmodification of the amendment. It is clear that those calling for an \nearly withdrawal of American troops from Iraq failed to fully play out, \nto fully understand the potential implications of\n\n[[Page S5929]]\n\nleaving prematurely. Cutting and running before Iraq can really defend \nitself threatens the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority reader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, two things that do not exist in Iraq and \nhave not are weapons of mass destruction and cutting and running.\n  This is the McConnell amendment. It is not the Kerry amendment. \nPeople have the right to file amendments.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I reoffer my motion to table. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. Is \nthere a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman).

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KERRY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my understanding is the Senate now turns \nto the measure by the Senator from Florida, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. I understand that. I ask the indulgence of the Senator if, \nafter he has finished his business, I could just have a moment.\n  Mr. WARNER. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, what is ``a moment''?\n  If the Senator propounds a unanimous consent for an amount of time, I \nwould be glad to not object. I wonder what a moment is?\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to have 5 minutes.\n  I thought the concept of ``a moment'' was not incomprehensible even \nin the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, following that, I ask unanimous consent \nthe Senator from Arizona be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me just say if I may, earlier today, \nthe distinguished chairman and manager of this legislation came to me \nand asked me if I was prepared to put my amendment in. I told him then, \nas he knows, that I said no, because a number of Members were talking, \nas is the right of the Senator with respect to any amendment filed. So \nthe chairman, the manager, was on notice that we were, in fact, in the \nprocess of working on this.\n  I voted no on this because any Senator reserves that right, No. 1; \nand No. 2, this is a debate I look forward to. This is a debate I want \nto have on the floor of the Senate. This is a debate we will have on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  I resent the fact that some Senators think the business of the United \nStates is somehow better done by calling up another Senator's \namendment, that may or may not be the language presented to the Senate, \nand having a fictitious vote on it. It is not unlike the war itself \nwhere we are in the third war: The first being about Saddam Hussein and \nweapons of mass destruction; the second being about al-Qaida; and the \nthird, now, the sectarian violence.\n  I look forward to having a debate on the floor of the Senate. But I \nlook forward to having a debate on the language that I, as a U.S. \nSenator, present to the Senate in an amendment that bears my name and \nthe name of other Senators that joined me. That has always been the \nprerogative of the Senator, and it is one that ought to be protected.\n  I respect and I understand completely what the distinguished minority \nleader did. He did it in consultation with me. I think it was the \nappropriate measure for him to take to protect my interests and the \ninterests of those on our side.\n  The Senate ought to give a more appropriate kind of seriousness of \npurpose to debate of this kind of consequence. This will be the first \ntime in some time that we will have debated this issue. I suggest some \nof my colleagues go back and reread the resolution which gave the \nPresident the authority to go into Iraq. There is nothing in that \nresolution that gives authority for what we are doing today.\n  So, in effect, this is a war of evolution, a war of transformation, \nand it deserves the kind of serious debate that it will get next week \nin the Senate.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator from Arizona yield to me for a few \nminutes?\n  Mr. McCAIN. For a moment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts and I did \nhave a brief conversation just before the conclusion of the vote in the \nmiddle of the noon hour. I, in an effort to try and keep momentum on \nthe bill, did inquire of the desire to move forward with his amendment. \nI only conveyed his response to me, which was not at this time--he was \nin consultation with colleagues--to my distinguished ranking member, \nadvising him we best look at other amendments to keep the momentum \ngoing forward. I then departed for the memorial services at the \nDepartment of Defense honoring those who lost their lives on 9/11. And, \ntherefore, when I arrived back we were in the middle of the debate that \nhas been described by the Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank you for the recognition, and I \nthank the distinguished chairman for his explanation of what just \ntranspired.\n  Mr. President, I rise to discuss the pending Nelson amendment. I \nthink it is very important that, first of all, we try not to react on \nthe floor of the Senate to the headlines that appear in the morning \npaper--whether they happen to be totally accurate or not.\n  The second thing I want to point out is that all of us--all of us--\nare pained\n\n[[Page S5930]]\n\nwhen a brave American is killed in this terrible, long, drawn-out \nconflict which has divided America and cost us so much in American \nblood and treasure. All of us--no matter where we stand on this \nconflict--feel the utmost sorrow and regret at the loss or wounding of \na single brave, young American man or woman. So this debate is \ncertainly not about the enormous sacrifice that has already been made \nand probably will be made in the course of this conflict.\n  But I think we have to be realistic about the way out of this \nconflict, the way out we have seen time after time throughout history \nof other conflicts, especially those that in many respects are civil \nwars.\n  Nelson Mandela probably had the greatest reason to seek revenge and \nfull accounting not only for the years of imprisonment and mistreatment \nhe personally received but also because of the hundreds if not \nthousands of his countrymen who were brutalized, mistreated, kept in \ninferior status, and, in some cases, even massacred by the minority \ngovernment that ruled his country.\n  When Nelson Mandela was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, it was not \nonly because of his bravery and courage while he underwent unspeakable \nunpleasantries and indignities as a prisoner--I believe the number was \n27 years--but primarily because Nelson Mandela realized he had to knit \nand heal the wounds that had so badly scarred his nation.\n  Nelson Mandela, in the spirit of forgiveness, for the good of his \ncountry, put his personal injuries aside because he realized the only \nway his nation could move forward is to put those terrible things that \nhappened behind him.\n  We also saw terrible things happen in El Salvador's civil war. Jose \nNapoleon Duarte, a name that some of us have forgotten, was elected \nPresident of the country. And he did two things. He vigorously \nprosecuted the insurgency, and then he reached out his hand to the \ninsurgents because he knew if they did not forgive and even try to \nforget, that nation would continue a bloodletting that had afflicted it \nfor a long period of time.\n  In Colombia, the President of Colombia has just attested that 40,000 \npeople--paramilitaries and guerrillas who, again, have carried out \nthese same kinds of attacks and murder and mayhem in their country--\nhave laid down their arms because of an amnesty program that he has \nextended to them.\n  I could go on about many of the conflicts in our history. But the \nfact is that wars end when enemies stop killing each other. After Pearl \nHarbor we talked with the Japanese. After years of war in Vietnam, we \ntalked to the North Vietnamese in Paris. Time and again, there reaches \na point where enemies must if not be forgiven at least be included, as \nhostilities come to an end and peace begins.\n  Our brave men and women are working with Iraqis to build a new \ncountry, and by co-opting the insurgents, perhaps we can save the lives \nand fortunes of our own and those who we support.\n  Things are very difficult in Iraq. And we are angered when we hear of \nan IED that blows up and kills and maims innocent Americans. We are \nsometimes driven to frustration and incredible--incredible--sorrow when \nwe hear of the loss of these precious young men and women.\n  But we also know that the insurgency does not end until the \ninsurgents stop fighting. And the sooner the new Prime Minister, freely \nelected--freely elected--Mr. Maliki, is able to bring his country back \ntogether, the sooner we will find peace, and the sooner Americans can \nbe withdrawn, and the sooner American casualties will end.\n  I am confident the amendment by the Senator from Florida amendment is \nwell-meaning, and I understand the intentions behind it. But I think it \nis important we look back and recognize that not only do times change, \nas in the case of Vietnam--our Secretary of Defense just in the last \nweek visited Vietnam, as we have renewed our relationships, as we have \nhealed the wounds of the Vietnam war, and moved forward in partnership \nwith the Vietnamese.\n  Mr. President, from a personal standpoint, there are a few Vietnamese \nI would very much like to see again, people I may not have the most \npeaceful intentions toward. But the reality is--the reality is--we must \nheal the wounds of war if we are going to unite a nation and move \nforward. And that is the case with Iraq, as it has been with almost \nevery other nation in history.\n  I finally add, as a footnote, I am not sure we here in the U.S. \nSenate should be dictating to the leaders of Iraq how they should \nconduct their affairs as they, the freely elected leaders of that \nnation, attempt to bring about peace and reconciliation in their \nnation.\n  But the larger issue here is, I believe, that our goal is to bring an \nend to the conflict as quickly as possible in Iraq. If that means, in \nreturn for laying down their arms, that some are allowed an amnesty or \nallowed to reenter the society of Iraq, in a peaceful manner, in a \nproductive manner, as has happened in South Africa, El Salvador--and is \nhappening in Colombia--and many other insurgencies throughout history, \nthen I think we should welcome it. And as we place our confidence in \nthe new Government of Iraq, perhaps we should give them some latitude.\n\n  I would also like to add, by the way, that that quote in the press \nmay not have been exactly right as to who might be eligible for amnesty \nand who might not. At least that should be cleared up. But it doesn't \nobscure the fact that the freely elected government, that we support, \nof the country of Iraq is now reaching out to attempt to end the \nfighting and the conflict. I do not think we should be micro managing \nthat from the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  I am sure that the enemies we faced in World War II--who the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee fought against in that great \nwar--that there was a time where we had reconciliation with our enemies \non both sides of the Atlantic.\n  Now, were people who were guilty of specific war crimes brought to \ntrial? Absolutely, and punished, in some cases, to the point of \nexecution. But those who fought against us are clearly now our friends.\n  So I hope that we would understand that this amendment would not be \nhelpful to the process of peace, would not be an endorsement of the \nfreely elected leaders of the country of Iraq, and might even serve, in \nan unintended fashion, as an impediment to a process of peaceful \nreconciliation in Iraq rather than helping it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my very good and longtime friend, \nwe have known each other since the closing months of the war in Vietnam \nwhen I was Secretary and he was serving in our naval service and \nreturned. So I just think sometimes of the great fortune of this body \nto have men such as John McCain, Daniel Inouye, and Ted Stevens, and \nothers, who have experience firsthand. I do not claim that same \nexperience that these men had in the mortal combat of the wars.\n  Senator McCain recounts the history of our Nation very accurately; \nthat is, when the conflicts are over, it has always been the stature \nand the greatness of this Nation to bind the wounds of war and to move \nforward with peace.\n  I say to the Senator from Florida, I have just handed him the \ncorrections that are now in the press, corrected by the national \nsecurity adviser to the new Prime Minister of Iraq, in which it is very \nexplicit that there was an error in translation. Some misfortune. But \nhe sets it forth here with absolute clarity, and I think that I would \nwant to state for my colleagues exactly what he said. He said the \nfollowing--and he said it, I presume, with the full knowledge of the \nPrime Minister.\n  He said: We thank--and the quote is--``the American wives and \nAmerican women and American mothers for the treasure and the blood they \nhave invested in this country . . . of liberating 30 million people in \nthis country. And we are ever so grateful.''\n  And further, he affirmed their position of the government that they \n``will never give amnesty to those who have killed American soldiers or \nkilled Iraqi soldiers or civilians.''\n  It seems to me that puts to rest, as my colleague from Arizona said, \nthis issue. And I wonder if the Senator would consider the withdrawal \nof his amendment to obviate the necessity on our side to take other \nsteps, and let us move forward with the bill.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n\n[[Page S5931]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Does the Senator from Florida have the floor \nor----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator from Florida has been seeking \nrecognition for the past hour and has not been able to speak.\n  Will the Senator from Virginia, the distinguished chairman of our \nArmed Services Committee, agree to a unanimous consent request that the \nSenator from Florida would be allowed to speak on this issue \nimmediately after the comments of the Senator from Virginia?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am delighted to accommodate my \ncolleague. I would hope we could discourse this matter in the \ntraditional way of a colloquy, but if you want the exclusive right to \nthe floor--if that is your desire--then I yield the floor, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Is that your desire?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. It is.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, what I understand of the \nparliamentary procedure is that the majority will offer an additional \namendment that will be a side-by-side and be voted upon, and the Senate \ncan make its choice.\n  In the case of the amendment that is being proffered by the \nmajority--indeed, in the copy that has been represented to me as being \nthe accurate one--it will recite the comments of the gentleman to whom \nin Iraq the chairman has just referred.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, that is the \nnational security adviser.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. And that side-by-side amendment will state \nthat the national security adviser of Iraq, on today, had ``thanked \n`the American wives and American women and American mothers for the \ntreasure and the blood they have invested in the country . . . of \nliberating 30 million people in this country . . . And we are ever so \ngrateful.' '' And that affirms their position that they will never give \namnesty to those who would kill American soldiers or those who have \nkilled Iraqi soldiers or civilians. I think that is all well and good. \nThis Senator would certainly intend to vote yes on that side-by-side \namendment.\n\n  The reason the Senator from Florida has been seeking recognition for \nthe last hour is this Senator's amendment has been characterized in \nways that defy what the amendment says. The amendment clearly said that \nit is the sense of Congress that ``the Government of Iraq should not \ngrant amnesty to persons known to have attacked, killed, or wounded \nmembers of the Armed Forces of the United States; and the President \nshould immediately notify the Government of Iraq that the Government of \nthe United States strongly opposes granting amnesty to persons who have \nattacked members of the Armed Forces of the United States.''\n  That is what the amendment says.\n  What this has been causing is a brouhaha because of something being \nread in to a simple little amendment that came as a result of a front-\npage story today in the Washington Post in which a top adviser to the \nPrime Minister, Mr. Adnan Ali al-Kadhimi, who happens to be the former \nchief of staff to the previous Prime Minister, a high-ranking official \nin the Dawa Party, he is the one who is quoted in the article as going \non to say, when asked about clemency for those who attacked U.S. \ntroops:\n\n       That's an area where we can see a green line. There's some \n     sort of preliminary understanding between us and the MNF-1 \n     that there is a patriotic feeling among Iraqi youth and the \n     belief that those attacks are legitimate acts of resistance \n     and defending their homeland. These people will be pardoned \n     definitely, I believe.\n\n  Now, it is very enlightening that the national security adviser has \ntried to clarify Prime Minister Maliki's comments. The Prime Minister \ncan certainly clarify his own comments. But here we have a high-ranking \nIraqi official who is quoted on the front page of the paper today as \nsaying amnesty for those who would have killed American men and women.\n  This Senator's name has been invoked by several speakers, including \nthe distinguished Senator from Alaska, who I have the greatest and \nutmost respect for, in talking about the reconciliation process as if \nthis were contrary to the reconciliation process. The Senator from \nAlaska was even quoting the reconciliation that took place after the \nCivil War, on which we all agree. The Senator from Alaska was talking \nabout the reconciliation that has taken place in South Africa, of which \nwe all agree, even talk of the reconciliation that took place with \nregard to Germany and Japan. But that didn't stop those who were \nresponsible for war crimes and the killings of Americans to be brought \nto justice; in other words, not to have amnesty granted for them. That \nwas not the case in South Africa where they had a process that those \nwho did those criminal acts were brought to justice. That was certainly \nnot the case in Germany after World War II where those who had \ncommitted those atrocities were brought to justice.\n  It just simply, in the opinion of this Senator, ought to be that a \npolicy of the very government that we have helped and have liberated a \npeople should not be amnesty for those who have killed Americans. How \nmuch more simple could it be? Yet I suspect, as others have implied \npolitics, I suspect politics has a way of taking over and starting to \nmake something seem like it isn't. It certainly wasn't the intention of \nthis Senator.\n  As I understand, my wonderful chairman of the committee is going to \noffer a second-degree or will offer another amendment that will be a \nside by side amendment to that which I have offered, and we can vote \nfor both. It would be the intention of this Senator to vote for both.\n  I said at the outset of my remarks, the first thing out of my mouth \nwhen I offered the amendment was, I hope there was something lost in \nthe translation of what was reported in this morning's Post.\n  I don't understand--or maybe I do--all the brouhaha that has occurred \nover the course of the last 2 hours on such a simple amendment as \nsaying that it is the sense of Congress that the Government of Iraq \nshould not grant amnesty to persons known to have attacked, killed, or \nwounded members of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first I would like to say to my colleague, \nwe have had a very strong, fervent and heartfelt debate, not a brouhaha \nby any definition of the use of those terms. We have heard from two of \nthe most respected combat veterans currently serving in this Chamber. \nIt was not in the nature of a brouhaha. They were simply reciting the \nhistory of this great Republic since its inception as to how it has \ndealt with adversaries in the several conflicts that we have had.\n  I first say to the Senator, I hope that you will reconsider the use \nof that term.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, of course.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. This Senator is referring to the rhubarb that \nhas occurred for the last 2 hours on the floor, where statements were \nmade about my amendment that mischaracterized the amendment and that \nfurther, then, allowed a totally different issue, an issue on which \nthis Senator agrees with the chairman of the committee, not withdrawing \nall of the troops by the end of the year.\n  The Senator can characterize it as he would like. This Senator will \ncharacterize it as he would like.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I so note his comments.\n  Again, addressing the Senator's amendment, it clearly, in my \njudgment, restricts in some respects the recognition that this is a \nsovereign government in Iraq today, in the hands of a duly elected \nPrime Minister and others, and that this amendment could well be \nconstrued as restricting what they can and cannot do. That was so \neloquently stated by Senator McCain. I wondered if the Senator would \ncare to try and revise the amendment so it is consistent with the \nlongstanding practices of our country with respect to our adversaries, \nin some way to recognize that it is not in conflict with that?\n\n[[Page S5932]]\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. If the Senator would like, we could have a \nquorum call and discuss exactly that matter.\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, as a coauthor of the amendment of my \ndistinguished colleague from Florida, I hope he will continue to pursue \nhis amendment. It is incredibly important to send a very clear message \non behalf of the United States about what is and is not acceptable as \nit relates to the future of our young men and women in the armed \nservices of the United States.\n  We are told on the Senate floor: Don't react to the morning's papers. \nBut, in fact, it is our reaction to it that brings about a \nclarification from the National Security Adviser of the Iraqi \nGovernment that moves us in the direction which should have been the \nposition of the Iraqi Government from the outset.\n  I am amazed how I have heard some of my colleagues in this Chamber \nstretch and twist and turn to justify a position which even now the \nIraqi Government supposedly rejects. We had some history lessons about \namnesty. Most of those were as it related to civil wars. But I remember \nhow President Bush started this engagement. He said to the Nation: You \nare either with the terrorists or you are with us.\n  As I listened to my colleagues suggest that amnesty is something we \nshould actually be in favor of for those who have committed acts \nagainst the Armed Forces of the United States, for those who have \nkilled American soldiers, for those who have wounded American soldiers, \nit is beyond my imagination that there are Members of the Senate who \nbelieve that is the signal we want to send throughout the world. What \nhappened to ``you are either with the terrorists or you are with us''? \nWhat happened to making it very clear that our men and women are not \nsitting ducks for those who think they could ultimately seek to kill \nthem and then walk away and get amnesty? I don't understand--if a \nterrorist survives our arrest or attack, does that mean that if they \nsuddenly see the light, we will say: Yes, it is up to the Iraqis to \ngive them amnesty? Is that the message the Senate wants to send?\n  It is beyond my imagination--we hear about the challenges of \ndemocracy in Iraq. Democracy is about the rule of law, and then \nultimately we would set aside the rule of law and say you can kill \nAmerican soldiers and we will have no say. Imagine that as the Nation \nsends its sons and daughters abroad to shed their blood and to give \ntheir lives, that we should have no say? That is what we heard on the \nSenate floor, that we should have no say, that we should let the Iraqi \nGovernment pursue even a course which might include amnesty against \nthose who kill American soldiers. That is the message we want to send? \nI think not.\n  The essence of the message we want to send is that we do not believe \nand do not accept and are outraged by the fact that there may have even \nbeen a consideration that there could be amnesty for those who killed \nAmerican soldiers but not amnesty for those who killed Iraqis. That is \nthe world's worst message we could send. We have to send a very clear \nmessage that we will not allow our sons and daughters to have their \nlives lost, and that their lives are not expendable and cannot be \nbartered for amnesty. That is what Senator Nelson is trying to do with \nthis amendment. Why it is so difficult for the Senate to come together \nin a bipartisan effort to send that very clear message, not only in \nIraq but throughout the world, that this is simply not a standard which \nis acceptable, is beyond belief.\n  This amendment is very clear, it is very simple, but it is also very \npowerful. It is a message that you can't kill our soldiers and walk \naway with impunity. Truly, you are either with the terrorists or you \nare with us, but you can't be a terrorist and then suddenly get caught, \nsee the light, and then ultimately walk away with amnesty. That would \nbe a horrible message for the Senate to send.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMcConnell now be recognized, that the pending amendments be set aside, \nand that Senator McConnell then offer an amendment which is relevant to \nthe Nelson amendment; provided further that if and when the McConnell \nand Nelson amendments are scheduled for votes--that would be sometime \nnext week--the McConnell amendment would be voted on first. Finally, I \nask unanimous consent that following the offering of the amendment, \nSenator Chambliss be recognized in order to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have no objection.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might amend the UC to delete the last \nsentence which reads:\n\n       Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following the \n     offering of the amendment, Senator Chambliss be recognized in \n     order to offer an amendment.\n\n  I ask that sentence be dropped.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, I have an amendment to provide compensation \nfor civilian veterans of the Cold War who contracted cancer as a result \nof their work at our nuclear weapons facilities.\n  My amendment will ensure that employees who worked at the Nevada Test \nSite during the years of above- and below-ground nuclear weapons \ntesting and suffer from radiation-induced cancers as a result of that \nwork finally receive the compensation they deserve. These Cold War \nveterans sacrificed their health and well-being for their country. We \ncan wait no longer to acknowledge those sacrifices and to try, in some \nsmall way, to compensate for the cancers they have suffered as a result \nof their service to their country.\n  U.S. citizens have served their country working in facilities \nproducing and testing nuclear weapons and engaging in other atomic \nenergy defense activities that served as a deterrent during the Cold \nWar. Many of these workers were exposed to cancer-causing levels of \nradiation and placed in harm's way by the Department of Energy and \ncontractors, subcontractors, and vendors of the Department without the \nknowledge and consent of the workers, without adequate radiation \nmonitoring, and without necessary protections from internal or external \noccupational radiation exposures.\n  Six years ago, I worked with President Clinton to pass The Energy \nEmployees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000, \nEEOICPA, to ensure fairness and equity for the men and women who \nperformed duties uniquely related to the nuclear weapons production and \ntesting programs by establishing a program that would provide timely, \nuniform, and adequate compensation for 22 specified radiation-related \ncancers.\n  Research by the Department of Energy, the National Institute for \nOccupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, NIOSH's contractors, the \nPresident's Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health, and \ncongressional committees indicates that workers were not adequately \nmonitored for internal or external exposures to ionizing radiation to \nwhich the workers were exposed and records were not maintained, are not \nreliable, are incomplete, or fail to indicate the radioactive isotopes \nto which workers were exposed.\n  Because of the inequities posed by the factors described above and \nthe resulting harm to the workers, EEOICPA has an expedited process for \ngroups of workers whose radiation dose cannot be estimated with \nsufficient accuracy or whose dose cannot be estimated in a timely \nmanner. These workers are placed into a Special Exposure Cohort, SEC. \nWorkers in an SEC do not have to go through the dose reconstruction \nprocess, which can take years and be extremely difficult as these \nworkers are often unable to produce information because it was or is \nclassified.\n  Congress has already legislatively designated classes of atomic \nenergy veterans at the Paducah, Kentucky, Portsmouth, Ohio, Oak Ridge \nK-25, Tennessee, and the Amchitka Island, AK, sites as members of the \nspecial exposure cohort under EEOICPA. Amchitka Island was designated \nbecause three underground nuclear tests were conducted on the Island.\n  Nevada Test Site workers deserve the same designation.\n  I and many other Nevadans remember watching explosions at the Nevada \nTest Site. We were struck with awe and wonder at the power and strength \nof these explosions. Little did we know that there was another side to \nthose atomic tests--the exposure of men and women working at the site \nto cancer-causing substances. Now, hundreds, perhaps thousands, of \nthese Cold War veterans face deadly cancers. Many have already passed \naway.\n  The contribution of the State of Nevada to the security of the United \nStates throughout the Cold War and since has been unparalleled. In \n1950, President Harry S. Truman designated what would later be called \nthe Nevada Test Site as the Nation's nuclear proving grounds and, a \nmonth later, the first atmospheric test at the Nevada Test Site was \ndetonated. The United States conducted 100 aboveground and 828 \nunderground nuclear tests at the Nevada Test Site from 1951 to 1992. \nOut of the 1054 nuclear tests conducted in the United States, 928, or \n88 percent, were conducted at the Nevada Test Site.\n\n[[Page S5938]]\n\n  Unfortunately, Nevada Test Site workers, despite having worked with \nsignificant amounts of radioactive materials and having known exposures \nleading to serious health effects, have been denied compensation under \nEEOICPA as a result of flawed calculations based on records that are \nincomplete or in error as well as the use of faulty assumptions and \nincorrect models.\n  It has become evident that it is not feasible to estimate with \nsufficient accuracy the radiation dose received by employees at the \nDepartment of Energy facility in Nevada known as Nevada Test Site at \nall in some cases and in others in a timely manner. In fact, the \nadministration has admitted that it cannot construct internal radiation \ndose for workers employed on the site during the aboveground test and \nyet is still balking at full compensation for all of these workers. \nThere are many reasons for this, including inadequate monitoring, \nincomplete radionuclide lists, and DOE's ignoring nearly a dozen tests \nconducted at the site that vented. Because of these problems, Nevada \nTest Site workers have been denied compensation under the act, some of \nwhich have waited for decades for their Government to acknowledge the \nsacrifices they made for their country and compensate them.\n  Unfortunately, 6 years since the passage of EEOICPA and in some cases \ndecades after their service to their country, very few of those Nevada \nTest Site Cold War veterans who have cancer have received compensation. \nIn fact, Nevada Test Site workers are receiving compensation at a rate \nlower than the national average, and many who have waited decades are \nbeing told that they have to wait longer. And many have already died \nwhile waiting for their compensation.\n  Last November, I sent a letter to President Bush asking him to \ninitiate this process himself. He still has not responded. However, his \nadministration is trying to rewrite the law via regulation and cut \nfunding to this program in order to delay compensation further and halt \nit for some workers altogether.\n  This is unacceptable.\n  That is why I am committed to ensuring that Nevada Test Site workers \nthrough 1993 are designated as a ``special exposure cohort.'' This will \nstreamline and speed up the recovery process for those workers.\n  My amendment would ensure employees and survivors of employees who \nworked at the Nevada Test Site through 1993 that they receive \ncompensation. They helped this country win the Cold War, sacrificing \ntheir personal health in the process, and after decades of waiting and \nsuffering, it is time the Government honored these sacrifices.\n  This bill would include within the special exposure cohort Nevada \nTest Site workers employed at the site from 1950 to 1993 who were \npresent during an atmospheric or underground nuclear test or performed \ndrillbacks, reentry, or cleanup work following such tests; present at \nan episodic event involving radiation release; or employed at Nevada \nTest Site for at least 250 workdays and in a job activity that was \nmonitored for exposure to ionizing radiation or worked in a job \nactivity that is or was comparable to a job that is, was, or should \nhave been monitored for exposure to ionizing radiation.\n  The Nevada Test Site has served, and continues to serve, as the \npremier research, testing, and development site for our nuclear defense \ncapabilities. The Nevada Test Site and its workers have been, and are, \nan essential and irreplaceable part of our Nation's defense \ncapabilities. This bill would honor the service of our atomic energy \nveterans and provide them with the compensation they deserve.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished ranking member \nfor his always cooperative efforts to move this bill along. I think we \nhave made progress on the bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Somehow or other, we did make progress.\n  Mr. WARNER. We did make progress. There will be a briefing in S-407 \ntomorrow with regard to operations in Iraq. Members of the Senate are \ninvited. I expect we will convene in the morning under an order later \nthis evening from the leadership, but we will be back on the bill for \nsome period of time tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, you can imagine the surprise, the \nconsternation of so many who woke up this morning and read on the front \npage of the Washington Post that the Prime Minister of Iraq suggested \nhe would grant amnesty to those who killed, maimed, hurt Americans. \nThis was just appalling.\n  I rise in support of the resolution offered by my colleagues from \nFlorida and New Jersey to, first, condemn those despicable remarks, \nand, second, to importune our President, President Bush, to make sure \nthe Prime Minister of Iraq retracts those remarks and registers the \nstrong disapproval of this Senate and of our Nation about what \nhappened.\n  To give those who shot at, sometimes killed, often maimed Americans a \nget-out-of-jail-free card is nothing short of despicable and a slap in \nthe face to all Americans. We have been told we are in Iraq for the \nnoblest of purposes--to bring peace and democracy. When the head of \nstate of that country says it is okay if you shot at American troops, \nit defies belief, it defies credibility.\n  The bottom line is our President stood with Prime Minister Maliki \njust a day or two ago and said he looked him in the eye and saw he was \na good man. President Bush must have missed something. Clearly, no one \ncan be a good man and state that it would be okay to give amnesty to \nthose who shot at our soldiers.\n  This is something which calls into question the whole endeavor in \nIraq. If this is the man we are relying on to get us out of the morass, \nto lead a government, and he is able to say that those who shot at our \nsoldiers should be given amnesty while those who shot at Iraqis should \nnot, something is dramatically wrong.\n  I will never forget when our President said he met President Putin, \nlooked in his eye, and found he was a good man. Yet we have had trouble \nwith President Putin ever since.\n  Something is desperately the matter. We need to do a few things. We \nneed to pass this resolution immediately and register our condemnation \nof the remarks.\n  President Bush, America is asking you to demand a retraction from the \nPrime Minister of Iraq of these despicable words or America can no \nlonger support sending soldiers to defend Iraqi freedom, to defend \nIraqi peace. How can we, our soldiers, and their families go over to \nIraq if, when they are shot at by renegade Iraqis, those Iraqis may be \ngiven amnesty and a pat on the back? That is despicable. It is so \nwrong.\n  I have spent time with families who have lost loved ones in Iraq. I \nhave spent hours seeing our soldiers off to victory, watching as their \nfamilies, their wives, their husbands, and their children, with tears \nin their eyes, watched them board the planes and the transports. For \nthese families, while their beloved men and women are over there, to \nread that the Prime Minister of Iraq would grant amnesty to someone who \ntried to kill that soldier who is bravely serving, how would they feel?\n  President Bush must get on the phone, if he has not already, with the \nIraqi Prime Minister and demand a retraction. If not, the American \npeople, and particularly the soldiers and their families, deserve an \nexplanation about what is going on over there. Again, to give a get-\nout-of-jail-free card to those who shoot at American soldiers while \nthose soldiers are trying to defend freedom and peace in Iraq boggles \nthe mind.\n  Another question: How can we rely on this man, this new Prime \nMinister Maliki, as an ally if he says this? My faith in him is shaken \nto the core. What will happen 2 months from now or 6 months from now?\n  This is a serious issue. I hope my colleagues will pay attention. It \nis serious\n\n[[Page S5939]]\n\nbecause of the honor of our soldiers. It is serious because it casts \ndoubt on the future of whatever plan there is in Iraq. It is serious \nmostly because it is an inhumane and nasty comment that negativizes all \nthe sacrifices our people have made.\n  I hope our President will act. He has been silent today. There is no \nclarification. There is no discussion of a phone call. There is no \nexpression of outrage from the White House. I hope that will change and \nchange soon. If it doesn't, it has to call into doubt everything we are \ntrying to do over there. This was not a happy day for what is going on \nin Iraq because of that awful newspaper story this morning and what it \nreported. I hope, I pray, things will change.\n  I certainly urge my colleagues to support unanimously the resolution \noffered by my colleague from Florida and my colleague from New Jersey, \nthat I am proud to support, asking for that change.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I understand the Senate is in morning \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business with 10-minute \ngrants.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/15/senate-section/article/S5939-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5939-S5940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SENATOR ROBERT C. BYRD\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, earlier in the week, on Monday to be \nexact, Senator Robert C. Byrd, our very distinguished colleague, became \nthe longest serving Senator in the history of the U.S. Senate. It is \nobviously a moment to celebrate and recognize his accomplishments in \nthe service of the Nation. Our celebration is tempered only by the fact \nthat his beloved wife Erma, with whom he spent nearly 69 years of \nmarriage, passed away recently.\n  I want to join my colleagues who, in the course of this week, have \npaid tribute to the senior Senator from West Virginia. Senator Byrd \nthis year completes his eighth Senate term, having first been elected \nto the Senate in 1958. Prior to that, he served 6 years in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives and, before that, 6 years in the West Virginia \nlegislature.\n  In his now almost 48 years in the U.S. Senate, he has held an \nextraordinary range of committee and subcommittee assignments and has \nserved in leadership positions as secretary of the majority conference, \nmajority whip, minority leader, majority leader, and President pro \ntempore. His vote has been recorded on nearly 99 percent of all Senate \nrollcalls since 1958. Indeed, he has cast far more votes than any other \nSenator in our Nation's history.\n  It is not for his longevity, however, that we honor our colleague, \nthe senior Senator from West Virginia. It is, rather, the manner in \nwhich he has faithfully carried out his responsibilities as a U.S. \nSenator and his abiding dedication to the Constitution of the United \nStates and the system of government it created. No Member of the U.S. \nCongress understands better than Senator Byrd the Constitution's role \nin framing our lives as Americans. As he has written:\n\n       Only the Constitution's genius affords our people the \n     powers and prerogatives that truly keep us a free nation, \n     most centrally through maintenance of the checks and balances \n     and separation of powers.\n\n  Over many years, while vigorously and effectively representing the \npeople of West Virginia, Senator Byrd has made the study, exposition, \nand defense of the Constitution his life's work. In so doing, he has \nspoken not only for West Virginians but for us all. If, as Senator Byrd \nhas said, the Senate functions as the central pillar of our \nconstitutional system, then I would say that Senator Byrd himself is \nthe central pillar of the Senate. His commitment to the Senate and its \nhistory, its custom, and procedures is equaled only by his commitment \nto the State of West Virginia, our Nation, and our Constitution.\n  No one is more keenly attuned to the Senate's role in assuring the \nproper functioning of our constitutional system. He has studied the \nSenate's origins in Roman and British history. He has, as he puts it, \n``ponder[ed] the lives of the framers and founders and set down a four-\nvolume history of the Senate.'' And he has read the journals and other \nwritings of the early Members of this body. He has mastered the Senate \nrules to a degree that few, if any, others have ever attained. Even in \nthe most contentious debates, Senator Robert C. Byrd remains a steady \nvoice for courtesy and civility. Indeed, his is the voice of courtesy \nand civility.\n  Senator Byrd begins his autobiography, ``Child of the Appalachian \nCoalfields,'' with an observation by William James:\n\n       The best use of life is to invest it in something which \n     will outlast life.\n\n  This certainly is what he has done.\n  It was not foreordained that he would some day be a U.S. Senator from \nWest Virginia. Born in North Carolina, he lost his mother in the great \ninfluenza epidemic of 1918, when he was a year old, whereupon he was \nadopted by an aunt and her husband and moved with them to West \nVirginia. His adopted father was a coal miner, and he grew up in \ncompany towns. He was an excellent student, valedictorian of his high \nschool class, ``a self-styled sort of somebody,'' one high school \nteacher later said, but his prospects were few. As another teacher \nobserved:\n\n       Knowing the background and how hard it would be to move out \n     from that background, I picture him as being an office man or \n     a scrip clerk at one of the mines.\n\n  In those years of the Great Depression, there was obviously no money \nfor college. Robert Byrd took what jobs he could get: Shop clerk, \nbutcher, a welder in a Baltimore shipyard during World War II. We were \nhonored to have had him in our State.\n  In 1946, he was elected to the first of three terms in the State \nlegislature. Of the decision to run for office he has said:\n\n       I grew up in a state where we didn't have much hope. I \n     wanted to help my people and give them hope . . .\n\n  He did not abandon his hopes of continuing his education. Upon his \nelection to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1952, he enrolled in \nlaw school. When he learned that he would be denied a law degree \nbecause he had never received a college degree in the law school in \nwhich he had enrolled, he transferred to the Washington College of Law \nat American University where he went to night classes for 10 years and \nreceived his law degree cum laude in 1963--a remarkable achievement. By \nthat time he had been a Senator from West Virginia for 5 years. Robert \nByrd is the only person ever to have served in either House of Congress \nto begin and complete a law degree while serving.\n  Twenty years later, the College of Law at American University honored \nhim as the First Distinguished Fellow of the honor society established \nby the late dean of the college, a most fitting tribute. Eleven years \nlater, in 1994, he received his bachelor's degree in political science \nfrom Marshall University in recognition of the credits accumulated \nthere and other places over a period of many years.\n  Of the many awards he has received in the course of his long and \ndistinguished career, Senator Byrd has said that none means more to him \nthan the tribute from the Governor and legislature of his State in \nnaming him ``West Virginian of the 20th Century.''\n  As his colleague here in the Senate for the past 30 years and as one \nwho has the deepest respect and admiration for him and cherishes his \ncounsel and friendship, I submit that he will be remembered not only \nfor his service to his State but for the courage and dedication and \ntenacity he has shown and continues to show every day in the service of \nour Nation. It is a privilege to be his colleague here in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, it is indeed a privilege and honor for me \nto join my colleagues in commemorating and honoring my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Robert C. Byrd, on the occasion of his becoming the \nlongest serving Senator in the history of our country, passing the old \nmark of 17,326 days on June 12, 2006. The fact that West Virginians \nhave returned him to the\n\n[[Page S5940]]\n\nSenate in eight prior elections speaks volumes of the love and \naffection and respect they feel for him as their Senator who serves \nthem most effectively.\n  When I first came to the Senate in 1990 from the other side of the \nCapitol, Senator Byrd was one of the first Senators I met with to get \nadvice and counsel, which he generously shared with me. Of course, he \ngave me a copy of a pocket edition of the Constitution, the document \nupon which our country is based and one that is ever-present in his \npocket. Over the years, he has been most generous with his friendships, \nand indeed I feel a sense of kinship and aloha with him. In Hawaii, \nthis feeling of kinship is often referred to as being part of the \nohana, or family, and used with love and endearment.\n  With stewards like Senator Robert C. Byrd, we can rest assured that \nour country is in good hands. I look forward to his continuing \nfriendship and serving with him for many years to come.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I do want to talk for a minute about \nSenator Byrd and recognize he has set a record in the Senate, as many \nof my colleagues have noted on the floor.\n  He marked his l7,327th day in office yesterday and became the longest \nserving Senator in history. That is truly a remarkable accomplishment, \nand I personally have many fond memories of working with Senator Byrd \nand look forward to many more.\n  I remember well when I came here as a freshman Senator 13 \\1/2\\ years \nago. Senator Byrd at the time brought in all of us freshmen Senators to \nsit across from him in his very important office and looked down at us \nand told us that we would be presiding, as is the Presiding Officer \ntoday, and told us about our responsibilities and made it very clear he \nwould be watching from his office, and if we were reading any other \nmaterial or talking to anyone, it would be noted.\n  I certainly did remember that during the many hours I spent in the \nPresiding Officer's chair because I knew he was watching. But I think \nit was a simple reminder to all of us as to the importance of the \noffice we hold here and the respect we have to have for our colleagues.\n  I remember as well that he invited me to lunch several months later \nwith the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Hatfield, a Republican, to sit down \nand talk with me about the responsibilities I had as a Senator. And I \nwas so impressed sitting in the room with Senator Byrd and Senator \nHatfield, never in my life expecting to have that kind of opportunity. \nAt that meeting they impressed upon me the importance of working across \nthe aisle and respect for the minority and how important everybody's \nvoice is here. It was an important lesson and one I think we all should \nbe reminded of more often.\n  But just that simple act of inviting me to lunch with two incredible \nleaders in the Senate is a memory I hold dear, and I thank my colleague \nfor doing that.\n  But, frankly, I think what I most will remember Senator Byrd for--and \nis a good reminder to all of us, too--is several years ago when my \nhusband came out here to Washington, DC--he lives in Washington State. \nI go home every weekend. But he came out here because it was our \nwedding anniversary, and instead of me having to fly home, he flew out \nhere. He was coming up the steps of the Capitol, and I met him as \nSenator Byrd was walking out to his car.\n  Senator Byrd saw my husband, and he said: Welcome. Nice to have you \nhere at this end of the country. What brings you here?\n  And my husband said: Well, it is our wedding anniversary.\n  And Senator Byrd, who, as we well know, lost his beloved wife just a \nfew short weeks ago, was about to celebrate I think it was his 67th \nwedding anniversary. He looked at my husband and said: Which \nanniversary is this?\n  And my husband said: It is our 32nd.\n  Senator Byrd paused and said: Well, it is a good start.\n  I think the message of that is important for all of us in our \neveryday lives, in our responsibilities as spouses, and as Senators, to \nremember it is a good start every day, and you can't rest on your \nlaurels and think back: Well, we have done this for 32 years. The next \n32 will be easy. Every day you have to come out and work hard at \nwhatever role you are in at the time.\n  I certainly say to my good friend, Senator Byrd, how much I respect \nhim and admire him. And today, as he marks his l7,328th day in office, \nI say to him: It is a good start.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee).

REHNQUIST\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today the Chief Justice and associate \nJustices of the Supreme Court held a memorial observance honoring Chief \nJustice William H. Rehnquist. It was a really grand event. I am sorry I \ncould not be there the whole time.\n  At 2 p.m., resolutions in tribute to the Chief Justice were presented \nfor consideration by members of the Supreme Court bar. There were \npresentations made by the Solicitor General and by the Attorney General \nof the United States during a special sitting of the Court, which \ncommenced at 3:15 p.m. this afternoon. Following that, the Supreme \nCourt held a reception for friends of the former Chief Justice.\n  I think one of the great joys of my life was to be able to say that I \nwas a long-time friend of our former Chief Justice. He and I met here \nas young lawyers the year we got out of law school. We were very \nfriendly. As a matter of fact, we double-dated during those days. And \nas the years went on, as I went to Alaska and came back as U.S. \nAttorney and had various other functions, we kept in touch. We were \ndivided by a continent, but we remained friends.\n  Years later, when I came to the Senate, he was with the Department of \nJustice. I can say it was one of the longest friendships I have had, \nand I was sad when he passed away. I am here really to ask that the \nSenate review some of the comments made about my friend and former \nChief Justice of the United States.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the schedule of the Supreme Court for \ntoday, Thursday, June 15, 2006, and also the resolution of the bar of \nthe Supreme Court of the United States in gratitude and appreciation \nfor the life, work, and service of Chief Justice William H.

Rehnquist, June 15, 2006\n\n       Today, the members of the Bar of the Supreme Court honor \n     the life and legacy of a\n\n[[Page S5941]]\n\n     gifted lawyer, a selfless public servant, and a treasured \n     teacher, mentor, and friend. Those who knew William Rehnquist \n     will remember him as one who, in the words of Justice Oliver \n     Wendell Holmes, ``lived greatly in the law.'' To his credit, \n     however, Bill Rehnquist cared less about being ``great'' than \n     about doing and living well. As President George W. Bush \n     remarked on the occasion of his funeral, ``to work beside \n     William Rehnquist was to learn how a wise man looks at the \n     law and how a good man looks at life.''\n       Rehnquist was born in Wisconsin, on October 1, 1924, the \n     son of a paper salesman and a homemaker who also worked as a \n     translator. Christened William Donald Rehnquist at birth, the \n     future Chief Justice changed his middle name to Hubbs--a \n     family name--in high school. His mother, Rehnquist later \n     explained, had once met a numerologist on a train, and Mrs. \n     Rehnquist was advised that her son would enjoy great success \n     in life if his middle name were changed to begin with the \n     letter ``H.''\n       Rehnquist was raised in Shorewood, a Milwaukee suburb on \n     Lake Michigan. Early on, he displayed his love of the \n     friendly wager, betting his sister on a Memorial Day weekend \n     that he could dive into the lake more often than she. He won, \n     and contracted pneumonia in the bargain. Rehnquist graduated \n     from high school in 1942, and after a year at Kenyon College, \n     he joined the United States Army Air Corps. Consistent with \n     his life-long interest in the weather--a fascination that \n     would be the stuff of many jokes and memories among his \n     friends and law clerks--he signed up for a premeteorology \n     program. He was reassigned to work as a weather observer \n     when, as he later put it, ``the brass realized that someone \n     had mistakenly added a zero to the number of weather \n     forecasters that would be needed.'' His war-time service took \n     him not only to Oklahoma, New Mexico, Texas, New Jersey, and \n     Illinois, but also to more exotic destinations such as \n     Casablanca, Marrakesh, Tripoli, and Cairo.\n       Rehnquist's assignment in North Africa impressed upon him \n     that ``if you lived in the right place, you didn't have to \n     shovel snow for four months a year.'' Accordingly, after \n     discharging from the service as a sergeant, he headed west, \n     and matriculated as an undergraduate at Stanford University \n     in 1946. There, he supplemented the financial assistance he \n     received through the G.I. Bill with odd jobs, including \n     working as a ``hasher'' in the dormitory of his future \n     colleague, Sandra Day.\n       After graduation, Rehnquist thought he wanted to become a \n     professor of political science, so he studied government for \n     a year at Harvard and earned his master's degree. But he \n     later decided against continuing his graduate work, and \n     instead took a standardized occupational examination, the \n     results of which suggested that he might thrive as a lawyer. \n     He then returned to the west, and to Stanford's law school, \n     where he flourished. As he recalled, some fifty years later, \n     in his typically understated manner, ``the law curriculum \n     came more easily to me than it did to some others.'' His \n     friend and classmate, the future Justice O'Connor, was more \n     definitive: ``[H]e quickly rose to the top of the class and, \n     frankly, was head and shoulders above all the rest of us in \n     terms of sheer legal talent and ability.''\n       One of Rehnquist's professors had been a law clerk for \n     Justice Robert Jackson, and thought highly enough of \n     Rehnquist to recommend him to Jackson as a prospective clerk. \n     When Jackson hired the young lawyer, the position was \n     Rehnquist's first ``honest-to-goodness job as a graduate \n     lawyer'' and, more significantly, his first exposure to the \n     institution to which he would dedicate thirty-three years of \n     his professional life. Rehnquist later described his \n     clerkship during the 1951 and 1952 Terms as ``one of the most \n     rewarding experiences of my life.'' His time in Washington \n     proved doubly rewarding, for during this period he began \n     dating Natalie ``Nan'' Cornell, a San Diegan he had met at \n     Stanford. They started with ``Thursday night'' dates, until \n     Nan was convinced that she liked the young lawyer enough to \n     move on to Saturdays.\n       After the clerkship, Rehnquist kept in his study a \n     photograph of his boss, inscribed ``To William Rehnquist, \n     with the friendship and esteem of Robert H. Jackson.'' Later, \n     as a member of the Court, Rehnquis would make the same \n     inscription for his law clerks, recounting Jackson's remark, \n     ``You may not be impressed, but it might impress your \n     clients.'' Perhaps most telling, the personal attributes that \n     the young William Rehnquist admired most in Justice Jackson \n     include many of the same qualities his own law clerks \n     remember and appreciate about him: ``[H]is own ego or view of \n     his own capacities was never unduly elevated by any of the \n     successes which he achieved''; he ``never succumbed to the \n     temptation,'' so common in Washington, to ``become . . . \n     isolated in high public office''; and ``[h]e did not have to \n     read the view of some particular columnist, commentator, or \n     editorial writer in order to know what he thought about a \n     particular factual situation.''\n       Characteristically unconventional, Rehnquist passed up \n     opportunities at lucrative East Coast law firms. He thought \n     California too big and too populated, and decided to look for \n     a home in the southwestern United States, hoping to find the \n     American equivalent of the North African climate he so \n     enjoyed. Rehnquist married his beloved Nan in August 1953, \n     and the couple ultimately settled on Phoenix. He later told \n     his law clerks that the descent into Phoenix, without air \n     conditioning, in his 1941 Studebaker, was like ``driving into \n     Hell.''\n       He was the ninth lawyer at one of the ``large'' law firms \n     in Phoenix, and he was paid $300 per month. Two years later, \n     hoping for more courtroom experience, he opened a two-lawyer \n     office, and for a time, Rehnquist took whatever clients came \n     in the door. He volunteered to represent indigent criminal \n     defendants in federal court, but suffered a series of \n     defeats, leading a federal prosecutor to joke that a cell \n     block at Leavenworth had been named after Rehnquist. He \n     delighted in telling stories of his practice before eccentric \n     jurists in Arizona's remote ``cow counties.'' A favorite \n     involved the representation of state legislators in a lawsuit \n     adverse to the state's attorney general, during which \n     Rehnquist made pointed reference to an inconsistency between \n     his adversary's litigating position and previous public \n     statements. Summoned to the judge's chambers after oral \n     argument, young Rehnquist remembered that his ``heart almost \n     stopped'' as he prepared himself for a trip to the woodshed, \n     only to hear the jurist from Cochise County remark: ``I was \n     sure glad to see you tee off on the Attorney General in your \n     argument on that last motion. He's a worthless son-of-a-\n     bitch, and the sooner this state gets rid of him the better \n     off we'll all be.''\n       During his 16 years of private practice, Rehnquist \n     represented a broad array of clients and handled a wide range \n     of litigation matters. He was also active in politics, \n     providing legal advice and draft speeches for the 1964 \n     Goldwater presidential campaign. He wrote op-ed pieces and \n     bar journal articles, spoke before bar and civic groups, \n     served as President of the Maricopa County Bar Association, \n     and was a favorite at continuing legal education seminars. He \n     spent four years as the town attorney for Paradise Valley, \n     was special counsel to the Arizona Department of Welfare, \n     served as Special Assistant Attorney General for the Arizona \n     Highway Department, and represented the State Bar of Arizona \n     in attorney disciplinary matters. In 1971, the Board of \n     Governors of the State Bar of Arizona praised Rehnquist for \n     having ``continually demonstrated the very highest degree of \n     professional competence and integrity and devotion to the \n     ends of justice.''\n       Through it all, Rehnquist maintained a balanced life. He \n     would work typically from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., then close \n     the law books, and go home for a family dinner. He and Nan \n     were blessed with three children, Jim, Janet, and Nancy. Even \n     when Rehnquist was in trial, the family dinner was sacred, \n     and he would either bring work home or make the ten-minute \n     drive back to the office after dinner. Keeping a schedule \n     that was unusual then, and virtually unheard of today, for \n     the family of a top litigator, the Rehnquists managed to take \n     a month's vacation every year. Rehnquist especially loved \n     camping vacations across the West, visits to a small cabin \n     in the Bradshaw Mountains of Arizona, and driving fast on \n     country roads, telling his children that a double yellow \n     line was ``just a recommendation.'' The Rehnquists also \n     maintained an active family-oriented social life, \n     including bridge, charades, cookouts, and hikes. Later in \n     life, Rehnquist reminisced that he ``had the good fortune \n     to realize long ago, instinctively, what I now see very \n     clearly--and that is that time is a wasting asset.'' \n     Rehnquist spent abundant time with his wife and young \n     children, ``not out of any great sense of duty, but just \n     because I enjoyed it so much.''\n       After the 1968 presidential election, Rehnquist's \n     involvement in politics resulted in an opportunity to serve \n     as Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel \n     in the United States Department of Justice. Upon receiving \n     word of this job offer, Rehnquist visited the Phoenix public \n     library to see what he could learn about the office, and he \n     was sufficiently intrigued by what he read to accept the \n     position. The family moved to Washington, but Rehnquist never \n     lost his deep affection for Arizona or his fond memories of \n     these earlier years. He left Phoenix, as he put it, ``very \n     much richer for the experience, but having accumulated very \n     little of the world's goods.''\n       As Assistant Attorney General, Rehnquist was ``in effect, \n     the President's lawyer's lawyer,'' as President Richard Nixon \n     would later say. Rehnquist served in the Justice Department \n     during challenging years in the midst of the Vietnam War. He \n     helped to hone the position of the Executive Branch on \n     delicate legal issues and carried the message of the \n     Administration around the country in numerous public \n     appearances. He discharged his responsibilities with such \n     great distinction that President Nixon would declare that \n     ``among the thousands of able lawyers who serve in the \n     Federal Government, he rates at the very top as a \n     constitutional lawyer and as a legal scholar.'' When Justice \n     John Marshall Harlan II retired in 1971, Rehnquist was the \n     President's choice to be the 100th Associate Justice of the \n     Supreme Court.\n       Confirmed in 1972 at age 47, Rehnquist was one of the \n     youngest Justices of the Supreme Court in modem history. Yet \n     his views on important matters of constitutional law were \n     remarkably well formed. Rehnquist once wrote that ``[p]roof \n     that a Justice's mind at the time he joined the Court was a \n     complete tabula rasa in the area of constitutional \n     adjudication would be evidence of lack of qualification, not \n     lack of bias,'' and Rehnquist's mind certainly was no blank \n     slate.\n       In 1976, he summed up his judicial philosophy in an essay \n     entitled, ``The Notion of a\n\n[[Page S5942]]\n\n     Living Constitution.'' He rejected the notion that judges \n     ``are a small group of fortunately situated people with a \n     roving commission to second-guess Congress, state \n     legislatures, and state and federal administrative officers \n     concerning what is best for the country.'' That elected \n     representatives had not solved a particular social problem, \n     he wrote, did not necessarily authorize the federal judiciary \n     to act: ``Surely the Constitution does not put either the \n     legislative branch or the executive branch in the position of \n     a television quiz show contestant so that when a given period \n     of time has elapsed and a problem remains unsolved by them, \n     the federal judiciary may press a buzzer and take its turn at \n     fashioning a solution.'' Rehnquist was critical of a mode of \n     constitutional interpretation that would allow ``appointed \n     federal judges'' to impose on others a rule that ``the \n     popularly elected branches of government would not have \n     enacted and the voters have not and would not have embodied \n     in the Constitution.'' This approach, he warned, was a \n     ``formula for an end run around popular government,'' and \n     ``genuinely corrosive of the fundamental values of our \n     democratic society.''\n       As an Associate Justice, Rehnquist emerged as a powerful \n     intellectual force. He authored a number of significant \n     opinions for the Court, but also did not hesitate to express \n     his position in solitary dissent, thus inspiring an early \n     group of law clerks to bestow upon him a Lone Ranger doll as \n     a mantlepiece. When Chief Justice Warren Burger resigned in \n     1986, it was precisely Rehnquist's powerful intellect, his \n     stellar record on the Court, and his consistent judicial \n     philosophy that made him President Ronald Reagan's pick to \n     lead the Court. But no less important were Rehnquist's \n     leadership qualities and the respect he garnered from all of \n     his colleagues, owing to his pleasant and down-to-earth \n     nature, quiet confidence, quick wit, and basic fairness.\n       On June 17, 1986, the President announced his nomination of \n     Justice Rehnquist to become the sixteenth Chief Justice of \n     the United States. During the ensuing confirmation hearings, \n     numerous witnesses testified glowingly to Rehnquist's \n     distinguished service on the Court and his high-powered legal \n     mind. Former Solicitor General Rex Lee, for instance, stated: \n     ``Of all the lawyers with whom I am acquainted, I know of \n     literally no one who is better qualified to be Chief Justice \n     of the United States.'' A representative of the American Bar \n     Association reported the ``genuine enthusiasm'' felt by other \n     Justices and Court employees about Rehnquist's nomination to \n     be Chief Justice: ``There was almost a unanimous feeling of \n     joy. . . . [H]e is regarded as a close personal friend of men \n     who are diametrically opposed to him philosophically and \n     politically.''\n       As Rehnquist took his new seat as the leader of the Court \n     in 1986, President Reagan presciently remarked that he ``will \n     be a Chief Justice of historic stature.'' Rehnquist served as \n     Chief Justice for nearly 20 years, and together with his \n     service as an Associate Justice for more than 14 years, this \n     tenure made him one of the Supreme Court's seven longest-\n     serving members. In that time, Rehnquist left an indelible \n     mark on the Supreme Court, on the functioning of the federal \n     Judiciary, and on the face of American law.\n       Rehnquist's jurisprudential legacy cuts a broad swath, but \n     it is undoubtedly substantial in the areas of criminal \n     procedure and the constitutional rights of criminal \n     defendants. Rehnquist was appointed to the Court shortly \n     after a series of decisions by the Warren Court had expanded \n     the constitutional rights of the accused in criminal cases, \n     and his early opinions made clear that he believed the \n     pendulum had swung too far in that direction. Dissenting from \n     the denial of a stay in California v. Minjares, he called for \n     re-evaluation of the ``exclusionary rule'' applied to the \n     States in Mapp v. Ohio in 1961. Complaining that evidence was \n     suppressed ``solely because of a good-faith error in \n     judgment'' on the part of arresting officers, Rehnquist \n     disputed that the exclusionary rule was necessary to preserve \n     the ``integrity'' of the courts: ``[W]hile it is quite true \n     that courts are not to be participants in 'dirty business,' \n     neither are they to be ethereal vestal virgins of another \n     world, so determined to be like Caesar's wife, Calpurnia, \n     that they cease to be effective forums in which both those \n     charged with committing criminal acts and the society which \n     makes the charge may have a fair trial in which relevant \n     competent evidence is received in order to determine whether \n     or not the charge is true.'' In another early opinion, \n     explaining the controversial 1966 decision in Miranda v. \n     Arizona, Rehnquist wrote for the Court in Michigan v. Tucker \n     that the procedural safeguards recommended by Miranda ``were \n     not themselves rights protected by the Constitution but were \n     instead measures to insure that the right against compulsory \n     self-incrimination was protected.''\n       Neither Mapp nor Miranda was overruled during Rehnquist's \n     long tenure on the Court. Indeed, in Dickerson v. United \n     States, the Chief Justice wrote for the Court in 2000 that \n     ``[w]hether or not we would agree with Miranda's reasoning \n     and its resulting rule, were we addressing the issue in the \n     first instance, the principles of stare decisis weigh heavily \n     against overruling it now.'' Yet the pendulum surely swung \n     back, with the Court affording the States more latitude in \n     developing procedures for the prosecution of criminal cases, \n     recognizing the practical needs of the police in \n     investigating crime, and fashioning clearer rules for law \n     enforcement officials and citizens alike. The exclusionary \n     rule remains in effect, but the suppression of evidence \n     seized in ``good faith,'' decried by Rehnquist in his \n     Minjares dissent, is far less common in light of the good-\n     faith exception to the exclusionary rule adopted during \n     Rehnquist's tenure. Miranda remains a ``constitutional \n     decision,'' but exceptions and limitations adopted by the \n     Court ensure that it gives way to competing concerns such as \n     the protection of public safety and the strong interest in \n     making available to the trier of fact all relevant and \n     trustworthy evidence. Testifying in support of Rehnquist's \n     appointment as Chief Justice, former Attorney General Griffin \n     Bell aptly observed that Justice Rehnquist had joined in \n     making the right to counsel, Miranda rights, and the \n     exclusionary rule ``more workable,'' and cited the good-faith \n     exception as ``a good example of saving the exclusionary rule \n     from its own excesses.''\n       Another area where Rehnquist's work had a powerful effect \n     on the shape and development of the law is religious freedom \n     and church-state relations. In First Amendment cases, \n     Rehnquist consistently endorsed the idea that governments \n     may, consistent with the Constitution, do quite a bit to \n     accommodate and acknowledge religion, but are not required by \n     the Constitution to provide religious believers with special \n     exemptions from generally applicable laws. It is not an \n     ``establishment'' of religion, he maintained, for politically \n     accountable actors to act in ways that benefit religious \n     believers and institutions or to recognize religious \n     traditions and teachings. That governments may not \n     ``establish[]'' religion does not mean, he believed, that \n     religion has no place in public life or civil society. At the \n     same time, he insisted, it is rarely a violation of the free-\n     exercise guarantee for those same actors to apply to \n     religious people and religiously motivated conduct the same \n     rules that apply generally.\n       As it turned out, Rehnquist's last opinion was for a \n     plurality in Van Orden v. Perry, in which the Justices ruled \n     that Texas had not ``establish[ed]'' religion by including a \n     Ten Commandments monument among the nearly 40 monuments and \n     historical markers on the grounds surrounding the State \n     Capitol. He wrote: ``Our cases, Januslike, point in two \n     directions in applying the Establishment Clause. One face \n     looks toward the strong role played by religion and religious \n     traditions throughout our Nation's history. . . . The other \n     face looks toward the principle that governmental \n     intervention in religious matters can itself endanger \n     religious freedom. This case, like all Establishment \n     Clause challenges, presents us with the difficulty of \n     respecting both faces. Our institutions presuppose a \n     Supreme Being, yet these institutions must not press \n     religious observances upon their citizens. One face looks \n     to the past in acknowledgment of our Nation's heritage, \n     while the other looks to the present in demanding a \n     separation between church and state. Reconciling these two \n     faces requires that we neither abdicate our responsibility \n     to maintain a division between church and state nor evince \n     a hostility to religion by disabling the government from \n     in some ways recognizing our religious heritage[.] '' In \n     this last opinion, Rehnquist returned to themes that he \n     had developed at length in one of his most famous \n     opinions, a dissent in Wallace v. Jaffree.\n       A third area where Rehnquist's legacy is both striking and \n     significant involves the structure and powers of the federal \n     government created by our Constitution and the role and \n     retained powers of the States. From his earliest to his final \n     days on the Court, Rehnquist was committed to what he called \n     ``first principles:'' Ours is a national government of \n     limited, delegated, and divided powers, and the government's \n     structure, no less than the Bill of Rights, is a safeguard \n     for individual liberty. Rehnquist's dedication to these \n     principles, and to enforcing the limits and boundaries that \n     our Constitution imposes on federal power, reflected his \n     understanding that our constitutional design leaves ample \n     room for diverse policy experiments and different answers to \n     pressing social questions.\n       Rehnquist's commitment to judicial enforcement of \n     enumerated powers and the federal-state balance was perhaps \n     most discernible in the Court's cases interpreting the \n     Commerce Clause. As early as 1975, dissenting alone, \n     Rehnquist argued that the federal government must treat the \n     States like sovereign entities, rather than like individuals. \n     Even when Congress has authority under the federal commerce \n     power to regulate private conduct in a particular area, it \n     could not apply that regulation to the States if doing so \n     would interfere with what he called ``traditional state \n     functions.''\n       As happened a number of times during his tenure, \n     Rehnquist's position in dissent ultimately was embraced by a \n     majority of his colleagues. In National League of Cities v. \n     Usery, a majority of the Court adopted his ``traditional \n     governmental functions'' test. Although the Court ultimately \n     overruled National League of Cities nine years later, \n     Rehnquist, in a pithy reply, thought it not ``incumbent on \n     those of us in dissent to spell out further the fine points \n     of a principle that will, I am confident, in time again \n     command the support of a majority of this Court.'' And true \n     to his prediction, Rehnquist's promotion of federalism forged \n     ahead, serving as the basis for the Court's declaration of an \n     anti-commandeering principle, its strengthening of the \n     States' sovereign immunity, and\n\n[[Page S5943]]\n\n     its reaffirmation of the existence of ``judicially \n     enforceable outer limits'' on the commerce power itself, in \n     United States v. Lopez in 1995.\n       Rehnquist's dedication to judicial restraint and popular \n     government is perhaps most evident in his writings on the \n     subject of ``substantive due process.'' At his death, \n     Rehnquist was the last remaining member of the Court that had \n     decided Roe v. Wade. He had dissented from the opinion of the \n     Court, comparing the majority's reasoning to the discredited \n     doctrine of Lochner v. New York, and commenting that the \n     Court's opinion in Roe ``partakes more of judicial \n     legislation than it does of a determination of the intent of \n     the drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment.'' While Rehnquist \n     garnered only four votes for his later view that Roe should \n     be overruled, the Court ultimately did adopt his restrained \n     approach to substantive due process. In Washington v. \n     Glucksberg, Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote for the majority \n     and recognized that ``[b]y extending constitutional \n     protection to an asserted right or liberty interest, we, to a \n     great extent, place the matter outside the arena of public \n     debate and legislative action.'' The Court declared that it \n     would ``exercise the utmost care'' whenever asked to ``break \n     new ground in this field, lest the liberty protected by the \n     Due Process Clause be subtly transformed into the policy \n     preferences of the Members of this Court.'' Thus, Rehnquist's \n     opinion was consistent with the view articulated more than 20 \n     years earlier, in his essay on the ``living Constitution,'' \n     that judicial review under the Fourteenth Amendment should \n     not be employed as an ``end run around popular government,'' \n     in a way that is ``genuinely corrosive of the fundamental \n     values of our democratic society.'' Running through his \n     opinions on any number of questions--from assisted suicide \n     and abortion to Christmas displays, campaign finance, and the \n     death penalty--is a deep commitment to the idea that our \n     Constitution leaves important, difficult, and even divisive \n     decisions to the people.\n       Rehnquist's legacy on the Supreme Court involves much more \n     than doctrinal contributions and particularly noteworthy \n     decisions. He encouraged and exemplified collegiality, \n     fairness, and graciousness among the Justices, urging them \n     towards greater consensus where possible, and thereby \n     enhancing the respect enjoyed by the Court in American \n     society. To some degree, Rehnquist's achievements as the \n     leader of the Court were the result of a subtle \n     transformation in Rehnquist himself--from Justice Rehnquist, \n     ``The Lone Dissenter,'' to Chief Justice Rehnquist, the \n     consensus-builder.\n       In his 1986 confirmation hearings, Rehnquist alluded to the \n     role of a Chief Justice in gaining consensus, and allowed \n     that deviation from his personal judicial philosophy may be \n     proper ``where there are constraints that there ought to be a \n     court opinion rather than a plurality opinion.'' Rehnquist \n     later acknowledged, in a 2001 interview, that while his legal \n     philosophy had never changed, since becoming the Chief \n     Justice he had ``become a lot more convinced of the need for \n     the Court to get a Court opinion in each case. . . . I'm more \n     conscious of the need for that and also conscious of the . . \n     . lack of need for a lot of concurring opinions.''\n       For those attorneys privileged to argue before the Supreme \n     Court during Rehnquist's long tenure, his legacy is probably \n     as much about his commanding presence on the Bench as his \n     approach to the Constitution or the Conference. Rehnquist's \n     view of oral argument was emblematic of his no-nonsense \n     approach to judging and life. He wrote that oral argument \n     ``forces the judges who are going to decide the case and the \n     lawyers who represent the clients whose fates will be \n     affected by the outcome of the decision to look at one \n     another for an hour, and talk back and forth about how the \n     case should be decided.''\n       Rehnquist preferred plain-spoken arguments to flowery \n     rhetoric or pretense. Although he was a kind and easygoing \n     man, he adopted a stem and no-nonsense demeanor on the Bench, \n     running arguments with Nordic precision. The moment the red \n     light came on, the Chief thanked counsel for the \n     presentation, even if the lawyer was in mid-sentence, and \n     then called the next lawyer or case. When one lawyer rose to \n     present his rebuttal, the Chief ended the argument by \n     stating, while breaking a wry smile, ``the Marshal says you \n     have 5 seconds left, and under the principle of de minimis \n     non curat lex, the case is submitted.''\n       Rehnquist's dry sense of humor often was on display during \n     argument sessions. During one argument, a lawyer gave what he \n     described as an ``honest and principled answer'' to another \n     Justice's question, and the Chief quickly replied, ``we hope \n     all your answers will be principled.'' When a lawyer \n     responded to Rehnquist's recitation of a case by saying ``you \n     are correct, Chief Justice,'' the Chief said, ``I'm glad to \n     know that.'' During his last public session on the Bench, \n     Rehnquist observed that seven different opinions had been \n     written in a case, then remarked, ``I didn't know we had so \n     many Justices.''\n       As the Chief Justice, Rehnquist presided over not only the \n     Bench and the Conference, but over the entire Judicial Branch \n     as well. He brought to this role the same collegiality, \n     wisdom, effectiveness, and clarity of purpose that marked his \n     leadership of the Supreme Court itself. As with so many \n     things he did, he impressed all with his ability to perform \n     so effortlessly the myriad tasks of running the Judiciary. \n     His colleague Justice Byron White remarked in 1996 that ``of \n     the three Chief Justices with whom I have served, the man who \n     now sits in the center chair. . . seems to me to be the least \n     stressed by his responsibilities and to be the most efficient \n     manager of his complicated schedule.'' Rehnquist, he said, \n     ``reminds me of a highly conditioned cross between a quarter \n     horse and racing thoroughbred.''\n       Rehnquist brought his penchant for innovation and \n     efficiency to management of the judicial branch. He adopted \n     changes that dramatically improved the efficiency and \n     operation of the Judicial Conference, including what he \n     termed a ``notably strengthened Executive Committee,'' which \n     became the senior executive arm of the Judicial Conference. \n     He fostered inclusiveness by requiring, for the first time, \n     that members of Judicial Conference committees rotate \n     regularly, and he never asserted his authority as Chief \n     Justice to govern with a heavy hand. A vigorous defender of \n     the Third Branch, Rehnquist effectively used the pulpit \n     provided by his position to support and defend the Judiciary \n     and to improve inter-branch relations. He wisely understood \n     that Congress had an important role to play in overseeing the \n     Judiciary, and he communicated often with congressional \n     leaders, in both formal and less formal settings, to advance \n     the goals of the Judiciary. As he put it, ``Judges. . . have \n     no monopoly of wisdom on matters affecting the Judiciary. . . \n     . Legislators and executive officials, no less than judges, \n     are committed to an effective Judiciary.''\n       But Rehnquist also understood full well the importance of \n     an independent and vibrant Judiciary, and he staunchly \n     defended the Judiciary from attacks, often resorting--as he \n     did in other areas--to lessons from history. In 2004, he \n     addressed congressional suggestions for impeachment of \n     federal judges who issue unpopular decisions by explaining \n     that ``our Constitution has struck a balance between judicial \n     independence and accountability, giving individual judges \n     secure tenure but making the federal Judiciary subject \n     ultimately to the popular will because judges are appointed \n     and confirmed by elected officials.'' His leadership \n     engendered great loyalty from the members of the federal \n     Judiciary, and in the end, one judge captured the \n     sentiment of a great many, saying that Chief Justice \n     Rehnquist ``was our wise leader, our strongest supporter \n     and our true friend.''\n       Above and beyond his demanding official duties, Rehnquist \n     pursued and cultivated a rich array of interests and \n     passions. Family, friends, and law clerks remember well his \n     dedication to afternoon swims and weekly tennis matches, his \n     friendly wagering on football, horse races, or even the \n     amount of snowfall, his love for trivia and charades, and his \n     interest and voluminous knowledge of literature, geography, \n     history, and art. Rehnquist also served as Historian-in-\n     Chief, writing books on the history of the Supreme Court, the \n     impeachment trials of Chase and Johnson, the controversial \n     Hayes-Tilden presidential election of 1876, and civil \n     liberties in wartime. Remarkably, Rehnquist himself became \n     the second Chief Justice in history to preside over an \n     impeachment trial, confronted a disputed presidential \n     election in 2000, and led the Court as it decided pressing \n     questions involving civil liberties and security in the \n     context of the war on terror and the attacks of September 11, \n     2001.\n       For those who knew, worked with, learned from, and cared \n     about William Rehnquist, his personal qualities--the \n     unassuming manner, the care he took to put people at ease, \n     and his evident desire to serve as a teacher and mentor--are \n     as salient in memories of him as his re-invigoration of the \n     ``first principles'' of our federalism, his re-focusing of \n     the Fourth Amendment on reasonableness, or his conviction \n     that the religion clauses of the First Amendment do not \n     require a public square scrubbed clean of religious faith and \n     expression. Rehnquist never forgot what it felt like to \n     arrive at the Court as a slightly awestruck and appropriately \n     apprehensive law clerk. He never lost his sense of gratitude \n     for the opportunity to learn and serve the law in that great \n     institution. And he never outgrew or got tired of teaching \n     young lawyers how to read carefully, write clearly, think \n     hard, and live well.\n       William Rehnquist served well his country, his profession, \n     and the Constitution. All the while, he kept and nurtured a \n     healthy focus on real things and places, and he embraced the \n     value, interest, and importance of ordinary, everyday life. \n     We are reminded of how the Chief had taken to heart Dr. \n     Johnson's dictum that ``[t]o be happy at home is the end of \n     all human endeavor.'' In a 2000 commencement address, he \n     invoked the wonderful old Jimmy Stewart movie, You Can't Take \n     it With You, to urge the assembled, ambitious young lawyers \n     to ``[d]evelop a capacity to enjoy pastimes and occupations \n     that many can enjoy simultaneously--love for another, being a \n     good parent to a child, service to your community.'' He \n     instilled in so many of his friends, colleagues, and law \n     clerks a commitment to building and living an integrated life \n     as a lawyer, a life that is not compartmentalized, atomized, \n     or segregated but that pulls and holds together work, \n     friends, family, faith, and community. Rehnquist understood \n     that the need for such a commitment is particularly acute \n     among lawyers, and he worried that the profession he so \n     thoroughly enjoyed and in which he thrived had become marked, \n     for many, by brutally long hours of well-paid stress and \n     drudgery.\n\n[[Page S5944]]\n\n       In the final years of his life, he recalled happily that \n     the ``structure of the law practice'' in Phoenix when he \n     practiced there ``was such that I was able to earn a decent \n     living, while still finding time for my wife and children and \n     some civic activities. Lawyers were not nearly as time \n     conscious then as they are now; this meant that they probably \n     earned less money than they might have, but had a more \n     enjoyable life.'' He exhorted law school graduates to realize \n     that because of their abilities and opportunities, they would \n     have ``choices,'' and that ``how wisely you make these \n     choices will determine how well spent you think your life is \n     when you look back at it.'' Gathered here together, looking \n     back at his life, the Members of the Bar of the Supreme Court \n     are pleased and honored to announce the opinion that his was \n     a great life, and well spent.\n       Wherefore, it is Resolved, That we, the Bar of the Supreme \n     Court of the United States, express our great admiration and \n     respect for Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, our deep \n     sense of loss upon his death, our appreciation for his \n     contribution to the law, the Court, and the Nation, and our \n     gratitude for his example of a life well spent; and it is \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Solicitor General be asked to present \n     these resolutions to the Court and that the Attorney General \n     be asked to move that they be inscribed on the Court's \n     permanent records.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Ted Stevens,\n     President pro tempore of the Senate.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am providing this supplemental \n     consolidated report, prepared by my Administration and \n     consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law 93-\n     148), as part of my efforts to keep the Congress informed \n     about deployments of U.S. combat-equipped Armed Forces around \n     the world. This supplemental report covers operations in \n     support of the war on terror, Kosovo, and Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina.\n\n\n                           THE WAR ON TERROR\n\n       Since September 24, 2001, I have reported, consistent with \n     Public Law 107-40 and the War Powers Resolution, on the \n     combat operations in Afghanistan against al-Qaida terrorists \n     and their Taliban supporters, which began on October 7, 2001, \n     and the deployment of various combat-equipped and combat-\n     support forces to a number of locations in the Central, \n     Pacific, and Southern Command areas of operation in support \n     of those operations and of other operations in our war on \n     terror.\n       I will direct additional measures as necessary in the \n     exercise of the U.S. right to self-defense and to protect \n     U.S. citizens and interests. Such measures may include short-\n     notice deployments of special operations and other forces for \n     sensitive operations in various locations throughout the \n     world. It is not possible to know at this time either the \n     precise scope or duration of the deployment of U.S. Armed \n     Forces necessary to counter the terrorist threat to the \n     United States.\n       United States Armed Forces, with the assistance of numerous \n     coalition partners, continue to conduct the U.S. campaign to \n     pursue al-Qaida terrorists and to eliminate support to al-\n     Qaida. These operations have been successful in seriously \n     degrading al-Qaida's training capabilities. United States \n     Armed Forces, with the assistance of numerous coalition \n     partners in Combined Forces Command, Afghanistan, ended the \n     Taliban regime and are actively pursuing and engaging remnant \n     al-Qaida and Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. Approximately \n     200 U.S. personnel also are assigned to the International \n     Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. The U.N. \n     Security Council authorized the ISAF in U.N. Security Council \n     Resolution 1386 of December 20, 2001, and has reaffirmed its \n     authorization since that time, most recently for a 12-month \n     period beginning October 13, 2005, in U.N. Security Council \n     Resolution 1623 of September 13, 2005. The mission of the \n     ISAF under NATO command is to assist the Government of \n     Afghanistan in creating a safe and secure environment that \n     allows reconstruction and the reestablishment of Afghan \n     authorities. Currently, all 26 NATO nations contribute to the \n     ISAF. Ten non-NATO contributing countries also participate by \n     providing military and other support personnel to the ISAF.\n       The United States continues to detain several hundred al-\n     Qaida and Taliban fighters who are believed to pose a \n     continuing threat to the United States and its interests. The \n     combat-equipped and combat-support forces deployed to Naval \n     Base, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in the U.S. Southern Command area \n     of operations since January 2002 continue to conduct secure \n     detention operations for the approximately 460 enemy \n     combatants at Guantanamo Bay.\n       The U.N. Security Council authorized a Multinational Force \n     (MNF) in Iraq under unified command in U.N. Security Council \n     Resolution 1511 of October 16, 2003, and reaffirmed its \n     authorization in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1546 of \n     June 8, 2004. In U.N. Security Council Resolution 1637 of \n     November 8, 2005, the Security Council, noting the Iraqi \n     government's request to retain the presence of the MNF, \n     extended the MNF mandate for a period ending on December 31, \n     2006. Under Resolutions 1546 and 1637, the mission of the MNF \n     is to contribute to security and stability in Iraq, as \n     reconstruction continues. These contributions have included \n     assisting in building the capability of the Iraqi security \n     forces and institutions as the Iraqi people drafted and \n     approved a constitution and established a constitutionally \n     elected government. The U.S. contribution to the MNF is \n     approximately 131,000 military personnel.\n       In furtherance of our efforts against terrorists who pose a \n     continuing and imminent threat to the United States, our \n     friends and allies, and our forces abroad, the United States \n     continues to work with friends and allies in areas around the \n     globe. These efforts include the deployment of U.S. combat-\n     equipped and combat-support forces to assist in enhancing the \n     counterterrorism capabilities of our friends and allies. \n     United States combat-equipped and combat-support forces \n     continue to be located in the Horn of Africa region, and the \n     U.S. forces headquarters element in Djibouti provides command \n     and control support as necessary for military operations \n     against al-Qaida and other international terrorists in the \n     Horn of Africa region, including in Yemen. In addition, \n     the United States continues to conduct maritime \n     interception operations on the high seas in the areas of \n     responsibility of all of the geographic combatant \n     commanders. These maritime operations have the \n     responsibility to stop the movement, arming, or financing \n     of international terrorists.\n\n\n                      NATO-LED KOSOVO FORCE (KFOR)\n\n       As noted in previous reports regarding U.S. contributions \n     in support of peacekeeping efforts in Kosovo, the U.N. \n     Security Council authorized Member States to establish KFOR \n     in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244 of June 10, 1999. \n     The mission of KFOR is to provide an international security \n     presence in order to deter renewed hostilities; verify and, \n     if necessary, enforce the terms of the Military Technical \n     Agreement between NATO and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n     (which is now Serbia); enforce the terms of the Undertaking \n     on Demilitarization and Transformation of the former Kosovo \n     Liberation Army; provide day-to-day operational direction to \n     the Kosovo Protection Corps; and maintain a safe and secure \n     environment to facilitate the work of the U.N. Interim \n     Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).\n       Currently, there are 24 NATO nations contributing to KFOR. \n     Eleven non-NATO contributing countries also participate by \n     providing military personnel and other support personnel to \n     KFOR. The U.S. contribution to KFOR in Kosovo is about 1,700 \n     U.S. military personnel, or approximately 11 percent of \n     KFOR's total strength of approximately 16,000 personnel.\n       The U.S. forces have been assigned to the eastern region of \n     Kosovo. For U.S. KFOR forces, as for KFOR generally, \n     maintaining a safe and secure environment remains the primary \n     military task. The KFOR operates under NATO command and \n     control and rules of engagement. The KFOR coordinates with \n     and supports the UNMIK at most levels; provides a security \n     presence in towns, villages, and the countryside; and \n     organizes checkpoints and patrols in key areas to provide \n     security, protect minorities, resolve disputes, and help \n     instill in the community a feeling of confidence.\n       In accordance with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244, \n     UNMIK continues to transfer additional competencies to the \n     Kosovar Provisional Institutions of Self-Government, which \n     includes the President, Prime Minister, multiple ministries, \n     and the Kosovo Assembly. The UNMIK retains ultimate authority \n     in some sensitive areas such as police, justice, and ethnic \n     minority affairs.\n       NATO continues formally to review KFOR's mission at 6-month \n     intervals. These reviews provide a basis for assessing \n     current force levels, future requirements, force structure, \n     force reductions, and the eventual withdrawal of KFOR. NATO \n     has adopted the Joint Operations Area plan to regionalize and \n     rationalize its force structure in the Balkans. The UNMIK \n     international police and the Kosovo Police Service (KPS) have \n     full responsibility for public safety and policing throughout \n     Kosovo. The UNMIK international police and KPS also have \n     begun to assume responsibility for guarding patrimonial sites \n     and established border-crossing checkpoints. The KFOR \n     augments security in particularly sensitive areas or in \n     response to particular threats as needed.\n\n[[Page S5945]]\n\n              NATO HEADQUARTERS IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA\n\n       Pursuant to the June 2004 decision made by NATO Heads of \n     State and Government, and in accordance with U.N. Security \n     Council Resolution 1575 of November 22, 2004, NATO concluded \n     its Stabilization Force operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina and \n     established NATO Headquarters-Sarajevo to continue to assist \n     in implementing the Peace Agreement in conjunction with a \n     newly established European Force. The NATO Headquarters-\n     Sarajevo, to which approximately 250 U.S. personnel are \n     assigned, is, with the European Force, the legal successor to \n     SFOR. The principal tasks of NATO Headquarters-Sarajevo are \n     providing advice on defense reform and performing operational \n     supporting tasks, such as counterterrorism and supporting the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.\n       I have directed the participation of U.S. Armed Forces in \n     all of these operations pursuant to my constitutional \n     authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations and as Commander \n     in Chief and Chief Executive.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the importance \nof educating new mothers about postpartum depression. The bill I am \nintroducing today with Senator Menendez will provide screening and \neducation for women who have given birth and will promote research into \nthe causes, diagnoses and treatments for postpartum depression.\n  The Commonwealth Fund released a study last month that finds post-\npartum depression inhibits a mother's ability to safely and effectively \ncare for her children after pregnancy. Mothers who are affected by \npost-\npartum depression are less likely to provide essential developmental \nsupport for the child through playing, talking, showing picture books, \nand following daily routines.\n  For many mothers, the depression worsens if it isn't diagnosed, which \ncan lead to substance abuse, loss of employment, divorce, further \nsocial alienation, self-destructive behavior, and even suicide.\n  A few years ago in Chicago, within a 4-week period, several new \nmothers who were affected by postpartum depression took their own \nlives.\n  Melanie Stokes jumped from a 12-story Chicago hotel, taking her life \nonly a few months after her daughter was born, The day before her \ndaughter's first birthday, Amy Garvey's body was found floating in Lake \nMichigan. Jennifer Mudd Houghtaling, from Wisconsin, jumped in front a \nsubway train in Chicago less than 5 months after giving birth to her \nson, Five days after giving birth to quadruplets, Ariceli Erivas \nSandoval drowned herself in Lake Michigan.\n  These are tragic, heart-wrenching stories. I wish I could say that is \nthe end of the story, but the problem is far more common than that. \nEach year, far more than half of women giving birth suffer from \npostpartum mood changes. The more mild ``baby blues'' affect up to 80 \npercent of new mothers. Postpartum mood and anxiety disorders impair 10 \nto 20 percent of new mothers, and postpartum psychosis strikes 1 in \n1,000 women after birth.\n  The Menendez-Durbin bill authorizes postpartum depression screening \nand information for mothers before they leave the birthing center. \nThrough a State grant program, health care providers are given the \ntools they need to recognize signs of depression and to educate women \nand their families about the disorder and how to access help.\n  We also call on the National Institutes of Health to convene a series \nof national meetings on postpartum depression and psychosis and then to \nexpand and intensify research around that consensus.\n  Our bill has been endorsed by the Illinois Chapter of the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics; the Illinois Psychiatric Association; Postpartum \nSupport International; the Association of Women's Health; Obstetric and \nNeonatal Nurses, AWHONN; the Family Mental Health Institute, Inc.; the \nNational Mental Health Association and the New Jersey chapter, and the \nNew Jersey Chapter of the American College of Obstetrics and \nGynecology, ACOG.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Menendez and me in supporting \nthe MOTHERS Act, which will ensure that new mothers are educated about \npostpartum depression and that research will help us prevent and treat \npostpartum depression in new mothers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/15/senate-section/article/S5945-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                  Petty Officer 2nd Class Jaime Jaenke\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the first \nfemale Iowan to have lost her life in the Iraq conflict. Petty Officer \n2nd Class Jaime Jaenke was a naval reservist who had been in Iraq for \nonly 3 months. She was killed on Monday, June 5, when the humvee she \nwas traveling in was hit by an improvised explosive device. She was 29 \nyears old and was assigned to the Naval Mobile Construction Battalion \n25 at Fort McCoy, WI.\n  Petty Officer Jaenke has given her life for our country, and I would \nask that all Americans join me today in remembering and honoring Petty \nOfficer Jaenke. Her loss will be felt deeply in the town of Iowa Falls. \nAlthough she had lived in Wisconsin for a number of years, she returned \nto Iowa 2 years ago and last fall opened an equestrian business outside \nIowa Falls. My thoughts and prayers are with Petty Officer Jaenke's \ndaughter, Kayla, her parents, Susan and Larry, as well as all those \nother family and friends who are grieving the loss of this young \nmother.\n  We owe a huge debt of gratitude to Petty Officer Jaenke for her \nsacrifice. I am greatly saddened by her passing but deeply proud and \ngrateful for what she gave for America. Her loss remains tragic but she \ndied a true patriot.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/15/senate-section/article/S5945-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MARRIAGE PROTECTION AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I strongly support traditional marriage, \nthe bedrock of our society, and I therefore support the Marriage \nProtection Amendment.\n  Like some of my colleagues, I believe that marriage is typically a \nState issue. Unelected, lifetime-appointed judges, however, have forced \nour hand on this issue. We can no longer sit idly by while a handful of \nactivist judges lay the groundwork to overturn the Defense of Marriage \nAct and redefine marriage for the entire Nation.\n  I voted in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act a decade ago, which \nreinforced States rights on this issue. Since then, 26 States have \npassed statutes designed to protect traditional marriage by defining \nmarriage only as the union of a man and a woman. Further, 19 States now \nhave constitutional amendments that contain this same definition. \nVoters in seven additional States will vote on constitutional \namendments this year. Another four State legislature--including that of \nmy own State, Iowa--are considering sending constitutional amendments \nto voters within the next 2 years. Ballot initiatives are currently \nunderway in three States. Only a handful of States have redefined \nmarriage to include same-sex partnerships, created a version of civil \nunions, or lack actual or planned protection for traditional marriage.\n  The states have spoken. A great majority of them have decided that \nmarriage, in their States, shall consist solely of the union of a man \nand a woman. But, it has become a common prediction that the Federal \nDefense of Marriage Act will be overturned by the judiciary. In that \ncase, the full faith and credit clause of our Constitution would \nrequire every State to recognize so-called marriages performed in \nStates that allow the union of same-sex couples, many only by judicial \ndecree. We cannot allow unelected judges to force their will upon the \npeople, who have acted through the democratic process to defend \ntraditional marriage.\n  Under our Constitution, Congress has the responsibility to enact \nlegislation. Congress also has the responsibility to initiate the \nconstitutional amendment process. We must fulfill this duty to protect \ntraditional marriage. We must provide the States the opportunity to \ndefend marriage as they have defined it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/15/senate-section/article/S5945-4", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5945-S5946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SCHOOL SAFETY ACQUIRING FACULTY EXCELLENCE ACT\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to express my \nsupport\n\n[[Page S5946]]\n\nfor H.R. 4894, the School Safety Acquiring Faculty Excellence Act.\n  As the father of three children, I know that nothing is more \nimportant than protecting their safety. We do everything to ensure that \nour children are safe while they are in our care. But just as \nimportant, we must do everything we can to make sure they are safe when \nwe cannot be right there beside them. One of the ways we can accomplish \nthis is to provide for a safe school environment.\n  We trust teachers, principals, coaches, and other school employees to \nteach our children, to protect our children, and to nurture our \nchildren during the school day. Therefore, it is imperative that our \nschool districts have the necessary tools to thoroughly review all \nschool employees before they ever come into contact with our children.\n  The School Safety Acquiring Faculty Excellence Act will help school \ndistricts better examine job applicants by having the Attorney General \nand the Department of Justice provide localities with direct access to \nthe FBI's national crime information databases and assistance with \nfingerprint background checks for potential employees. Currently there \nare a myriad of laws across the States pertaining to background checks \nfor school employees. This legislation will ensure a more thorough \nprocess and encourage information sharing across State borders.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, which is \na step forward in promoting safe schools and protecting our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/15/senate-section/article/S5946-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR RECOMMENDATION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to inform my colleagues of my \nrequest to Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to strongly recommend the \nnomination of MSG Woodrow W. Keeble for the Congressional Medal of \nHonor.\n  Last week, the Secretary of the Army made a recommendation to the \nSecretary of Defense that the late MSG Woodrow W. Keeble be awarded the \nCongressional Medal of Honor. I strongly encourage and request that the \nSecretary of Defense recommend Mr. Keeble for this award and that \naction be taken quickly, particularly for the sake of Mr. Keeble's \nwidow, to recommend approval to President Bush.\n  Mr. Keeble was a full-blooded Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux, who fought in \nboth World War II and the Korean war. He was born in Waubay, SD, and \nattended Wahpeton Indian School in North Dakota. While attending \nWahpeton Indian School, Mr. Keeble excelled as a baseball pitcher. His \noutstanding athletic ability, for which he is remembered in the \nWahpeton community, would later serve him well during his acts of \nbravery and courage in the Korean war.\n  The brave actions that make Mr. Keeble deserving of the Congressional \nMedal of Honor occurred during Operation Nomad of the Korean war on \nOctober 20, 1951. During the Korean war, Mr. Keeble was assigned to \nCompany G, 19th Infantry, 24th Division of the U.S. Army. He was \ncharged with leading the 1st platoon of Company G as master sergeant.\n  Mr. Keeble's actions on October 20, 1951, were reminiscent of \nHollywood movies, but this was real heroism. On that date, Mr. Keeble's \ncompany was charged with the mission of taking and securing Hill 765, a \nsteep rocky and well-defended terrain near Kumsong, Korea. As they \nbegan to reach their final objective, the lead platoon of Company G was \nambushed with heavy fire from three enemy machine gun nests. The \nplatoon's situation became grave as Mr. Keeble, acting platoon leader \nof a support platoon, left his position of cover and bravely made his \nway forward and joined the trapped platoon.\n  It took Mr. Keeble little time to decide that immediate action had to \nbe taken. He courageously crawled directly into the line of fire to \ntake out the enemy machine guns. He successfully crawled up the rocky \nterrain and neutralized the first two machine gun nests by hurling \ngrenades and rendering them useless. The remaining enemy machine gun \nnest brought terrific fire down upon him. Undaunted by the rain of \nconcussion and fragmentation grenades, Mr. Keeble proceeded to disable \nthe final enemy position. After missing the enemy with his last \ngrenade, he launched a one-man assault with his M-1 rifle. By this \ntime, he sustained multiple shrapnel wounds. Fearlessly, he took out \nthe final machine gun position with his rifle. While awaiting the \narrival of his fellow soldiers, he continued to singlehandedly take out \ntwo additional nearby trenches of enemy troops, and he effectively \nneutralized the enemy stronghold, involving a series of close combat \nstruggles. Mr. Keeble's heroic actions led to the successful \naccomplishment of Company G's mission and, no doubt, saved the lives of \nmany American troops.\n  Those who served with Mr. Keeble twice recommended him for the \nCongressional Medal of Honor, but the recommendations were lost. The \nfirst was due to the regiment's move from the Korean theater, and the \nsecond was an inability to meet mapping requirements. However, it \nshould be noted that both instances of application only required two \nsignatures, but in each case, all the men in Master Sergeant Keeble's \ncompany signed the Congressional Medal of Honor request. Eventually, \nthe deadline for the Medal of Honor consideration passed, but Mr. \nKeeble's family was granted their request in 2002 that his file be \nreopened.\n  For his acts of heroism he was awarded the Purple Heart, the Bronze \nStar, the Silver Star, and the Distinguished Service Cross. The \ncriteria for the Congressional Medal of Honor include deeds of personal \nbravery, self-sacrifice, or an action that conspicuously distinguishes \nthe individual above his comrades. Should the President agree to this \nrecommendation, Mr. Keeble would be the first Sioux Indian to be \nawarded the Nation's highest military honor if he is chosen to receive \nthe Congressional Medal of Honor. Certainly the courageous and \npatriotic acts exhibited by Mr. Keeble during times of war make him a \nlong overdue and deserving recipient of the Congressional Medal of \nHonor.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Secretary of Defense to strongly recommend \nthe nomination of MSG Woodrow W. Keeble for the Congressional Medal of \nHonor to the President of the United States, and I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in saluting a truly brave and courageous American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/15/senate-section/article/S5946-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n MAGNUSON-STEVENS FISHERY CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT REAUTHORIZATION \n                                  ACT\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.

My \namendment makes Oregon's salmon fishermen eligible for disaster \nassistance. Their willingness to accommodate my concerns and help \nOregon's salmon fishers means that I can withdraw the objection I \nissued 2 weeks ago to any unanimous consent request for the Senate to \nact on the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation Act. I also wish to \nthank Senator Smith and Senator Boxer for their important contributions \nand assistance. I look forward to swift passage of the legislation, as \namended.\n  The inclusion of the disaster declaration in the Magnuson-Stevens \nauthorization is an important first step in getting relief for our \nsalmon fishers and coastal communities that depend on salmon for their \nlivelihoods. After waiting months for a disaster declaration from the \nadministration, our salmon fishers now finally have some movement to \nhelp address their immediate financial needs.\n  Even with this important language, the fight to help Oregon's salmon \nfishermen is far from over, and I will continue to press for \ncongressional appropriations to fund the disaster assistance fishing \nfamilies and the coastal fishing communities need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/15/senate-section/article/S5946-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5946-S5947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WORLD ELDER ABUSE AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of World Elder \nAbuse Awareness Day. As ranking member on the Special Committee on \nAging, I am pleased that the international community has designated \nthis day. It is important to recognize the grim reality of elder abuse, \nneglect, and exploitation and focus on\n\n[[Page S5947]]\n\nwhat we can do to end these horrible crimes.\n  In the past 40 years, our Nation has struggled to address some of our \nsociety's worst ills: child abuse and domestic violence. Now we must \nconfront elder abuse.\n  For the past 25 years, Congress has held hearings on the devastating \neffects of elder abuse, yet we have taken no comprehensive action. \nAbuse of the elderly is nothing new, but as our Nation has aged and the \nbaby boom generation stands on the cusp of retirement, the prevalence \nof elder abuse will only get worse. The time to act is now. We can no \nlonger ignore or tolerate the shame and scandal of abuse, neglect, and \nexploitation of our Nation's seniors.\n  I have long made ending elder abuse a top priority. I worked hard to \ndevelop a national criminal background check system for nursing home, \nhome health, and other long-term care employees. While the vast \nmajority of these employees are diligent, dedicated, and professional, \nit is too easy for people with abusive and criminal backgrounds to find \nwork in long-term care. This is unacceptable. Today, seven States, \nincluding my home State of Wisconsin, are engaged in a pilot project \nbased on my legislation which requires long-term care employers to run \nFBI criminal background checks on potential employees before they are \nhired and trusted to care for our loved ones. My hope is that upon \ncompletion of this pilot project, we will move to a national criminal \nbackground check system and protect seniors in all 50 States.\n  I am also a proud original cosponsor of the Elder Justice Act, which \ntakes a number of steps to prevent and treat elder abuse. It will \nimprove prevention and intervention by funding State and local projects \nthat keep older Americans safe. It will ensure that health officials, \nsocial services, law enforcement, long-term care facilities, consumer \nadvocates, and families are all working together to confront this \nproblem; and, it will establish training programs so health \nprofessionals in both forensic pathology and geriatrics can better \ndetect elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation.\n  Finally, the bill will establish victim assistance programs, create \n``safe havens'' for seniors in dangerous living situations, and help \ntrain law enforcement officers to prioritize and investigate cases of \nelder abuse.\n  Researchers have warned us that the reported cases of elder abuse \nmight only be the tip of the iceberg; that is why World Elder Abuse \nAwareness Day is so important. We must spread the word: elder abuse, \nneglect, and exploitation is occurring every day and, if left \nunchecked, will only grow more prevalent. As I continue my efforts here \nin the Senate, I encourage my colleagues and Americans everywhere to \njoin me in putting an end to this terrible scourge of elder abuse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/15/senate-section/article/S5947-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  HONORING 17 OUTSTANDING HOOSIER DADS\n\n Mr. BAYH.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity to honor \nGeorge Wingate High School in Brooklyn, NY. Wingate High School, my \nalma mater, will graduate its last class on June 27, 2006.\n  In 1954, Wingate High School accepted its first class of students and \nhad its first graduating class in 1957. It was the first high school \nbuilt in New York after the end of World War II, and it embodied many \nof the ideals of the baby boomer generation. Wingate High School was so \ndifferent from the standard design plan for schools that it became \nknown as ``The Banjo School'' because of its open design.\n  Wingate High School was also innovative in its approach to teaching. \nInstead of focusing strictly on academic classes, Wingate was one of \nthe first high schools in the Nation to offer a comprehensive range of \nclasses in vocational, commercial and academic fields. Wingate High \nSchool has been known for its outstanding aviation, culinary arts, \nnursing and law programs, and many of its students have gone on to \nbecome successful pilots, chefs, nurses and attorneys.\n  Wingate has had a few famous graduates such as former New York State \nsenator and current Brooklyn Borough president, Marty Markowitz, and \nRoger Brown, a New York City playground legend who went on to greatness \nin the American Basketball Association. However, thousands of other \nWingate graduates have made priceless contributions to their \ncommunities, in part because of the valuable lessons they learned \nthere.\n  I firmly believe that a quality education is the key to our youths' \nsuccess and our nation's future. I commend Wingate's teachers, faculty, \nstaff, and volunteers for their many years of hard work and dedication \nto Wingate High School's students. Their work has resulted in thousands \nof students who are better prepared to face the world and its \nchallenges. I commend them for their commitment to quality education. \nTheir enthusiasm and love of teaching means a brighter future for all \nof our children.\n  Wingate High School's motto is: ``Ad Astra per Ardua''--``To the \nstars through struggle.'' In its 52-year history, George Wingate High \nSchool has graduated thousands of students who have gone on to make the \nworld a better place. Though the journey has not always been easy, I \nknow that Wingate's 2006 graduates will go on to do great things.\n  I give my most sincere congratulations and best wishes for the future \nto Wingate High School's Class of 2006.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/15/senate-section/article/S5947-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5947-S5948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL HISTORY DAY\n\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the National \nHistory Day program. A basic knowledge of history is essential for our \nNation's children to become active participants in our democracy, and \nNational History Day is promoting history education in Minnesota and \nthroughout the Nation. National History Day empowers teachers to \nimprove history education so that every student will have historical \nknowledge and skills to contribute to the public good of our Nation. \nThe National History Day program also allows students to create \nexhibits, documentaries and performances, by using their critical \nthinking and research skills in the subject of history.\n\n[[Page S5948]]\n\n  It brings me great pleasure to pay special tribute to Emily Brown, as \nshe is recognized for her scholastic achievements in National History \nDay.\n  Emily is a student at Sunrise Park Middle School in White Bear Lake, \nMN, and was one of 12 students chosen from across America to display \nand present her history project at the White House Visitors Center on \nJune 15. Emily's project is titled ``The Iron Jawed Angel: Alice Paul \ntakes a stand for women's right to vote.''\n  I congratulate Emily as she is honored for her presentation and \ncommend her for her dedication and commitment.

Mr. President, today I recognize a community in \nNorth Dakota that will be celebrating its 125th anniversary. On June \n30-July 2, the residents of Steele will gather to celebrate their \ncommunity's history and founding.\n  Steele is a thriving community in North Dakota. The city was founded \nby Wilbur F. Steele in 1878. He purchased the land from the railroad \nand had hopes that the city would house the State capitol. Mr. Steele \nconstructed a building in the city to serve as a place for the \nlegislature to meet. Since Steele was not chosen as the State's \ncapital, the building became the Kidder County Courthouse, which is \nstill in use today.\n  Steele is best known for its 38\\1/2\\ foot high Sandhill Crane. This \npiece of art was inspired by the numerous birds and ducks that migrate \nthrough Steele each year. Steele has plenty to offer to its residents \nand visitors, from the golf course and parks to fishing, hunting, and \ncrosscountry skiing.\n  The community has planned a wonderful weekend celebration to \ncommemorate its 125th anniversary. The celebration includes an all \nschool reunion, parade, fireworks, auction, outdoor concert, a street \ndance, and much more.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Steele, \nND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing them well \nthrough the next century. By honoring Steele and all the other historic \nsmall towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier \nspirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Steele that \nhave helped to shape this country into what it is today, which is why \nthis fine community is deserving of our recognition.\n  Steele has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/15/senate-section/article/S5948-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        ASSOCIATION OF ENERGY SERVICE COMPANIES 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 50th \nanniversary of the Association of Energy Service Companies and the \nbeneficial contributions it has made to the oil and gas industry since \nFebruary 1956. This organization has helped unite the oil and gas \nindustry and advocates the most efficient production models for all of \nthe member companies, resulting in vastly superior oil and gas \noperations across the Nation.\n  The association formed when six service contractors met and formed \nthe Association of Oil Well Servicing Companies to combat increasing \ngovernmental regulations, rising insurance costs, and the rising \ndifficulty in employee recruitment. With Mr. Frank Poole appointed as \nthe first president, the association began to gradually grow and gain \nprominence in the oil and gas industry. Soon after formation, the group \ngrew to represent 35 wells and 15 trucks and eventually placed an \nassociation chapter in 17 oil-producing States.\n  Over the past 50 years, the organization has blossomed from 6 members \nto over 400. The association currently boasts representation of over 70 \npercent of the well-servicing rigs in domestic oil production. In 1996, \ndue to a rapidly growing national membership and expansive chapter \nrepresentation, the Association of Oil Well Servicing Companies changed \ntheir name to the Association of Energy Service Companies.\n  The AESC continues to lead the oil and gas industry by providing a \nhost of services including safety training and seminars on current and \nnew technology, environmental protection initiatives, monthly meetings \nof State and local chapters, as well as national meetings, conferences, \nand tradeshows.\n  Mr. President, as the members of the AESC prepare to celebrate 50 \nyears of dedicated service, I extend my congratulations to all of those \nmembers who have remained committed to excellence in the oil and gas \nindustry. In a world driven by oil and gas production and consumption, \nthis organization has provided guidance and regulation to maintain \nequal standards in a competitive industry. For the next 50 years and \nbeyond, I sincerely hope this organization's leadership and dedication \nto fairness remains as strong as it has been the past 50 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/15/senate-section/article/S5948-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ROGER MEIER\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a great man, \nRoger Meier.\n  The late Oregon Governor Tom McCall once said, ``Heroes are not giant \nstatues framed against a red sky. They are people who say, `This is my \ncommunity and it is my responsibility to make it better.' ''\n  When Roger Meier passed away on June 5, I lost a trusted friend and \nOregon lost a true hero. Through leadership, vision, and generosity, \nRoger made his community of Portland and his State of Oregon a better \nplace in which to live, work, and raise a family.\n  Roger was a fourth-generation Oregonian and a descendant of the \nfounders of the Meier and Frank Company, one of Oregon's most beloved \ninstitutions. Roger spent 13 years working in the family business \nbefore venturing out on his own and serving as president and CEO of a \nprivately owned investment company for more than 30 years.\n  Roger earned a reputation as a savvy analyst of the business and \nfinancial scene. He put his intelligence and knowledge to work for all \nOregonians, serving for 13 years as chairman of the Oregon Investment \nCouncil, which helps to manage pension funds for Oregon's public \nemployees. Under his stewardship, Oregon's portfolio of investments \ngrew from $400 million to $7 billion.\n  Roger was also a tireless advocate for and a generous philanthropist \nto countless worthy causes and charitable organizations, including the \nOregon Health Sciences University, Good Samaritan Hospital, and the \nOregon Historical Society. Roger and his wonderful and gracious wife of \n54 years, Laura, also had a special love of art. Along with their good \nfriends, Pete and Mary Mark, Roger and Laura's generosity has helped to \nmake the Portland Art Museum into a world-class institution.\n  It was fitting that a memorial tribute to Roger was held at the \nPortland Art Museum on June 11. My predecessor, Senator Mark Hatfield, \nspoke at the service and said that there was one word he believed best \nsummed up Roger: gentleman.\n  Senator Hatfield was right. A man of courtesy, kindness, honesty and \nintegrity, Roger Meier was a true gentleman. He will be greatly missed \nby Laura, by his daughters Alix and Jill and their families, by his \nfriends, and by the community and State he served so ably.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/15/senate-section/article/S5948-4", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           125TH ANNIVERSARY OF SOUTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize South \nDakota State University, which is celebrating its 125th year \nanniversary.\n  Over the past 125 years, SDSU has proven to its students, faculty, \nand alumni that ``you can go anywhere from here.'' South Dakota State \nUniversity, or SDSU, was founded in 1881 as the primary agriculture \nuniversity in my home State of South Dakota, and 125 years later it now \nholds the distinction of being the State's largest university.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \npermanently extend the floor on the Medicare work geographic adjustment \nunder the fee schedule for physicians' services; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today with \nSenators Snowe, Cochran, Cantwell, Domenici, Lincoln, Jeffords, \nCollins, Murray, Harkin, Landrieu, Obama, Salazar, and Sessions \nentitled the ``Rural Equity Payment Index Reform Extension Act of \n2006.'' The legislation would extend a provision that was included as \npart of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 and came from my \noriginal legislation, S. 881 in the 108th Congress, with Congressman \nDoug Bereuter of Nebraska to ensure that the work component of the \nMedicare physician payment formula is set to ensure that no geographic \nregion is paid less than the national average.\n  The Medicare physician payment formula, known as the Medicare \nResource-Based Relative Value Scale, or RBRVS, is based on three \ncomponents of each service: work, practice expense, and professional \nliability insurance. The relative value of each service is then \nmultiplied by a geographic adjuster for each Medicare locality, which \nis known as the Geographic Practice Cost Indices, or GPCIs.\n  Prior to the enactment of this provision as part of the Medicare \nModernization Act of 2003, the physicians in States that have the worst \nworkforce shortages were being paid far less than their counterparts in \nStates with adequate or even an oversupply of physicians due to the \nGPCI adjustment. For the ``work component'' in particular, which \naccounts for about 55 percent of the total Medicare physician payment, \nan adjustment based on geographic adjustments made little sense. An \noffice visit to a rural physician is no different in time, effort, or \nworkload compared to an office visit to an urban physician.\n  As National Rural Health Association president Dr. Wayne Myers said \non January 7, 2003, prior to the legislation's passage, ``An office \nvisit to a rural physician is no different than an office visit to an \nurban physician. The idea that physicians are reimbursed for their work \nand their skills at a lower rate simply on the basis that they choose \nto practice in a rural area and serve our rural communities is \ncompletely ludicrous.''\n  In addition, since Medicare beneficiaries pay the same premium for \nall Part B services, inequitable physician fee payments result in \nsubstantial cross-subsidization from people living in low payment \nStates to people living in higher payment States.\n  Congress determined that such extensive geographic disparities were \nunfair and, as part of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, language \nfrom my bill was included that brought all geographic areas up to the \nnational average for the calculation of this piece of the Medicare \nphysician payment formula.\n  It is important to highlight that the importance of this formula \nextends well beyond Medicare. According to the American Academy of \nPediatrics in its February 8, 2006, update on the Medicare payment \nformula, ``. . . over 74 percent of public and private payors, \nincluding state Medicaid programs, have adopted components of the \nMedicare RBRVS to reimburse physicians, while many other payors are \nexploring its implementation.''\n  Furthermore, Medicare Advantage plan payments are based in large part \non fee-for-service payments made in various geographic locations. \nDisparities in Medicare Advantage payments are also caused, in part, by \nsuch geographic adjustments made to physician payments.\n  Unfortunately, these disparities will increase if the ``work \ncomponent'' in the physician payment rate is allowed to once again \nfully adjust based on geography. The provision bringing payment levels \nup to the national average for every geographic area was in effect for \n2004-2006 and is set to expire at the end of this calendar year. As a \nresult, physicians, who already face a potential reduction in their \noverall Medicare payment rate, might also see their payment rates \nfurther reduced unless this legislative extension is passed.\n  According to the November 21, 2005, Federal Register notice, if \npayment rates were not brought up to the national average, there would \nbe reductions in physician payments to the following States: Alabama, \nArizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia outside of Atlanta, \nIdaho, parts of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, \nMaine, Maryland outside of Baltimore region, Michigan outside of \nDetroit, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New \nHampshire, New Mexico, most of New York outside of New York City and \nsuburbs, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon outside \nof Portland, Pennsylvania outside of Philadelphia, Puerto Rico, South \nCarolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas outside of Houston, Dallas, \nand Brazoria, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington outside of Seattle, \nWest Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\n  Lack of equitable reimbursement is a critical factor leading to the \nshortage of physicians in many rural areas, including the State of New \nMexico. The extension of the Rural Equity Payment Index Reform \nExtension Act of 2006 will ensure that the disparity in physician \npayments between states such as New Mexico and other geographic areas \ndoes not once again widen.\n  I urge prompt passage of this important legislation and ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3516\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rural Equity Payment Index \n     Reform Extension Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PERMANENT EXTENSION OF FLOOR ON MEDICARE WORK \n                   GEOGRAPHIC ADJUSTMENT.\n\n       Section 1848(e)(1)(E) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395w-4(e)(1)(E)) is amended by striking ``and before January \n     1, 2007,''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON:\n  S. 3517. A bill to enhance the services available to members of the \nArmed Forces returning from deployment in Operation Iraqi Freedom and \nOperation Enduring Freedom to assist such members in transitioning to \ncivilian life, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nHeroes\n\n[[Page S5953]]\n\nat Home Act of 2006. This legislation would take several important \nsteps toward assisting our brave men and women in uniform in \ntransitioning back home to their families, workplaces, and communities \nafter deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Hundreds of thousands of troops have rotated through Iraq and \nAfghanistan as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, OIF, and Operation \nEnduring Freedom, OEF, including thousands of courageous men and women \nfrom New York. More military service members than ever are surviving \nthese conflicts because of better body armor and helmets and improved \nbattlefield medicine.\n  But surviving these wars and transitioning home can be an uphill \nbattle. Many OIF and OEF service members, including the unprecedented \nnumber of National Guard and Reserve members, face readjustment \nchallenges after war, such as medical, mental health, relationship, and \nwork problems. Family members also are affected by the transition as \nthey struggle to reconnect with their war heroes, some who may be \ndeployed two, three, if not more times.\n  As I meet with returning service members and their families around \nthe State of New York and the country, I hear about the real hardships \nthey battle after deployment--just how difficult it can be to adjust \nback to life at home.\n  Several articles and reports have highlighted these struggles. \nAccording to a March 2006 study, 19 percent of Iraq veterans and 11 \npercent of Afghanistan veterans reported mental health problems. Among \nthe OIF and OEF veterans seeking care at Department of Veterans \nAffairs, VA, hospitals, nearly a third have been diagnosed with mental \ndisorders, with over 40 percent of those posttraumatic stress disorder, \nPTSD. Another report found that 10 to 30 percent of National Guard \nmembers come home from Iraq searching for work. Others return to \ncivilian jobs dissatisfied with old tasks that pale in comparison to \nwartime responsibilities.\n  In addition to these challenges, a large number of service members \nare coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan with life-threatening brain \ninjuries from roadside blasts that can cause brain damage. It is \nestimated that traumatic brain injuries, TBI, affect more than 25 \npercent of bomb blast survivors--a percentage thought to be higher than \nin any other past U.S. conflict, making TBI the ``signature'' injury of \nIraq. The diffuse but debilitating symptoms of TBI can leave service \nmembers with cognitive and emotional problems, including the inability \nto adapt to civilian life. However, TBI frequently goes undiagnosed \nbecause returning troops may show no visible wounds or may not realize \nthey suffered a concussion.\n  Lessons from past wars have taught us that identifying and dealing \nwith problems like PTSD and TBI right away is vital for overcoming \nthem. Yet just last month, a GAO report found that only 22 percent of \nOIF and OEF service members who may have been at risk for developing \nPTSD based on post deployment screenings were referred on for further \nmental health evaluations. In another report from May 2005, the GAO \nidentified that, despite DOD efforts, the needs of demobilizing Reserve \nand National Guard members for transition assistance were still unmet.\n  We must do more today to reach out and help our newest generation of \nwar heroes as they transition home after serving bravely in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. And we must do more to shore up their families, who have \ncourageously maintained family life on the home front during their \ndeployment. That is why I am introducing this legislation today. The \nHeroes at Home Act would help address returning service members' \nreadjustment to work, PTSD, TBI, and other problems, as well as provide \nsupport to their family members.\n  This bill would involve partnerships with employers and community \norganizations because--despite more services and resources offered at \nDOD facilities, VA hospitals, and Vet Centers--returning service \nmembers are often reluctant to go to traditional mental health clinics \ndue to stigma and concerns about confidentiality and their military \ncareers. Only 29 percent of the approximately 500,000 separated OIF and \nOEF veterans have sought VA health care services, including mental \nhealth services.\n  This legislation would identify ways to better assist National Guard \nand Reserve members in returning to civilian jobs, who are often hurled \nfrom civilian life into combat with less preparation and are then \nexpected to reenter the civilian workforce. It would develop an \nassistance center for employers, employee assistance programs, and \nother organizations to provide them with best practices and education \nfor ensuring the success of Guard and Reserve members in resuming \ncivilian work after deployment, a win for our businesses, our \nemployers, and our troops.\n  Under this legislation, demonstration grants would be awarded to \norganizations in community setting for providing mental health \neducation and assistance to National Guard and Reserve members and \ntheir families. Since many of these troops return to local communities \nscattered across the country far away from military bases and VA \nhospitals, these pilot projects would help reach them and their loved \nones in more convenient places like community colleges, public schools, \ncommunity mental health clinics, and family support organizations.\n  With more and more troops injured by improvised explosive devices, \nIEDs, and bombs in Iraq, we must do more to understand the effects of \nthese blasts on those impacted by them. That is why this legislation \nalso calls for a study on the long-term physical and mental health \nconsequences and rehabilitation needs of traumatic brain injured \nservice members of OIF and OEF. This study would examine ways to help \nprevent future generations of service members from sustaining such \ninjuries while assessing what types of programs and services are \navailable to treat those who have already been injured in the years \nahead.\n  To further assist the mushrooming number of traumatic brain injured \nservice members and their families, this legislation would establish a \nTBI family caregiver training curricula. Health professionals at DOD \nand VA hospitals would use this training to teach family members how to \ncare for traumatic brain injured service members after they leave the \nhospital. It is crucial that we give family members the tools they need \nto effectively assist their loved ones at home in their communities.\n  Those who have proudly served our Nation in OIF and OEF have made \nextraordinary sacrifices in the battlefield in defense of democracy and \nfreedom. Back home, these heroes deserve our best resources and support \nto make sure they once again are vibrant and welcomed members in our \nneighborhoods, our towns, and our cities, at our work sites, and in our \nfamilies. None of our returning service members should suffer alone in \nsilence. Nor should their families. We all must do our part. I look \nforward to working with all of my colleagues to ensure passage of this \nbill that champions the successful transition of our newly returning \nheroes to their families, workplaces and communities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3517\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Credit Repair Organizations Act to \nestablish a new disclosure statement; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \namend the Credit Repair Organizations Act, CROA, to stop abusive class \naction lawsuits against companies offering legitimate credit file \nmonitoring products. The following is a summary of why we need to pass \nthis legislation.\n  Credit-monitoring products are offered by consumer reporting \nagencies, their affiliates, and resellers. These products help \nconsumers access their consumer report information and credit scores on \na regular basis. They include credit alert features when derogatory \ninformation appears in the consumer's file or someone obtains the \nconsumer's report. The products give consumers a front-line defense \nagainst identity theft, and are routinely made available to victims of \nsecurity breaches. Credit-monitoring products also educate consumers \nabout their credit scores and credit histories. The market is highly \ncompetitive. Banks and other creditors also provide these products to \ntheir customers.\n  These products are threatened by abusive class action lawsuits, based \non CROA's language. CROA was to combat the assault on the integrity of \naccurate credit file data by credit repair organizations and by \nconsumers acting on their advice. Under CROA, a credit repair \norganization is subject to a number of appropriately harsh and specific \nrequirements. The most significant of these is a prohibition on \ncollecting fees before completion of performance of the promised \nservices. CROA also mandates that consumers be given a written warning \nthat the services cannot result in the change or deletion of negative \nbut accurate data. This ``warning'' would be confusing and \ninappropriate if given to a consumer of credit monitoring products or \nservices.\n  CROA was enacted before credit monitoring products were created. The \nCROA definition of ``credit repair organization'' is intentionally \nbroad in order to prevent circumvention of its coverage. Among other \nthings, the definition includes an entity that implies its activities \nor services can ``improve'' a consumer's credit record, credit history \nor credit rating. The breadth of the definition has been used by \nplaintiffs' lawyers an attempt to obtain statutory damages against \nconsumer reporting agencies and their resellers solely for offering \nthese monitoring\n\n[[Page S5957]]\n\nproducts. The class action lawsuits threaten the viability of the \ncredit-monitoring industry.\n  This result can be prevented through the enactment of a technical \namendment to CROA that clarifies the definition of ``credit repair \norganization'' as it includes ``improving'' a consumer's credit record, \netc. The amendment can explain that ``improving'' a consumer's credit \nrecord does not include credit monitoring, notifications, analysis, \nevaluation, or explanations.\n  Because this is a clarifying amendment, it will not affect the CROA's \nessential operation or Federal agency enforcement. The Federal Trade \nCommission has stated that it does not think credit-monitoring products \nshould be subject to CROA. If this amendment is enacted, consumers will \ncontinue to enjoy CROA's important rights and protections, including \nthe right to bring private lawsuits against credit repair organizations \nfor violations of the act. The amendment to CROA will also assure the \ncontinued availability of credit monitoring products and services for \nconsumers.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join with me in passing this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Conrad, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 3519.

Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Agriculture \nSmall Business Opportunity and Enhancement Act of 2006. Currently, 28 \nStates, including my home State of Utah, have State meat inspection \nprograms. But, outdated Federal laws prohibit the interstate shipment \nof certain meats inspected under these programs. My legislation would \nremove that unfair ban.\n  Let me provide some background on why this legislation is necessary. \nA 1906 law, the Federal Meat Inspection Act, requires the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, USDA, to inspect all cattle, sheep, swine, \ngoats, and horses slaughtered for human consumption. An amendment in \n1957, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, added poultry to that list. \nWhile the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the 1968 Poultry Products \nInspection Act recognized State inspection programs separate from the \nFederal program, these laws also prohibit certain meats inspected under \nState programs from being sold in interstate commerce. That ban applies \nto beef, poultry, pork, lamb, and goat products, but not to specialty \nmeats such as venison, pheasant, quail, rabbit, and numerous others \nthat are typically inspected under State programs.\n  It is important to point out that this ban is unique. State-inspected \nbeef, poultry, pork, lamb, and goat products are the only food \ncommodities that are banned from interstate shipment. Many perishable \nproducts, including milk and other dairy items, fruit, vegetables, and \nfish, which are inspected under State programs, are shipped freely \nacross State lines.\n  There is no legitimate reason for the ban on the interstate shipment \nof State-inspected meats to continue. The State programs are equal or \nsuperior to the Federal program. In fact, the 1967 and 1968 Meat and \nPoultry Inspection Acts require State inspection programs to be ``at \nleast equal to'' the Federal program. Since 1967, USDA has conducted \ncomprehensive reviews of each individual State inspection program to \nverify whether or not the program meets the statutory requirement to be \n``at least equal to'' the Federal program. In the nearly 30 years that \nUSDA has been conducting these reviews, the agency has never \nunilaterally found that a State inspection program should be \ndiscontinued due to an inability to meet Federal food safety standards.\n  Further, the 2002 farm bill required USDA to conduct an additional \ncomprehensive review of State inspection programs. After a 2-year \nstudy, USDA issued an interim report which found that State inspection \nprograms are indeed ``at least equal to'' the Federal inspection \nprogram. In addition, three USDA Advisory Committees have recommended \nthat the ban on interstate shipment be lifted.\n  In short, there is no distinction between the Federal and State \ninspection programs. Without exception, State inspection programs meet \nor exceed Federal food-safety requirements, and USDA has verified the \nsafety of these programs for decades.\n  In Utah, we have 32 establishments that inspect meat under a State's \ninspection program. These establishments, like the nearly 2,000 similar \nplants nationwide, are, for the most part, small businesses. And, \ngenerally speaking, these establishments cater to the needs of small, \nfamily-run farms and ranches. The outdated ban on interstate shipment \nof State-inspected meats clearly disrupts the free flow of trade, \nrestricts market access for countless small businesses, and creates an \nunfair advantage for big businesses.\n  But it gets worse. Current regulations also favor foreign meat \nproducers over small businesses in our Nation. In fact, meat inspected \nin 34 foreign countries can be shipped anywhere in the U.S. because the \nUSDA has certified that the inspection programs in these foreign \ncountries are equivalent to the Federal program. As I have pointed out, \nState inspection programs must meet the same Federal equivalency \nstandard. In fact, USDA supervision of State inspection programs is far \nmore frequent and thorough than its oversight of foreign inspection \nprograms.\n  In my view, it is absurd that meat inspected in 34 foreign countries \ncan be shipped anywhere in the United States without restriction, but \nsmall businesses in 28 States are prohibited from shipping their \nproducts across State lines, even though these small businesses meet \nthe same Federal food safety requirements as their foreign competitors.\n  A ban on interstate shipment of State-inspected meat unfairly hinders \nour Nation's economy. My legislation would remove the outdated, \nunnecessary, unjust ban that puts our small businesses at such a \ndisadvantage. Removing this prohibition will increase competition and \ninnovation. It will provide farmers and ranchers with increased \nopportunities to sell their products at a better price. It will not do \nanything more than level the playing field and ensure that our small \nbusinesses have the opportunity to economically compete in the market.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in defending America's small \nbusinesses by supporting this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 3520. A bill to amend the International Claims Settlement Act of \n1949 to allow for certain claims of nationals of the United States \nagainst Turkey, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as you know, Turkey invaded the northern \narea of the Republic of Cyprus in the summer of 1974. At that time, \nless than 20 percent of the private real property in this area was \nowned by Turkish Cypriots, with the rest owned by Greek Cypriots and \nforeigners. Turkey's invasion and subsequent occupation of northern \nCyprus displaced people who are to this day prevented by the Turkish \narmed forces from returning to and repossessing their homes and \nproperties.\n  A large proportion of these properties were distributed to, and are \ncurrently being used by, the 120,000 Turkish settlers brought into the \noccupied area by Turkey. It is estimated that 7,000 to 10,000 U.S. \nnationals today claim an interest in such property.\n  Adding urgency to the plight of Greek-Cypriots and Americans who lost \nproperty in the wake of the invasion is a recent property development \nboom in the Turkish-occupied north of Cyprus. As an ever-increasing \nnumber of disputed properties are transferred or developed, the \nrightful owners' prospects for recovering their property or being \ncompensated worsen.\n  In 1998, the European Court of Human Rights found that Turkey had \nunlawfully deprived Greek Cypriot refugees of the use of their \nproperties in the north of the island. The Court ruled that the \nGovernment of Turkey was obliged to compensate the refugees for such \ndeprivation, and to allow them to return home.\n  It is to provide similar redress to the American victims of Turkey's \ninvasion and occupation of Cyprus that my colleague Senator Menendez \nand I today introduce the American-Owned Property in Occupied Cyprus \nClaims Act. A substantively identical bill has been\n\n[[Page S5958]]\n\nproposed in the House of Representatives by Representative Pallone and \n32 of his Republican and Democratic colleagues.\n  This act would direct the U.S. Government's independent Foreign \nClaims Settlement Commission to receive, evaluate, and determine awards \nwith respect to the claims of U.S. citizens and businesses that lost \nproperty as a result of Turkey's invasion and continued occupation of \nnorthern Cyprus. To provide funds from which these awards would be \npaid, the act would urge the President to authorize the Secretary of \nState to negotiate an agreement for settlement of such claims with the \nGovernment of Turkey.\n  The act would further grant U.S. Federal courts jurisdiction over \nsuits by U.S. nationals against any private persons--other than \nTurkey--occupying or otherwise using the U.S. national's property in \nthe Turkish-occupied portion of Cyprus. Lastly, the act would expressly \nwaive Turkey's sovereign immunity against claims brought by U.S. \nnationals in U.S. courts relating to property occupied by the \nGovernment of Turkey and used by Turkey in connection with a commercial \nactivity carried out in the United States.\n  This bill represents an important step toward righting the \ninternationally recognized wrong of the expropriation of property, \nincluding American property, in northern Cyprus in the wake of the 1974 \ninvasion by the Turkish Army. I strongly urge my colleagues to promptly \nconsider and pass this critical piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself, Mr. Frist, Mr. Allard, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \n        Sessions, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Alexander, Mr. \n        Graham, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Craig, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \n        Isakson, Mr. DeMint, Mr. McCain, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Thune, Mr. \n        Chambliss, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Bunning, and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 3521. A bill to establish a new budget process to create a \ncomprehensive plan to rein in spending, reduce the deficit, and regain \ncontrol of the Federal budget process; to the Committee on the Budget.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill which is \nsponsored by myself and 20 other Members of the Senate.\n  The purpose of this bill is to put some control over spending--or at \nleast put procedures in--to allow us as a Congress to begin to control \nspending.\n  I think we all recognize that in the short run we are headed toward a \nbudget that looks like it may actually move toward balance. We have \nseen some very significant, positive gains. A deficit that was supposed \nto be about $425 billion this year is down to about $300 billion, and \nit may well go below that. That does not solve our problem even though \nwe have gotten things moving the right way because in the outyears we \nface a fiscal crisis. That is reflected in this chart.\n\n  The fact is, there is facing this country a situation where we have a \ngeneration known as the baby boom generation which is such a large \ngeneration that it has basically overwhelmed the systems of America at \neach point in its evolution. It started out in the early 1950s and late \n1940s. It overwhelmed the school systems it was so big. As it moved \nforward in the 1960s, it created the civil rights movement, and in the \n1980s and 1990s it created the greatest prosperity in the history of \nour country as a result of its size and productivity.\n  But now that generation is beginning to retire. It will start to \nretire in the year 2008. It will be fully retired by the year 2020. It \nwill be the largest retired generation in the history of our Nation by \na factor of two. There will essentially be 70 million people retiring \nduring that period.\n  What are the implications? The implications are rather severe for our \nNation's fiscal policy, and especially for our children. All of our \nretirement systems in this Nation--Social Security, Medicare, \nMedicaid--all our major safety nets were built around the concept \ncreated by FDR, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, that there would always be \nmany more people working than retiring.\n  In fact, in the early 1950s there were about 12 people working and \npaying into the Social Security system for every one person taking it \nout of Social Security. Today there are about three and a half people \nworking for every one person who is retired. By the years 2020 to 2025, \nthere will only be two people working for every one person taking out \nof the system. That means this pyramid concept goes to a rectangle, and \nour children and our grandchildren who will then be the working people \nin America will not be able to support the benefit structure which is \nin place for the retired.\n  This chart reflects the dramatic effect of this situation rather \nstarkly. The blue line represents what percent of gross national \nproduct the Federal Government usually spends. Historically, since \nWorld War II, the Federal Government has spent about 20 percent of the \ngross national product. The red line represents three programs in the \nFederal process: Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The red line \ngrows dramatically beginning in about the year 2008 and proceeds at an \nexponential rate of growth, so that by the years 2025 to 2028 those \nthree programs alone will actually cost more than 20 percent of the \ngross national product of America.\n  What does that mean? It means if we were to spend the historic amount \nwe have spent on the Federal Government, those three programs would use \nup all that money and there would be no money available for education, \nfor national defense, for laying out roads, for health care for \neveryone else, other than those who are retired, or for anything else \nthe Federal Government is supposed to do. Everything would have to be \nspent on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. It does not stop \nthere. It continues up at a rather dramatic movement.\n  The point, of course, is that our children will have to pay the cost. \nThey will find themselves confronted with a dramatic increase in tax \nburden unless we address the cost of those programs from the spending \nside.\n  The point, also, is we really cannot tax our way out of this problem. \nWe cannot possibly raise taxes high enough to keep up with the cost of \nthese programs and still have a viable country. If we did that, we \nwould eliminate the ability of our children to buy a new home, to send \ntheir kids to college, to even buy cars. The lifestyle of an American, \nour children and our grandchildren, would be dramatically reduced--\ntheir quality of life--were we to raise taxes to try to keep up with \nthis rate of growth of spending.\n  Again, it is not a revenue problem; it is a spending problem. That is \nimportant to stress. In fact, if you look at the revenues over the last \nfew years, this reinforces this point. Revenues dropped precipitously \nat the beginning of this President's term for two reasons. One, we had \nthe largest bubble in the history of the world, the Internet bubble, \nback in the late 1990s, where we were essentially producing false \nincome, paper returns through the issuance of stock which wasn't backed \nup by productive companies. This bubble burst, and it was the biggest \nbubble in history, bigger than the tulip or south seas bubble. And the \neffect of it was to cause our economy to retrench.\n  Then we had the attack of September 11, which dramatically impacted \nour psyche as a nation. Obviously, it had a horrific effect in the area \nof loss of lives, but it had a dramatic effect on our economy. Those \ntwo back-to-back events basically forced a significant drop in \nrevenues.\n  So President Bush came in and said: Let's try to get out of this \nrecession--and it was a shallow recession but would have headed a lot \ndeeper--by cutting taxes and giving people an incentive to be more \nproductive. We have heard a lot from the other side about how it is \nterrible we cut taxes at the beginning of this administration. But what \nthose tax cuts did was create an atmosphere where people who wanted to \nbe entrepreneurial, who wanted to go out and take risks, who were \nwilling to put their own personal efforts and their dollars behind an \neffort to be productive, and, thus, create jobs, did exactly that.\n  Then the economy started to recover. We had 39 straight months of \nrecovery. We had one of the largest expansions of the post-World-War II \nperiod. The practical effect of that is that we have created more \neconomic activity, created\n\n[[Page S5959]]\n\nmore jobs, and created more revenue to the Federal Government. So in \nthe last 2 years, the revenue to the Federal Government has actually \njumped greater in a 2-year period than at any time in the post-World-\nWar II period. Each of the last 2 years has had historic increases of \nrevenues for the Federal Government.\n  We are at a point where revenues are essentially at the same place \nthey would be over history as a percent of gross national product. We \nare essentially generating about the same amount of revenue we have \nalways generated to the Federal Government.\n  The other side of the aisle says: Let's raise taxes some more. That \nis not going to help because we are already generating as much revenue \nas we usually generate. We are doing it the right way, with a fair tax \nsystem, telling entrepreneurs to make jobs and create risks. We have \ncreated jobs and given revenues to the Federal Government.\n  The real issue is, you have to be willing to address spending, which \nis what the chart shows. A group on our side of the aisle said: How do \nyou do this? Probably the way to do it is to put in place a series of \nprocesses in the Senate and in the House, which basically forced the \nCongress to address the public policy issues of reducing the rate of \ngrowth and spending for the Federal Government. This is very difficult \nfor an elected body. We know it is a natural tendency of an elected \nbody to spend more money because people come to you and say: We need \nthis for that. Usually the stories are compelling and the purposes are \ngood.\n  The simple fact is, we cannot afford to spend all the money that \npeople want to spend, and we need to have some mechanisms around here \nwhich energize an atmosphere of producing fiscal responsibility, \ndelivering government that is efficient, delivering government that is \neffective, delivering government that people get what they expect, and, \nalso, get their dollars used efficiently and effectively to produce a \ngovernment that works.\n  So we are suggesting a program that basically renews, redesigns; it \nreforms, it rebuilds the Federal system relative to how we are going to \nspend money and makes sure we spend it effectively so we give people an \naffordable government, something that delivers the type of services \nthey need but does it in a way that can be afforded. That is our goal. \nOur goal, essentially, is to contain spending so that we are able to \ndeliver quality government and still pass on to our children a \ngovernment that is affordable, a tax burden they can afford that won't \noverwhelm them and will give them the opportunity to have as good a \nlife as we have had.\n  The proposal we have come up with has a variety of different elements \nto accomplish this. First, we follow the ideas put forward by the \nPresident, which has eight basic elements. It is a very extensive \nreform package, renewal package, redesign package, rebuilding package.\n  The first element is what I call fast-track rescission. I suppose \nthat is too technical. The President calls it the line-item veto. But \nit says the President has the opportunity to look at bills we have \npassed in the Senate and say: Listen, we do not need to spend money on \nthat item. That is really an item of earmark, or maybe you might call \nit pork, or it is just simply not what we need. It is not what the \nAmerican people have to have their dollars spent on. He gets to put \ntogether a package of items, and he sends them to us. He says: These \nare the items I don't think we need. We think the American people don't \nneed them. We don't think the Government can afford them, and you, the \nCongress, can take another look at them and vote them up or down. Fast-\ntrack rescission. We have to take the vote. It is an opportunity for \nthe executive branch to have a say and for the legislative branch to \ntake a second look. We have done it in a way so neither branch is \nprejudiced as to our constitutional role which is very important.\n  The second thing we have done is we have reinstated statutory caps. \nWhat is that? It means that we say every year how much the Federal \nGovernment is going to spend and we lock it down so that if we spend \nover that amount we have to go back and cut somewhere else to bring us \ndown to that number.\n  What has happened around here, we have said we are going to spend X \ndollars. That is called a cap. But we have not had any enforcement \nmechanism behind the cap. Those lapsed in 2002. So when we exceed the \ncap, you get 60 votes and people say: Fine, we will spend the money \nanyway, even though we said we were not going to spend that much money, \nand it is ignored. This puts in place a system where we have to be \nresponsible to the number we set out as to what the Federal Government \nshould spend. It is basically truth in budgeting and forces budgeting \nto be effective and responsive.\n  The third item we put in, we reduce the deficit so it will move to \nzero by 2012. This is done by saying essentially this: The deficit \ntoday is X percent of gross national product. We are going to say that \nthe deficit should be dropped as a percent of gross national product \nevery year until we get to about 2012 where we expect it to be \nbasically no deficit. If we exceed those numbers--in other words, if \nthe deficit exceeds that percent of gross national product which we set \nout in the bill--and these numbers are historical numbers and they are \nobtainable numbers.\n  In fact, in the first 2 years, the numbers we have set out are \nbasically above where the actual deficit looks like it will hit, and it \nis about the third and fourth year we may have some issues to keep the \ndeficit moving down--but if the deficit is not moving down, we put in \nplace a process called reconciliation, directed at entitlement \nspending.\n  The problem we have as a Federal Government isn't the discretionary \nside of the ledger. That is spending that occurs every year. Every year \nyou have to spend X dollars on defense, X dollars on education, and you \ncan make a choice regarding how much you will spend here, how much you \nspend there. Nondefense spending in those accounts has been flat for \nthe last few years, essentially flat if you factor in inflation. The \nreal growth of the Federal Government has been in these accounts that \nare entitlement accounts, mandatory accounts which I had on the first \nchart, three of the major ones. They represent, along with the Federal \ndebt, about 60 percent of Federal spending.\n  What this bill says is that essentially you have to go back and take \na look at those accounts if we are not meeting our deficit targets and \nbring them into line so we will meet those deficit targets.\n  Now, in order to help accomplish this, this proposal also includes an \nentitlement commission. There have been a lot of commissions around \nhere and everyone is a little tired of commissions. This commission is \ndifferent. This commission says take a look at the entitlement accounts \nof the Federal Government, report back to the Congress, and Congress \nmust act on your proposal. We actually put in place a policy procedure \nto try to correct the entitlement issue. Then we put in place a \nbudgeting procedure which allows us to legislate changes if the \nentitlement improvements are not accomplishing our goals.\n  The purpose is to make these entitlement programs affordable for our \nchildren while they still maintain a quality lifestyle for those who \nare retired. That can be and should be able to be accomplished. But it \ntakes a Congress being willing to step up to the plate and doing it. So \nfar, we have not been willing to do that. We have been burying our head \nin the sand on that issue.\n  Another element in this proposal is a BRAC commission, a proposal \nfrom Senator Brownback, which essentially looks at the whole \nGovernment, independent of the Defense Department, which was looked at \nunder its own BRAC commission. And if you recall, it looked at the \nentire Defense Department and decided what the Defense Department \nneeded and didn't need and set up a package and we voted on it as a \npackage.\n  This is a ``BRAC Commission'' for the Government with very strong, \nthoughtful people being appointed to the Commission, the same way the \nBRAC Commission was set up relative to the Defense Department. We will \nbe able to take a look at functions of the Government which maybe \nshould be eliminated or reduced or significantly changed.\n  It is a good proposal. It is also a proposal that includes biennial \nbudgeting--an idea that is strongly supported by the Senator from \nAlabama, Mr. Sessions, who is managing the bill on the floor right now, \nand the Senator\n\n[[Page S5960]]\n\nfrom New Mexico--so we can have a budget process where we are not \nalways looking at the budget every year and everybody spinning their \nwheels around the budget but, rather, having a year where we develop a \nbudget and a year where we do a lot more oversight. That is the theory \nbehind that, so we can become more efficient.\n  Finally, it has reforms to what is known as the reconciliation \nprocess. The reconciliation process is the teeth under which we \naccomplish savings in the budget process. But it can also, \nunfortunately, be used for expanding spending if it is not handled \nproperly. So these reforms make it clear that reconciliation is \nprimarily for the purposes of controlling spending, not of expanding \nspending.\n  So the goal is simple. The goal is to put in place a package which \nwill allow us as a Congress to step up and address the issue of \noverspending. That is why we call it SOS, ``stop overspending.'' The \npurpose of that goal is to be able to pass on to our children a \ngovernment that is affordable, that continues to deliver the services \npeople expect, continues to give high-quality services but does it in \nan affordable way so our children's quality of life is not overwhelmed \nby the burden of a government that is trying to support a retired \ngeneration that is huge.\n  Again, I must stress, that you cannot do this on the tax side. You \ncannot solve the issues of the deficit, you cannot solve the issues of \nentitlement concerns on the tax side. There is simply too much \nprogrammatic commitment in the pipeline to accomplish that.\n  Let me give you a couple numbers to highlight that fact. The General \nAccounting Office--the comptroller of the Government--has told us there \nis presently pending relative to entitlement responsibility for retired \npeople an obligation which we don't know how we are going to pay for--\nthat is called an unfunded liability--of $46 trillion; and that is \n``trillion'' with a ``T.'' So that is $46 trillion of responsibility \nthat we have put on the books in costs that we don't really know how we \nare going to pay for.\n  I don't know what $1 trillion is. It is very hard to comprehend $1 \ntrillion. But just to put it in some sort of context, since the \nbeginning of this country, since our Revolution, we have paid something \nlike $43 trillion in taxes. So all the taxes paid since this country \nstarted would not pay for the bills we have on the books for our \nupcoming retired generation. Or to put it in another context, if you \ntook all the assets owned in America today--all the cars, all the \nhomes, all the stock, all the small businesses, all the big \nbusinesses--and totaled them up, their total is about $47 trillion in \nnet value. So we have on the books a liability that is essentially the \nsame as the net worth of our Nation. That is a serious problem, and you \ncannot deal with that problem by simply raising taxes.\n  The other side of the aisle has not put forward any substantive ideas \nin this area relative to spending. They have suggested a proposal \ncalled pay-go, which is a stalking-horse for tax increases. Fine. That \nis their position: We should raise taxes to address all problems. But \nwe know from the numbers that are now coming in at the Treasury that we \nare already taxing Americans at a level which is at our historic level, \nour traditional level, and that revenues to the Federal Government are \njumping significantly because of the good tax policies we have in \nplace, the fair tax policies we have in place.\n  So we know you cannot solve this problem by continuing to raise taxes \non the American people. The total tax burden to the American people \ntoday, including State, local, and Federal, is almost at a historic \nhigh. How much higher can you put that tax burden on the American \npeople? No, you cannot do it on that side of the ledger. In fact, what \nwe have proven is you generate more revenues by giving people an \nincentive to be productive and to go out and create jobs by having a \nfair and reasonable tax rate rather than jumping tax rates to the point \nwhere people have a disincentive to be productive and thus start to \nreduce revenues to the Federal Government.\n  That was proven by John Kennedy, confirmed by Ronald Reagan, and now \nconfirmed again by George W. Bush. It should be accepted policy around \nhere, but it is rejected by the other side of the aisle, which still \nsubscribes to this 1930s philosophy of governance, which is that you \ncan always raise taxes to meet any problem. No. The problem is that we \nneed to be willing to step up and address spending.\n  This package, if it were to pass in its entirety--I hope the other \nside will not obstruct it coming to the floor. We hope to mark it up in \nBudget next week and report it out, and hope the other side will let us \ntake it up. Let's have a free-flowing debate out here on the floor \nabout how you address this issue.\n  The outyear threat to our children--which is a function of the fact \nthere is a baby boom generation floating around here that is huge--is \nnot going to go away and is going to demand significant services which \nwill cost a dramatic amount of money.\n  Our proposal is comprehensive and extensive. It is a rebuilding, \nretooling approach toward how we manage this Congress and especially \nour budgets. It is a constructive approach, one that is committed \ntoward delivering an affordable and effective government and a \ngovernment that does not overburden our children and our grandchildren \nwith taxes. So it will lead to a balanced budget, and it will lead to a \ngovernment that is affordable.\n  I thank all my colleagues who have joined me in this effort, and I do \nhope we can move it forward.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. First, I wish to say to any Americans listening and all \nour colleagues, when Chairman Gregg speaks about long-term financial \nchallenges facing this Nation, we ought to listen. ``E.F. Hutton'' \nspeaks. So our ``E.F. Hutton'' is speaking, and I could not be more \nproud of the package he has proposed because all of those proposals, in \nmy view, are not only workable but they will work.\n  What we tend to do around here a lot is we propose packages and \nideas, and the ones that pass will not actually work.\n  I say to Chairman Gregg, you had a chart that showed a declining \ndeficit. Would you put that up? I just want to raise one point about it \nbecause it, perhaps, raises a misconception. It shows a reduction of \nthe deficit and, in effect, a zero deficit. But you do not mean by that \nthat to achieve that huge reduction in our current deficit, we have to \ncut spending; is that correct?\n  Mr. GREGG. No.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Is it necessary we actually cut the current rate of \nspending to achieve that?\n  Mr. GREGG. Absolutely not. In fact, under most scenarios, the current \nrate of spending on almost all of these major programs--such as \nMedicare, Social Security, and Medicaid--would rise significantly; they \njust would not rise as fast. Medicare, for example, would probably, \nover this 5-year period, rise by about 40 percent, instead of 43 \npercent--something like that. Those are numbers off the top of my head, \nbut those are the types of numbers we are talking about. You are \ntalking about increased spending but at a slower rate and affordable.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. And even with this long-term 20-, 30-, 60-year \nprojection of larger deficits, if we just contain the growth in the \nentitlement programs by a realistic amount, we could have a great \nimpact on reducing those projected deficits; isn't that correct?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator from Alabama is absolutely \nright. We do not have to cut anywhere. All we have to do is slow the \nrate of growth so it is an affordable rate of growth because the \ncompounding effect of slowing these rates of growth is huge.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is such an important answer.\n  Let me ask the Senator this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. With regard to the growth of revenue to our \nGovernment--and you had a chart which showed that--as I recall, last \nyear we showed over 14 percent growth, and with this year almost half \ngone, we are looking at in excess of 11 percent growth. That is after \ntaxes have been cut. Is that correct?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator from Alabama is correct. The \nrate\n\n[[Page S5961]]\n\nof growth of revenues to the Federal Government last year was about 14 \npercent. This year, through the first 6 months, it was about 11 percent \nand continues to grow dramatically. That is a function of the fact that \nwe now have a tax policy which encourages people to go out and take \nrisks and create jobs, which creates revenue.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator because he has given us optimism \nand hope that we can reduce this deficit, and he has shown us we can do \nthis without slashing our social programs or any other spending but \njust contain the growth.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      BY Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Smith, Mr. Craig, and Mrs. \n        Murray):\n  S. 3522. A bill to amend the Bonneville Power Administration portions \nof the Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Act of 2000 to \nauthorize appropriations for fiscal years 2006 through 2012, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by Senator \nGordon Smith, Senator Larry Craig and Senator Patty Murray in \nintroducing the Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Act of \n2006--or FRIMA. Our legislation extends a homegrown, commonsense \nprogram that has a proven track record in helping restore Northwestern \nsalmon runs. Dollar-for-dollar, the fish screening and fish passage \nfacilities funded by our legislation are among the most cost-effective \nuses of public and private restoration dollars. These projects protect \nfish while producing significant benefits. That is why it is important \nthat this program be reauthorized and funding be appropriated now.\n  Since 2001, when the original Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation \nMitigation Act of 2000, FRIMA, was enacted, more than $9 million in \nFederal funds has leveraged nearly $20 million in private, local \nfunding. This money has been used to protect, enhance, and restore more \nthan 550 river miles of important fish habitat and species throughout \nOregon, Washington, Idaho, and western Montana. For decades, State, \ntribal and Federal fishery agencies in the Pacific Northwest have \nidentified the screening of irrigation and other water diversions, and \nimproved fish passage, as critically important for the survival of \nsalmon and other fish populations.\n  This program is very popular and has the support of a wide range of \nconstituents, including community leaders, environmental organizations, \nand agricultural producers. Senator Smith and I are proud of the \nsuccessful collaborative projects that irrigators and members of the \nOregon Water Resources Congress have completed while putting this \nprogram to work in our home State. Our program also has the support of \nOregon Governor Ted Kulongoski, irrigators throughout the Northwestern \nStates, Oregon Trout, American Rivers and the National Audubon Society.\n  FRIMA authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to establish a program \nto plan, design, and construct fish screens, fish passage devices, and \nrelated features. It also authorizes inventories to provide the \ninformation needed for planning and making decisions about the survival \nand propagation of all Northwestern fish species. The program is \ncurrently carried out by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on behalf \nof the Interior Secretary.\n  FRIMA provides benefits by: keeping fish out of places where they \nshould not be--such as in an irrigation system; easing upstream and \ndownstream fish passage; improving the protection, survival, and \nrestoration of native fish species; helping avoid new endangered \nspecies listings by protecting and enhancing the fish populations not \nyet listed; making progress toward the de-listing of listed species; \nutilizing a positive, win/win, public-private partnership; and, \nassisting in achieving both sustainable agriculture and fisheries. \nSince FRIMA's enactment in 2001, 103 projects have been installed. This \nis a true partnership and fine example of how our fisheries and farmers \ncan work together to protect fish species throughout the Northwest.\n  While he was Governor of Idaho, Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne \nsaid, ``. . . the FRIMA program serves as an excellent example of \ngovernment and private land owners working together to promote \nconservation. The screening of irrigation diversions plays a key role \nin Idaho's efforts to restore salmon populations while protecting rural \neconomies.'' [from ``Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation \nPrograms, FY 2002-2004'', U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Washington, \nD.C., July, 2005, p. 13]\n  The bill that we are introducing today specifically extends the \nauthorization for this program through 2012; gives priority to projects \ncosting less than $2.5 million--a reduction in a targeted project's \ncost from $5,000,000 to $2,500,000; clarifies that projects funded \nunder the act are viewed as recipients of a ``pass through program'' \nand not a ``grant'' program; that any Bonneville Power Administration, \nBPA, funds provided either directly or through a grant to another \nentity shall be considered non-Federal matching funds--because BPA's \nfunding comes from ratepayers; requires an inventory report describing \nfunded projects and their benefits; and changes the administrative \nexpenses formula used by the Fish & Wildlife Service and the States of \nOregon, Washington, Montana and Idaho, so that administrative costs are \nscaled in proportion to the amount of funds appropriated for the \nprogram each year.\n  Ultimately, it will take the combined efforts of all interests in our \nregion to recover our salmon. State, Tribal and local governments, \nlocal watershed councils, private landowners and the Federal Government \nneed to continue working together. Initiatives such as the bill I am \nintroducing today help to sustain the partnerships upon which \nsuccessful salmon recovery will be based.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to see this legislation \npass.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a letter of \nsupport from Oregon Governor Kulongoski be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3522\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Energy and Natural Resources \n         Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Domenici and Bingaman: I write in support of \n     the re-authorization of the Fisheries Restoration and \n     Irrigation Mitigation Act (FRIMA). In addition, I support the \n     funding 1evel originally authorized by Congress of $25 \n     million per year.\n       The Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Act is \n     one of the most successful cost share programs in the Pacific \n     Northwest, funding the installation of fish screens and \n     ladders at irrigation diversions in Idaho, Montana, Oregon \n     and Washington. Conservationists support it because it saves \n     wild, migrating Endangered Species Act (ESA) listed fish such \n     as Steelhead, Coho and Chinook salmon, as well as those \n     produced in state and federal hatcheries. Irrigated \n     agriculture supports the program both for its conservation \n     effects and because it helps protect operators from possible \n     federal enforcement actions resulting from take of ESA fish.\n       It is widely accepted that correcting fish barrier, \n     diversion and screen problems is a very cost-effective \n     investment. Each federal FRIMA dollar has been matched by \n     $1.37 in state or local dollars. Participants have \n     contributed a total of 58 percent toward the cost share--\n     exceeding the legal requirement of 35 percent--and also pay \n     100 percent of project operation and maintenance costs. The \n     FRIMA projects are completed quickly because existing state \n     fish screening and passage programs are used to implement \n     projects.\n       The program, which I have summarized for you in the \n     enclosed fact sheet, has resulted in fish-friendly irrigation \n     projects as well as increased spawning and rearing habitat. \n     Since FRIMA's introduction in 2000, 103 projects have been \n     installed, providing fish access to 553 miles of habitat \n     upstream and screening a total volume of water at 1,572,757 \n     gallons per minute. Healthy fish populations produce \n     commercial and recreational fishing opportunities, which are \n     essential to our coastal economies and rural communities that \n     have often lost other industries in recent years.\n       Due to its popularity and success, there is a backlog of \n     hundreds of potential FRIMA projects. To date, appropriations \n     have averaged only $3 million per year, or $750,000 per \n     state, per year. This amount has jump-started the process, \n     but is inadequate given the magnitude of the available \n     projects and the fish benefits they are designed to provide.\n       I urge you to increase funding to $25 million per year--the \n     level originally authorized by Congress--so we can continue \n     increasing fish populations, assisting irrigators in \n     installing fish protection devices and bolstering local \n     economies.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Theodore R. Kulongoski,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 FRIMA\n\n       Re-authorization Fact Sheet\n       Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Act 2000 \n     (P.L. 106-502).\n       FRIMA is a highly popular and cost-effective voluntary fish \n     screening and passage partnership program that benefits \n     Idaho, western Montana, Oregon and Washington.\n       Why do fish need protection at water diversions?\n       Water diversions redirect water from streams and rivers so \n     it can be used for crop irrigation, power, drinking water, \n     and other beneficial purposes. Water diversions also block \n     the normal migration of fish and pull fish into pumps, \n     irrigation canals, and fields greatly reducing their \n     survival.\n       Benefits of fish protection 98% of young salmon survive an \n     encounter with a properly designed fish screen that meets \n     accepted state and federal criteria. Fish protection devices \n     benefit by: Keeping fish out of places where they should not \n     be (like an irrigation system); providing safe upstream and \n     downstream fish passage; improving the protection, survival, \n     and restoration of native fish species; achieving both \n     sustainable agriculture and sustainable fisheries.\n       How the program works\n       FRIMA is a 65%/35% cost share program requiring that grant \n     recipients contribute at least 35% in non-federal matching \n     funds. Projects must: Be associated with an irrigation, or \n     other water diversion; benefits fish species native to the \n     project area; have a local, state, tribal or federal \n     government sponsor or co-applicant.\n       Successful cost share 2000-2005: 83 fish screens installed, \n     screening 1,572,757 gallons of water per minute; 20 fishways \n     installed, opening 553 miles of habitat to fish; $1 in FRIMA \n     funds leverage $1.37 in state/local funds; participants have \n     contributed 58% in cost share, which is much more than the \n     required 35%.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 3523. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat the Tax Court may review claims for equitable innocent spouse \nrelief and to suspend the running on the period of limitations while \nsuch claims are pending; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that \nenhances the innocent spouse equitable relief provision of the Internal \nRevenue Code. Through only minor legislative modifications, this bill \nclarifies the statute's original intent, affording innocent spouses the \nnecessary recourse to ensure their cases and circumstances are given a \nfair hearing.\n  According to section 6015(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the IRS \nmay relieve an innocent spouse of liability for unpaid taxes generated \nthrough the filing of a joint tax return if ``taking into account all \nthe facts and circumstances'' it would be inequitable to hold the \nspouse responsible.\n  Little recourse exists, however, to prevent the IRS from seizing \nassets or garnishing wages if a petition for innocent spouse equitable \nrelief is not approved.\n  Recent decisions of the Eighth and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals \nhave denied the Tax Court jurisdiction over petitions for equitable \nrelief under the Innocent Spouse Statute. Consequently, there is no \nmechanism for review or appeal of these IRS decisions.\n  The story of one of my constituents provides a stunning example of \nthe problem.\n  The IRS seized all of her husband's income to pay a tax liability \nincurred 20 years earlier, before they were married. Because the IRS \nseized the entirety of the income, the taxes on the income remained \nunpaid.\n  When her husband died, the IRS pursued the innocent spouse for the \ntaxes\n\n[[Page S5963]]\n\non her husband's income. She was forced to sell her family home and all \nproperty owned jointly with her husband. My constituent is employed, \nbut due to financial hardship she must live with friends. Even so, the \nIRS may have her wages garnished along with funds set aside for her in \ntrust by a probate court.\n  Because the Tax Court does not have jurisdiction to review claims for \ninnocent spouse equitable relief, my constituent can do little to \nprevent the IRS from seizing what remains.\n  The aim of this legislation is to provide an avenue through which \ninnocent spouse equitable relief decisions may be appealed, if \noriginally denied by the IRS.\n  This bill: expressly provides that the Tax Court has jurisdiction to \nreview the denial of equitable innocent spouse relief under Internal \nRevenue Code section 6015(f); and suspends IRS collection activity \nwhile a request for relief under Internal Revenue Code section 6015(f) \nis pending.\n  I believe that my proposal would provide a straightforward and \nuncontroversial solution to the unfair treatment of innocent spouses \nunder current law. Moreover, without this bill, an increasing number of \ninnocent spouse equitable relief appeals will remain in limbo--pending, \nwith no method for consideration.\n  When this body enhanced innocent spouse protections--through passage \nof the 1998 Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act--the \ngoal was to modernize, simplify, and streamline the cumbersome process \nof seeking relief from liabilities of tax, interest, and related \npenalties.\n  Unfortunately, the conference report on the 1998 act included vague \nlanguage, which ultimately has left innocent spouses with no avenue for \nappeal.\n  It is worth noting that the IRS grants fewer than three in 10 \nrequests for innocent spouse relief. This bill in no way guarantees \nrelief, but rather fixes the broken appeals process for these IRS \ndecisions.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this small change that will have a \nprofound effect on the lives of many innocent spouses--mostly women--\nwho deserve their day in court.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 3523\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein, in introducing legislation to clarify \nthe jurisdiction of the U.S. Tax Court in cases involving ``equitable \nrelief'' for innocent spouse claims.\n  In general, spouses who sign joint tax returns are held jointly and \nseverally liable for taxes owed on such returns. An individual may be \nrelieved from such liability if she meets the ``innocent spouse'' test \nset forth in section 6015 of the Internal Revenue Code. The current \nstandards were put in place by the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of \n1998.\n  An article published in the New York Times in late 1999 notes that \nthe number of innocent spouse applications increased sharply after the \n1998 law and that as many as 90 percent of the people filing innocent \nspouse applications are women. Clearly, the 1998 law opened an \nimportant avenue for ex-spouses to challenge unexpected tax bills they \nreceived after their former spouses cheated on their taxes without the \nknowledge of the ``innocent'' spouse.\n  Unfortunately, the 1998 law also left uncertain the Tax Court's \njurisdiction to hear appeals from denials of ``equitable relief.'' The \nTreasury Secretary is authorized to grant equitable relief if a \ntaxpayer does not meet any of the statutorily specified qualifications \nfor being an innocent spouse. But while the Tax Court was given \njurisdiction to hear appeals under those specific avenues spelled out \nin the Code, the Code is silent on whether the Tax Court can hear \nappeals based on the Treasury Secretary's equitable relief authority. \nRecent decisions by the Eight and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals have \nheld that the Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to hear petitions for \ninnocent spouse equitable relief.\n  The legislation Senator Feinstein and I have introduced makes clear \nthat the Tax Court has jurisdiction to hear appeals of decisions \ndenying equitable relief. The National Taxpayer Advocate has \nrecommended that Congress pass this legislation, and I am hopeful that \nwe can move this important bill through the Finance Committee in very \nshort order.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 3526. A bill to amend the Indian Land Consolidation Act to modify \ncertain requirements under that Act; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today a bill to amend \nvarious provisions of the Indian Land Consolidation Act, ILCA. Some of \nthese amendments are of a technical or clarifying nature; others have \nthe effect of delaying the effective date of certain provisions of the \nIndian Probate Code set forth in ILCA section 207.\n  Section 1 of the bill clarifies the meaning of certain defined terms \nused in ILCA--``trust or restricted interest land'' and ``land''--and \nalso delays the application of the act's probate code to permanent \nimprovements located on Indian trust lands until after July 20, 2007. \nThis delay will provide additional time to analyze how the probate code \nshould apply to permanent improvements and determine whether further \namendments are needed. The definition of land is amended to clarify \nthat a decedent's interest in such improvements is included in the term \n``land'' only for purposes of intestate succession under ILCA section \n207(a) and even then only when the improvements are located on a parcel \nof trust or restricted land that is itself included in the decedent's \nestate. Thus, ``land'' would not include a decedent's interest in \npermanent improvements located on tribal trust land or for that matter \non individually owned trust land if the underlying parcel of land is \nnot itself part of the decedent's estate.\n  Section 2 of the bill also amends the ``single heir rule'' of ILCA \nsection 207(a)(2)(D)--which governs the inheritance of interests that \nare less than 5 percent of the total undivided interest in a parcel of \nland--by making it inapplicable to any interest in the estate of a \ndecedent who dies during the period beginning on the enactment date of \nthe clause and ending on July 20, 2007, and authorizing the Secretary \nof Interior to extend this period for up to 1 year.\n  The bill would also delay until July 21, 2007, the application of the \npresumption in ILCA section 207(c) that a devise of a trust interest to \nmore than 1 person creates a joint tenancy absent clear language in the \nwill to the contrary. It would amend ILCA section\n\n[[Page S5964]]\n\n207(o), which authorizes purchase of interests during probate, in \nvarious ways, but most significantly limiting nonconsensual purchases \nto the Secretary and the Indian tribe; clarifying that the 5 percent \nthreshold applies to the decedent's interest rather than to the \ninterest passing to an heir; and holding the rule allowing \nnonconsensual purchase at probate of small interests inapplicable to \ninterests in the estate of any decedent who dies on or before July 20, \n2007. This section would also authorize the Secretary to extend this \nperiod for up to 1 additional year.\n  The amendments delaying the application of these provisions will give \nIndian landowners more time to understand how these provisions work and \nplan their estates accordingly. The delays of the single heir rule and \nnonconsensual purchase option at probate will also allow the Department \nmore time to have procedures and systems in place to determine whether \na given interest is above or below the 5 percent threshold that \ntriggers the application of the rules.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3526\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Blue Collar Computing and \n     Business Assistance Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Computational science, the use of advanced computing \n     capabilities to understand and solve complex problems, \n     including the development of new products and processes, is \n     now critical to scientific leadership, economic \n     competitiveness, and national security.\n       (2) Advances in computational science and high performance \n     computing provide a competitive advantage because they allow \n     businesses to run faster simulations of complex systems or to \n     develop more precise computer models.\n       (3) The Federal Government is one of the investors in \n     research aimed at the development of new computational \n     science and high-performance computing capabilities.\n       (4) As determined by the Council on Competitiveness, the \n     Nation's small businesses and manufacturers must ``Out \n     Compute to Out Compete''. However, new computational science \n     technologies are not being transferred effectively from the \n     research organizations to small businesses and manufacturers.\n       (5) Small businesses and manufacturers are especially well-\n     positioned to benefit from increased availability and \n     utilization of high-performance computing technologies and \n     software.\n       (6) Current cost and technology barriers associated with \n     high-performance computing and software algorithms often \n     inhibit small businesses and manufacturers from successfully \n     making use of these technologies.\n       (7) The establishment of an advanced multidisciplinary \n     computing software institute will help make existing high \n     performance computing resources more accessible to small \n     businesses and manufacturers. This will create new \n     opportunities for economic growth, jobs, and product \n     development.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide grants \n     for the creation of an Advanced Multidisciplinary Computing \n     Software Institute that will--\n\n[[Page S5965]]\n\n       (1) develop and compile high-performance computing software \n     and algorithms suitable for applications in small business \n     and manufacturing;\n       (2) effectively carry out the transfer of new computational \n     science and high-performance computing technologies to small \n     businesses and manufacturers; and\n       (3) actively assist small businesses and manufacturers in \n     utilizing such technologies.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, the manufacturing sector is under siege from \ncheap imports, unfair trade agreements, and escalating heath care and \nenergy costs. Instead of working to alleviate this burden, the Bush \nadministration has turned its back on manufacturing; focusing instead \non tax cuts for the rich and their heirs. Indeed, the administration \nhas slashed funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, MEP, \nand the Advanced Technology Program, ATP, in this year's budget. MEP \nhelps manufacturers streamline operations, integrate new technologies, \nshorten production times, and lower costs. ATP provides grants to \nsupport research and development of high risk, cutting edge \ntechnologies. Both MEP and ATP help manufacturers survive and compete \nwith countries like China.\n  I today offer, with Senator DeWine, some more help for beleaguered \nmanufacturers. The Blue Collar Computing and Business Assistance Act of \n2006 was\n\n[[Page S5966]]\n\ndrafted from recommendations made by the Council on Competitiveness \nregarding high performance computing. The legislation would provide \ngrants for the creation of five Advanced Computing Software Centers \nthroughout the United States that would transfer high performance \ncomputing technologies to small businesses and manufacturers.\n  High Performance Computing will allow manufacturers to visualize and \nsimulate parts and products before they can be created which will cut \nthe time and cost required to experiment with new materials. General \nMotors, for example, uses high performance computing to simulate \ncollisions, saving millions of dollars in development costs and \nsubstantially shortening design cycle times.\n  Presently, only large companies like GM have the resources to reap \nthe benefits of high performance computing. This bill would provide \ngrants to small and medium manufacturers to implement this technology \nand create new opportunities for economic growth, job creation and \nproduct development and allow manufacturers and businesses to harness \nthe full potential of high performance computing.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 3529. A bill to ensure that new mothers and their families are \neducated about postpartum depression, screened for symptoms, and \nprovided with essential services, and to increase research at the \nNational Institutes of Health on postpartum depression; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend Senator \nDurbin to introduce the Mom's Opportunity to Access Help, Education, \nResearch, and Support for Postpartum Depression, MOTHERS, Act. Senator \nDurbin has been and continues to be a leader on this issue and I am \ngrateful for the opportunity to work with him on this important \nlegislation. I would also like to recognize Representative Rush, who \nhas been a champion for women battling postpartum depression, PPD, in \nthe House for many years. I am proud to say that his bill, The Melanie \nStokes Postpartum Depression Research and Care Act, shares the same \ngoals as the legislation I am introducing today.\n  In the United States, 10 to 20 percent of women suffer from a \ndisabling and often undiagnosed condition known as postpartum \ndepression. Unfortunately, many women are unaware of this condition and \noften do not receive the treatment they need. That is why I am \nintroducing the MOTHERS Act, so that women no longer have to suffer in \nsilence and feel alone when faced with this difficult condition.\n  Recently, the great State of New Jersey passed a first-of-its-kind \nlaw requiring doctors and nurses to educate expectant mothers and their \nfamilies about postpartum depression. This bill was introduced in the \nState legislature by State Senate President Richard Codey. The \nattention Senator Codey and his wife, Mary Jo Codey--who personally \nbattled postpartum depression--have brought to the issue is remarkable. \nBrooke Shields, a graduate of Princeton University, has also shared her \nstruggle with postpartum depression publicly and should be commended \nfor her efforts to bring awareness to this condition. Postpartum \ndepression affects women all across the country, not just in New \nJersey, and that is why I believe the MOTHERS Act is so important.\n  In America, 80 percent of women experience some level of depression \nafter childbirth. This is what people often refer to as the ``baby \nblues.'' However, each year, there are between 400,000 and 800,000 \nwomen across America who suffer from postpartum depression, a much more \nserious condition. These mothers often experience signs of depression \nand may lose interest in friends and family, feel overwhelming sadness \nor even have thoughts of harming their baby or harming themselves. \nPeople often assume that these feelings are simply the ``baby blues,'' \nbut the reality is much worse. Postpartum depression is a serious and \ndisabling condition and new mothers deserve to be given information and \nresources on this condition so, if needed, they can get the appropriate \nhelp.\n  The good news is that treatment is available. Many women have \nsuccessfully recovered from postpartum depression with the help of \ntherapy, medication, and support groups. However, mothers and their \nfamilies must be educated so that they understand what might occur \nafter the birth of their child and when to get help. The legislation I \nam introducing today will require doctors and nurses to educate every \nnew mother and their families about postpartum depression before they \nleave the hospital and offer the opportunity for new mothers to be \nscreened for postpartum depression symptoms during the first year of \npostnatal check-up visits. It also provides social services to new \nmothers and their families who are suffering and struggling with \npostpartum depression. By increasing education and early treatment of \npostpartum depression, mothers, husbands, and families will be able to \nrecognize the symptoms of this condition and help new mothers get the \ntreatment they need and deserve.\n  The MOTHERS Act has another important component. While we continue to \neducate and help the mothers of today, we must also be prepared to help \nfuture moms. By increasing funding for research on postpartum \nconditions at the National Institutes of Health, we can begin to \nunravel the mystery behind this difficult to understand illness. The \nmore we know about the causes and etiology of postpartum depression, \nthe more tools we have to treat and prevent this heartbreaking \ncondition.\n  We must attack postpartum depression on all fronts with education, \nscreening, support, and research so that new moms can feel supported \nand safe rather than scared and alone. Many new mothers sacrifice \nanything and everything to provide feelings of security and safety to \ntheir innocent, newborn child. It is our duty to provide the same level \nof security, safety and support to new mothers in need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/15/senate-section/article/S5966-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 513--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n PRESIDENT SHOULD DESIGNATE THE WEEK BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 10, 2006, AS \n     ``NATIONAL HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WEEK''\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \nDeWine, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Talent, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Obama, Mr. Voinovich, \nMs. Landrieu, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Lott, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \nChambliss, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Specter, Mr. Allen, Mr. Burr, Mr. McCain, Mr. \nCochran, Mr. Biden, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mrs. Dole) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution to \ncondemn an action that I find terribly appalling. On April 29, 2006, \nthe municipal government of St. Denis, France, named a street in honor \nof Mumia Abu-Jamal, the convicted killer of Philadelphia Police Officer \nDanny Faulkner. Representative Fitzpatrick has introduced a similar \nresolution in the House of Representatives.\n  On the morning of December 9, 1981, Officer Danny Faulkner, a 5 year \nveteran of the Philadelphia Police Department, made a traffic stop at \nLocust Street near Twelfth Street. The car stopped by Officer Faulkner \nwas driven by William Cook who was driving the wrong way down a one way \nstreet. William Cook's brother, Mumia Abu-Jamal, was across the street. \nAs Faulkner attempted to handcuff William Cook, Abu-Jamal ran from \nacross the street and shot the officer in the back. Faulkner was able \nto fire one shot that struck Abu-Jamal in the chest; the wounded \nofficer then fell to the pavement. Mumia Abu-Jamal stood over the \nofficer and shot him four more times at close range, including one \ndirectly in the face. Abu-Jamal was found at the scene of the shooting \nby officers who arrived there within seconds.\n  Official ballistics tests on the fatal bullet confirmed that Officer \nFaulkner was killed by a bullet identical in type, brand, and caliber \nto the bullet found in Abu-Jamal's gun. Witnesses to the brutal slaying \nidentified Abu-Jamal as the killer both at the scene and during his \ntrial. In July 1982, Mumia Abu-Jamal was convicted of murdering Officer \nDanny Faulkner and was sentenced to death. Abu-Jamal has had numerous \nlegal appeals, including to the PA State Supreme Court and the U.S. \nSupreme Court, and his conviction has been upheld each time.\n  I am outraged that the municipal government of St. Denis, France \nwould make such a thoughtless and insensitive decision as to name a \nstreet after the murderer of a Philadelphia police officer. This is a \nmonumental insult to the memory of Danny Faulkner, to his family, and \nto the courageous men and women who put on a police uniform every day \nto protect our communities. Officer Danny Faulkner gave his life to \nkeep our nation's streets safe. St. Denis lawmakers have made the \nchilling decision of choosing to support a cold-blooded killer over a \npolice officer who made the ultimate sacrifice.\n  I hope my Senate colleagues will join me in condemning the murder of \nOfficer Faulkner, and urging the municipal government of St. Denis to \ntake immediate action to change the name of ``Rue Mumia Abu-Jamal.'' If \nsuch action is not taken, this resolution urges the French Government \nto take appropriate action against the city of St. Denis to change the \nname of the street. Finally, this resolution appropriately commends all \npolice officers for their commitment to public service and public \nsafety. I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/15/senate-section/article/S5967-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5967-S5968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4253.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Nevada Test Site Veterans' \n     Compensation Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Employees working on Cold War-era nuclear weapons \n     programs were employed in facilities owned by the Federal \n     Government and the private sector producing and testing \n     nuclear weapons and engaging in related atomic energy defense \n     activities for the national defense beginning in the 1940s.\n       (2) These Cold War atomic energy veterans helped to build \n     and test the nuclear arsenal that served as a deterrent \n     during the Cold War, sacrificing their personal health and \n     well-being in service of their country.\n       (3) During the Cold War, many of these workers were exposed \n     to radiation and placed in harm's way by the Department of \n     Energy and contractors, subcontractors, and vendors of the \n     Department without their knowledge and consent, without \n     adequate radiation monitoring, and without necessary\n\n[[Page S5972]]\n\n     protections from internal or external occupational radiation \n     exposure.\n       (4) The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation \n     Program Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.) (in this section \n     referred to as ``EEOICPA'') was enacted to ensure fairness \n     and equity for the men and women who, during the past 60 \n     years, performed duties uniquely related to the nuclear \n     weapons production and testing programs of the Department of \n     Energy, its predecessor agencies, and contractors by \n     establishing a program that would provide timely, uniform, \n     and adequate compensation for beryllium- and radiation-\n     related health conditions.\n       (5) Research by the Department of Energy, the National \n     Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), NIOSH \n     contractors, the President's Advisory Board on Radiation and \n     Worker Health, and congressional committees indicates that at \n     certain nuclear weapons facilities--\n       (A) workers were not adequately monitored for internal or \n     external exposure to ionizing radiation; and\n       (B) records were not maintained, are not reliable, are \n     incomplete, or fail to indicate the radioactive isotopes to \n     which workers were exposed.\n       (6) Due to the inequities posed by the factors described \n     above and the resulting harm to the workers, Congress \n     designated classes of atomic weapons employees at the \n     Paducah, Kentucky, Portsmouth, Ohio, Oak Ridge K-25, \n     Tennessee, and the Amchitka Island, Alaska, sites as members \n     of the Special Exposure Cohort under EEOICPA.\n       (7) The contribution of the State of Nevada to the security \n     of the United States throughout the Cold War and since has \n     been unparalleled.\n       (8) In 1950, President Harry S Truman designated what would \n     later be called the Nevada Test Site as the country's nuclear \n     proving grounds and, a month later, the first atmospheric \n     test at the Nevada Test Site was detonated.\n       (9) The United States conducted 100 above-ground and 828 \n     underground nuclear tests at the Nevada Test Site from 1951 \n     to 1992.\n       (10) Out of the 1,054 nuclear tests conducted in the United \n     States, 928, or 88 percent, were conducted at the Nevada Test \n     Site.\n       (11) The Nevada Test Site has served, and continues to \n     serve, as the premier research, testing, and development site \n     for our nuclear defense capabilities.\n       (12) The Nevada Test Site and its workers are an essential \n     and irreplaceable part of our nation's defense capabilities.\n       (13) It has become evident that it is not feasible to \n     estimate with sufficient accuracy in a timely manner the \n     radiation dose received by employees at the Department of \n     Energy facility at the Nevada Test Site for many reasons, \n     including the following:\n       (A) The NIOSH Technical Basis Document, the threshold \n     document for radiation dose reconstruction under EEOICPA, has \n     incomplete radionuclide lists.\n       (B) NIOSH has not demonstrated that it can estimate dose \n     from exposure to large, nonrespirable hot particles.\n       (C) There are significant gaps in environmental measurement \n     and exposure data.\n       (D) Resuspension doses are seriously underestimated.\n       (E) NIOSH has not been able to estimate accurately \n     exposures to bomb assembly workers and radon levels.\n       (F) NIOSH has not demonstrated that it can accurately \n     sample tritiated water vapor.\n       (G) External dose records lack integrity.\n       (H) There are no beta dose data until 1966.\n       (I) There are no neutron dose data until 1966 and only \n     partial data after such date.\n       (J) There are no internal dose data until late 1955 or \n     1956, and limited data until well into the 1960s.\n       (K) NIOSH has ignored exposure from more than a dozen \n     underground tests that vented, including Bianca, Des Moines, \n     Baneberry, Camphor, Diagonal Line, Riola, Agrini, Midas Myth, \n     Misty Rain, and Mighty Oak.\n       (L) Instead of monitoring individuals, groups were \n     monitored, resulting in unreliable personnel monitoring.\n       (14) Amchitka Island, where only 3 underground nuclear \n     tests were conducted, has been designated a Special Exposure \n     Cohort under EEOICPA.\n       (15) Some Nevada Test Site workers, despite having worked \n     with significant amounts of radioactive materials and having \n     known exposures leading to serious health effects, have been \n     denied compensation under EEOICPA as a result of flawed \n     calculations based on records that are incomplete, in error, \n     or based on faulty assumptions and incorrect models.\n\n     SEC. _03.

REPORTS ON DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE EFFORTS TO \n                   INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE CASES OF CONTRACTING \n                   ABUSE IN IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, AND THROUGHOUT THE \n                   WAR ON TERROR.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Waste, fraud, and abuse in contracting are harmful to \n     United States efforts to successfully win the conflicts in \n     Iraq and Afghanistan and succeed in the war on terror. The \n     act of stealing from our soldiers who are daily in harm's way \n     is clearly criminal and must be actively prosecuted.\n       (2) There are reports that the Department of Defense has \n     lost accountability of significant funding due to theft by \n     corrupt contractors. These taxpayer funds should be recovered \n     and spent on the services and equipment that our troops need \n     to accomplish their mission abroad.\n       (3) It is a vital interest of United States taxpayers to be \n     protected from theft of their tax dollars by corrupt \n     contractors.\n       (4) Whistleblower lawsuits are an important tool for \n     exposing waste, fraud, and abuse and can identify serious \n     graft and corruption. Whistleblowers have brought many cases \n     of contractor corruption to light, and must be commended as \n     true patriots and champions of honesty and integrity.\n       (5) Based on published reports about whistleblower lawsuits \n     initiated under sections 3729 and 3730(b) of title 31, United \n     States Code (commonly known as the ``False Claims Act''), to \n     address contractor corruption in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \n     throughout the war on terror, it is unclear if the Department \n     of Justice has brought a sufficient number of these cases to \n     resolution. It is also unclear whether a chain of command and \n     an accountable management structure exists for handling such \n     whistleblower lawsuits, which aim to root out contractor \n     corruption in Iraq, Afghanistan, and throughout the war on \n     terror.\n       (6) This issue is of paramount importance to the United \n     States taxpayer, and the Congress has not received enough \n     information about the contractor waste, fraud, and abuse \n     taking place in Iraq, Afghanistan, and throughout the war on \n     terror and about the efforts of the Department of Justice to \n     combat these crimes. Sharing of this information will show \n     how seriously the Federal Government, as a whole, takes the \n     issue of contractor theft of United States taxpayer dollars.\n       (b) Reports.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, and every 90 days thereafter, the \n     Attorney General shall submit to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary and the Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs of the Senate, the Committee on the \n     Judiciary and the Committee on Government Reform of the House \n     of Representatives, and the congressional defense committees \n     a report on efforts to investigate and prosecute cases of \n     waste, fraud, and abuse under sections 3729 and 3730(b) of \n     title 31, United States Code, or any other related law that \n     are related to Federal contracting in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \n     throughout the war on terror.\n       (2) Content.--Each report submitted under paragraph (1) \n     shall include the following:\n       (A) Information on all of the organized efforts of the \n     Department of Justice that have been created to ensure that \n     the Department of Justice is investigating, in a timely and \n     appropriate manner, all claims of contractor waste, fraud, \n     and abuse related to the activities of the United States \n     Government in Iraq, Afghanistan, and throughout the war on \n     terror.\n       (B) Specific information on the cases and investigations of \n     contractor waste, fraud, and abuse in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \n     throughout the war on terror that have been undertaken by \n     United States Attorneys and the Director of the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation, including the names and locations of \n     these offices, as well as the personnel and financial \n     resources committed to the task and a description of the \n     type, nature, and substance of the allegations made and the \n     amount of funds in controversy for each case and \n     investigation, to the greatest extent possible under the law. \n     Information that would otherwise be prohibited from \n     disclosure by Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal \n     Procedure or by a seal order pursuant to section 3730(b) of \n     title 31, United States Code, shall be submitted in a \n     confidential memorandum to the committees specified in \n     paragraph (1) and shall not be deemed to be a violation of \n     either Rule 6(e) or such seal order. If there is a showing of \n     extraordinary circumstances that disclosure of particular \n     information would pose an imminent threat of harm to a \n     relator and be detrimental to the public interest, then this \n     information should be redacted in accordance with standard \n     practices.\n       (C) Information on the specific number of personnel, \n     financial resources, and workdays devoted to addressing this \n     waste, fraud, and abuse, including a complete listing of all \n     of the offices across the United States and throughout the \n     world that are working on these cases and an explanation of \n     the types of additional resources, both in terms of personnel \n     and finances, that the Department of Justice needs to ensure \n     that all of these cases proceed on a timely basis.\n       (D) A detailed description of any internal Department of \n     Justice task force that exists to work specifically on these \n     cases of contractor fraud and abuse in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \n     throughout the war on terror, including a description of its \n     action plan, the frequency of its meetings, the level and \n     quantity of staff dedicated to it, its measures for\n\n[[Page S5978]]\n\n     success, the nature and substance of the allegations, and the \n     amount of funds in controversy for each case. If there is a \n     showing of extraordinary circumstances that disclosure of \n     particular information would pose an imminent threat of harm \n     to a relator and be detrimental to the public interest, then \n     this information should be redacted in accordance with \n     standard practices.\n       (E) A detailed description of any interagency task force \n     that exists to work specifically on these cases of contractor \n     waste, fraud, and abuse in Iraq, Afghanistan, and throughout \n     the war on terror, including its action plan, the frequency \n     of its meetings, the level and quantity of staff dedicated to \n     it, its measures for success, the type, nature, and substance \n     of the allegations, and the amount of funds in controversy \n     for each case. If there is a showing of extraordinary \n     circumstances that disclosure of particular information would \n     pose an imminent threat of harm to a relator and be \n     detrimental to the public interest, then this information \n     should be redacted in accordance with standard practices.\n       (F) The names of the senior officials directly responsible \n     for oversight of the efforts to address these cases of \n     contractor waste, fraud, and abuse in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \n     throughout the war on terror.\n       (G) Specific information on the number of investigators and \n     other personnel that have been provided to the Department of \n     Justice by other Federal departments and agencies in support \n     of the efforts of the Department of Justice to combat \n     contractor waste, fraud, and abuse in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \n     throughout the war on terror, including data on the quantity \n     of time that these investigators have spent working within \n     the Department of Justice structures dedicated to this \n     effort.\n       (H) Specific information on the full number of \n     investigations, including grand jury investigations currently \n     underway, that are addressing these cases of contractor \n     waste, fraud, and abuse in Iraq, Afghanistan, and throughout \n     the war on terror.\n       (I) Specific information on the number and status of the \n     criminal cases that have been launched to address contractor \n     waste, fraud, and abuse in Iraq, Afghanistan, and throughout \n     the war on terror.\n       (J) Specific information on the number of civil cases that \n     have been filed to address contractor waste, fraud, and abuse \n     in Iraq, Afghanistan, and throughout the war on terror, \n     including specific information on the quantity of cases \n     initiated by private parties, as well as the quantity of \n     cases that have been referred to the Department of Justice by \n     the Department of Defense, the Department of State, and other \n     relevant Federal departments and agencies.\n       (K) Specific information on the resolved civil and criminal \n     cases that have been filed to address contractor waste, \n     fraud, and abuse in Iraq, Afghanistan, and throughout the war \n     on terror, including the specific results of these cases, the \n     types of waste, fraud, and abuse that took place, the amount \n     of funds that were returned to the United States Government \n     as a result of resolution of these cases, and a full \n     description of the type and substance of the waste, fraud, \n     and abuse that took place, including its direct and indirect \n     impacts on United States troops, officers, and other \n     individuals working for the United States Government in Iraq, \n     Afghanistan, and throughout the war on terror.

Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bennett, Mr. \nDorgan, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Salazar, and Mr. Thomas) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill S. 2766, to \nauthorize appropriations for fiscal year 2007 for military activities \nof the Department of Defense, for military construction, and for \ndefense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe personnel \nstrengths for such fiscal year for the Armed Forces, and for other \npurposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 147. MINUTEMAN III INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of \n     Conference on H.R. 1815, the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 2006, the conferees state that the policy \n     of the United States ``is to deploy a force of 500 ICBMs''. \n     The conferees further note ``that unanticipated strategic \n     developments may compel the United States to make changes to \n     this force structure in the future.''.\n       (2) The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) conducted under \n     section 118 of title 10, United States Code, in 2005 finds \n     that maintaining a robust nuclear deterrent ``remains a \n     keystone of United States national power''. However, \n     notwithstanding that finding and without providing any \n     specific justification for the recommendation, the \n     Quadrennial Defense Review recommends reducing the number of \n     deployed Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles \n     (ICBMs) from 500 to 450 beginning in fiscal year 2007. The \n     Quadrennial Defense Review also fails to identify what \n     unanticipated strategic developments compelled the United \n     States to reduce the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile force \n     structure.\n       (3) The commander of the Strategic Command, General James \n     Cartwright, testified before the Committee on Armed Services \n     of the Senate that the reduction in deployment of Minuteman \n     III Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles is required so that \n     the 50 missiles withdrawn from the deployed force could be \n     used for test assets and spares to extend the life of the \n     Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile well into \n     the future. If spares are not modernized, the Air Force may \n     not have sufficient replacement missiles to sustain the force \n     size.\n       (b) Modernization of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles \n     Required.--The Air Force shall modernize Minuteman III \n     Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles in the United States \n     inventory such that a sufficient supply of launch test assets \n     and spares is retained to sustain the deployed force of such \n     missiles through 2030.\n       (c) Limitation on Termination of Modernization Program \n     Pending Report.--No funds authorized to be appropriated for \n     the Department of Defense may be obligated or expended for \n     the termination of any Minuteman III ICBM modernization \n     program, or for the withdrawal of any Minuteman III \n     Intercontinental Ballistic Missile from the active force, \n     until 30 days after the Secretary of Defense submits to the \n     congressional defense committees a report setting forth the \n     following:\n       (1) A detailed strategic justification for the proposal to \n     reduce the Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile \n     force from 500 to 450 missiles, including an analysis of the \n     effects of the reduction on the ability of the United States \n     to assure allies and dissuade potential competitors.\n       (2) A detailed analysis of the strategic ramifications of \n     continuing to equip a portion of the Minuteman III \n     Intercontinental Ballistic Missile force with multiple \n     independent warheads rather than single warheads as \n     recommended by past reviews of the United States nuclear \n     posture.\n       (3) An assessment of the test assets and spares required to \n     maintain a force of 500 deployed Minuteman III \n     Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles through 2030.\n       (4) An assessment of the test assets and spares required to \n     maintain a force of 450 deployed Minuteman III \n     Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles through 2030.\n       (5) An inventory of currently available Minuteman III \n     Intercontinental Ballistic Missile test assets and spares.\n       (6) A plan to sustain and complete the modernization of all \n     deployed and spare Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic \n     Missiles, a test plan, and an analysis of the funding \n     required to carry out modernization of all deployed and spare \n     Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles.\n       (7) An assessment of whether halting upgrades to the \n     Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles withdrawn \n     from the deployed force would compromise the ability of those \n     missiles to serve as test assets.\n       (8) A description of the plan of the Department of Defense \n     for extending the life of the Minuteman III Intercontinental \n     Ballistic Missile force beyond fiscal year 2030.\n       (d) ICBM Modernization Program Defined.--In this section, \n     the term ``ICBM Modernization program'' means each of the \n     following for the Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic \n     Missile:\n       (1) The Guidance Replacement Program (GRP).\n       (2) The Propulsion Replacement Program (PRP).\n       (3) The Propulsion System Rocket Engine (PSRE) program.\n\n[[Page S5981]]\n\n       (4) The Safety Enhanced Reentry Vehicle (SERV) program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4275.
