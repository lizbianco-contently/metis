Mr. President, this morning we are in session for a period \nof morning business. There are several Senators who have indicated \ntheir desire for time today to introduce legislation and to make \ngeneral statements. There will be a number of statements over the \ncourse of the morning and possibly into the early afternoon--in part \nbecause we have had such a busy week with legislation on the floor so \nthat people will take advantage of this opportunity today.\n  Last night we were able to complete both the CAFTA legislation and \nthe Energy and Water appropriations bill. I hesitated a little bit \nbecause, by the time we finished here--it was not that long ago, about \n9 hours ago. We finished about 1 o'clock in the morning. But we had a \nvery full day, a very productive day yesterday, passing the \nappropriations bills as well as the legislation that will do a great \ndeal in terms of lowering trade barriers to very important countries, \nmost of which are recently emerged democracies.\n  Because we were able to finish our work late last night into the wee \nhours of the morning, we will not have rollcall votes today. When we \nfinish our business today, we will adjourn for our recess and return on \nMonday, July 11. At that point in time the plans are to take up the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill. We will have a vote late Monday \nafternoon--later this morning we will say more about that--in relation \nto an amendment on the Homeland Security bill.\n  I do thank all of our Members for their hard work and their \nassistance over the last week, indeed the last several weeks. In the \nlast week alone, the last 5 days, we were able to initiate the \nappropriations process and pass three appropriations bills as well as \nthe Central American Free Trade Agreement bill.\n  It could not have been done without a lot of understanding and \nparticipation by both sides of the aisle, including the Republican \nleadership working with the Democratic leadership very effectively, \nhand in hand. We had long, late, busy sessions, but they were very\n\n[[Page S7876]]\n\nproductive and we moved America's business forward in a very positive \nway.\n  I know several people will have statements over the course of the \nmorning, looking back over the past several weeks, in that we have had \na very productive session that delivered to the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/01/senate-section/article/S7876-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7876-S7879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONCERNS ABOUT PRESCRIPTION DRUG ADVERTISING\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to make a statement that I \nregard as a very important one because it reflects what I think is a \nneeded change in behavior that affects health care across America. Let \nme begin with a few phrases: ``Keep the spark alive,'' ``The healing \npurple pill,'' ``If a playful moment turns into the right moment you \ncan be ready,'' ``For everyday victories.''\n  You turn on your TV anytime of the day and that is what you will hear \nand that is what you will see. These are the advertising tag lines for \nsome of America's best selling and most advertised prescription drugs--\nin the last several weeks, months and years. We all know them when I \nread them. Some even have the images that pop up into their minds, \nbecause we see them again and again and again and again. We are \nbarraged by them.\n  I mention this as a physician, because 10 years ago you would not \nhave seen any of that advertising on television. We have heard them on \nour television sets, we hear them on our favorite radio programs, we \nsee them in newspapers, we see them in magazines. Those who go to \nNASCAR races see them on the cars. You see them on billboards along the \nhighways. We are barraged with this information. It is called direct-\nto-consumer advertising. When I was practicing medicine before coming \nto this body--not that long ago, in 1994--it didn't exist.\n  This is what direct-to-consumer advertising is. When drug companies, \npharmaceutical companies, market their products, the marketing used to \nbe done to physicians who could accumulate that information and help \npatients make decisions. But the direct-to-consumer goes over the heads \nof physicians with this advertising, direct to the American people, \ndirect to the consumer. It is called direct-to-consumer advertising, or \nDTC is the terminology people use.\n  It is a two-edged sword. Obviously there can be huge health education \nbenefits to such advertising because you are exposed to it, you are \nbarraged with it, and information is provided, information to which you \nmight not otherwise have access. But let there be no mistake, drug \nadvertisements are fuel to America's skyrocketing prescription drug \ncost. It is a two-edged sword. The advertising is new over the last 10 \nyears. Now it is time to assess the efficacy of advertising, but also \npotential damage that is done by this proliferation, this skyrocketing \nof advertising to which we are being exposed.\n  These ads do influence consumer behavior; otherwise, drug companies \nwouldn't be putting money into them. Their real purpose at the end of \nthe day is to have a drug that, yes, helps people, but also makes money \nfor them. It affects consumer behavior and it also--though it is not \nsaid very much but I will speak to it here shortly--affects physician \nbehavior in a way I think is detrimental. Physicians don't want to talk \nabout it very much because it is a little embarrassing. I will come \nback to that. But it affects physicians' behavior in a way that I think \nis not healthy, as well as affecting consumer behavior.\n  These ads cause people to take more prescription drugs. They have the \npotential to create an artificial demand and thereby they can drive up \nhealth care costs for everybody listening to me as individuals, but \nalso our overall health care cost for the Nation.\n  I believe it has reached a point where they--again, it can be very \npositive with the health education--are needlessly and wastefully \ndriving up health care costs. Thus it is time for us to get more \ninformation but also address the issue.\n  Moreover, a lot of the direct-to-consumer advertising is misleading. \nI know, as people listen, you tend to believe, unfortunately, what you \nsee on TV and that can be dangerous in certain cases. This direct-to-\nconsumer advertising can oversell hope, and people want hope; it can \noversell results; and it can also undersell the risk. Every drug has \nside effects. Every drug has a side effect. We may not know all of the \nside effects, but the idea of promoting a drug without adequately \nenumerating, spelling out, highlighting the risk is wrong. Misleading \nadvertising, especially when we are barraged with it, when that is all \nwe see--a little bit of hyperbole, on TV between shows, if it is \nmisleading, hurts patients and definitely pressures doctors to \noverprescribe or to change prescribing habits in response to that \nrequest, that specific request from a patient.\n  So today I rise to urge all pharmaceutical companies to voluntarily \nrestrict consumer drug advertising during the first 2 years that a new \ndrug is on the market. Today I am also requesting a Government study \ninto the cost and into the consequences and any potential benefits of \ndirect-to-consumer advertising. It is time for the drug companies, I \nbelieve, when it comes to direct-to-consumer advertising, to clean up \ntheir act. If they do not, I believe Congress will need to act in this \narena.\n  In its proper place, direct-to-consumer drug advertising gives \npatients, gives consumers, information. It empowers them to make \ndecisions. It can give them the information they need in order to make \ninformed decisions about their health, about the advantages of a \nparticular drug. It can instruct them and open their eyes to symptoms \nthey have that might be very serious but they might not otherwise go to \nsee a doctor about. It can inform them about new therapies, the \nbreakthrough therapies that are so powerful--made in large part because \nof the research and development in our private sector by our \npharmaceutical companies.\n  These are good things. These are the good things that advertising can \ndo, that education can do, that knowledge can do. Indeed, I envision a \nhealth care system--and we are not yet there today, but I think we are \nmoving in that direction, in part through legislation on the floor of \nthe Senate, to move to a system that is centered not on big Government \nand not on us micromanaging from the floor of the Senate prices and \ndecisions, but, no, move toward a system that is patient centered. We \nare moving toward a health care system that centers on the individual \npatient, that is provider friendly, and that is driven by three things. \nThose are knowledge or information that is given the patient, the \nindividual, the opportunity to choose and make choices for themselves, \nand to make sure that patient is empowered, they have resources to make \nthose decisions.\n  So if you are looking at a consumer-driven, patient-centered health \ncare system, having timely information, accurate information, complete \ninformation, and balanced information has to be one of the major \npillars.\n  Direct consumer advertising can be very helpful in that regard if \nthat is the purpose and if it meets those standards. I don't think the \nadvertising we see today--and I base this on people coming up to me all \nthe time as a physician and policymaker--I don't think the advertising \ntoday meets those standards. I will have more to say about that issue.\n  With today's advertising, perhaps you are at a ball game with your \nfamily, going to a movie or to dinner--ask somebody about it--and \ntoday's advertising will likely leave parents having to explain to \ntheir young children, their 10-, 9-, 8-year-old, what erectile \ndysfunction is rather than a discussion of the importance of getting \nyour blood pressure checked to see if you have hypertension so you will \nnot have a stroke or heart disease. That would be useful information.\n  That is the problem. How did we get to this point? Prior to the \n1980s, drug manufacturers almost always introduced and explained their \nproducts to physicians. Physicians had a body of knowledge and the \ntraining to make an assessment of whether, based on the information the \ndrug companies gave them, this would be an efficacious drug, a useful \ndrug to use, or whether the side effects would be appropriate for \nindividual patients.\n  In 1981, just over 20 years ago, Boots Pharmaceuticals ran the first \nU.S.\n\n[[Page S7877]]\n\nprint advertisement--just 24 years ago. It was directed to consumers \nfor the ibuprofen product brufen. In 1980, print advertising picked up. \nIn the 1990s, drug companies began to use more print advertisements to \npromote their products--again, directly to consumers, not going through \nphysicians--and during that period they ran television advertisements \nsparingly. Rarely would consumers turn on the television and actually \nsee an advertisement directed at the consumer on a drug.\n  Looking back over the last 40 years since 1962, the FDA has had a \nrequirement--the FDA is the Government institution in charge of \nregulation and oversight. Since 1962, the FDA has required ads to \ninclude a brief summary of a drug's side effects, indications for use, \nthe contraindications, the warnings and precautions.\n  Regarding the massive changes we are exposed to today, look back to \nthe Clinton administration in 1997 when the disclosure rules for \ntelevision ads were liberalized. The door was opened. That is not that \nlong ago--3 years after I formally left the practice of medicine to \ncome to the Senate. Rather than providing a full picture of a drug's \nrisk and benefits, the new laws required only that drug companies \ndisclose the most significant risk and then refer patients to a \nsecondary source of information, leaving this whole inadequacy of the \nrisk and adverse effects on the ad as presented.\n  As a direct result of this 1997 ruling, spending on direct consumer \nadvertising skyrocketed 145 percent between 1997 and 2001. It passed \nthe $1 billion mark in 1997. It was almost nonexistent 7 years before \nthat and skyrocketed to about $1 billion in 1997. Then 4 years later, \nit kept skyrocketing and reached $2.7 billion. Indeed, last year, the \ndrug companies spent over $4 billion advertising medications directly \nto consumers.\n  This 145 percent over that 4-year period from 1997 to 2001 for direct \nconsumer advertising, reaching consumers, should be compared to an \nincrease of only 59 percent for research and development for drugs--\nclearly, a heavy investment in direct consumer advertising. Why? \nBecause that advertising increases utilization of that drug and sells \nmore drugs.\n  The Clinton administration at the time they opened this door--under \nintense pressure by the drug industry--not only opened the door but \nopened the door too widely, and our regulatory body has not kept up \nwith what has come through that door. As a result, the direct-to-\nconsumer advertising exploded to levels that at least I did not \nanticipate. As we watched this unfold through the 1990s, I don't think \nanyone anticipated the level that we see when we turn on the television \ntoday. That drives up drug use, that drives up drug spending, and, of \ncourse, that will drive up the cost of health care generally.\n  In addition to all that, it has led to inappropriate doctor-physician \nprescribing. We have to be careful because until we really study it, we \nwill not know all effects. My doctor friends tell me again and again, \nwhen a patient comes in with a specific request for a drug written down \nand the doctor has 30 or 40 patients waiting outside, it is almost \neasier--I am embarrassed to say this--almost easier for a doctor to \nwrite the prescription and give it to them even though there may be a \ngeneric drug or a much less expensive drug. The patient comes in and \nsays: I have to have this drug. This drug is what I have in mind, the \nhope for the cure for my disease.\n  This misallocation of resources and inefficiency that results from \ninappropriate prescribing from the physician's standpoint is something \nwe can rip out of the system if we turn to a balance between very good \nand direct-to-consumer advertising, which includes patient education, \nbut get rid of the inappropriate, imbalanced state we are in today.\n\n  If we consider the recent labeling changes in market withdrawals of \njust one class of drugs, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory, it tells a \nstory. These drugs were the most heavily advertised in America. They \nwere used by millions and millions of patients. Millions of patients \nbenefited, I should say, from these drugs, but many people today \nbelieve--looking back at what happened in response to the advertising--\nthat they were overprescribed.\n  In the case of one drug people have heard a lot about, Vioxx, 93 \nmillion prescriptions had been written since its approval in May 1999. \nMillions of prescriptions were also written for similar drugs such as \nCelebrex and Bextra. In the case of Vioxx, indeed, it was a better \ndrug. It did prove to be better than competing products for patients \nwho had gastrointestinal problems or stomach problems. America did \nconduct postmarket research that was not required by the Food and Drug \nAdministration. Of course, we cannot foresee every risk. It does take \ntime to accumulate information to fully assess risk.\n  Quite simply, we should always strive to make safety the top concern, \nnot selling the most drugs through increasing utilization, through \nadvertising, but ultimately to make safety our top concern, especially \nfor newly approved products that are used for the very first time in \nmillions and millions of patients. It takes time for the adverse \nreactions and side effects to be fully explored and to fully surface. \nDoctors should have more time to use the drugs to gain experience with \nthem, to collect more balanced information, and to be able to weigh the \nrisks and benefits of a product.\n  In a 2002 report on the practice, the Government Accountability \nOffice, the GAO, highlighted two studies. The last time it has been \nstudied--and that is why I want to study it now, because we have had \nthis explosion--but in the two studies they highlighted in 2002, the \nlast report, each showed a 10-percent increase in direct-to-consumer \nspending within a drug class increased sales in that class by 1 \npercent. For one popular, very heavily advertised prescription drug, $1 \nof consumer advertising translated into $4 in increased sales--$1 \ndollar in advertising, $4 in sales. So we see the motivation from the \ndrug companies in advertising particular drugs. It is no wonder the \ndrug companies are flooding our airwaves today.\n  The GAO findings in that 2002 report were clear: Increased direct-to-\nconsumer advertising has helped fuel escalating drug costs. These drug \ncosts, as we know, are skyrocketing. In 2003, Americans consumed 134 \nbillion prescription pills and spent over $216 billion on prescription \ndrugs. That is as much as Americans spent on gasoline and oil. During \nthe past few years, drug costs have gone up more than twice as fast as \ninflation, faster than nearly all other health care items and services.\n  Congress has paid attention to these skyrocketing, escalating drug \ncosts, and we have acted on the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act. We \ntook major steps toward providing more affordable prescription drugs. I \nadd the ``more affordable'' because we did a number of things.\n  First and foremost, recognizing the importance of prescription drugs, \ncentrality of prescription drugs to health care delivery today, we \nprovided seniors with an outpatient prescription drug benefit under the \nMedicare Program for the first time in history--something I feel \nstrongly about, something I am very excited about as we look over the \nnext year, couple of years, where implementation begins. We also \nestablished health savings accounts that allow individuals to own and \ntake care of their own health care. We reformed patent laws and closed \nloopholes to help speed lower cost generic drugs to market and set \nstandards to encourage more efficient electronic prescribing and \nimproved patient safety. We provided funds to the Department of Health \nand Human Services to study the clinical comparative effectiveness of \ndrugs and then take that information and share it with patients, to \nshare it with consumers so they can make prudent decisions.\n\n  We have taken some good steps, moved in the right direction, but we \nclearly have a lot more to do. Part of this effort, and the reason I \nbring it to the Senate today, is a responsibility we have to look at \nprescription drug advertising. Unbalanced and misleading prescription \ndrug advertising hurts the American people. We will look at it. It adds \ntension to the relationship between doctors and patients, the \nphysician-patient relationship. It can lead to inappropriate \nprescribing, and it can overwhelm our current regulatory system.\n  As consumers, we are all familiar with these ads. They adorn major \nmagazines, Web sites, newspapers, and\n\n[[Page S7878]]\n\nflood the airwaves. Particularly on television, they present upbeat \nimages, a parade of images that bring hope and beauty with these \npositive images, but often the warning and the cautions are in either \nfine print or as an afterthought. As I mentioned earlier, think how \nmany parents have found themselves watching a sporting event with their \nson or daughter, only to be assaulted by an ad for erectile \ndysfunction.\n  Think back to advertising during this year's Super Bowl, the nature \nof those ads and the focus of those ads. Only rarely do these ads \nprovide consumers with enough time to absorb the risk information. In a \n2002 FDA study, nearly 60 percent of patients reported drug \nadvertisements did not provide enough risk information. In that study, \n58 percent of patients felt these ads portrayed products as better than \nthey are. In another 2002 FDA survey, 75 percent of physicians said ads \nled patients to overestimate the efficacy of the drugs, and 65 percent \nof physicians noted that patients confused the risk and benefits of \ndrugs advertised to consumers.\n  What this means is sometimes a patient may request a drug, even \ninsist upon a drug, even if it does more harm than good. They may too \nheavily rely on a pill when an overall lifestyle change might be more \nappropriate. They may come in and demand the latest, most expensive \nmedication when an old standby could do just as well.\n  Patients seeing the ads place new demands on their doctors. As I \nmentioned, when my medical colleagues are pressed for time, they tend \nto respond with the easy way of responding to a specific demand--even \nif it might not be either the most cost-effective or efficacious drug.\n  Thinking of one example, after one year of directly advertising the \nbone-mass-increasing drug Fosamax to consumers, physician visits for \nosteoporosis evaluation nearly doubled. That in some ways may be good \nbecause it shows the double-edged sword in that people go to the doctor \nand they ask appropriate questions. But then you have to ask the \nquestion: Did these ads provide the patients with the appropriate \ninformation to go see that doctor for the appropriate information on \nthe side effects of that particular drug?\n\n  An interesting study from the University of California-Davis was \nwhere the researchers sent actors in good health to 152 doctors' \noffices in three cities to find out if they could get prescriptions for \nsimulated symptoms. Half of the actors imitated patients suffering \ndepression. The other half expressed symptoms of stress and fatigue.\n  The study found that if an actor requested Paxil, which is a heavily \npromoted antidepressant, he was five times as likely to walk out of the \ndoctor's office with a prescription for the drug. The research \nsuggested that direct-to-consumer advertising increases patient demand \nfor specific medications, even in situations where prescriptions are \nnot needed.\n  Finally, we need to ask questions about how we regulate this drug \nadvertising. Right now, the Food and Drug Administration simply has \nneither the resources to scrutinize direct-to-consumer advertisements \nnor the power to review them for accuracy before they are viewed by the \npublic. In 2002, the FDA received over 137,000 pieces of promotional \nmaterial for review. Some of these materials appeared on the airwaves \nor in print even before they arrived at the office of the FDA.\n  The entire division responsible for this oversight consists of 40 \nemployees--just 40 employees--who have to review almost 40,000 complex, \nmedically sensitive advertisements. It is not enough. The FDA knows it \nis not enough. We have not given them enough resources.\n  Two years ago, Dr. Janet Woodcock, then the FDA's Acting Deputy \nCommissioner for Operations, told the Senate Committee on Aging:\n\n       It would be impossible for the FDA to try to track the \n     number of different broadcast advertisements that are aired.\n\n  Almost unbelievable to me is the fact that the FDA review comes after \nthe fact. It cannot require drug companies to submit their \nadvertisements before they appear on the airwaves or on the Internet or \nin print. The FDA simply cannot keep up.\n  Our failure, our Government's failure, to appropriately regulate drug \nadvertising hurts the very people I believe the drugs are intended to \nhelp, and that is the patients. We are not serving the American people \nas well as we should.\n  Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, the pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers \nSquibb announced a voluntary ban on advertising its new drugs to \nconsumers in their first year on the market. The company said it wanted \nto give doctors more time to understand new products before patients \nstart asking for them. I think this shows leadership. It shows \nresponsibility. Bristol-Myers is setting an example in showing \nrestraint in the industry.\n  I know PhRMA--that is the drug industry's trade association--has \nannounced it will adopt an industrywide voluntary code governing \ndirect-to-consumer advertising next month--another good move.\n  Mr. President, what should we do? I believe, at a minimum, the \npharmaceutical industry should include a voluntary restriction on the \ndirect-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs in their first 2 \nyears on the market. This restraint is important because a typical \nclinical trial for a drug includes about 5,000 patients. A blockbuster \ndrug can attract as many as a million patients in the first year on the \nmarket. But since no drug is free of a side effect, we may not fully \nknow what those side effects are. Doctors and patients need time to \nlearn about the new treatments to be able to assess their benefits and \nfind out more about the risk. Education should come before persuasion. \nPatient safety should be paramount, not the bottom line.\n  So what should we do? Three things.\n  First, we should give the FDA prior review and approval authority for \nall direct-to-consumer drug advertising. By the time the FDA reprimands \na company for running a misleading drug commercial, that advertisement \nmay have already deceived consumers. Advertising should boldly and \nresponsibly address safety head on, replacing the upbeat fantasyland \nimages with a frank discussion of a product's risks and benefits.\n  Second, we should increase resources devoted to reviewing \nadvertising, to determine the advertisement's accuracy and to ensure \nall standards are met.\n  The FDA must have the resources, must have the capability to more \nthoroughly monitor drug advertising and make sure that companies fully \ncomply with the advertising guidelines.\n  The American people assume this is being done today when they see \nthose ads, and it is not. A staff of 40 is simply not sufficient.\n  And third, we should give doctors and patients greater access to \nclinical data and postmarketing surveillance efforts about drugs after \nthey become available.\n\n  For the drug industry, which has long touted the educational benefits \nof its advertising and of its mission, it has to know that the success \nof their mission inherently depends upon the quality of information \nthey give to physicians and patients--not just the enticing images, but \nthe quality of information.\n  Mr. President, in closing, as a doctor who has witnessed both the \ngood but also the bad in this explosion of drug advertising direct to \nthe consumer, I feel I have a responsibility to watch this issue \nclosely. If the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary restrictions are \nnot strong enough, I will support congressional action to make sure \nconsumers get the protection they deserve.\n  In the meantime, today, I am asking the Government Accountability \nOffice, the GAO, to investigate FDA's oversight of prescription drug \nadvertising, the pharmaceutical industry's spending on such \nadvertising, and this advertising's impact on utilization, health care \nspending, and patient education and awareness.\n  Wherever I go--whether it is to meet with a group of doctors at a \nmedical meeting at the Harvard Medical School or back at the University \nof Tennessee or at the Coca-Cola 600 in Charlotte--people come to me \nand say the direct-to-consumer advertising has gone overboard.\n  We have to return balance. I believe we can and we should move into a \nhealth care system that is centered on the patient, where they have \nappropriate information to make decisions--\n\n[[Page S7879]]\n\na consumer-driven, provider-friendly, patient-centered system.\n  I know my colleagues share these or similar priorities. I believe the \nsteps I have proposed today will be to the benefit of patients. It will \nsave money. It will save lives. Prescription drugs, I believe, are the \nmost powerful tools in American medicine today. We really could not and \nshould not do without them. But we have to use them and market them and \npromote them with care.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/01/senate-section/article/S7879-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a truly \ndistinguished American--U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, \nwho announced her retirement earlier this morning.\n  The current group of nine Justices, including Justice O'Connor, \nrepresented the longest serving Supreme Court since the 1820s.\n  Today marks a great loss for America. But it is also a day to reflect \non all that we have gained because of Justice O'Connor's service to our \ncountry.\n  For nearly 23 years, Justice O'Connor lent America her brilliant mind \nand her fair and impartial judgment.\n  Sandra Day O'Connor, who turned 75 this year, was born in El Paso, \nTX.\n  The daughter of Harry and Ada Mae, she was raised on her family's \ncattle ranch, in southeastern Arizona.\n  Sandra Day O'Connor began her academic journey at Stanford \nUniversity.\n  Upon earning a bachelor's degree in economics and graduating magna \ncum laude, she stayed on at Stanford, pursuing an education in law.\n  And at Stanford she thrived. She earned a coveted position on the Law \nReview's Board of Editors and completed law school in only 2 years. Not \nonly did she graduate in record time, but she finished third in her \nclass.\n  Coincidentally, she finished with a man who would later become her \ncolleague on the highest Court in the land--Chief Justice William H. \nRehnquist.\n  It was during law school that Sandra Day O'Connor met her future \nhusband, John Jay O'Connor.\n  Seeking her first job as a young, female attorney, Sandra Day \nO'Connor faced many challenges in a male-dominated law profession.\n  After having difficulty finding a job in the private sector, she \nbegan her legal career as Deputy County Attorney of San Mateo, CA.\n  When her husband was drafted into the JAG Corps in 1953, the young \ncouple moved to Frankfurt, Germany, where she worked as a civilian \nattorney for the U.S. Army.\n  After 2 years in Europe, Sandra Day O'Connor returned to Maryvale, \nAZ, where she experienced difficulty finding employment in the legal \nworld. As a result, she decided to start her own legal practice.\n  After practicing law for 2 years, Sandra Day O'Connor took a break \nfrom her career to start a family. She and her husband raised three \nsons--Scott, Brian, and Jay. I must say, as a father of three sons, \nthis may be her greatest accomplishment--certainly, one of the most \nchallenging.\n  In 1965, Sandra Day O'Connor transitioned from the private sector, to \nthe public, when she became Arizona's Assistant Attorney General.\n  In this capacity, she served for 4 years before being appointed to \nfill an unexpired seat in the Arizona State Senate. Her constituents \nagreed it was a good match--as they elected her twice more.\n  In the Arizona Senate she rose to the highest level, becoming \nmajority leader and the first woman ever to hold such an office in the \nUnited States.\n  As majority leader of this body, I understand the challenges and \nrewards of being leader and admire Justice O'Connor for her tremendous \nachievement.\n  In 1975, Sandra Day O'Connor was elected, judge of the Maricopa \nCounty Superior Court and served until 1979, when she was appointed to \nthe appellate bench in Arizona.\n  There she served, until late President Ronald Reagan appointed her \nAssociate Justice to the Supreme Court.\n  On September, 21, 1981, the Senate unanimously confirmed her \nnomination to the Supreme Court. And that day, Sandra Day O'Connor made \nhistory. She became the first female Justice in the Court's history.\n  This 51-year-old Arizona-Court of Appeals judge shattered the 190-\nyear-long tradition on the High Court of addressing Justices: ``Mr. \nJustice.''\n  When asked for her reaction to her nomination, Sandra Day O'Connor \nsaid:\n\n       I can only say that I will approach [my work on the bench] \n     with care and effort and do the best job I possibly can do.\n\n  Most would agree that she has done just that.\n  Since 1981, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor has served with distinction \non the U.S. Supreme Court. She has served as an example to all \nAmericans--demonstrating that through persistence and hard work \nanything is possible.\n  In the face of obstacles--including being a woman in a male-dominated \nlaw profession--she never surrendered her determination nor did she \nsurrender her Southwestern pride and love of the outdoors when she \nmoved to the city. Rather, she brought it with her.\n  Anyone who has entered the inner confines of Justice O'Connor's \nSupreme Court office is familiar with a sign that reads ``Cowgirl \nParking Only: All Others will be Towed.''\n  Fiercely proud of her heritage, Justice O'Connor and her brother, H. \nAlan Day, authored a best selling memoir ``entitled Lazy B: Growing up \non a Cattle Ranch in the American Southwest.''\n  Having grown up in the South--in Nashville, TN--I appreciate Justice \nO'Connor's pride in her roots. She has not forgotten where she came \nfrom.\n  The values she learned through life on the range were values that \nleft their brand mark. Indeed, hard work, self-reliance, and survival \nare the core values that make Sandra Day O'Connor the successful woman \nshe is today.\n  As she writes in her memoir, working alongside cowboys on the Lazy B, \nshe learned a system of values that was ``simple and unsophisticated \nand the product of necessity.''\n  Throughout her tenure on the Court, she has not wavered from her \nwell-grounded views.\n  I've had the privilege of meeting Justice O'Connor on various \noccasions during my time in the United States Senate.\n  Each time that I've had the opportunity to interact with her, I've \nfound her to be thoughtful, kind, and extraordinarily intelligent.\n  To echo the words of Ronald Reagan on the day he appointed Sandra Day\nO'Connor:\n\n       She is truly a ``person for all seasons,'' possessing those \n     unique qualities of temperament, fairness, intellectual \n     capacity and devotion to the public good which have \n     characterized the 101 ``brethren'' who have preceded her.\n\n  Today, more than 23 years later, President Reagan's words still ring \ntrue.\n  When she took the oath of office as the 102nd Associate Justice, she \npledged to uphold the Constitution, and since this time, Justice \nO'Connor has proven her steadfast commitment to uphold the \nConstitution.\n  During her confirmation hearing, she emphasized that the court's role \nwas to interpret the law and not to make public policy.\n  Her record demonstrates that she has lived up to that commitment, \nrespecting the rule of law and judiciously interpreting the \nConstitution.\n  Often cited as the ``swing vote'' on many important cases, Sandra Day\n\n[[Page S7880]]\n\nO'Connor has taken exception to that characterization, stating that \n``if my vote has not been a hundred percent predictable, that's because \nI try to look at each one as it comes to us.''\n  Sandra Day O'Connor is an independent thinker and has made great \ncontributions in many substantive areas of the law.\n  On the bench, she has not allowed the pressures of popular opinion to \nsway her decisions. Rather, she has consistently decided each case \nbefore her based on the underlying facts.\n  Despite being the first woman to serve on the high Court, Justice \nO'Connor has not used this position to influence decisions of the \nmajority. She once said:\n\n       The power I exert on the court depends on the power of my \n     arguments, not my gender.\n\n  Her wisdom, intellect, and humility have earned her deep respect from \nher colleagues, even those with opposing judicial philosophies.\n  For they see that she embodies all the ideal qualities in a judge--\nfair, impartial, and open-minded.\n  Through her experiences, Justice O'Connor has brought a unique \nperspective and understanding of checks and balances to the Court.\n  A true public servant--Sandra Day O'Connor has served our Nation for \nalmost four decades: As an Arizona State Senator and majority leader, \nState court judge, assistant State attorney general, and in the \ncapacity for which she will long be remembered, as an Associate Justice \non the Supreme Court.\n  Throughout her life, Justice O'Connor has displayed her civic \nloyalties through her participation in various community organizations \nincluding the boards of the Smithsonian Institution, the Heard Museum, \nand the Salvation Army.\n  She was recognized for her service in 1995, when she was inducted \ninto the National Women's Hall of Fame.\n  Sandra Day O'Connor has accomplished more in a lifetime than many \nwould imagine possible.\n  Yet, throughout that breathtaking journey to the top, she never lost \nsight of her humble roots, and never lost sight of the people she \nserved.\n  As she told a reporter in a 1996 interview that she never expected or \naspired to be a justice, and still considers herself ``just a cowgirl \nfrom Arizona.''\n  While the ``cowgirl from Arizona'' may never have dreamed of riding \nto the highest court in the land, America is fortunate that she did.\n  A brilliant jurist, a bright legal mind, and a compassionate woman--\nshe has earned her place in history for more reasons than one.\n  I am sure that Justice O'Connor is looking forward to spending time \nwith her husband, John, and their family during her retirement.\n  And Karyn and I wish her and her family much joy and happiness in \nthis new chapter of life.\n  On behalf of the entire United States Senate and a grateful Nation, I \ncommend Justice Sandra Day O'Connor for a lifetime of distinguished \nservice to our great Nation.\n  As the Senate moves forward to confirm a new nominee for the high \nCourt, it's important that we remember her legacy.\n  America needs judges who are fair, independent, unbiased and \ncommitted to equal justice under the law. I am confident that the \nPresident will select a qualified replacement justice who embodies \nthese qualities.\n  And I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure a fair \nconfirmation process in the Senate that will ensure the Supreme Court \nis at full strength to start its next term in October.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/01/senate-section/article/S7880-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7880-S7882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, before we leave for the Fourth of July \nrecess, I want to congratulate my colleagues for their hard work and \nfocus over the past 6 months. We have worked hard to deliver meaningful \nsolutions for the American people, and we have succeeded.\n  From lawsuit reform to trade and energy policy, we have tackled a \nnumber of key issues that will make America stronger, more prosperous \nand more secure.\n  We also confirmed six new members of the President's administration, \nincluding Secretary Condoleezza Rice, Homeland Security Chief Michael \nChertoff, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, Trade Representative Rob \nPortman, EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson, and the first ever \nNational Intelligence Director, John Negroponte.\n  As I reflect on the goals set out in January, we took on big and \nurgent challenges. And our actions have translated into solutions. \nTogether we are moving America forward.\n  When we began the 109th Congress 6 months ago, America faced a number \nof structural problems threatening our safety, prosperity, and freedom.\n  America was drowning in lawsuit abuse. Our highways and ports were \nfalling into disrepair. We were hitting our 10th year with no energy \nplan and becoming ever more dependent on foreign oil. Partisan \nobstruction was tearing apart the confirmation process. Our troops in \nthe field needed our support. And over the Christmas holiday, a tsunami \ndisaster devastated Southeast Asia.\n  We needed to take bold action, so I laid out a plan.\n  We began by passing the 5th fastest budget in Senate history. That \nallowed us to move on to the issues starting with class action. \nFrivolous lawsuits were so out of control that litigation in America \nhad become the most expensive in the world. In 2003, the tort system \ncost an incredible $246 billion--more than the total economic output of \nmy home State of Tennessee.\n  Frivolous filings dull our competitive edge, clog up state courts, \nwaste taxpayer dollars, and lead to outrageous settlements that award \ntrial attorneys multimillion-dollar fees while their clients get \npennies.\n  Reform was long overdue. So we pulled together and finally passed a \ncomprehensive class action reform bill with nearly three-quarters of \nthe Senate voting in favor. One week later, the bill was signed into \nlaw. And we delivered to America a victory for fairness.\n  With this success at our backs, we turned to bankruptcy abuse.\n  Bankruptcy reform had long been in the works. Similar bills had \npassed the 105th, 106th and 107th Congresses. In this Congress, we \npassed the most sweeping overhaul of bankruptcy law in 25 years to \nrestore fairness, integrity and personal responsibility to the system. \nAnd like class action, the bankruptcy bill passed with broad, \nbipartisan support.\n  I thank my colleagues for finally getting these reforms through. It \nwas not easy. A rich and powerful constituency had a lot to lose from \nreform. But common sense prevailed and we were able to return fairness \nto the system.\n  There is still much to do to curb the lawsuit culture: asbestos, gun \nliability, and medical malpractice. But I am hopeful that the \nbipartisan spirit that carried us this far will continue to push us \nacross the finish line.\n  The highway bill was another area where we were able to come together \nand keep America moving forward.\n  The highway bill was the result of a long, bipartisan process. It was \nbased on more than 3 years of work, over a dozen hearings, testimony \nfrom more that 100 witnesses, and countless hours of negotiation. It \nwas supported by a deep and broad coalition--from State and local \nhighway authorities to national safety advocates.\n  As every commuter knows, America's roads have become choked with \ntraffic. In many American cities, rush hour now lasts all day long.\n  Worse yet, car crashes are the No. 1 cause of death for every age \nfrom 3 to 33. Last year, nearly 43,000 people died in car accidents.\n  Transportation Secretary Norm Mineta rightly observed that, ``If this \nmany people were to die from any one disease in a single year, \nAmericans would demand a vaccine.''\n  This year, we were able to provide relief. By a vote of 89 to 11, we \npassed the long overdue SAFETEA bill. As communities improve their \nroads and ports, America's drivers will face less time sitting in \ntraffic, burning up time and gas.\n  Which brings me to energy. Like the highway bill and lawsuit abuse \nreform, energy policy had languished for years--in this case, for over \na decade.\n  While Congress dithered, oil prices soared.\n  Likewise, instead of the lowest natural gas prices in the \nindustrialized world, we have the highest.\n\n[[Page S7881]]\n\n  And because of high natural gas prices, manufacturing and chemical \njobs have been steadily moving overseas. Farmers are taking a pay cut. \nConsumers are paying too much to heat and cool their homes. Communities \nacross the country are suffering. And as many as 2.7 million \nmanufacturing jobs have been lost because of soaring prices.\n  All the while, we have grown dangerously reliant on foreign sources \nof energy. And some of those foreign sources do not have America's best \ninterests at heart.\n  With all of this as a backdrop, we were finally able, this week, to \npass a comprehensive Energy bill. It took 10 years, but we made it. And \nI am hopeful that, soon, we will be able to deliver to the American \npeople an energy plan the makes America safer and more secure.\n  Another area where we simultaneously strengthened America's national \nand economic security was with the passage of the Central American Free \nTrade Agreement last night.\n  The agreement, which President Bush signed in May of 2004, will \neliminate most trade barriers between the United States, Costa Rica, El \nSalvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republican.\n  CAFTA will open the doors to 44 million new consumers of American \ngoods. And more sales to Central America mean more jobs here at home.\n  It also means a more shared values.\n  Twenty years ago, only two of the CAFTA nations were established \ndemocracies--Costa Rica and the United States. Today, all seven can be \ncounted among the free nations of the world.\n  By linking their economies with democratic capitalism, CAFTA will \nhelp gird these nations against the threats posed in the neighborhood, \nmainly Venezuela and Cuba. It will strengthen their democracies and \nprovide a model for freedom seekers around the world.\n  Which brings me to our outstanding work on the world stage. In April, \nby a near unanimous vote, we passed the emergency defense and war \nsupplemental and Tsunami relief.\n  On the morning of December 26th, the world woke up to the terrible \ntsunami disaster in Southeast Asia.\n  Deep in the Indian Ocean, an enormous earthquake, estimated at a \nmagnitude of 9.0 on the Richter scale--possibly one of the most \npowerful earthquakes in history--caused a devastating tsunami which \nkilled over 155,000 people, seriously injured half a million, and \ndisplaced as many as 5 million from their demolished homes.\n  Thousands of people were literally washed out to sea as the enormous \nwall of water traveling at speeds of up to 500 miles per hour in the \nopen ocean struck the coasts of the Indian Ocean rim. As the waves \nreceded, they took with them whole towns and villages.\n  In the face of this terrible tragedy, America took swift action.\n  We immediately dispatched military ships, planes and helicopters to \ndeliver aid. Twelve thousand of our men and women in uniform worked \naround the clock to reach survivors. And Americans here at home, moved \nby the terrible images and stories, gave millions out of their own \npockets to help.\n  I had the opportunity to travel to the region with Senator Landrieu \nto survey the damage and meet with local doctors and government \nofficials. We learned that it will take years for the region to \nrecover. Many families never will.\n  The legislation we passed in April provides an additional $880 \nmillion to help the victims recover and rebuild. The tsunami story may \nno longer be grabbing headlines, but America is still hard at work \ndoing its part.\n  We are still also hard at work fighting the war on terror. And the \nemergency defense bill provides $75.9 billion in support for our brave \nsoldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq hunting down the enemy, helping to \nrebuild and spread freedom and democracy.\n  As the President reminded the Nation this week, we are engaged in an \nepic struggle. The terrorists and insurgents want to deny the Iraqi \npeople the freedoms that are the right of all mankind.\n  They want democracy in Iraq to fail, so that they can seize power and \nspread their poison.\n  But they will not succeed. We will win this war. But to do so, we \nmust continue to stand together, united in support of our troops and in \nsupport of our values. The terrorists are no match for the will of the \nAmerican people. And as Senators, we have no higher duty than to \nprotect our fellow citizens' safety and well being.\n  The past 6 months were not without their tense and dramatic moments \nin the Senate--none were more dramatic than the battle to confirm the \nPresident's judicial nominees.\n  We appear to have begun to repair the confirmation process and \nrestore dignity, fairness, and respect to our debates.\n  As we said all along, each of these candidates was amply qualified, \nand enjoyed the majority support of the Senate. Each would be confirmed \nif brought to the Senate floor. And each of them were: Priscilla Owen, \nJanice Rodgers Brown, William Pryor, Richard Griffin, David McKeague, \nand Tom Griffith were all confirmed to the Federal bench.\n  Unfortunately, in the process, they had to endure continuous, unfair \nattacks on their character. Some of the nominees in the last Congress \nfound the process so painful, they dropped out rather than continue on.\n  It is no wonder that we now hear reports that smart, qualified judges \ndo not want to be considered for confirmation to the Federal bench. \nThey have concluded that Washington is no place to risk your \nreputation--you may never get it back.\n  Unfortunately, we see this now with the nomination of John Bolton to \nthe United Nations.\n  I have listened to my Democrat colleagues and heard their requests. I \nhave no choice but to conclude that some on the other side are engaged \nin plain, partisan obstruction.\n  John Bolton has a long record of successfully serving his country. He \nhas been confirmed by the Senate no less than four times.\n  I have been more than willing to try to reach a fair accommodation \nwith the various requests, but the goalposts keep moving.\n  This is a critical time for the United States and for the world. \nBecause of the President's vision and commitment, democracy is on the \nmarch around the globe. And with sensible reform, the United Nations \ncan and should be vital in advancing these developments. But we need to \nget a U.N. ambassador in place to make that change happen.\n  We have before us a smart, principled, and straightforward candidate \nwho will effectively articulate the President's policies on the world \nstage.\n  We were assured that the partisan obstruction would stop. But as we \nsee with the John Bolton nomination here we are again. I urge my \ncolleagues to do what is right for the country, to set aside \npartisanship and let the Senate do its work, vote up or down, yes or \nno.\n  We have much to do when we get back. It will be a busy month. I look \nforward to getting down to business and passing more legislation, like \nthe Genetic Non-Discrimination Act we passed in February, that makes \nAmerica more secure.\n  I thank my colleagues for their hard work. I wish them a safe, \nproductive and energizing holiday recess.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of my very brief remarks about the retirement of Justice \nO'Connor, Senator Voinovich be recognized for up to 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. May I inquire, does the Senator from Ohio intend to \nspeak about Justice O'Connor?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I do not.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, would the Senator mind if I made a short \nstatement about Justice O'Connor before he speaks?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I have been here since 10 minutes to 10 waiting to \ngive a speech. I have a schedule today. I would like to have my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Very well.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to briefly celebrate the \nservice of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. I met Justice O'Connor through \nmy wife,\n\n[[Page S7882]]\n\nLabor Secretary Elaine Chao. Justice O'Connor swore her in for two of \nthe positions she has held in the Federal Government, as chairman of \nthe Federal Maritime Commission and, also, most recently, as Secretary \nof Labor. Through Secretary Chao, I have seen her on several occasions \nsocially. I must say that she is an extraordinary individual. During \nher time on the Court, Justice O'Connor has proven herself to be a \nbrilliant jurist and a strong defender of the Constitution. She is \nknown for her fairness and her desire to seek practical solutions for \neven the most difficult decisions upon which the Court had to rule.\n  Justice O'Connor has proved to be an independent thinker and a \nvigorous questioner, narrowing in on precise legal issues with laser-\nlike precision from the bench. She has lived up to the promise to \nrespect the Constitution and to interpret the law judiciously, seeking \nthe narrowest reach possible for the Court's rulings. Justice O'Connor \nis known for approaching each case individually, seeking to arrive at \npractical conclusions.\n  Justice O'Connor has been a great advocate for the Court. She has \ntraveled the globe, speaking to thousands of students, lawyers, foreign \ndignitaries, and others on the judiciary, the Constitution, and the \nlaw. Justice O'Connor's love of this Nation, its judicial process, and \nthe law is widely known.\n  In her most recent book, ``Majesty of the Law, Reflections of a \nSupreme Court Justice,'' she insightfully describes the institution of \nthe Court, its history, customs, and some of its most able members. \nCertainly, we will all agree that Justice O'Connor will long be \nremembered as one of the most distinguished persons ever to serve on \nthe High Court. We wish her very well in her retirement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Ohio is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I just found out that Sandra Day \nO'Connor has resigned from the Supreme Court. I think regardless of \nwhat our political persuasion is or our ideology, we all respect her \nfor living up to her oath of office in that her presence on the Supreme \nCourt is going to be missed by this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/01/senate-section/article/S7882-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7882-S7886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF JOHN BOLTON\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. This is the third time I have come to the Senate floor \nto speak about the nomination of John Bolton to be the next ambassador \nto the United Nations. It is particularly apropos because the Senate is \non the eve of going into the Fourth of July recess. The record before \nthe Senate documents the allegations related to Mr. Bolton's lack of \ninterpersonal skills and management style, the pattern of intimidation \nwith intelligence analysts, and the allegations that Mr. Bolton had a \nhabit of cherrypicking intelligence to suit his perception of the world \nand his ideology.\n  The record has also documented Mr. Bolton's tendency to stray off \nmessage in a manner that could harm U.S. interests and his need for \nsupervision from higher authorities to prevent him from hurting U.S. \nobjectives. The record documents the fact that I was given assurances \nby the Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, that Mr. Bolton would be \nsupervised closely in his new position at the U.N. Because of these \nconcerns--and according to other Members of the Senate, they were given \nthe same assurances--the question we all have to ask is, Why would we \nsend someone to the United Nations who needs supervision?\n  I did not come to the floor today to repeat the record, although \nthese issues are very important to our decision to confirm Mr. Bolton \nas our next ambassador to the United Nations. I came to the floor to \ntalk about why this nomination is particularly unique and why it is \nparticularly important at this time in history that we send the right \ncandidate to the United Nations.\n  The nominee that we send to the U.N. to be the face of the United \nStates to the world community must be able to advance our objectives \nthrough diplomacy and improve the world's opinion of the United States \nat this critical time. America's image is in trouble. World opinion is \nincreasingly negative when it comes to the United States. It is not \nlimited to Muslim countries. Polls of traditional allies and nonallies \nreveal a dangerous rise in negative opinion since the beginning of the \nconflict in Iraq. The Associated Press reported that the popularity of \nthe United States in many countries, including many in Europe, is \nlagging behind even Communist China.\n\n  According to the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, \nabout two-thirds of Britain, 65 percent, saw China favorably compared \nwith 55 percent who held a positive view of the United States. It is \neasy to understand why our friend, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, \nlost 30 seats in the Parliament.\n  The 9/11 Commission made this point in its report that negative \nopinions of the United States have a serious impact on U.S. national \nsecurity objectives. The report stated that winning hearts and minds \nthrough public diplomacy is just as critical to the war on terrorism as \nother tools, such as military assets and intelligence. I know I am not \nthe only American who is disturbed by these numbers. The allegations \nand the criticism do not reflect the facts and are in no way fair to \nthe United States of America. Our country is a decent, generous country \nthat has sacrificed a great deal for our brothers and sisters \nthroughout the world. Our men and women have sacrificed their lives in \nmany wars and peacekeeping operations so that others could be free from \noppression and free to pursue happiness.\n  In Iraq, the deaths of over 1,700 Americans and the injuries borne by \nalmost 13,000 Americans bear witness to this sacrifice. But the fact \nis, we have to do a better job of getting our message out.\n  Our President, who made an outstanding case for our need to stay the \ncourse in Iraq the other night, has stated on a number of occasions \nthat we need to improve our public diplomacy, and he has been very \nsuccessful in pushing forward that agenda in recent months. As I \nmentioned before, the President has nominated Karen Hughes to head up \nhis public diplomacy efforts at the State Department, understanding \nthat it is going to take a talented individual to get the job done. He \nhas also been very successful in strengthening relationships with key \nallies in the last several months.\n  The President has been very clear about the importance of diplomacy \nin dealing with the world and the most pressing national security \nissues. During the President's May 31 press conference at the White \nHouse, just a month ago, he stated:\n\n       The best way to solve any difficult situation is through \n     diplomacy.\n\n  In response to questions about Iran, the President stated that U.S. \npolicy is to let diplomacy work its way and to solve the problem with \ndiplomacy, working with the EU-3, France, Great Britain, and Germany.\n  In response to questions about North Korea, the President said:\n\n       We want diplomacy to work.\n\n  Repeating:\n\n       We want diplomacy to be given a chance to work.\n\n  And that is exactly the position of the Government.\n  Based on these statements, there is no doubt that U.S. national \nsecurity strategy is going to rely on diplomacy for the months ahead, \nand our ambassador to the United Nations must have the ability to \nimplement this Presidential strategy.\n  I recently spoke with Comptroller General David Walker who heads the \nGovernment Accountability Office and is an expert on change in \ngovernmental organizations and how one achieves reform in a \ngovernmental organization. He said that in order to be successful on \nreform, you need someone who respects the institution to be reformed \nand who is respected by the institution.\n  In a March 2005 article in the Los Angeles Times, it was reported \nthat Mr. Bolton was asked why he opposed offering incentives to North \nKorea to abandon its nuclear weapons program.\n  Mr. Bolton stated, ``I don't do carrots.''\n  Any competent diplomat knows you need both a carrot and a stick to be \nsuccessful. One would assume by that statement that Mr. Bolton's mode \nof diplomacy is solely through carrying a big stick.\n  I will read a few quotes of many Mr. Bolton has spoken over the \nyears:\n\n\n[[Page S7883]]\n\n\n       There's no such thing as the United Nations.\n       If the U.N. Secretary Building in New York lost 10 stories, \n     it wouldn't make a difference.\n       Not only do I not care about losing the General Assembly \n     vote, but actually see it as a ``make my day'' outcome.\n\n  Most recently, in answering a question from Juan Williams from \nNational Public Radio, Mr. Bolton said:\n\n       If I were redoing the Security Council today, I'd have one \n     permanent member because that's the real reflection of the \n     distribution of power in the world.\n\n  Mr. Williams queried:\n\n       And that one member would be, John Bolton?\n\n  Mr. Bolton responded:\n\n       The United States.\n\n  This is not a man who is perceived to respect the U.N. and who will \nbe respected by the institution if he goes there.\n  The other issue that makes this nomination particularly unique is the \ngreat opportunity we have before us to reform the United Nations. This \nis not an ordinary time in regard to the U.N. The U.N. has serious \nproblems that need attention now. We all know about the flaws in the \noversight system and the corruption related to the Oil for Food \nProgram.\n  There are also serious problems with the general management of the \nU.N., the Commission on Human Rights, and the standards of conduct for \nU.N. peacekeepers. All of these areas require reform now.\n  The bipartisan U.S. task force, led by Newt Gingrich and George \nMitchell, has issued a report detailing several recommendations for \nreforming the U.N. and calling for action.\n  The report notes that without a renewed and more effective United \nNations, the challenges to international security, development, and \ngeneral well-being will be all the greater because, as the report \nstates, ``an effective U.N. is in American interests.''\n  The opportunity to finally reform the U.N. is even greater now \nbecause we have the support of U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan. He \nfinally gets it, Mr. President.\n  In an article in Foreign Affairs Journal and in a recent article in \nthe Wall Street Journal, Kofi Annan stated, ``The desire for change is \nwidespread, not only in the U.S., but among many member-states, and \nalso many U.N. staff.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that both of these articles be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            United We Stand\n\n                           (By Kofi A. Annan)\n\n       This Sunday marks the 60th anniversary of the signing of \n     the United Nations Charter in 1945. Debate about ``reform'' \n     of the U.N. has been raging almost from that moment on.\n       This is bcause--especially but not only in the United \n     States--idealism and aspiration for the U.N. have always \n     outstripped its actual performance. For 60-years Americans--\n     conservative and liberal alike--have expected much from the \n     U.N. Too often, we have failed to meet those expectations.\n       In Washington, the debate now centers on two documents \n     which appeared last week: the report of the bipartisan Task \n     Force led by former Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Senator \n     George Mitchell, and the Henry J. Hyde United Nations Reform \n     Act, adopted by the House of Representatives.\n       There is considerable overlap between the two \n     prescriptions, as there is between both and the reforms that \n     I myself have proposed--or, where they are within my power, \n     am already implementing. That is not surprising. The desire \n     for change is widespread, not only in the U.S., but among \n     many other U.N. member-states, and also many U.N. staff.\n       All of us want to make the U.N.'s management more \n     transparent and accountable, and its oversight mechanisms \n     stronger and more independent.\n       All of us would like the General Assembly to streamline its \n     agenda and committee structure, so that time and resources \n     are devoted to the burning issues of the day, rather than to \n     implementing resolutions passed years ago in a different \n     political context.\n       All of us are eager to make the U.N.'s human rights \n     machinery more credible and more authoritative, notably by \n     replacing the present Commission on Human Rights with a Human \n     Rights Council, whose members would set an example by \n     applying the standards they are charged to uphold.\n       All of us would like to see a Peacebuilding Commission \n     created within the U.N., to coordinate and sustain the work \n     of helping countries make the transition from war to peace--\n     so that we do not repeat the dangerous relapse into anarchy \n     that we witnessed in Afghanistan before 2001 and more \n     recently in Haiti, as will as several African countries.\n       And all of us want to impose stricter standards of conduct \n     on U.N. peacekeeping missions, especially to put an end to \n     sexual abuse and exploitation.\n       Those are some examples, among many. I believe this \n     convergence of expectations offers us--perhaps for the first \n     time in 60 years--a chance to bridge the gap between \n     aspiration and performance.\n       Where there are differences--not so much between the U.N. \n     and the U.S., but between the Hyde Act and the other \n     proposals on offer--these relate essentially to two points: \n     the method to be used to make reform happen, and the global \n     context which makes U.N. reform so important.\n       For Mr. Hyde and his colleagues, reform can only be brought \n     about by threatening a draconian and unilateral cut in the \n     U.S. contribution to the U.N. budget.\n       I believe that approach is profoundly mistaken and would, \n     if adopted by the U.S. government as whole, prove \n     disastrously counterproductive. It would break the reformist \n     coalition between the U.S. and other member-states whose \n     collective pressure could otherwise make these reforms \n     happen.\n       The U.N. is an association of sovereign states, which \n     agreed, when they ratified the Charter, to share the expenses \n     of the Organization ``as apportioned by the General \n     Assembly.'' The scale of assessment, which determines the \n     share borne by each member-state, is renegotiated every six \n     years; and every year the General Assembly passes a \n     resolution--invariabaly supported by the U.S.--enjoining \n     all members to pay their contributions promptly, in full \n     and without conditions.\n       The way to make changes or reforms, therefore, is to \n     negotiate agreement with other member-states.\n       As the Gingrich-Mitchell task force put it, ``to be \n     successful, American diplomacy must build a strong coalition \n     including key member-states from various regions and groups . \n     . . many of whom share America's' strong desire to reform the \n     United Nations into an organization that works.'' Such a \n     coalition will not be built by one nation threatening to cut \n     its own contribution unilaterally. Other states will not \n     accept such a ``big stick'' approach.\n       Fortunately, the Hyde withholding proposal is not backed by \n     the administration, or indeed by the task force.\n       Even more important, however, is the global context The \n     U.N. does not exist in a vacuum, or for its own sake. It is a \n     forum in which all the world's peoples can come together to \n     find common solutions to their common problems--and, when \n     they so choose, also an instrument with which to pursue those \n     solutions.\n       There are surely more shared global problems and threats \n     today, or anyway not fewer, than when the U.N. was founded.\n       Among the most worrying are the proliferation of terrorist \n     groups and weapons of mass destruction, and the danger that \n     the latter will fall into the hands of the former.\n       Those are very serious threats to people in rich and poor \n     countries alike. The failure of last month's review \n     conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to address \n     them seems breathtakingly irresponsible. I hope the world's \n     political leaders will now take up the issue, with much \n     greater urgency.\n       To deal with such issues, we need, among other things, a \n     stronger and more representative Security Council.\n       But the threats that seem most immediate to many people in \n     poor countries are those of poverty, disease, environmental \n     degradation, bad government, civil conflict, and in some \n     cases--Darfur inevitably springs to mind--the use of rape, \n     pillage and mass murder to drive whole populations from their \n     homes.\n       We can only make progress if we address all these threats \n     at once. No nation can reasonably expect cooperation on the \n     things that matter to it most, unless it is prepared in \n     return to help others with their priorities. And, as the \n     U.N.'s own high-level reform panel pointed out, the different \n     kinds of threats are closely interconnected. Neglect and \n     misgovernment in Afghanistan allowed terrorists to find a \n     haven. Chaos in Haiti caused attempted mass migration to \n     Florida. And poor health systems in poor countries may make \n     it easier for a disease like avian flu to spread \n     spontaneously, or even to be spread deliberately, from one \n     continent to another.\n       So development and security are connected--and both in turn \n     are linked to human rights and the rule of law. The main \n     purpose of my ``In Larger Freedom'' report was to suggest \n     things that can and should be done, by all nations working \n     together, to achieve progress on all these fronts and to make \n     the U.N. a more effective instrument for doing so.\n       Decisions can be taken this September, when political \n     leaders from all over the world meet at U.N. Headquarters for \n     the 2005 world summit. Over 170 have said they will come, and \n     President Bush is expected to be among them.\n       The stakes for the U.S., and for the world, could hardly be \n     higher. The opportunity to forge a common response to common \n     threats may not soon recur. It is in that context, and for \n     that reason, that a reformed and strengthened U.N. is so \n     badly needed.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             ``In Larger Freedom'': Decision Time at the UN\n\n                            (By Kofi Annan)\n\n\n                        OUR SHARED VULNERABILITY\n\n       Ask a New York investment banker who walks past Ground Zero \n     every day on her\n\n[[Page S7884]]\n\n     way to work what today's biggest threat is. Then ask an \n     illiterate 12-year-old orphan in Malawi who lost his parents \n     to AIDS. You will get two very different answers. Invite an \n     Indonesian fisherman mourning the loss of his entire family \n     and the destruction of his village from the recent, \n     devastating tsunami to tell you what he fears most. Then ask \n     a villager in Darfur, stalked by murderous militias and \n     fearful of bombing raids. Their answers, too, are likely to \n     diverge.\n       Different perceptions of what is a threat are often the \n     biggest obstacles to international cooperation. But I believe \n     that in the twenty-first century they should not be allowed \n     to lead the world's governments to pursue very different \n     priorities or to work at cross-purposes. Today's threats are \n     deeply interconnected, and they feed off of one another. The \n     misery of people caught in unresolved civil conflicts or of \n     populations mired in extreme poverty; for example, may \n     increase their attraction to terrorism. The mass rape of \n     women that occurs too often in today's conflicts makes the \n     spread of HIV and AIDS all the more likely.\n       In fact, all of us are vulnerable to what we think of as \n     dangers that threaten only other people. Millions more of \n     sub-Saharan Africa's inhabitants would plunge below the \n     poverty line if a nuclear terrorist attack against a \n     financial center in the United States caused a massive \n     downturn in the global economy. By the same token, millions \n     of Americans could quickly become infected if, naturally or \n     through malicious intent, a new disease were to break out in \n     a country with poor health care and be carried across the \n     world by unwitting air travelers before it was identified.\n       No nation can defend itself against these threats entirely \n     on its own. Dealing with today's challenges--from ensuring \n     that deadly weapons do not fall into dangerous hands to \n     combating global climate change, from preventing the \n     trafficking of sex slaves by organized criminal gangs to \n     holding war criminals to account before competent courts--\n     requires broad, deep, and sustained global cooperation. \n     States working together can achieve things that are beyond \n     what even the most powerful state can accomplish by itself.\n       Those who drew up the charter of the United Nations in 1945 \n     saw these realities very clearly. In the aftermath of World \n     War II, which claimed the lives of 50 million people, they \n     established at the San Francisco conference in 1945 an \n     organization (in the words of the charter) to ``save \n     succeeding generations from the scourge of war.'' Their \n     purpose was not to usurp the role of sovereign states but to \n     enable states to serve their peoples better by working \n     together. The UN's founders knew that this enterprise could \n     not be narrowly conceived because security, development, and \n     human rights are- inextricably linked. Thus they endowed the \n     new world organization with broad ambitions: to ensure \n     respect for fundamental human rights, to establish conditions \n     under which justice and the rule of law can be maintained, \n     and, as the charter says, ``to promote social progress and \n     better standards of life in larger freedom.''\n       When the UN Charter speaks, of ``larger freedom,'' it \n     includes the basic political freedoms to which all human \n     beings are entitled. But it also goes beyond them, \n     encompassing what President Franklin Roosevelt called \n     ``freedom from want'' and ``freedom from fear.'' Both our \n     security and our principles have long demanded that we push \n     forward all these frontiers of freedom, conscious that \n     progress on one depends on and reinforces progress on the \n     others. In the last 60 years, rapid technological advances, \n     increasing economic interdependence, globalization, and \n     dramatic geopolitical change have made this imperative only \n     more urgent. And since the attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     people everywhere have come to realize this. A new insecurity \n     entered every mind, regardless of wealth or status. More \n     clearly than ever before, we understand that our safety, our \n     prosperity indeed, our freedom--is indivisible.\n\n\n                       A NEW SAN FRANCISCO MOMENT\n\n       Yet precisely when these challenges have become so stark, \n     and when collective action has become so plainly required, we \n     see deep discord among states. Such dissonance discredits our \n     global institutions. It allows the gap between the haves and \n     the have-nots, the strong and the weak, to grow. It sows the \n     seeds of a backlash against the very principles that the UN \n     was set up to advance. And by inviting states to pursue their \n     own solutions, it calls into question some of the fundamental \n     principles that have, however imperfectly, buttressed the \n     international order since 1945.\n       Future generations will not forgive us if we continue down \n     this path. We cannot just muddle along and make do with \n     incremental responses in an era when organized crime \n     syndicates seek to smuggle both sex slaves and nuclear \n     materials across borders; when whole societies are being laid \n     waste by AIDS; when rapid advances in biotechnology make it \n     all too feasible to create ``designer bugs'' immune to \n     current vaccines; and when terrorists, whose ambitions are \n     very plain, find ready recruits among young men in societies \n     with little hope, even less justice, and narrowly sectarian \n     schools. It is urgent that our world unite to master today's \n     threats and not allow them to divide us and thus master us.\n       In recent months, I have received two wide-ranging reviews \n     of our global challenges: one from the 16-member High-Level \n     Panel on Threats, Challenges, and Change, which I had asked \n     to make proposals to strengthen our collective security \n     system; the other from 250 experts who undertook the UN \n     Millennium Project and devised a plan to cut global poverty \n     in half within the next ten years. Both reports are \n     remarkable as much for their hardheaded realism as for their \n     bold vision. Having carefully studied them, and, extensively \n     consulted UN member states, I have just placed before the \n     world's governments my own blueprint for a new era of global \n     cooperation and collective action.\n       My report, entitled ``In Larger Freedom,'' calls on states \n     to use the summit of world leaders that will be held at UN \n     headquarters in September to strengthen our collective \n     security, lay down a truly global strategy for \n     development, advance the cause of human rights and \n     democracy in all nations, and put in place new mechanisms \n     to ensure that these commitments are translated into \n     action. Accountability--of states to their citizens, of \n     states to one another, of international institutions to \n     their members, and of this present generation to future \n     ones--is essential for our success. With that in mind, the \n     UN must undergo the most sweeping overhaul of its 60-year \n     history. World leaders must recapture the spirit of San \n     Francisco and forge a new world compact to advance the \n     cause of larger freedom.\n\n\n                           FREEDOM FROM FEAR\n\n       The starting point for a new consensus should be a broad \n     view of today's threats. These dangers include not just \n     international wars but also civil violence, organized crime, \n     terrorism, and weapons of mass destruction. They also include \n     poverty, infectious disease, and environmental degradation, \n     since these ills can also have catastrophic consequences and \n     wreak tremendous damage. All of these can undermine states as \n     the basic units of the international system.\n       All states--strong and weak, rich and poor--share an \n     interest in having a collective security system that commits \n     them to act cooperatively against a broad array of threats. \n     The basis of such a system must be a new commitment to \n     preventing latent threats from becoming imminent and imminent \n     threats from becoming actual, as well as an agreement on when \n     and how force should be used if preventive strategies fail.\n       Action is required on many fronts, but three of them stand \n     out as particularly urgent. First, we must ensure that \n     catastrophic terrorism never becomes a reality. In that \n     cause, we must make use of the unique normative strength, \n     global reach, and convening power of the UN. To start, a \n     comprehensive convention against terrorism should be \n     developed. The UN has been central in helping states \n     negotiate and adopt 12 international antiterrorism \n     conventions, but a comprehensive convention outlawing \n     terrorism in all its forms has so far eluded us because of \n     debates on ``state terrorism'' and the right to resist \n     occupation. It is time to put these debates aside. The use of \n     force by Most lawyers recognize that the provision includes \n     the right to take preemptive action against an imminent \n     threat; it needs no reinterpretation or rewriting. Yet today \n     we also face dangers that are not imminent but that could \n     materialize with little or no warning and might culminate in \n     nightmare scenarios if left unaddressed. The Security Council \n     is fully empowered by the UN Charter to deal with such \n     threats, and it must be ready to do so.\n       We must also remember that state sovereignty carries \n     responsibilities as well as rights, including the \n     responsibility to protect citizens from genocide or other \n     mass atrocities. When states fail to live up to this \n     responsibility, it passes to the international community, \n     which, if necessary, should stand ready to take enforcement \n     action authorized by the Security Council.\n       The decision to use force is never easy. To help forge \n     consensus over when and how resort to force is appropriate, \n     the Security Council should consider the seriousness of the \n     threat, whether the proposed action addresses the threat, the \n     proportionality of that proposed action, whether force is \n     being contemplated as a last resort, and whether the benefits \n     of using force would outweigh the costs of not using it. \n     Balancing such considerations will not produce made-to-\n     measure answers but should help produce decisions that are \n     grounded in principle and therefore command broad respect.\n\n\n                           LIVING IN DIGNITY\n\n       Accepting our solemn responsibility to protect civilians \n     against massive violations of human rights is part of a \n     larger need: to take human rights and the rule of law \n     seriously in the conduct of international affairs. We need \n     long-term, sustained engagement to integrate human rights and \n     the rule of law into all the work of the UN. This commitment \n     is as critical to conflict prevention as it is to poverty \n     reduction, particularly in states struggling to shed a legacy \n     of violence.\n       The UN, as the vehicle through which the Universal \n     Declaration of Human Rights and two international human \n     rights covenants have been promulgated, has made an enormous \n     contribution to human rights. But the international machinery \n     in place today is not sufficient to ensure that those rights \n     are upheld in practice. The Office of the UN High \n     Commissioner for Human Rights operates on a shoestring \n     budget, with insufficient capacity to monitor the field. The \n     high commissioner's office needs more support, both political \n     and financial. The Security Council--\n\n[[Page S7885]]\n\n     and in time, I hope, the proposed Peacebuilding Commission--\n     should involve the high commissioner much more actively in \n     its deliberations.\n       The Commission on Human Rights has been discredited in the \n     eyes of many. Too often states seek membership to insulate \n     themselves from criticism or to criticize others, rather than \n     to assist in the body's true task, which is to monitor and \n     encourage the compliance of all states with their human \n     rights obligations. The time has come for real reform. The \n     commission should be transformed into a new Human Rights \n     Council. The members of this council should be elected \n     directly by the General Assembly and pledge to abide by the \n     highest human rights standards.\n       No human rights agenda can ignore the right of all people \n     to govern themselves through democratic institutions. The \n     principles of democracy are enshrined in the Universal \n     Declaration of Human Rights, which, ever since it was adopted \n     in 1948, has inspired constitutions in every corner of the \n     globe. Democracy is more widely accepted and practiced today \n     than ever before. By setting norms and leading efforts to end \n     colonialism and ensure self-determination, the UN has helped \n     nations freely choose their destiny. The UN has also given \n     concrete support for elections in more and more countries: in \n     the last year alone, it has done so in more than 20 areas and \n     countries, including Afghanistan, Palestine, Iraq, and \n     Burundi. Since democracy is about far more than elections, \n     the organization's work to improve governance throughout the \n     developing world and to rebuild the rule of law and state \n     institutions in war-torn countries is also of vital \n     importance. Member states of the UN should now build on this \n     record, as President George W. Bush suggested to the UN \n     General Assembly in September 2004, by supporting a fund to \n     help countries establish or strengthen democracy.\n       Of course, at the UN, democratic states sometimes have to \n     work with nondemocratic ones. But today's threats do not stop \n     neatly at the borders of democratic states, and just as no \n     democratic nation restricts its bilateral relations to \n     democracies, no multilateral organization designed to achieve \n     global objectives can restrict its membership to them. I look \n     forward to the day when every member state of the General \n     Assembly is democratically governed. The UN'S \n     universal membership is a precious asset in advancing that \n     goal. The very fact that nondemocratic states often sign \n     on to the U.N.'s agenda opens an avenue through which \n     other states, as well as civil society around the world, \n     can press them to align their behavior with their \n     commitments.\n\n\n                           FREEDOM FROM WANT\n\n       Support for human rights and democracy must go hand in hand \n     with serious action to promote development. A world in which \n     every year 11 million children die before their fifth \n     birthday, almost all from preventable causes, and 3 million \n     people of all ages die of AIDS is not a world of larger \n     freedom. It is a world that desperately needs a practical \n     strategy to implement the Millennium Declaration on which all \n     states solemnly agreed five years ago. The eight Millennium \n     Development Goals that are to be achieved by 2015 include \n     halving the proportion of people in the world who live in \n     extreme poverty and hunger, ensuring that all children \n     receive primary education, and turning the tide against HIV/\n     AIDS, malaria, and other major diseases.\n       The urgency of taking more effective action to achieve \n     these goals can hardly be overstated. Although the deadline \n     is still a decade away, we risk missing it if we do not \n     drastically accelerate and scale up our action this year. \n     Development gains cannot be achieved overnight. It takes time \n     to train teachers, nurses, and engineers; to build roads, \n     schools, and hospitals; and to grow the small and large \n     businesses that create jobs and generate income for the poor.\n       The U.N. summit in September must be the time when all \n     nations sign up not just for a declaration but also for a \n     detailed plan of attack on deadly poverty by which all can be \n     judged. That summit will be a moment for deeds rather than \n     words--a moment to implement the commitments that have been \n     made to move from the realm of aspirations to that of \n     operations.\n       At the core of this plan must be the global partnership \n     between rich and poor countries, the terms of which were set \n     out three years ago at the International Conference on \n     Financing for Development in Monterrey, Mexico. That historic \n     compact was firmly grounded in the principles of mutual \n     responsibility and mutual accountability. It reaffirmed the \n     responsibility of each country for its own development and \n     elicited concrete commitments from wealthy nations to support \n     poorer ones.\n       In September, all developing countries should undertake to \n     put forward, by 2006, practical national strategies to meet \n     the Millennium Goals. Each country should map the key \n     dimensions and underlying causes of extreme poverty, use that \n     map to assess its needs and identify necessary public \n     investments, and convert that assessment into a ten-year \n     framework for action, elaborating three-to-five-year poverty-\n     reduction strategies for the meantime.\n       Donors must also ensure that developing countries that put \n     such strategies in place really do get the support they need, \n     in the form of market access, debt relief, and official \n     development assistance (ODA). For too long, ODA has been \n     inadequate, unpredictable, and driven by supply rather than \n     demand. Although such aid has been increasing since the \n     Monterrey summit, already with noticeable results, many \n     donors still give far less than the target of 0.7 percent of \n     gross national income. All of them should now draw up their \n     own ten-year strategies to meet the 0.7 percent target by \n     2015 and ensure that they reach 0.5 percent by 2009.\n       We need action on other fronts, too. On global climate \n     change, for example, the time has come to agree on an \n     international framework that draws in all major emitters of \n     greenhouse gases in a common effort to combat global warming \n     beyond the year 2012, when the Kyoto Protocol is due to \n     expire. We need both a commitment to a new regulatory \n     framework and far more innovative use of new technologies and \n     market mechanisms in carbon trading. We must also learn the \n     lesson of December's devastating tsunami, by putting in place \n     a worldwide capability to give early warning of all natural \n     hazards--not just tsunamis and storms, but floods, droughts, \n     landslides, heat waves, and volcanic eruptions.\n\n\n                              A RENEWED UN\n\n       If the U.N. is to be a vehicle through which states can \n     meet the challenges of today and tomorrow, it needs major \n     reforms to strengthen its relevance, effectiveness, and \n     accountability. In September, decisions should be reached to \n     make the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council \n     more strategic in their work. Just as we contemplate creating \n     new institutions such as a Peacebuilding Commission, we \n     should abolish those that are no longer needed, such as the \n     Trusteeship Council.\n       No reform of the U.N. would be complete, however, without \n     Security Council reform. The council's present makeup \n     reflects the world of 1945, not that of the twenty-first \n     century. It must be reformed to include states that \n     contribute most to the organization, financially, militarily, \n     and diplomatically, and to represent broadly the current \n     membership of the U.N. Two models for expanding the council \n     from 15 to 24 members are now on the table: one creates six \n     new permanent seats and three new nonpermanent ones; the \n     other creates nine new nonpermanent seats. Neither model \n     expands the veto power currently enjoyed by the five \n     permanent members. I believe the time has come to tackle this \n     issue head on. Member states should make up their minds and \n     reach a decision before the September summit.\n       Equally important is reform of the U.N. Secretariat and the \n     wider network of agencies, funds, and programs that make up \n     the U.N. system. Since 1997, there has been a quiet \n     revolution at the U.N., rendering the system more coherent \n     and efficient. But I am deeply conscious that more needs to \n     be done to make the organization more transparent and \n     accountable, not just to member states, but to the public on \n     whose confidence it relies and whose interests it ultimately \n     must serve. Recent failures have only underlined this \n     imperative.\n       I am already taking a series of measures to make the U.N. \n     Secretariat's procedures and management more open to \n     scrutiny. But if reform is to be truly successful, the \n     secretary-general, as chief administrative officer of the \n     organization, must be empowered to manage it with autonomy \n     and flexibility, so that he or she can drive through the \n     necessary changes. The secretary-general must be able to \n     align the organization's work program behind the kind of \n     agenda I have outlined, once it is endorsed by member states, \n     and not be hamstrung by old mandates and a fragmented \n     decision-making structure that jeopardize setting a central \n     strategic direction. When member states grant the post this \n     autonomy and flexibility, they will have both the right and \n     the responsibility to demand even greater transparency and \n     accountability.\n\n\n                             decision time\n\n       In calling on member states to make the most far-reaching \n     reform in the organization's history and to come together on \n     a range of issues where collective action is required, I do \n     not claim that success through multilateral means is \n     guaranteed. But I can almost guarantee that unilateral \n     approaches will, over time, fail. I believe states have no \n     reasonable alternative to working together, even if \n     collaboration means taking the priorities of your partners \n     seriously to ensure that they will take seriously your own in \n     return--even if, as President Harry Truman said in San \n     Francisco 60 years ago, ``We all have to recognize, no matter \n     how great our strength, that we must deny ourselves the \n     license to do always as we please.''\n       The urgency of global cooperation is now more apparent than \n     ever. A world warned of its vulnerability cannot stand \n     divided while old problems continue to claim the lives of \n     millions and new problems threaten to do the same. A world of \n     interdependence cannot be safe or just unless people \n     everywhere are freed from want and fear and are able to live \n     in dignity. Today, as never before, the rights of the poor \n     are as fundamental as those of the rich, and a broad \n     understanding of them is as important to the security of the \n     developed world as it is to that of the developing world.\n       Ralph Bunche, a great American and the first U.N. official \n     to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, once said that the U.N. \n     exists ``not merely to preserve the peace but also to make \n     change--even radical change--possible without violent \n     unheaval. The U.N. has no\n\n[[Page S7886]]\n\n     vested interest in the status quo.'' Today, these words take \n     on new significance. The U.N.'s mission of peace must bring \n     closer the day when all states exercise their sovereignty \n     responsibly, deal with internal dangers before these threaten \n     their citizens and those of other states, enable and empower \n     their citizens to choose the kind of lives they would like to \n     live, and act with other states to meet global threats and \n     challenges. In short, the U.N. must steer all of the world's \n     peoples toward ``better standards of life in larger \n     freedom.'' The U.N. summit in September is the chance for all \n     of us to set out on that path.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, Kofi Annan also stated there is \nconsiderable overlap between the Mitchell-Gingrich task force report \nand the reforms he himself is proposing, and that he is prepared to \nimplement them.\n  He stated:\n\n       All of us want to make the U.N.'s management more \n     transparent and accountable, and its oversight mechanisms \n     stronger and more independent.\n\n  He stated:\n\n       All of us want to make the U.N.'s human rights machinery \n     more credible . . . by replacing the present Commission on \n     Human Rights with a Human Rights Council.\n\n  He also stated:\n\n       All of us want to impose stricter standards of conduct on \n     U.N. peacekeeping missions, especially an end to sexual abuse \n     and exploitation.\n\n  These statements indicate we are in a unique position with the U.N. \nand there is a sincere interest in reform. We have to seize this \nopportunity now.\n  When you are dealing with an organization that understands the need \nfor reform and is echoing our objectives and is ready to cooperate, we \nneed to send in not the ``bad cop,'' or the guy with the ``sharp \nelbows,'' or the guy who says, ``I don't do carrots.'' We need to send \nthe ``good cop,'' the guy who knows how to reap the benefits of the \nenvironment for change and make it happen.\n  John Bolton is a bold contradiction to the efforts to improve the \nimage of the U.S. at this critical time, as well as a contradiction to \nthe President's efforts to ramp up public diplomacy.\n  John Bolton is a bold contradiction to efforts to reform the U.N. If \nwe do not send the right person to the U.N., there is substantial risk \nwe might lose this unprecedented and ripe opportunity to achieve \nimportant reforms.\n  The person we send to the U.N. will have great influence on the \nworld's perception of the United States, our values, our decency, and \nwill be critical to the urgent reforms that must be made at the U.N.\n  Our success on these issues--public diplomacy and U.N. reform--will \nhave an enormous impact on our ability to win the war on terrorism, to \npromote peace in the world and, most importantly, whether we live in an \nAmerica that is free from terror.\n  Mr. President, how many minutes do I have left?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I will comment for a couple of minutes \non the very fine statement the leader made in regard to the advertising \nfor prescription drugs. I think he made a clear statement and sends a \nlarge message to the drug companies that they have to reevaluate their \nadvertising campaign. The statement confirms the fact to the American \npeople that we are paying more for drugs because of those advertising \ncosts.\n  I think it is particularly appropriate for us to be raising this \nissue at this time because this year millions of Americans--Medicare-\neligible people--are going to be signing up to take advantage of the \nprescription drug benefits of the Medicare Modernization Act. It is \nvery important that while they are signing up and taking advantage of \nthis new opportunity--an opportunity that I think will make the largest \nimprovement in public health since the advent of the Medicare Program--\nthey don't just willy-nilly have drugs prescribed for them that they \nmay or may not need.\n  I think one other point needs to be made, and that is, in this era in \nwhich we live, we all have to be our own best friend. At one time, I \ntook Vioxx. I called my pharmacist and discussed other drugs I was \ntaking. He told me Vioxx contributed to an increase in blood pressure. \nI was taking other drugs to bring down my blood pressure. I decided \nvoluntarily that this doesn't make sense and I got off Vioxx. I lost 10 \npounds. Now, once in a while when I have arthritic pain, I take a \nMotrin. But the fact is that all of us Members of Congress and the \nordinary public have to pay a lot more attention to the drugs we are \ntaking because, as the leader said, the side effects are significant \nand we have to be careful about it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I have come to the floor to make comments \nconcerning our good friend, Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. \nIt has been Catherine's and my honor to have become very close to the \nO'Connors.\n  I want to tell the Senate that I think Justice Sandra Day O'Connor is \none of the most extraordinary and gracious women I have ever known. She \nhas come to Alaska often. What most people don't know is she is a very \nfine fisher person. I think one of the most interesting letters I ever \nreceived in my life was the letter I received from Sandra Day after she \nhad gone fishing to a remote fishing lodge in Alaska. She was the only \nwoman there at the time. She fished through some rainy periods and \nsunny periods and gave a general description of the joy she had being \nable to have the time to fish and to think as she did that. It was a \nreal joy to read that letter.\n  I also asked Sandra Day O'Connor to come to Alaska and speak--she has \nbeen there many times--at the Anchorage Library. She gave a stirring \naddress to mainly young women who were part of the Alaska State Bar \nAssociation. That evening, we had a dinner for Justice O'Connor, and \nher husband John asked for the privilege of introducing her. I want to \ntell the Senate that I think that was probably the most moving tribute \nI ever heard a husband deliver for his wife in my life.\n  Her husband John is a fine lawyer and a devoted husband. He told us a \nstory of how he felt when Sandra Day got the call asking her if she \nwould become a member of the Supreme Court. Sandra Day O'Connor, just 2 \nweeks ago, at my request, took a group of the Chinese delegates to the \nSenate-Chinese parliamentary conference to the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States. She took the time to take these Chinese representatives \nthrough the Court and explain our judicial process and how it is an \nessential function of our democracy to these delegates who came to meet \nto discuss issues of great importance to the nation of China and our \nown Nation. The way she handled those people and the gracious way in \nwhich she described the functions in the chamber, and took us to the \ncourtroom and explained how the Court listens to the attorneys who \npresent cases and how the Court reacts individually to statements, and \nthe type of questions she puts to the attorneys who represent various \nlitigants, was a most instructive session for our Chinese friends. \nAgain, it demonstrated the depth of Sandra Day O'Connor. She is one \ngreat lady.\n  She has been an exemplary public servant who has made exceptional \ncontributions not only to the Supreme Court but to our Nation. I think \nshe will be remembered in this country as a groundbreaker, overcoming \nadversity and stereotypes. She was the first woman nominated to be a \nmember of our Supreme Court.\n  She is a native of southeastern Arizona and she grew up on an \nisolated ranch owned by her parents. The ranch itself did not receive \nelectricity or running water until she was seven. My wife's family had \na similar experience living in another part of Arizona. I think that is \none of the reasons we have become so close to the O'Connors.\n  She received her bachelor's degree in economics, magna cum laude, \nfrom Stanford University in 1950. After she received her bachelor's \ndegree, O'Connor enrolled at Stanford Law School, graduating third in \nher class and serving on the Stanford Law Review. It was during law \nschool that she met her husband, John.\n  After graduating from law school, she faced a tough job market as a \nfemale attorney. After having difficulty\n\n[[Page S7887]]\n\nfinding a position in the private sector, Sandra Day O'Connor accepted \na position working as Deputy County Attorney for San Mateo County, \nCalifornia.\n  When her husband John was drafted into the JAG Corps in 1953, she \nmoved to Frankfurt, Germany with him and served as a civilian attorney \nfor the Quartermaster Market Center from 1954-1957.\n  After leaving Germany, O'Connor returned to Arizona and again faced \ndifficulty in finding employment with a private law firm. As a result, \nshe began a small practice of her own where she practiced from 1958-\n1960.\n  In 1965, after returning to work following a brief hiatus to care for \nher children, O'Connor accepted a position as an Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for the State of Arizona.\n  In 1968, she was appointed to the Arizona State Senate by the \ngovernor to fill a vacancy. O'Connor successfully defended her Senate \nseat in the next election, and was subsequently reelected to two more \nterms. During this time, O'Connor was elected to be majority leader of \nthe Arizona Senate.\n  O'Connor was elected Judge of Maricopa County Superior Court in 1975 \nand she served until 1979 when she was appointed to the Arizona Court \nof Appeals. In 1981, President Reagan appointed her as the first woman \nto sit on the Supreme Court and she was confirmed unanimously by the \nSenate.\n  During her time on the Court, Justice O'Connor has proven herself to \nbe a brilliant jurist and a strong defender of the Constitution. She is \nknown for her fairness and her desire to seek practical solutions for \neven the most difficult decisions the Court has ruled on.\n  Justice O'Connor has proven to be an independent thinker and a \nvigorous questioner, narrowing in on precise legal issues with laser-\nlike precision from the bench.\n  She has lived up to her promise to respect the Constitution and to \ninterpret the law judiciously, seeking the narrowest reach possible for \nthe Court's rulings. Justice O'Connor is known for approaching each \ncase individually, seeking to arrive at practical conclusions.\n  Justice O'Connor has been a great advocate for the Court. She has \ntraveled the globe, speaking to thousands of students, lawyers, foreign \ndignitaries and others on the judiciary, the Constitution, and the law.\n  Justice O'Connor's love of this Nation, its judicial process, and the \nlaw is widely known. In her most recent book, ``Majesty of the Law: \nReflections of a Supreme Court Justice'' she insightfully describes the \ninstitution of the court, its history, customs and some of its notable \nmembers.\n  Justice O'Connor, is ``one of the most significant historical figures \nof the 21st century'' and ``an inspiration to all future generations.'' \nChief Judge Stephen McNamee, U.S. District Court, District of Arizona.\n  ``[Justice O'Connor] likes to hear people's points of view. I never \nfelt I had to agree with her to conform to her view.''

Mr. President, many Americans will soon enjoy a long 3-day \nweekend, courtesy of the Fourth of July, which this year falls on a \nMonday.\n  The Fourth of July is a wonderful time. Summer's heat has not yet \nworn us down. School has not been out so long that the days have begun \nto drag for the younger set--or for their parents. We are not tired of \nthe season or of each other. The growth of the grass has slowed, so \nthat weekends are not spent on mowing and yard work, but leaves some \ntime for picnics and pools. Gardens are beginning to pour forth their \nbounty, but not yet in such abundance that we have become desperate to \nunload mounds of zucchini and tomatoes. Wild blackberries. I remember \nwhen I was a boy, reaching around the shed and picking off a few wild \nblackberries and having the color of the blackberries stain my \nlips. Wild blackberries are ripening along the edges of fields and the \nheavy perfume of honeysuckle vines makes rural walks a feast--a feast--\nfor the senses. The Fourth of July is a perfect time to glory in the \ngentle bounty of our Nation and of our Nation's families. Independence \nDay, together with Thanksgiving and Christmas, remains a uniquely \nfamily-oriented celebration. When Americans reflect on our freedom, our \nsecurity, our liberties, our many blessings, we like to do it among our \nclosest friends and family.\n\n  Fourth of July parades--oh man, man, man, they will bring out the \ncrowds along community main streets, big towns, little towns, middle-\nsize towns. Small hands--I can just see them, can't you?--small hands, \nlittle hands will clutch miniature flags as firetrucks roll past in all \nof their shining glory. Floats made by church groups, scout troops, and \n4-H clubs will compete, each hoping to demonstrate the greatest \npatriotism.\n  After the parades, there will be family picnics and barbecues that \nhost their own friendly competition as family cooks show off their \ntalents at the grill or on tables laden with traditional favorites such \nas creamy macaroni and potato salad, slow-cooked baked beans--oh, how \ngood they taste--deviled eggs, and chocolate cake.\n  The menu is not as important, however, as the feeling of family \nsolidarity as everyone settles in after a splendid meal to watch the \ncascading displays of fireworks set off in the growing dusk. With the \nexception of some small children and family pets, such as my little \ndog, Trouble, that howl at the thunderous booms and high-pitched \nsqueals of some fireworks, the general response to the evening's finale \nis usually a unanimous ``oooh'' after each bloom of sparks.\n  Even the earliest Independence Day celebrations were marked by \nsimilar displays of patriotism, often including the discharge of \ncannons, one for each State in the Union, and toasts, also one for each \nState in the Union.\n  On July 3, 1776, John Adams wrote to his wife Abigail and said:\n\n       Yesterday the greatest question was decided which ever was \n     debated in America; and a greater perhaps never was, nor will \n     be, decided among men. A resolution was passed without one \n     dissenting colony, that those United Colonies are, and of \n     right ought to be, free and independent States.\n\n  That resolution was on separation from England. It was not until July \n4 that the Declaration of Independence--the Declaration of \nIndependence, there it is with my wife Erma's name on the front of the \nleather cover. It contains the Constitution, the Articles of \nConfederation, yes, and the Declaration of Independence, and some other \nhistoric documents.\n  The Declaration of Independence was voted upon by the Continental \nCongress. Adams felt that the July 2 date was the one that would be \nmarked by celebration, but the physical presence of the declaration \ndocument, along with its stirring rhetoric, allowed it to easily usurp \nthe separation vote tally as the turning point in history.\n  Eighty copies of the original declaration were printed that same \nnight, July 4, for distribution among the rebelling colonies.\n  At the very first Independence Day celebrations, those spontaneous \nones that followed in the days and weeks after the Declaration of \nIndependence was adopted and distributed, the Declaration of \nIndependence was itself a central part of the festivity, read aloud to \nthe crowds gathered at capitols, courthouses, and public places around \nthe newly declared nation. In New York, the Declaration of Independence \nwas read at the head of each brigade of the Continental Army posted \naround the city, to loud hurrahs--loud hurrahs.\n  Today, as proud inhabitants of a powerful and wealthy nation, it can \nbe difficult to recall that in 1776, the celebrations of independence \nmust be seen as\n\n[[Page S7888]]\n\nacts of incredible bravado. In 1776, the population of the United \nStates was estimated to be between 2.2 million and 2.9 million people \ndispersed over an enormous swath of lightly populated country. Some \n70,000 British loyalists had fled the new United States after \nindependence was declared. The remaining tiny population was taking on \nthe British empire at the height of her power--a colossus five times \nlarger in terms of population that was the greatest and richest in \nhistory since the fall of Rome and the recent victor of wars against \nFrance and Spain that left her in sole possession of much of the North \nAmerican Continent. To wave flags and shoot off fireworks in \ncelebration of the Declaration of Independence from such a behemoth was \ntantamount to a junior varsity football team taking on the entire \nNational Football League for the Super Bowl and thumbing their noses to \nboot. In point of fact, it took everything the new Nation had to eke \nout a victory. There were many points during the Revolution at which \nthe outcome was far from certain.\n  Even in the aftermath of victory, the future of the new Nation was \nfragile. Burdened by war debt, exhausted, struggling to form a workable \ngovernment out of 13 highly independent new States, the new Nation \nlimped along without even an established capital. It was not until the \nConstitution was drafted in 1787 and the new Capital established in \nWashington, DC, that the new Nation took on a sense of stability and \npermanence. On July 4, 1801, President Thomas Jefferson, the principal \ndrafter of the Declaration of Independence, opened the White House to \nguests while the Marine Band played patriotic music on the lawn and \nmilitia units conducted military drills with fixed bayonets.\n\n  Independence Day celebrations were conducted far from Washington as \nwell. Two hundred years ago, July 4, 1805, found the Lewis and Clark \nexpedition traveling along the upper Missouri River in Montana. LT \nWilliam Clark noted in his journal that the group honored the day with \nas much of a feast as they could muster, drank the last of their \nbrandy, and pulled out the fiddle for dancing and merriment until ``a \nlate hour.'' I am especially pleased to note that fiddle playing was \npart of the day's celebration. In my younger days, family gatherings \nalways included some fiddle playing, a little singing, and maybe a \nlittle dancing. It is a tradition as old as the Fourth of July.\n  I hope, Mr. President, that on this Independence Day, many Americans \nmay enjoy a little fiddle music--it keeps you down to Earth--a healthy \ndollop of patriotism, and the pleasure of family. As we celebrate the \nday with friends and families at home or out amid our Nation's \nbeautiful wild spaces, I hope all of our citizens will spare a moment \nor two to read the Declaration of Independence. Let us remember that \neach person who signed that Declaration of Independence virtually was \nsigning his own death warrant. After all, they could have been charged \nwith treason against the King and hanged. Think of it.\n  The colonists rebelled against a government that was arbitrary, \nunjust, high handed, and unwilling to even hear the concerns of those \nit governed. They rebelled against a tyrant who made the military \nindependent of and superior to civil authority, who imposed taxes \nwithout their consent, deprived them of the benefits of trial by jury, \ncut off their trade, abolished their laws, and fundamentally altered \nthe form of government, suspended their legislatures, captured their \npeople at sea, and forced them to bear arms against the colonists, and \nignored their pleas for justice, these things among many other \ngrievances.\n  On the Fourth of July, Americans celebrate and honor the tremendous \nvision of our Founding Fathers, their incredible courage, and their \nwillingness to take on a fight that must have seemed a desperate \ngamble. We celebrate a document that laid out for all the world to see \njust what kind of a nation we aim to be and just what kind of a \ngovernment we would never stand for--we should never stand for.\n  The Declaration of Independence is more than a piece of paper. The \nDeclaration of Independence is more than a piece of history. It is a \nvow for the future, a call to battle, and the cornerstone of a new \nnation. As we watch the flags snap and pop in the breeze as the parade \nswings past, recall the words of the Declaration that put troops on the \nmarch to take on the King's armies. Each citizen, each family, has much \nto be grateful for as a result of that document.\n  And so, Mr. President, let me read briefly from that beautiful \nDeclaration:\n\n       When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary \n     for one people to dissolve the political bands which have \n     connected them with another, and to assume among the powers \n     of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the \n     Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent \n     respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should \n     declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these \n     rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their \n     just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever \n     any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it \n     is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to \n     institute new Government, laying its foundation on such \n     principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them \n     shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.\n  On this Fourth of July, let us honor and let us recall the \ngenerations of brave Americans who have fought on and off the \nbattlefield to preserve our freedom, and then let us remember the words \nof Henry Van Dyke's poem ``America For Me.''\n\n     Tis fine to see the old world, and travel up and down\n     Among the famous palaces and cities of renown,\n     To admire the crumbly castles and the statues of the kings;\n     But now I think I've had enough of antiquated things.\n\n     So it's home again, and home again, America for me!\n     My heart is turning home again, and there I long to be,\n     In the land of youth and freedom beyond the ocean bars,\n     Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of \n           stars.\n\n     Oh, London is a man's town, there's power in the air;\n     And Paris is a woman's town, with flowers in her hair;\n     And it's sweet to dream in Venice, and it's great to study in \n           Rome\n     But when it comes to living there is just no place like home.\n\n     I like the German firwoods, in green battalions drilled;\n     I like the gardens of Versailles with flashing fountains \n           filled;\n     But, oh, to take your hand, my dear, and ramble for a day in \n           the friendly [West Virginia hills] where nature has her \n           way!\n\n     I know that Europe's wonderful, yet something seems to lack:\n     The past is too much with her, and the people looking back.\n     But the glory of the present is to make the future free;\n     We love our land for what she is and what she is to be.\n\n     Oh, it's home again, and home again, America for me!\n     I want a ship that's westward bound to plough the rolling \n           sea,\n     To the blessed land of room enough beyond the ocean bars,\n     Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of \n           stars.\n\n                                                 --Henry Van Dyke.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I will say to my friend from West \nVirginia, I had occasion to live abroad for 2 years, and as I caught \nthe ship to come home again, westward bound--I suppose that dates me \nbecause now you go by plane--I recited that poem. It is good to hear it \nrecited on the floor of the Senate in the shadows of the Fourth of \nJuly.\n  While I was waiting and heard the Senator from West Virginia urge us \nall to read the Declaration of Independence, I took the copy that is in \nmy desk and I read it through so I can report to him that I have done \nmy homework.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bennett pertaining to the introduction of S. 1379 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/01/senate-section/article/S7888-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7888-S7889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      JUSTICE SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to mark a historic occasion, and \nthat is the retirement of our Nation's first female Supreme Court \nJustice, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. As the father of two daughters \nwho are now 22 and 23, I\n\n[[Page S7889]]\n\nappreciate in so many ways the career of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, \nbut one of the ways I appreciate her career is that she has paved the \nway toward the highest accomplishment for women in our society, and for \nthat I shall be grateful always.\n  She was Justice O'Connor, after all, born in El Paso, TX--I have to \nremind my colleagues of that--on March 26, 1930. She married law school \nclassmate John Jay 0'Connor III in 1952 and raised three sons: Scott, \nBrian, and Jay--all while managing, as many women do in our society \ntoday, a career and family at the same time, but in this instance \ndemonstrating and living out one of the most remarkable legal and \npolitical careers in our history.\n  She received her undergraduate and law degrees at Stanford University \nand graduated third in her class. She then served as deputy county \nattorney in San Mateo County, CA, and then as a civilian attorney for \nQuartermaster Market Center in Frankfurt, Germany. She later served as \nassistant attorney general of Arizona and then as a member of the \nArizona State Senate. As one who has now served in the executive branch \nand the judicial branch of State government in Texas and now serves in \nthe legislative branch in Washington, the kind of service Justice \nO'Connor has had in all of her varied and important positions during \nher career has well prepared her as a Justice on the Court and \nunderstanding both the opportunities and potential and the limitation \nof government to do good in our country and in our society and what \nquestions can be resolved by government and which questions are best \nreserved to the people.\n  In 1975, she was elected judge of the Maricopa County Superior Court \nand served there until 1979, when she was appointed to the Arizona \nCourt of Appeals. In 1981, it was President Ronald Reagan who nominated \nher as Associate Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court. She has written two \nbooks, ``Lazy B'' and her most recent, ``Majesty of the Law.''\n  Justice O'Connor has played a leading role in some of the Nation's \nmost contentious legal disputes in recent years. And she has provided a \ncritical voice of judicial restraint on a number of important issues on \nwhich the Court is closely divided 5 to 4.\n  She authored the Court's 5-4 majority opinion upholding the three-\nstrikes-and-you're-out law for repeat convicted criminals. She wrote \nthe Court's plurality opinion in Hamdi, affirming the President's legal \nauthority to detain enemy combatants in wartime and thus preserving a \nkey tool in the ongoing global war on terrorism. She provided the \ncritical fifth vote protecting the First Amendment freedom of \nassociation of the Boy Scouts. She has provided the critical fifth vote \nin case after case after case, involving the important role that States \nplay in our federalist system of Government, and in the protection of \nreligious liberties and religious expression in the public square.\n  Justice O'Connor has made important contributions to our \njurisprudence, even when she was not part of the Court's ruling \nmajority. Just last week, she penned an important dissent on behalf of \nprivate property rights against overreaching and ever-growing \ngovernment--and against the 5-4 majority ruling in Kelo which has \nattracted so much national attention and outrage this past week. Last \nyear, she provided a critical voice in defense of the voluntary \nrecitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools, even though a \nmajority of her colleagues refused to do so. And 2 years ago, she \ndemonstrated respect for precedent when she refused to join the Court's \ncontroversial majority opinion in Lawrence v. Texas, the 2003 decision \nthat inspired State and Federal court rulings and local government \nactions against traditional marriage laws nationwide.\n  Throughout her 24 years of service on the Nation's highest court, \nJustice O'Connor worked to restore common sense to our criminal justice \nsystem and due regard for the power reserved to the States under the \nConstitution, and to limit restrictions on faith in the public square. \nThanks to Sandra Day O'Connor, victims of crime are more likely to \nreceive justice, and inner city children are no longer constitutionally \nbarred from access to school choice programs. Although I have not \nalways agreed with her rulings, I have always felt a deep and abiding \nrespect for her commitment to public service, her reverence for the \nlaw, and her regard for her fellow man and woman.\n  In a time when so many controversial issues divide Americans of good \nwill, it is especially critical that our Federal courts, led by our \nSupreme Court, be steadfast in its interpretation and application of \nthe law as it is written, and for our courts to avoid picking winner \nand losers in the great political debates of our day. Under the steady \nhand of Sandra Day O'Connor, America has weathered some of the most \nheated legal controversies our Nation has ever endured--and for that, \nthe American people will forever be grateful.\n  Today's historic announcement also raises an important question about \nthe Senate and the role we will play in the confirmation process of the \nPresident's selection to succeed Sandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme \nCourt. Moments ago the President called upon the Senate for a dignified \nprocess, and I think we should heed that call. We should conduct \nourselves in a way worthy of this great body, which has served the \nNation for more than 200 years, and which time after time after time, \nwhen there has been a vacancy on the Court, has done its job, providing \nadvice and consent, asking hard questions, investigating the background \nof the President's nominees--but ultimately providing an up-or-down \nvote to each and every one of the President's nominees to the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  The process for considering the next Associate Justice should reflect \nthe best of the American judiciary--not the worst of American politics. \nWe deserve a Supreme Court nominee who reveres the law--and a \nconfirmation process that is civil, respectful, and keeps politics out \nof the judiciary.\n  As I wrote in an op-ed piece this past Monday in National Review \nOnline, which I had printed in the Record yesterday, history affords us \nsome important benchmarks for determining whether the Senate has \nundertaken a confirmation process worthy of the Court and of the \nAmerican people. There is a right way and a wrong way to debate the \nmerits of a Supreme Court nominee. The Senate's past record, \nunfortunately, has been mixed.\n  Whoever the nominee is, the Senate should focus its attention on \njudicial qualifications--not personal political beliefs. Whoever the \nnominee is, the Senate should engage in respectful and honest inquiry, \nnot partisan personal attacks.\n  I wish to congratulate Sandra Day O'Connor on her extraordinary life \nand commitment to public service. I wish her and her family well. I \nyield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/01/senate-section/article/S7889-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7889-S7890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ARMY SPECIALIST JULIE HICKEY\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as we approach the celebration of \nAmerica's Independence Day, I am reminded of something that President \nFranklin D. Roosevelt once said about the ideals we hold dear. He said \nthis: ``In the truest sense, freedom cannot be bestowed; it must be \nachieved.''\n  That was certainly true of our Founding Fathers when they established \nAmerica's freedoms and independence over 225 years ago. And, it is \nstill true today of the men and women in our military who are serving \naround the globe to achieve freedom in nations that have never, ever \nknown it before.\n  Today, I rise to recognize the contributions of an exceptional young \nwoman whose mission it was to protect our freedom here at home and to \npromote its achievement abroad. I pay tribute to her now as we approach \nthe Fourth of July--a date that is significant not just because she \nembodied the ideals it represents, but because it marks the anniversary \nof this brave young woman's death.\n  Army SPC Julie R. Hickey, of Galloway, OH, died at Landstuhl Regional \nMedical Center in Landstuhl, Germany, on July 4, 2004, from diabetic \ncomplications. She was 20 years old.\n  Julie Hickey was born on January 17, 1984. Growing up, she was a fun-\nloving child with a gift for making friends. Her younger sister Rachel \nsays that Julie was always the shoulder to cry on and also the person \nwho wanted to make sure you had fun.\n\n[[Page S7890]]\n\n  Julie was very loyal and very protective of her friends. She was 5 \nfeet and 11 inches tall and built to shelter and stand up for them. \nJulie's friend, Audria Daniels, remembered a time when she was having a \nfight with an old boyfriend. Displaying the personal courage that would \nserve her so well in the Army, Julie stepped right into the middle of \nthis particularly heated exchange and said, ``You can't talk to her \nlike that.'' Even though the young man stood 6 foot 8, he quickly \nbacked down. Looking back, it makes perfect sense that Julie would \ndedicate her life to standing up for others in need. She'd been doing \nit all her life.\n  Julie attended Westland High School in Galloway, OH. During high \nschool, she enlisted in the Army Reserves and completed the Civil \nAffairs Specialist Course at Fort Bragg, NC. She graduated from \nWestland High in 2002, and, wanting to earn money for college, she \njoined the Army Reserves. Julie had been planning to start school at \nThe Ohio State University in the fall of 2003, but before she could \nrealize that dream, Julie was called to serve in Operation Enduring \nFreedom.\n  Julie was deployed to Afghanistan as a member of the 412th Civil \nAffairs Battalion, where she was assigned to the Provincial \nReconstruction Team in Asadabad. As part of this team, she provided \nhumanitarian assistance to the Afghan people, particularly women and \nchildren in need. Seeing the unfair way that women were treated in \nAfghanistan, Julie again decided to stand up. During her time there, \nJulie gave impassioned speeches to women's organizations about how they \nneeded to fight for their rights.\n  Following one particular speech, Julie's mother, Melody, recalled \nthis:\n\n       One of the women came to see her afterward and told her \n     through an interpreter that it made them happy to see Julie \n     wearing pants and working beside men. She said it gave them \n     hope for the future.\n\n  For women who had grown up in oppression, Julie Hickey was an \ninspiration--a hopeful example of what they, too, could be.\n  Ask anyone who knew Julie Hickey, and they would tell you about her \npassion for her work. As her mother said:\n\n       [Julie] loved her job. She spent some of her time working \n     at a medical clinic, where she assisted children. She would \n     teach them personal hygiene. She taught them a little \n     English--how to count from one to 10 and say ``Groovy, man!''\n\n  Julie's work was direct--one-on-one with people--and she could see, \nfirsthand, the good she was doing on the faces of the women and \nchildren with whom she worked. Julie was the type of ambassador that \nthe United States depends on in our efforts to spread the great \nblessings of freedom and democracy in a part of the world still \ntroubled by violence and fear.\n  More than anyone, Julie's mother understood her commitment to serving \nothers in the fight for freedom. She once said that Julie strongly \nbelieved that we need to ``appreciate everything [we] have. We have so \nmuch here just because we were born [in the United States].'' Julie \nnever took this wonderful gift for granted. In fact, she spent her life \npaying it back through her service to others.\n  Tragically, Julie's life of service was cut short by diabetes. \nJulie's mother said that their family has a history of diabetes, but \nthat Julie hadn't been diagnosed with the illness before she left for \nAfghanistan. Even a preliminary medical exam didn't reveal anything \nabnormal. However, when Julie fainted at work one day, she was \nstabilized and moved to a hospital in Bagram. Only then and there was \nshe diagnosed with diabetes.\n  Julie Hickey was transferred to Landstuhl on June 30, 2004. She went \ninto insulin shock and died on the Fourth of July--the day before she \nwas to be sent to Walter Reed Army Medical Center.\n  The sudden nature of this tragedy struck all of Julie's friends and \nfamily. Her mother said that Julie was planning her wedding to another \nsoldier and that she was going to be honorably discharged. According to \nJulie's family, one of the deepest disappointments is that Julie would \nnever get to become a mother and have ``the children she longed for.'' \nGiven the love and compassion she demonstrated all throughout her life, \nJulie clearly would have made a wonderful mother.\n  Julie's awards hardly do justice to the full breadth and depth of her \nservice. But, they do illustrate how special this young lady was. Her \nawards include the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the \nGlobal War on Terrorism Service Medal, the National Defense Service \nMedal, and the Army Service Ribbon.\n  While these awards are, indeed, impressive, there is, perhaps, a \nbetter symbol of Julie's service. On a 2-week leave in late May of \n2004, Julie brought home with her a burqa--the head-to-toe covering \nthat many Afghani women wear. One of the women she had been working \nwith gave this to her. Julie was buried with that burqa in her casket. \nIt was a fitting reminder of the profound impact she had on the life of \nso many Afghan women.\n  As Julie's mother Melody has said, it is, in some respects, fitting \nthat Julie passed away on the day of our Nation's birth. On this July \nFourth, let us remember Army SPC Julie Hickey's dedication to freedom \nand learn from this splendid 20 year old about what it truly means to \nbe an American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/01/senate-section/article/S7890-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7890-S7893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    Specialist James ``Jim'' Miller\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I today honor the memory of Army SPC James \n``Jim'' Miller, IV. The West Chester, OH, native died on January 30, \n2005, when an improvised explosive device hit his convoy near Ramadi, \nIraq. He was 22 years old.\n  That date--January 30, 2005--should sound familiar. It was an \nhistoric day on which Iraqi citizens participated in their first, truly \ndemocratic election. And Jim Miller, an Army medic, was an integral \npart of that remarkable day.\n  Having already treated three of his wounded comrades, Jim could have \nstayed at an aid station to wait out the dangerous Election Day. \nInstead, he volunteered to go back out to the streets and help \nsafeguard Iraqis waiting at polling places. To some, Jim's choice to do \nthat might have seemed like an extraordinary act. But, with Jim, such \nactions were typical. That's just the way he was--always choosing to be \nbrave, always choosing to be selfless. He was, indeed, a hero.\n  Jim Miller was one of those people who left an impression on everyone \nhe met. He was always courteous, polite, and quick to laugh--a laugh \nthat those who knew him describe as soft, gentle, and distinct. Jim was \na very intelligent young man--wise beyond his years. His pee-wee \nfootball coach and mentor, John Hayden, said of Jim's intelligence:\n\n       He had the most sophisticated, elaborate vocabulary of any \n     young boy I'd ever seen. [After every football practice], he \n     would send me home looking to the dictionary for what he had \n     called me that day!\n\n  The oldest--and biggest--of three brothers, Jim had many passions, \none of which was football. In pee-wee football, he was an offensive \nlineman who proudly called himself a ``B-U-B,'' or ``Big Ugly Body.'' \nJim excelled at football and played until his sophomore year at \nAnderson High School. But, according to John Hayden, under the large, \nintimidating physique, Jim was still just ``a big teddy bear. . . . He \nwas . . . a sensitive kid with a lot of depth.''\n  Tragically, during his sophomore year of high school Jim's mother, \nAlice, died of breast cancer. He turned inward to find purpose and \nsolace. At that time, Jim discovered another passion--and that was \nmusic. He started a band, in which he played the guitar, and during his \nsenior year, he signed up for music theory and music history classes.\n  His principal, Diana Carter, remembers him as a ``very bright, \ninsightful, and mature young man--an independent spirit.'' She was also \nimpressed with his decision to take music theory and music history \nbecause it was an extra bit of dedication to music that many musicians \ndon't exhibit. It seems Jim was always a bit more dedicated to the \nthings he was passionate about.\n  Jim graduated from Anderson in 2001 and decided to attend Xavier \nUniversity and study English. After 18 months, though, Jim realized \nthat college was not providing him with the fulfillment he desired. As \nhis father, James Miller, III knew, ``[Jim] was the type of kid who was \nalways looking inside himself.'' When he looked inside himself, Jim \nfound that what he really\n\n[[Page S7891]]\n\nwanted was to join the Army. He enlisted in April, 2003. He completed \nbasic training at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and then decided to train as a \nmedic at Fort Sam Houston in Texas.\n  Becoming an Army medic was the fulfillment for which Jim searched. He \nfelt a sense of purpose and pride in saving the lives of his fellow \nservicemembers. Father Harry Meyer, who presided at the funeral \nliturgy, said this about Jim:\n\n       [He was a] sensitive young man who was struggling to find \n     his place in this world. He found himself as a medic and had \n     decided to pursue a career in the medical field. He was \n     happiest when he was able to serve others and felt helpless \n     when he could not.\n\n  In planning for the future, Jim hoped to work in a trauma unit \nsomeday, so he could continue to provide life saving assistance to \nthose in dire need.\n  After a year as a medic in Korea, Jim was deployed to Iraq in August \nof 2004 with the Army's 1st Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd \nInfantry Division. Jim believed in his mission in Iraq and, according \nto his father, Jim found that most Iraqis he talked with believed in it \ntoo: ``He was surprised to find out that the Iraqi people were fed up \nwith the insurgents and wanted to take back their country.'' True to \nhis nature, Jim became determined to help the Iraqi people realize \ntheir dreams of freedom.\n  It was Jim's usual ``extra bit'' of determination that led him back \nout to the streets of Iraq on Election Day. He was determined that the \nIraqi people would be free to vote safely.\n  In the beginning of my remarks I called SPC James Miller a ``hero.'' \nBut, in today's world, what does that term truly mean? To define Jim \nMiller's heroism I turn to Ralph Waldo Emerson, who wrote:\n\n       A hero is no braver than an ordinary man, but he is brave 5 \n     minutes longer.\n\n  Jim decided to leave the safety of college and enlist in the Army. In \ndoing so, he was brave 5 minutes longer.\n  Jim dutifully answered the call of his country when he was deployed \nto Iraq. In doing so, he was brave 5 minutes longer.\n  On January 30, 2005 Jim--Doc Miller--volunteered to protect the lives \nof Iraqis waiting to vote. In doing so, he was brave five minutes \nlonger.\n  That is why I choose to call him Jim Miller a hero.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Jim's father and stepmother, \nJames and Jodi, and his brothers, Dan and Jeff, in our thoughts and \nprayers.\n\n\n                         Specialist Ryan Martin\n\n  Mr. President, at all military funeral services it is traditional for \na lone bugle to sound ``Taps.'' It is a powerful piece of music that \ncalls us to remember the fallen and honor their sacrifice. Upon its \norigin, however, ``Taps'' was actually a common bugle call that \nsignified ``Lights Out.'' The call told soldiers that it was time to \nend their activities and conversations and turn in for the night. The \nhistory of ``Taps'' is significant because it reminds us not only of \nthe sacrifices of the men and women it is played for, but also of the \nmen and women, themselves.\n  That call for ``Lights Out'' has been played for countless service \nmen and women as they were undoubtedly talking with each other about \ntheir homes, or about their spouses and children, or about just a hot \nshower or a good meal. These men and women were and are heroes who put \ntheir lives on hold to safeguard the lives of others. Taps plays as \nmuch for the lives they gave up as for the lives they gave.\n  I today honor one of these heroes--Army SPC Ryan Martin, from Mt. \nVernon, OH, who gave his life on August 20, 2004, near Samarra, Iraq, \nwhen a roadside explosive detonated near his vehicle. He was 22 years \nold.\n  Ryan Martin, the youngest of three boys, grew up enjoying hunting, \nsports, and fixing cars. He was always willing to help his father, Tom, \nwork on his cattle farm. With his keen mechanical skills and interest \nin fixing cars combined with his love for the outdoors, Ryan was a big \nfan of ``mud running.'' This is a recreational or competitive activity \nin which 4 x 4 vehicles navigate a course of thick, muddy terrain. \nAccording to Matt Hull, one of Ryan's friends, Ryan planned to buy some \nland when he returned from Iraq and create his own place for mud \nrunning--a place where he could enjoy being outside and spending time \nhaving fun with his friends and family.\n  Ryan had a knack for ``hands-on'' work and mechanics. These skills \nled him to study at Knox County Career Center. Ryan graduated from Mt. \nVernon High School and the Career Center in 2000, with training as a \ncarpenter. He then spent a few years working with heavy machinery at \nconstruction sites.\n  The September 11th terrorist attacks changed everything for Ryan. \nAccording to his father, the attacks had a profound effect on Ryan. He \nfelt a sense of duty to protect his country and to seek out those who \nhad harmed so many. And so, after much contemplation, in April 2003, \nRyan enlisted in the Ohio Army National Guard. He then volunteered for \nactive duty in February 2004.\n  Ryan wanted to be part of the effort to rebuild Iraq, hastening the \ndevelopment of democracy and making the world a more stable and safe \nplace for all of us. He operated bulldozers, excavators, and mine \nclearing machinery with the 216th Engineering Battalion, based out of \nChillicothe, OH. At its core, Ryan's service to our country was a \nhumanitarian service to the Iraqi people. He used his mechanical \nexpertise to build roads, dig foundations for new buildings, and clear \ndeadly mines from roads and fields.\n  Ryan built not only infrastructure in Iraq, but also lasting \nfriendships with his fellow soldiers. According to his stepmother, \nJackie Martin, on the eve of a 2-week leave from Iraq, Ryan said that \n``he was looking forward to coming home, but when it came time to pack \nup, he didn't want to leave his buddies. He really made some good \nfriendships and bonded with others while he was there.''\n  Ryan is remembered fondly by his friends and comrades, who called him \n``Little Bear''--referencing his 6' 2\", 240 pound body. One of his \nbuddies, Sergeant Ron Eaton, recalls Ryan's sense of humor:\n\n       [Ryan would] get us to laugh in extremely harsh situations. \n     I remember talking in our bunks one night, and hearing him \n     tell of how he purchased a semi truck just after this 16th \n     birthday, without his parent's knowledge. They made him sell \n     it back, but knowing Ryan, that's just the kind of thing he \n     would do.\n\n  Risking his life to protect his friends was also the kind of thing \nRyan would do--and did do. Ryan's father, Tom Martin, said that at a \nmilitary ball he attended after Ryan's death, a general came up to him \nand told him that ``when there was trouble, [Ryan] didn't stand behind \npeople and he didn't stand beside them--he stood in front of them.''\n  Ryan was always willing and eager to volunteer for dangerous \nmissions, missions that had the protection of others as their goal. In \nthe words of one of his commanding officers:\n\n       Ryan [made] work much safer for other soldiers.\n\n  When he was killed, Ryan was doing just that: making the area more \nsecure for his comrades, as he helped clear deadly mines and other \ndetonation devices from the vital highway so his fellow soldiers--his \nfriends--could do their jobs more safely.\n  Mr. President, as we all know, our Armed Forces are made up of men \nand women from all of our communities, people who are volunteering \ntheir time, sacrificing their safety and their lives to serve on our \nbehalf. It is through their service that they spread democracy and help \nmake our world safer.\n  That is what Ryan Martin did. He built roads and houses, cleared \nmines, and made friends. In doing all of it, he was making the world a \nbetter place. He ultimately gave his life, a life that was just \nbeginning, and he did so so that others could have a fresh start and a \nbetter tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, when I mentioned earlier the calling of ``Taps,'' I \ndid not mention the words that go along with the bugle call. Let me now \nread those words:\n\n     Day is done,\n     Gone the sun,\n     From the Earth, from the hill, from the sky.\n     All is well,\n     Safely rest,\n     God is nigh.\n\n  While the men and women for whom ``Taps'' is played are gone from \nthis Earth, we can take solace in knowing that they may now ``safely \nrest.'' The Sun may have set, but it will rise again and a new day will \ndawn. And with every new day, we will always remember the sacrifice and \nservice of those who have fallen.\n\n[[Page S7892]]\n\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Ryan's family in our thoughts and \nin our prayers.\n\n\n      Army Staff Sergeant Aaron Reese and Army Sergeant Todd Bates\n\n  Mr. President, I, today, honor two men from Ohio who gave their lives \nin the defense of freedom. Army SSG Aaron Reese and Army SGT Todd Bates \nwere from two different parts of Ohio. They grew up with different life \nexperiences and different kinds of opportunities. However, when both \nbecame members of the 135th Military Police Company of the Ohio Army \nNational Guard, their lives became irrevocably linked.\n  All of our armed services, all of our Armed Forces' members, serve \nthis country with pride and with a sense of duty. Whether it is a \nmission deep in the mountains of Afghanistan or a night patrol on the \nTigris River or in the back alleys of Fallujah, the men and women in \nour military serve with a great sense of responsibility for the safety \nand security of those in their own units. They care about each other. \nOur men and women in uniform feel a unique connection to each other. \nThey see each other as brothers. They see each other as sisters. And \nthey are willing to put their own lives on the line so their comrades \nwill be safe. They do it every single day.\n  It was this dual sense of duty--to their country and to their fellow \nservice members--that put Staff Sergeant Reese and Sergeant Bates in \nharm's way on December 10, 2003. You see, their squad was on a night \npatrol boat mission on the Tigris River. At some point during the \nmission, Staff Sergeant Reese, who was the squad leader, lost his \nbalance, and he fell from the boat, plunging into the swift, murky \nwaters of the Tigris.\n  Seeing his leader fall into the river, Sergeant Bates acted \nimmediately. He quickly discarded his heavy body armor and weapon, and, \nwithout a life jacket, he dove into the river in an attempt to save \nStaff Sergeant Reese.\n  Mr. President, Members of the Senate, tragically--tragically--the \nriver was too strong for them both.\n  In William Shakespeare's play ``Henry V,'' the title character \ndelivers a stirring call to arms to rally his troops. Within this St. \nCrispin's Day speech, Henry tells his men that one day each one of them \nwould ``strip [their] sleeves and show their scars,'' proud that they \nhad fought and proud in knowing that they were a ``band of brothers''--\na ``band of brothers.''\n  Aaron and Todd can no longer strip their sleeves and show us their \nscars, and so it is up to us to do that in their honor. It is up to us \nto remember their lives--lives that they each gave for our country and \nfor their brothers.\n  Aaron Reese was from Reynoldsburg, OH. He grew up, however, in Elida, \nOH, where he attended Elida High School. Aaron worked hard at both \nacademics and athletics. His Latin teacher, Mike Herzog, said Aaron was \n``one of those you can't forget--always working hard, always smiling. \nHe didn't have a bad day. He was always in a positive mood.''\n  Aaron was a hurdler on the Elida Bulldogs track and field team and a \ndefensive back on the football team. Aaron participated in sports with \na quiet confidence. His principal, Don Diglia, cites Aaron's team-\noriented personality as his biggest leadership quality:\n\n       He was the kind of guy who was content on being on the team \n     instead of being the star of the team. He was a team player \n     all around. . . .\n\n  After graduating from Elida in the year 1990, Aaron decided to put \nhis leadership qualities and physical prowess to the test. So he \nenlisted in the U.S. Army. He served 7 years. While on active duty in \nCentral America, he met the love of his life. He married the love of \nhis life, Emilia, and then they became the proud parents of a son, \nAnthony, and a daughter, Nicole.\n  Wanting to spend more time with his new family, Aaron joined the Ohio \nArmy National Guard. While serving in the Guard, Aaron also attended \nthe Ohio State University and Columbus State. He planned to join the \nCincinnati Police Department when he returned from Iraq.\n  Aaron had been serving in the Guard for nearly 6 years when his unit \nwas called up for Operation Iraqi Freedom. It was hard for Aaron to \nleave his wife and his son and his new baby, Nicole, who had been born \nonly a few months before he was deployed.\n  SGT Sheri Brown remembers seeing Aaron saying goodbye to his family \nin February of 2003 and describes it this way:\n\n       His toddler son was playing in the snow. Aaron wept as he \n     cradled his baby and tried to say a few last words to his \n     wife.\n\n  Aaron Reese cared for his family, but he also felt a strong \nobligation to his country and to his unit. It was an obligation that \nwas not foreign to the Reese family. Aaron's grandfather, Paul Shafer, \nserved in World War II. His uncle, James Shafer, was killed in Vietnam \nin 1967. Aaron also had two other uncles who served in the Armed \nForces. As Aaron's father, Ed Reese, said:\n\n       What you will see in our family is the red, white, and \n     blue.\n\n  Indeed, Aaron's military heritage, experience, and leadership ability \ngave him confidence in his mission. The 135th Military Police Company \nwas responsible for the safety of their fellow soldiers, for the \ntraining of Iraqi police, and for various support missions.\n  Aaron Reese proudly led his unit in their tasks. Mr. President, 1LT \nWilliam F. Lee had this to say of Aaron's service in Iraq:\n\n       I had the privilege of leading this outstanding \n     noncommissioned officer in Operation Iraqi Freedom. I have \n     known Aaron for many years. We have served many deployments \n     together--some good and some not so good. Aaron executed his \n     duties with exceptional performance and was one of my best \n     leaders.\n\n  First Lieutenant Lee's comments are a ringing endorsement of Aaron's \nconsummate professionalism and dedication. He was a model soldier, \nsomeone whom others not only looked up to but also tried to emulate.\n  SGT Timothy Haskamp had this to say:\n\n       I had the great opportunity to serve with Aaron. Over the \n     months in Iraq, he taught me how to be a good NCO. He wasn't \n     just a fellow soldier and my squad leader, he was a friend \n     and someone who would do anything he could for you. I can \n     only imagine what a good father and husband he must have \n     been. As I continue my service, I will remember everything he \n     taught me and teach those things to all who serve under me in \n     the future.\n\n  For those who served with Aaron, he was an anchor of strength, an \nexperienced leader, who made it his personal mission to keep his men \nand women safe. April Engstrom, Aaron's sister, said that her brother \nloved the soldiers in his squad and wanted to protect them. Todd Bates' \nactions on that night in December, however, really speak to the love \nAaron's squad also had for him.\n  Aaron Reese leaves behind a wife, two small children, and a loving \nfamily. But he also leaves a legacy of leadership. He made a sacrifice \nso that his children and our children can live in a safer world. And \nfor that a grateful Nation honors and remembers him.\n  Army SGT Todd Bates was 20 years old when he dove into that dangerous \nTigris River to try to save his squad leader, Aaron Reese. Todd Bates \nspent his all-too-short life growing up in Bellaire, OH, where he was \nraised by his grandmother, Shirley Bates. Todd was a fun-loving kid, \nwho was loved dearly by his friends and family. One of his lifelong \nfriends, Richard Kendle, remembers growing up in Bellaire with Todd. \nThis is what he had to say:\n\n       I knew Todd all my life. We went to school together from \n     kindergarten on up through graduation. I remember the many \n     days that I used to go over to his house and play video \n     games. Or, we'd go out in his backyard and shoot his BB gun. \n     I remember the meals that his grandmother prepared for us \n     after a day of play. Todd and I never had much growing up . . \n     . but we never knew it. We had families that loved us and a \n     friendship that would never die.\n\n  Family and friends are important in Bellaire, OH. For many young men \nand women who grow up there, the two most promising paths to success \nare sports and the military. Todd Bates realized this and applied his \ntireless work ethic to both endeavors. At Bellaire High School, Todd \nexcelled on the ``Big Reds'' football team. But he did not do so \nthrough just raw talent. Rather, Todd worked his way into the starting \nlineup. He worked his way there.\n  More often than not, if you wanted to find Todd, all you had to do \nwas look in the football weight room. His coach, John Magistro, thought \nTodd was humble, genuine, caring, and unselfish. And I quote him:\n\n\n[[Page S7893]]\n\n\n       He was a good player and he worked really hard.\n\n  Todd's work ethic and attitude were recognized by his teammates on \nthe 2000 ``Big Reds'' team. They voted him one of their cocaptains. And \nunder Todd's leadership, Bellaire reached the State playoffs that year.\n  Todd was recognized in Bellaire for being a leader of the football \nteam, for being a quiet and respectful young man, and for his beloved \ncar--called the ``Bates-mobile,'' by most people. His football coach \nremembers Todd, often in the school parking lot long after practice had \nended, under his car's hood, trying to get it started. Reverend Donald \nCordery also remembered the ``Bates-mobile.'' Reverend Cordery was an \nassistant football coach and a mentor to Todd. One day after practice, \nhe asked Todd for a ride home:\n  I said, ``Bates, what's the chance I could get a ride in your car?'' \nHe said, ``Pastor Don, do you really want to take a ride in my car?'' I \nsaid, ``Bates, with my looks and your car, the ladies will be out!''\n  Todd was respected by his peers, his teachers, and his community, but \nhe wanted more. He wanted to go to college. He knew, though, that he \nwasn't going to be able to secure a football scholarship. Financially, \nthat left Todd with very few options. So, after graduating from \nBellaire High School in 2001, Todd decided to join the Ohio Army \nNational Guard to make money for college.\n  But, like many things in Todd's life, it wasn't easy. He had played \nas a lineman in high school and he had the body of a lineman. Todd was \n6 feet tall and 250 pounds--not quite the ideal weight for a National \nGuardsman. Todd needed to lose some weight if he hoped to get into the \nGuard. To qualify, Todd loaded a backpack with 50 pounds of weight and \nwalked eight miles a day. He repeated this workout until he had lost \nfifty pounds. Todd was, indeed, a remarkable young man.\n  As with his dedication to losing weight and to football, Todd brought \nthe same focus and work ethic to his career in the Army. His drill \nsergeant, Jason Patrick, from Ft. Leonard Wood said this about Todd:\n\n       Todd was a remarkable soldier and person--always striving \n     to be the very best and fully committing to every task at \n     hand. I watched this fine young American grow from civilian \n     to soldier. I watched as he endured everything I could throw \n     at him. I am proud to have trained him and extremely proud of \n     all he accomplished.\n\n  After being deployed to Iraq in February of 2003, Todd continued to \nout-perform the expectations of his commanders. Brigadier General \nRonald Young said of Todd, ``[He] was an exceptional soldier . . .  He \nserved his assignments with great distinction, and his commanders have \nrecognized his dedication to duty and personal leadership on several \noccasions.''\n  Todd had a passion for what he was doing in the Guard and as with his \nother passions in life, he was the standard for hard work and \nexcellence. While he was certainly a very focused young man, Todd also \nhad a terrific sense of humor and never took anything too seriously.\n  The other members of his unit remember Todd as a funny guy who was \nalways trying to make tough, stressful situations a little easier with \na joke. At the same time, Todd was always looking out for the other \nmembers of his unit. He felt connected to them--like they were all a \nbig, extended family, who believed in the National Guard motto: ``Of \nthe troops, for the troops.''\n  When Todd Bates jumped into the Tigris River on that cold, December \nnight, he was not thinking of himself. He was only thinking of his \nsquad leader--his friend, his ``brother,'' Aaron Reese.\n  Both Aaron Reese and Todd Bates gave their lives not thinking of \nthemselves, but only thinking of us. They put our lives, Iraqi lives, \nand the lives of their fellow service men and women before their own. \nWe will never forget their sacrifices.\n  My wife, Fran, and I continue to keep the families of Aaron Reese and \nTodd Bates in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/01/senate-section/article/S7893-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7893-S7894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CHILD SURVIVAL AND MATERNAL HEALTH\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, the Senate Appropriations Committee this \nweek took an important step. That step was in providing $275 million to \nthe Child Survival and Maternity Health Programs. I congratulate the \nfull committee for this work. I also congratulate the subcommittee, \nchaired by Senator McConnell, and Ranking Member Leahy, for the bill \nthey reported which contained this money. I want to use this occasion \nand the passage of this bill--in the future, it will be coming to the \nSenate floor with this language--to share some important statistics \nabout child and maternal mortality.\n  It is so very important that we understand what this money can do. I \nam often hesitant to recite statistics on the floor of the Senate \nbecause when you hear them repeatedly, it is all too easy to become \nnumb to statistics, to forget the human realities that they do, in \nfact, represent.\n  It is important for all of us and for the American people to listen \nto some of these statistics because they are so unbelievable and so \ntragic and because they do represent human lives. These are lives that \ncan be saved, lives that can be saved by making resources available to \ndeveloping countries and people who are in such great need. Let me \nrecite some of these statistics.\n  Today, over 10 million children under the age of 5 die each year from \npreventable and treatable diseases and ailments. These include \ndiarrhea, pneumonia, measles, and, yes, malnutrition. It is an \nunbelievable figure. Of those 10 million deaths worldwide, 3.9 million \noccur in the first 28 days of life. These babies don't even have a shot \nat getting as old as 2 or 3 or 4 or 5. Yet two-thirds of these deaths \ncould be prevented if available and affordable intervention had reached \nthe children and their mothers who need them. Malnutrition contributes \nto 54 percent of all childhood deaths. As many as 3 million children \ndie annually as a result of vitamin A deficiency. An estimated 400,000 \ncases of childhood blindness are reported each year, children who are \ncondemned to going about their lives blind. These are preventable. Of \nthe 130 million babies born each year, about 4 million die in the first \n4 weeks of life. In poor communities many babies who die are unnamed, \nunrecorded, indicating the perceived inevitability of their deaths. \nFour hundred fifty newborn children die every hour, mainly from \npreventable causes.\n  According to World Health Organization estimates, over 4.4 million \nchildren died from vaccine-preventable diseases in 2001, diseases such \nas hepatitis, polio, and tetanus. Of all the vaccine-preventable \ndiseases, measles remain the leading childhood killer, claiming the \nlives of 745,000 children, more than half of them in Africa.\n  Such staggering numbers of children dying from preventable diseases \nis unacceptable. It is up to us--the Congress, the Senate, people in \nthe developed world, the United States, around the world--to change \nthis tragic human reality. We have an obligation to make this change \nbecause we have the know-how, we have the resources to prevent these \ndeaths.\n  The Lancet, a British medical journal which ran a series of articles \nlast year about child survival, just published a new study indicating \nthat the lives of an estimated 6 million children could be saved for as \nlittle as $1.23 per child. Yes, for as little as $1.23 per child in the \n42 countries with the highest rates of child mortality, 23 lifesaving \ninterventions could be made universally available. These interventions, \nmany of them as basic as vitamin A or zinc supplements, are critical to \npreventing the deaths of millions of children.\n  The full Appropriations Committee has agreed to provide this $275 \nmillion for child survival in the Foreign Operations bill. This is very \nsignificant. It is an important step in our efforts to improve the \nhealth of children around the world. This funding will save lives. I \nurge my colleagues to support this funding level when the bill comes to \nthe floor. I urge my colleagues, when the bill then goes to conference \ncommittee, to keep this funding in that bill as well.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7894]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/01/senate-section/article/S7894-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RETIREMENT OF JUSTICE SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today we have learned that one of our \nNation's finest jurists will step down from our highest court. Despite \nher departure from the Supreme Court, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor will \nleave a lasting mark on American jurisprudence characterized by \nfairness, balance, and integrity.\n  Justice O'Connor's career and service to our Nation have been truly \nremarkable. This country will miss her presence on the Supreme Court \ndearly.\n  Some have said that no other individual in our Nation's history has \ncome to the Supreme Court under greater expectations. Not only did \nJustice O'Connor meet these expectations, she far exceeded them. When \nPresident Reagan nominated and the Senate unanimously confirmed Justice \nO'Connnor in 1981, she became the first woman to sit on the Supreme \nCourt and, over time, she grew to be one of the crucial swing votes on \nthe court--her decisions driven both by her conservative sensibilities \nand also by her practical nature.\n  Justice O'Connor grew up on the Lazy-B Cattle Ranch in southeastern \nArizona. She learned to drive at age 7 and could fire rifles and ride \nhorses by the time she turned 8. Perhaps it was her Arizona roots that \nfueled both her pragmatism and her desire to succeed.\n  Mr. President, after high school, Justice O'Connor attended Stanford \nUniversity where she majored in economics and graduated with high \nhonors. A legal dispute over her family's ranch, however, inspired her \ninterest in law and her decision to enroll at Stanford Law School. \nJustice O'Connor completed law school in only two years, but she still \nmanaged to serve on the Stanford Law Review and receive highest honors. \nO'Connor graduated third out of a class of 102. First in the class was \nfellow Arizonan William H. Rehnquist. I suggest that maybe we should \nturn to Arizona once again for a Supreme Court nominee, considering the \ntrack records of Justices O'Connor and Rehnquist.\n  In law school, Justice O'Connor also met her future husband, John Jay \nO'Connor, a fine man and husband.\n  Mr. President, Justice O'Connor faced a difficult job market after \nleaving Stanford. No law firm in California wanted to hire her and only \none offered her a position as a legal secretary. Later, in Arizona, she \nagain found it difficult to obtain a position with any law firm, so she \nstarted her own firm. It is truly remarkable to realize just how far \nJustice O'Connor has risen during her life despite the adversity she \nhas faced.\n  After she gave birth to her second son, Justice O'Connor withdrew \nfrom her professional life to care for her children. Nevertheless, she \nbecame involved in many volunteer activities during this time. She also \nbegan an involvement with the Arizona Republican Party. After five \nyears as a full-time mother, Justice O'Connor returned to work as an \nassistant State Attorney General in Arizona. Arizona Governor Jack \nWilliams later appointed her to occupy a vacant seat in the Arizona \nSenate. O'Connor successfully defended her Senate position for two more \nterms and eventually became the majority leader. By rising to the \nposition of majority leader, Justice O'Connor achieved another first \nfor American women.\n\n  In 1974, Justice O'Connor ran and won a judgeship on the Maricopa \nCounty Superior Court, which resulted in her service in all three \nbranches of Arizona government. A year later, she was nominated to \nserve on to the Arizona Court of Appeals. Almost two years after that, \nPresident Reagan nominated her to the Supreme Court to replace the \nretiring Justice Potter Stewart. The Senate rightly confirmed \nO'Connor's nomination unanimously and the Court soon abandoned its use \nof ``Mr. Justice'' as the form of address. Justice O'Connor herself \ndescribed the significance of her nomination in the following way. She \nsaid, ``A woman had never held a position at that level of our \ngovernment. And it was a signal that it was all right that women could \nbe in such positions. That they could do well in such positions.''\n  Mr. President, Justice O'Connor brought to her position on the \nSupreme Court her remarkable life history characterized by \nindependence, perseverance, and achievement. Early in her tenure on the \nCourt, observers identified her as part of the Court's conservative \nfaction. The public often associated her with Justice Rehnquist because \nof their shared roots and values. Over time, though, Justice O'Connor \ncombined her conservative sensibilities with a desire to find pragmatic \nsolutions based on sound legal interpretation. She approached each case \nthoughtfully.\n  It will be difficult to fill the void that Justice O'Connor's \nresignation has created, nor can anyone assume a similar place in \nAmerican history. There can be only one first, and Sandra Day O'Connor \nwas it.\n  Mr. President, very rarely do I presume to speak on behalf of all of \nthe citizens of my State of Arizona. But I know, with confidence, that \nI do so now when from the bottom of our hearts we thank Justice \nO'Connor for her magnificent service to her State and to her Nation. \nShe and her magnificent husband John will be in our thoughts and \nprayers as they enter the struggle ahead. We are confident that with \nher traditional courage, she will face this new challenge and emerge \nvictorious. We thank her for her service. We thank her for her family. \nWe are, most of all, confident that Americans and Arizonans will \nremember her with great pride.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/01/senate-section/article/S7894-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7894-S7895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BEST WISHES TO JUSTICE O'CONNOR\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join my friend and colleague, the \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, in extending my best wishes to \nJustice O'Connor and thank her for her long and dedicated service to \nthe Nation. She was a cheerful and thoughtful and highly respected \nmember of the Court, a wise judge who served the Nation and the \nConstitution well.\n  Justice O'Connor was a mainstream conservative and was confirmed \nunanimously by the Senate. I hope the President will select someone who \nmeets the high standards that she set and can bring the Nation \ntogether, as she did.\n  Our Senate debates in recent weeks have included extensive \ndiscussions on the need for consultation by the President with the \nSenate on potential Supreme Court nominations. But such consultation \nwas not mentioned by the majority leader in his address on judges \nearlier this week, and the omission is glaring, since consultation is \nthe heart of the ``advice'' requirement in the constitutional \nrequirement that the President appoint judges with the ``advice and \nconsent'' of the Senate.\n  Under the Constitution and the Senate rules, every Senator's hands \nare on the oars of this vessel. If a substantial number of us are \nrowing in the opposite direction from the majority leader, we will not \nmake much progress. But if there is a consensus as to where we want to \ngo, we can get there directly and quickly.\n  The 14 Senators who reached the landmark bipartisan compromise in the \nnuclear option debate made a pledge to one another and a plea to the \nPresident that the advice function must not be given short shrift, and \nthat serious consultation with the Senate in the nomination process is \nthe key to a successful confirmation process.\n  Separate and independent assessments of nominations by each Senator \nare precisely what the Framers wanted us to do. They wanted Senators to \nbe a check on the Executive's proposed judicial selections as a safety \nnet for the Nation if the President overreaches by making excessively \npartisan or ideological nominations.\n  Mr. President, all one has to do is read the debates of the \nConstitutional Convention. Our Founding Fathers considered where to \nlocate the authority and the power for the naming of the judges on four \ndifferent occasions. On three occasions, they gave it unanimously to \nthe Senate--to nominate and to approve. And only in the last 8 days of \nthe Constitutional Convention did they change that to make it a balance \nbetween the Executive and the Senate of the United States.\n\n[[Page S7895]]\n\n  No fair reading of the debates at the Constitutional Convention or \nthe Federalist Papers does not recognize that this is a shared \nresponsibility. The best way we carried that shared responsibility was \nif there is a recognition by the Executive that he or she--if at a time \nin the future we elect a woman--has the prime responsibility to \nnominate; but the final aspect of consenting is in the Senate.\n  The process works best when there is consultation. It works best \nwhen, as we have seen when the leader of the conservative movement in \nthis country, Ronald Reagan, took the opportunity to select Sandra Day \nO'Connor, who received a unanimous vote in the Senate, a true \nconservative. But President Reagan was setting the path for that time, \nand for future times, about how to proceed.\n  That is the opportunity this President has at the present time. We \nhope he will be inspired by what President Reagan did in terms of the \nnominating process.\n  Just this past week, several of the members of the group of 14 spoke \non the floor of the Senate. Just last week, Senator Pryor gave a \ncompelling explanation of the agreement. He said that he was puzzled \nbecause people are ignoring a section of the agreement that is as \nimportant as any other section, the part dealing with advice and \nconsent. He spoke of the past days ``of bipartisan cooperation between \nthe executive and legislative branches of Government.'' He pointed out \nthat he was a signatory to a unanimously supported letter from the \nSenate minority to the President calling for consensus and cooperation \nand calling for bipartisan consultation--the best path to a fair and \nreasoned confirmation process.\n  He did not demand that the President sit down with the 14 or pretend \nthat they will supplant the Senate Judiciary Committee and its leaders. \nBut he did urge the President to seek the counsel of Senators from both \nparties as he makes future nominations. ``Their insight,'' Senator \nPryor said, ``could help the President steer a smoother course when it \ncomes to judicial nominations. . . . Just as the 14 Senators did their \npart to smooth the way for future judicial nominations, the White House \n[can] do their part by reaching out to the coequal branch of \nGovernment.''\n  How can anyone argue with that wise prescription? How can anyone \nignore it, since it comes from one of those who helped bring the Senate \nback from the brink of disaster? A President would have to be \nextraordinarily imprudent not to give it great weight.\n  Another of the signers on the agreement, Senator Salazar, wrote to \nthe President last week with a clear message:\n\n       A wide ranging and good faith consultation between the \n     executive and the Senate, as contemplated by the Founding \n     Fathers, is the best way to smooth the path to rapid Senate \n     consideration for all judicial nominations but will be \n     especially important if a vacancy arises on our Supreme \n     Court.\n\n  Another of the 14 signers, Senator Nelson of Nebraska, mentioned his \nown experience in selecting judges. In his letter to the President, he \npointed out that even though as Governor he was not required to obtain \nthe advice and consent of his legislature, nevertheless he consulted a \ngreat deal with them and found it ``a very worthwhile and successful \nprocess.''\n  He encouraged President Bush to reach out to both sides of the aisle \n``so we can move forward on future nominees in a positive and less \ncontentious manner.'' Without this consultation, he said, there could \nbe difficulties, especially regarding future Supreme Court nominations, \nthat might provide the basis for blocking an up-or-down vote which \notherwise might not exist.\n  Even the President has said--once--that he would consult with \nSenators on judicial nominations, and I urge him to do so. But as yet, \nthere has been no meaningful consultation with the Senate. As the \nminority leader has made clear, off-the-cuff casual discussions about \nhow nice it would be if a Senator were the choice is not meaningful \nconsultation. To be meaningful, consultation should include information \nabout who the President is really considering so we can give responsive \nand useful advice.\n  White House officials made time to meet last week with prominent \noutside allies on the right who are so sure the President will nominate \na nonconsensus candidate that they have put an $18 million war chest in \nplace to defend their nominee. Their advice to the President was clear: \nThey would consent to and support any rightwing judge he selects for \nthe High Court. No wonder he likes to get their advice and consent.\n  The American people deserve a Senate that will be more than a \nrubberstamp for a Supreme Court nominee. A Senate that walks in \nlockstep with the White House is not doing its constitutional job. It \nis not doing the job the American people sent us here to do: to protect \ntheir rights and freedoms.\n  If the President abuses his power and nominates someone who threatens \nto roll back the rights and freedoms of the American people, then the \nAmerican people will insist that we oppose that nominee, and we intend \nto do so.\n  Mr. President, I hope President Bush will follow Ronald Reagan's \nexample and ignore the advice and arguments of those who prefer an \nideological activist. He knew that the best thing for the country would \nbe someone who we could all unite behind, and he chose such a person: \nSandra Day O'Connor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the retirement \nof Justice Sandra Day O'Connor from the U.S. Supreme Court. First, I \nwish to applaud her public service that has been part of her entire \nlife. She is a fantastic role model; she is a role model to two of my \nolder of five children. My two older daughters have seen her as someone \nwho moved into an area that had not been occupied by a woman before--\nthe Supreme Court of the United States. One of my daughters got to meet \nwith her at one time. It was quite an event in her life, being able to \nsee a woman on the U.S. Supreme Court at a young age. And that has been \nreplicated, of course, with Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Women have broken \nthrough. That will continue to be the case, and will continue to be an \ninspiration to people throughout the world in general, and my family in \nparticular.\n  Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was raised in southeastern Arizona on her \nfamily's ranch. Her humble beginnings contributed to her appreciation \nfor common sense and limited government, which she carried forward on \nthe Court. She received her undergraduate degree from Stanford \nUniversity; one of the great schools of our country. At Stanford, she \nsuccessfully pursued a degree in economics and graduated third in her \nclass at Stanford Law School. It was during law school that she met her \nhusband John.\n  As a young female attorney, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor faced great \nadversity in finding employment. It does not seem possible that someone \ngraduating third in their class from Stanford Law School would face \nthis problem. But those were different times, and she was a woman and \nwas looking for employment in the private sector.\n  She persevered, accepted a position as deputy county attorney for San \nMateo County in California, where she served with distinction.\n  In 1958, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor began a small private practice \nin her native Arizona.\n  In 1965, after returning to work following a brief hiatus to care for \nher children, Justice O'Connor accepted a position as an assistant \nattorney general for the State of Arizona.\n  In 1968, she was appointed to the Arizona State Senate by the \nGovernor to fill a vacancy. During O'Connor's tenure in the State \nSenate, she demonstrated wisdom and excellence to become the majority \nleader.\n  O'Connor was elected judge of Maricopa County Superior court in 1975 \nand served until 1979 when she was appointed to the Arizona Court of \nAppeals.\n  In 1981, President Ronald Reagan fulfilled his promise to nominate \nthe first\n\n[[Page S7896]]\n\nwoman to the Nation's top Court. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was \nconfirmed unanimously by the Senate.\n  It is hard to think of a Supreme Court nominee getting a unanimous \nconfirmation in this body today, but it happened in 1981.\n  Justice O'Connor's life is a testament to perseverance, integrity, \nand appreciation of constitutional government. She served as a role \nmodel to a generation of women in the legal profession. I commend her \nfor her 24 years of dedicated service to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  In her letter to the President announcing her retirement, I was \nimpressed by Justice O'Connor's reference to the ``integrity of the \nCourt and its role under our constitutional structure.'' I think it is \nimportant to remember that in our system of government, the courts have \nbut limited jurisdiction: they should neither write nor execute the \nlaws, but simply ``say what the law is,'' in the famous phrase of \nformer Chief Justice Marshall. As Alexander Hamilton explained, this \nlimitation on judicial power is what would make the Federal judiciary \nthe ``least dangerous branch.'' They were not meant to resolve divisive \nsocial issues, short-circuit the political process, or invent rights \nwhich had no basis in the text of the Constitution.\n  Unfortunately, the courts in recent years have not kept themselves \nwithin the circumscribed role envisioned by the Framers. Hamilton \nhimself likely would be shocked at the broad sweep of the exercise of \njudicial power in America: Federal courts today are redefining the \nmeaning of marriage, removing the role of faith in the public square, \nrunning prisons and schools by decree, enhancing Federal power at the \nexpense of the States and, just last week, radically expanding the \npower of government to take private property from one individual and \nhand it over to another in the name of public use; by 5-to-4 \ndecisions--5 for, 4 against. The expanded role assumed by the Federal \ncourts generally in recent years makes it all the more important that \nthe upcoming nominee exhibit the proper respect for the restrained role \nof the Federal courts in American Government, staying within the text \nof the Constitution.\n  Given the President's repeated statements during his campaign that he \nwould pick Justices who would faithfully interpret the text of the \nConstitution and the resonance his position had with the American \npeople, I am confident that he will nominate a well-qualified \nindividual who will refrain from making law from the bench.\n  I will conclude by simply saying, in the confirmation process, I hope \nthis body can take a position where we hold fair hearings, where the \nnominee is not maligned by outside groups seeking to cast aspersions \nthat are clearly not there, or trying to paint an individual where the \nfactual setting is not there; that it will be a process of 51 votes and \nnot 60 votes, that there will not be a filibuster for this Supreme \nCourt nominee position. It should not be an extraordinary circumstance. \nThe position is to be filled by a majority vote of this body, not by a \nsupermajority vote of this body.\n  I hope we could move forward with a confirmation process through the \nJudiciary Committee, on which I and the Presiding Officer serve on, in \na timely and reasonable fashion; that we could bring the nomination in \nfront of this body, have a robust debate on it, and then vote. The \nperson either goes on the Supreme Court or they do not go on the \nSupreme Court--by 51 votes. That is what it should be. I think that is \nclearly the case of what was anticipated by the Framers in the overall \nprocess.\n  I see my colleague from Texas is here, who is to speak on the floor. \nI do want to end by again commending Sandra Day O'Connor's lifetime of \nservice, the inspirational role that she has played for many people in \nthis country--to people in my family. I thank her and say Godspeed to \nher and her family, and I am sure she will continue to serve this \nNation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to talk on two issues. \nFirst, I think everyone is talking about Sandra Day O'Connor and the \ngreat contribution she has made to our country. I am pleased to say she \nis a friend of mine. I have gotten to know her because we have many of \nthe same parts of our background. Sandra Day O'Connor was born in El \nPaso, TX, and she actually graduated from high school in El Paso, TX. \nShe grew up on a ranch in Arizona, and it was, of course, a remote \nplace, so her parents sent her to high school in Texas to try to make \nsure she received a first-rate education.\n  I think we see from her record in college and law school that she \ndid, indeed, receive fine preparation. She was one of the brightest \nstudents to come out of Stanford Law School, graduating right at the \ntop of her class along with her classmate, William Rehnquist.\n  Sandra Day O'Connor is a person who has overcome obstacles, and she \nhas done it in the most graceful way, in a way that is a role model for \ngirls in our country, for women in our country, because she has always \nkept a positive attitude. When she couldn't get a job out of Stanford \nLaw School, graduating right at the top of her class, she cajoled an \noffer from the county attorney in the county where Stanford was \nlocated, and was able to win that first job. Then, of course, she \nexcelled from that time forward.\n  She has excelled in everything she has done. She became the leader of \nher party in the State Senate in Arizona. She was plucked from the \nState court of appeals to become a member of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  When you think about it, to be thrust into this national limelight as \nthe first woman to become a Supreme Court Justice in our country, in \n1981, this was a glaring spotlight for a young woman from Arizona who \nwas on the court of appeals at the State level. Yet President Reagan \nsaw something in her that was quite special. He saw that she had the \nleadership abilities and the basic grounding and the intellect to take \nthis job. He really took somewhat of a chance because she wasn't the \nwell-known commodity that Supreme Court Justices usually are. But he \nknew the time was right to appoint a woman to the U.S. Supreme Court \nand he found the woman who was the right one for the job. She earned \nher place in history.\n\n  As she announces today that she is taking her retirement, I think all \nof us who know her and have admired her for so many years do want to \nwish her well. We believe she deserves this wonderful opportunity to \nhave some time for herself.\n  Sandra Day O'Connor also was named to the National Cowgirl Hall of \nFame. That is another connection that we have. This is a wonderful \nmuseum in Fort Worth, TX, that honors the cowgirls of our country who \nhave made a difference, the cowgirls who have shown that ranching life \nand that independent spirit can be the basis for success that is really \nunmatched. Sandra Day O'Connor is in the Cowgirl Hall of Fame and she \nis a real cowgirl. She did grow up on a ranch. She talks about her \nchildhood where they didn't even have running water in her home. \nGrowing up like that made her hardy and able to overcome obstacles.\n  She has made quite an impression on the Court as well. Sandra Day \nO'Connor has been one of those people on the Court who is a strict \nconstructionist and who is an intellectual who is sometimes considered \na swing vote, but you always know that her conservative philosophy is \none that is very careful not to make laws from the bench but allows \nlawmakers to make the laws of our country.\n  I think her opinion as the dissenting opinion in the most recent case \non eminent domain shows that basic conservative philosophical \nunderpinning, saying it would be outrageous to expand public purpose in \neminent domain to include private projects, even if they are private \nprojects that are going to enhance the tax base of the city. That is \nnot what the Constitution intended in its preservation of private \nproperty rights.\n  I think Sandra Day O'Connor has made an impact on the Court and an \nimpact on our country.\n  I want to end my talk about Sandra Day O'Connor reading from an \ninterview I did with her when I was interviewing for my book ``American \nHeroines,'' interviewing the women of today who are breaking barriers, \nthe women of today who are the first at something that is important. \nSandra Day O'Connor, of course, the first woman on our United States \nSupreme Court, was one of those I interviewed.\n\n[[Page S7897]]\n\n  I asked her what was her most important trait for success. And she \nsaid something I think is especially important to note today, on the \nday she announces her retirement. She said:\n\n       I am blessed with having a lot of energy. I think I \n     inherited it from my mother. But to be a working mother \n     requires an enormous amount of energy to do your job and to \n     manage to take care of your family and to go nonstop all the \n     time with never any personal downtime. I can't remember a \n     time in my life when I had time for myself.\n\n  I think on the day that she is announcing her retirement, to have \nthat time for herself, makes us understand that this is a woman who \ndeserves, finally, to have her time for her family.\n  She said:\n\n       Another attribute that perhaps has been helpful is a \n     curiosity about things, how things work. I think a love of \n     learning and finding out about things is useful. And, third, \n     probably, is liking people. Enjoying talking to them, whoever \n     they are with whatever lifestyle or standard of living. I \n     have always enjoyed talking to people. I think I got that, \n     maybe, from my grandmother, in Texas.\n\n  So that is just one excerpt from an interview with an extraordinary \nwoman, a woman who made her mark in the history of the United States \nand who will always be remembered, as we wish her well in her \nretirement, as one of the leaders of our time, the leaders of the last \ncentury who, indeed, did break an important barrier.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/01/senate-section/article/S7897-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          VETERANS HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to talk about the Veterans' \nAdministration issue that we dealt with this week in the Senate. I want \nto bring us up to date, where we are, to try to fix some of the \nproblems that Secretary Jim Nicholson has brought to our attention. We \nwere hoping that the Veterans' Administration would not have financial \ndifficulties this year. But I have to say that Jim Nicholson stepped \nright up to the plate when he saw that, in fact, we would have a \nshortfall this year, and we would need to borrow from capital funds and \nmaintenance funds in order to make ends meet by the end of this fiscal \nyear, September 30. He came straight to Congress. He didn't try to hide \nit. He didn't go and try to Band-Aid the Veterans' Administration. He \ncame absolutely public, to the Congress, and said: We have a problem. \nEven though he did not anticipate it, even as late as a month ago.\n  But, in fact, models that have been used for 20 years in the \nVeterans' Administration have had to change because we do have veterans \nnow coming out of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. There are more \ninjuries and fewer deaths in this kind of conflict, and I think we are \nproud there are fewer deaths and we are proud these soldiers who are \ninjured are going to be taken care of.\n  The Senate voted unanimously this week to amend the appropriations \nbill that was on the floor with an emergency supplemental of $1.5 \nbillion. This was the initial estimate Secretary Nicholson gave to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs about what they would need to get \nthrough the 2005 fiscal year and take them into 2006 with their \npreliminary estimates.\n\n  Last night, the House of Representatives passed a bill for $975 \nbillion as an emergency supplemental, just taking care of the year \n2005. That now is resting in the Senate.\n  I have talked to Secretary Nicholson today. I talked to Josh Bolton \nat the Office of Management and Budget today. I have asked them to come \nback to the Senate the week of July 11, and tell what they project \ntheir needs to be for 2006. As chairman of the Veterans Affairs \nAppropriations Committee, along with my colleague Senator Feinstein, \nwho is the ranking member, we want to have all of the information \nbefore we mark up our 2006 budget for the Veterans' Administration \nwhich will occur July 21. I asked Secretary Nicholson and the Office of \nManagement and Budget director to determine what is going to be needed \nin 2006, and if they can give us that number and assure the money will \nbe transferred into the budget for 2006, then the Senate would pass the \nHouse bill and send it to the President so that 2005 would be taken \ncare of. We did not want to pass that bill until we know the 2006 \nnumber is finite so we can assure we will take care of the 2006 deficit \nin projections. We must try to do this in July to get our \nappropriations bills going.\n  We are going to come back July 11 or 12. Hopefully, we will have \nnumbers next week that will allow us either to pass the House bill that \nwill take care of 2005, knowing exactly what we will need to take care \nof 2006, or send the $1.5 billion that has already passed the Senate \nover to the House to take care of 2005 and take us into 2006 with a \ncushion if the Veterans' Administration says they cannot make good \nestimates for the rest of 2006 at this time. That is where we stand.\n  Here is the point I make: The Veterans' Administration, the President \nof the United States, the Office of Management and Budget Director--the \nOffice of Management and Budget being responsible for being the steward \nof the President's budget--the Democrats on the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, the Republicans on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, all \nworking together along with the House of Representatives, are going to \ndo what is right for veterans. We will not make this a partisan issue. \nWe will not make it some test between any function of Government. We \nare going to do what is right for the veterans who have served our \ncountry, who are protecting freedom for our children. The money will be \nthere. There will not be one iota of service not given to a veteran \ntoday or next week or next year. That is our commitment to them. It is \npart of the war on terrorism.\n  Democrats and Republicans are going to work together. The President \nis going to assure we do. The Veterans' Administration and the Office \nof Management and Budget are going to do the right thing. And Secretary \nNicholson has already done the right thing by coming forward in a \npublic way, being criticized by some for having made these mistakes, \nbut saying, I am not going to let this pass for one more day. We are \ngoing to do the right thing.\n  Everyone is working together. We will do the right thing by the \nveterans. We will have a supplemental appropriation. We will get a bill \nto the President in very short order to make sure not one stone is left \nunturned to give our veterans the best care possible for the great \nservice they have performed for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise briefly to say thank you, \ncongratulations, and best wishes to an outstanding person, a truly \nremarkable jurist. That is, of course, Sandra Day O'Connor, who \nannounced her retirement today.\n  A lot of people can say many good things about her service on the \nCourt, her interpretation of the Constitution. We have heard many \ndiscussions about the wise judgment she has made.\n  I reflect a little bit as a personal acquaintance. Going back over 30 \nyears when I visited my parents in Arizona, I had the opportunity to \nget to know John and Sandra Day O'Connor. We played a lot of tennis \ntogether. Incidentally, they are both very good tennis players. John \nhas a great, somewhat wacky sense of humor. Sandra Day O'Connor is a \ntruly wonderful, remarkable, warm human being.\n  She wouldn't tell the stories publicly, but there are a number of \nstories her friends know about the extra measure of kindness she showed \nto people in need, people who are very ill, people who were suffering. \nShe went out of her way quietly and demonstrated a human kindness and \ncompassion that was significant.\n  As has already been outlined, she had a great record, great \neducational record, a record of great service. When I met her, she was \nmajority leader of the Arizona State Senate. I was Governor of \nMissouri. We were recruiting people to run for Governor of Arizona. I \nthought Sandra Day O'Connor would make a great Governor of Arizona. I \nmade it my cause to recruit her on behalf of the Republican Governors \nAssociation to run for Governor. Then one day she told me, I have \ndecided I am going to take a seat on the bench. I am going to become a \njudge. In one of those famous comments that lives with you forever, I \nsaid: Sandra Day O'Connor, it is a dead-end job being a judge in \nPhoenix, AZ.\n  I was dead flat wrong. When I welcomed her to Missouri to address the\n\n[[Page S7898]]\n\nbar association as Madam Justice of the Supreme Court, needless to say \nshe took great delight in relating that wonderful advice I had given \nher to run for the Governor of Arizona. We have been very pleased to \nhave her back several times, and as far as I can tell she has never \nfailed to mention that story.\n  I mention that story only to say she was right, once again, and she \nhas contributed honorably and significantly to the judicial service of \nthis Nation.\n  I can only say on behalf of those who were her constituents, as \nAmericans, and those who know her as a friend, we wish you the very \nbest. We go forward with our deep gratitude for all you have \ncontributed and our very best wishes for health, happiness, and a long \nlife.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/01/senate-section/article/S7898-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7898-S7899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today our President, President Bush, spoke \nso eloquently upon learning of Justice O'Connor's desire to step down \nand spend more time with her husband. I think that is such a beautiful \nand warm way to send a message all across America.\n  I say, with a deep sense of humility, I consider her a friend. I am \nprivileged to know her. I know her husband. He loves the outdoors. He \nloves the golf game. They are a wonderful couple who have inspired \nAmerica.\n  It is interesting, I also heard, this morning, another broadcast in \nwhich a retired Federal circuit court judge--an individual well known \nto the Senate, well known to America--in commenting upon this \nretirement, did so in a way that left me troubled. That is what brings \nme to the floor. I am not sure he paid the respect this great Justice \nis owed. I will let people who desire to look at his remarks.\n  But then he said, in so many words--and used the word--that the \nSenate advice and consent process today is ``corrupt.'' That moved me \nto the point where I felt compelled to speak out today.\n  What a privilege it has been for me, on behalf of Virginia, to stand \non this floor for 27 years and to participate in debates and vote for \nthe best interests of our Nation and the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n  As I look at Justice O'Connor's record, it exemplifies to me a \nquotation from Shakespeare that I have always tried to follow: Unto \nthine own self always be true.\n  The record will show and history will record the magnificent way in \nwhich she discharged public office not only in the Supreme Court but, \nindeed, back in the legislative body of her beloved State of Arizona.\n  I will participate with my colleagues in this debate, this careful \nand fair and objective consideration of that individual selected by our \nPresident. As sure as I am standing here, I am confident that when it \nreaches the vote--and I think we will have an up-or-down vote; I will \ncertainly do what I can to ensure that takes place--the American public \nwill look back upon the duty of the Senate, under the Constitution, as \nhaving been fulfilled with dignity and in a manner to reflect \nconfidence within this great Nation and our citizens.\n  As you know, Mr. President, the executive branch, with the President, \nhas a role in this nomination coequal to that of the Senate. In \nstudying history, the role of the President is set out so carefully. I \ndid this research when I worked with the ``Gang of 14,'' which I will \nmention here momentarily.\n  But Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist Paper No. 66, said:\n\n       It will be the office of the President to nominate, and, \n     with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint. There \n     will, of course, be no----\n\n  I repeat: ``no''----\n\n     exertion of choice on the part of the Senate.\n\n       They may defeat one choice of the Executive----\n\n  I hope that does not happen in this case----\n\n     and oblige him to make another; but they cannot themselves \n     choose--they can only ratify or reject the choice of the \n     President.\n\n  How clear that is. And working with Senator Byrd and the other \nmembers of the 14 Senators who got together--and, by the way, I think \nthe work of that group reflects credit on this institution--some six \nFederal judges are now serving our Nation as a consequence of their \nwork, work which I always felt was in support of the Senate leadership \nand their valiant efforts to see that the consideration by Senators of \nnominees be fair and expeditious.\n  But in the context of our sort of agreement--and I quote from it----\n\n       We [the 14] believe that, under article II, Section 2, of \n     the United States Constitution, the word ``Advice'' speaks to \n     consultation between the Senate and the President with regard \n     to the use of the President's power to make nominations. We \n     encourage the Executive branch of government to consult with \n     members of the Senate, both Democratic and Republican, prior \n     to submitting a judicial nomination to the Senate for \n     consideration.\n       Such a return to the early practices of our government may \n     well serve to reduce the rancor that unfortunately \n     accompanies the advice and consent process in the Senate.\n\n  As it has in contemporary times.\n  The Founding Fathers put the word ``advice'' in there, drawn from our \nEnglish language, clearly defined in dictionaries and by precedent. It \nsimply speaks to the role of the Senate and its ability to counsel with \nthe President. I am confident that will take place.\n  This is a magnificent opportunity for the President, this nomination, \nin so many respects. Clearly, he is fully entitled, under the \nConstitution, to select an individual whose philosophy is basically \nconsistent with the core values of our President and his goals that he \nwishes to achieve, not only during the course of his Presidency but \nwith confirmation, judicial nominees remain on for some 10, 15, 20, 25 \nyears--long after the President has stepped down from office. So that \nshows you the value of this nomination.\n  But in this instance, our President has an opportunity, against a \nbackground of troubled times in our country. We are engaged in a very \ndifficult war on terrorism.\n  Great sacrifices are being made by our country. He can step forward \nand be a uniter, not a divider, in this nomination by selecting someone \nwho will gain the confidence of the majority of Americans, someone who \nwill enable the two aisles here to remove the center aisle, and we can \njoin in a bipartisan way and give strong ratification to the \nPresident's choice.\n  It is interesting. I went back to General Eisenhower. I reached back \n50 years to examine the manner in which the President and the Senate \nworked together under this advice and consent clause. In that 50-year \nperiod, there have been 27 total nominees. Fifteen, better than half, \nwere passed by the Senate either with voice vote--and as the Presiding \nOfficer knows full well, that means total unanimity in the Senate--or \nwith more than 80 votes, so 3 by voice and over half of those by 80 \nvotes. Only 1 of the 27 passed by fewer than 60 votes, that threshold \nthat describes the filibuster. Three were rejected by the Senate and \none withdrew. To me, that shows action in history for a half a century, \nconsistent with what the Founding Fathers devised in this magnificent \nConstitution of ours.\n  That individual selected by the President--I suppose he or she, as \nthe case may be--will be labeled a conservative. That is fine. That \ndoesn't trouble me at all. That doesn't divide. That is consistent with \nthe President's basic philosophy. But if we can put on the bench of the \nhighest Court in the land, a Court that decides literally decisions \nwhich affect every one of us--every single American is affected by \ntheir decisions--an individual who will begin with the confidence of \nthe American public as reflected in a strong bipartisan vote in this \nChamber, that will be a great legacy for the President as a uniter and \nnot a divider.\n  I wish to reflect on the consultation. I am confident it will take \nplace. There is no way of trying to describe it. It is up to the \nPresident. It is within his discretion. But I have confidence it will \ntake place in a manner that history will document that will be more \nthan adequate for the purpose.\n  I also listened to a report this morning where one group has been \ngathering\n\n[[Page S7899]]\n\nfunds. They said they had $20 million ready to throw behind the \nPresident's nominee. Another group had an equal amount of money to \nthrow behind such opposition as to mount against the nominee. They have \na perfect right under freedom of speech, the magnificence of this \ncountry, but it would be my hope that they will play a constructive \nrole and not look at this great moment in history of the selection of a \nJustice to the Court as something likened to a Super Bowl where the \nsides get in and start the clash. Rather, they should view themselves \nas being in consultation with the Senate--Senators individually and \ncollectively--and do it in a constructive way.\n  I remember so well the role of the outside groups in that \nextraordinary chapter of Senate history with regard to the Schiavo \ncase. History will record the viewpoints of many as to how it was done. \nI myself will forever be concerned about the role, in particular, of \nthe Congress and, most specifically, the Senate. I remember Palm Sunday \nwhen only three Senators, myself and two others, were on this floor, at \nwhich time we didn't have time to speak. We could only include a \nwritten statement which is in the Congressional Record. And I did so, \nexpressing my disagreement with having the Senate go on record as \nsupporting a greater role of the Federal judiciary.\n  I felt the tenth amendment clearly established the prerogatives of \nthe several States to handle matters of this type. I was the sole \n``no'' vote that day. But only three Senators acted. The news broadcast \nsaid the Senate of the United States has decided. I will often reflect \non that moment as to whether it did. Although accurate, three Senators \ncan act on behalf of the body, but that was an example of where the \noutside interested parties became quite overbearing and in some ways \ndistorted the important issue. I don't disagree with those who felt \ndifferent than I. But they obfuscated and overdramatized the issue.\n  There is nothing more important than trying to save a life. I \nunderstand that. I respect that. But I use that as an example to say, \nwe cannot, in my judgment, in these troubled times in our history \nexperience another chapter such as that.\n  This nominee, I am confident, will be one who, first, with the \nselection by the President and then, in the course of review by the \nJudiciary Committee and the full Senate must be viewed as one committed \nto uphold and support the Constitution of the United States. The term \n``activist'' jurist is one that troubles me and, indeed, many people, \nbecause it is the Congress of the United States with regard to Federal \nlegislation and the respective 50 State legislatures. They are the \nbodies to write the law, not the State/Federal judiciary.\n  We have seen a tendency recently for opinions to reflect a decision \nthat doesn't necessarily rest on the core values of the Constitution \nbut, rather, the core values of the writers of the opinion.\n  I hope we see that this process moves forward and reflects great \ncredit on our President and credit on this institution. As I say, the \ngang of 14 played a constructive role in the history of this body. The \nquestion was the use or nonuse of what was termed ``the nuclear \noption'' to set aside the 60-vote rule of the Senate. It is my fervent \nhope we don't reach that option--that option is still on the table; the \nrecord is clear--that we don't have any tendency or recourse to go to \nthat because in these troubled times, when this country needs to be \nunited, we would not want to send to the Supreme Court, by virtue of a \nvote under the doctrine of the nuclear option, that individual who \nwould be tattooed for life. That is not what we need.\n  We want that individual to go up there with the full confidence and \ntrust of the American people, the widest margin of people that could \npossibly be drawn together, and to represent them and to make decisions \nwhich they will perceive were done by that individual and the other \nmembers of the Justices of the Court that are in the best interest of \nthe country and each individual American.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     the retirement of robert abbey\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today on the occasion of his \nretirement, to honor the 27 years of public service of Robert V. Abbey \nof Reno, NV. Bob hails originally from Mississippi. He was born in \nClarksdale and earned his bachelor's degree in Resource Management at \nthe University of Southern Mississippi. Over the past 8 years, I am \nproud to say he has become a Nevadan.\n  Bob began his public service working for the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers. Later he moved to the Bureau of Land Management where he has \ndistinguished himself as a dedicated land manager, visionary leader, \nand exceptional citizen.\n  Bob's early career at BLM included tours of duty as a budget analyst \nin Washington, DC; assistant district manager in Yuma, AZ; district \nmanager in Jackson, MS; and associate and acting State director in \nColorado. Since the fall of 1997, Bob has served as the Nevada State \ndiretor of the BLM. His job may very well be the toughest in Nevada and \nperhaps in the ranks of the BLM; in any case, it is among the most \nimportant for both.\n  Although his address has changed many times during his career, his \ncommitment to public lands and public service has never wavered. The \nWest and Nevada are better for it.\n  Today, Bob Abbey leads a staff of 750 employees who manage 48 million \nacres of public land in Nevada. He has led the Nevada BLM during an \nexciting and historic time. Increased public land use, record \npopulation growth, evolving management mandates and shrinking budgets \nrepresent just a few of the challenges facing the Nevada BLM. Bob Abbey \nhas handled every difficulty with grace and vision.\n  During his tenure, Bob directed the implementation of the Southern \nNevada Public Lands Management Act. This is no small task given that \nClark County, NV leads the Nation in sustained growth and development \nand ever increasing recreational use of public lands.\n  Bob and his staff also helped me and the other members of the Nevada \ncongressional delegation in the development of the Clark and Lincoln \nCounty land bills. These bills were among the most significant public \nlands legislation in the 107th and 108th Congresses, respectively, and \nBob's leadership helped make them possible.\n  Bob's motto that we have more in common than our differences has set \nthe tone for the best working relationships between Federal land \nmanagers and Nevadans in my memory. He has inspired his employees to \nsolve problems, take pride in their work, and serve the public with \ndistinction. The results serve as testament to his character, courage, \nand conviction.\n  At the end of next week, Bob Abbey will retire from Federal service \nwith a remarkable record of achievements. But perhaps his greatest \ncontribution as a land manager will come to fruition while he is \nenjoying his retirement with his wife Linda.\n  After wildfires devastated vast swaths of rangeland in Nevada and \nother Western States in 1999 and 2000, Bob played a key role in \ncrafting a blueprint for rangeland and ecosystem restoration in the \nWest. The so-called Great Basin Restoration Initiative is a grand \nvision and roadmap for heaIing the landscape in Nevada. Unfortunately, \nto date, the BLM and Department of Interior have yet to match Bob's \nvision with appropriate funding. It is my hope that this is a temporary \ndelay and that one day soon, a thriving Great Basin ecosystem will \nserve as the enduring legacy of Bob Abbey's public service.\n  Although I regret that Bob Abbey is retiring, I know I speak for \nthousands of Nevadans when I thank him for his exemplary public service \nand wish him well with his future endeavors. We know Bob has made \nNevada and our Nation a better place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/01/senate-section/article/S7899-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7899-S7902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2005\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the United States has a long history of \ncreativity and innovation when it comes to energy. But, somehow we \ncannot seem to break away from our dependency on foreign oil as the \ndominant energy source. It is clear that we must\n\n[[Page S7900]]\n\nbegin a new chapter for energy use as we begin the 21st century through \nnew sources and new means of both generating and saving energy, in \nparticular, for the energy security of our Nation. I am pleased that \nthe Energy Policy Act of 2005 at least starts us down this path.\n  The bipartisan bill passed by the Senate this week attempts to look \nbroadly at our energy needs and at new technologies. Innovation has \nbeen the bedrock of this nation's economic growth and it will be \nessential once again in transforming the way energy is produced and \nconsumed, not only in the United States but around the world.\n  Fuel cell technology is just one example of this ingenuity--offering \na clean, secure, efficient, distributed and dependable source of \nenergy. I am pleased that the Lieberman-Snowe fuel cell bill is part of \nthe overall bill as it should be part of our national energy strategy. \nNew sources of energy and energy efficiencies can and must be developed \nand launched in the marketplace for the benefit of both our own \nnational security as well as the American consumer. At the same time, \nconservation, and decreased energy consumption through greater energy \nefficiencies are also a necessity.\n  I am particularly pleased that the bill contains a number of energy \nefficiency tax incentives I have championed that will benefit my state \nof Maine as well as the rest of the nation. Specifically, this bill \nprovides important tax incentives for the construction of energy \nefficient commercial buildings, and renovation of old existing \nbuildings--including schools and other public buildings--as well as \nresidential buildings that produce a 50 percent reduction in energy \ncosts to the owner or tenant--as compared to a national model code that \nwas part of S. 680, Efficient Energy Through Certified Technologies and \nElectricity Reliability, or EFFECTER, Act that I have introduced with \nSenators Feinstein, McCain, and Durbin.\n  The bill also contains a tax credit for new energy-efficient homes \nthat save as much as 30 to 50 percent of the heating and cooling energy \ncosts, as well as tax credits for efficient heating, cooling and water \nheating equipment--including air conditioners--that reduce consumer \nenergy costs.\n  Notably, these incentives are based on performance, not cost, in \norder to foster competition between suppliers of different technologies \nto produce products that meet the proposed target and conserve the most \nenergy. And we know that competition will not only improve these \ntechnologies, but help make them more widely available.\n  The bill also extends the section 45 tax credit for electricity \nproduction from renewable sources. In the JOBS bill enacted last fall, \nthis credit was modified to allow categories of waste materials from \nforest-related activities--biomass, which is a critical industry in \nMaine--to qualify. This has been a boost to the struggling forest \nproducts industry and will take a step towards smart energy production. \nIt was vital that we extended this effective tax credit.\n  I believe our task is to help make it more attractive, through the \ntax code, for our U.S. manufacturers to get the most promising and \ncost-effective technologies to the U.S. and global marketplace as \nquickly as possible. Through the tax code, we can also incentives great \nenergy savings though energy efficiencies. We should help increase the \nAmerican public's awareness of the benefits to our health and our \nnational security of encouraging the shift away from foreign oil and \ntoward domestic renewable and alternative energy sources that help curb \nour voracious thirst for fossil fuels.\n  My performance-based targeted incentives included in the bill will \nreduce natural gas prices and electricity prices by cutting the demand \nfor natural gas and electricity in the near term, as well as in the \nlonger term. The bottom line is, we have the opportunity to raise the \nbar for our future domestic energy systems and energy efficiencies. \nSolutions do exist in the entrepreneurial spirit of the American \npeople.\n  I must admit to disappointment that we did not address, at the very \nleast, closing the SUV CAFE Standards loophole that would have \nrectified an unacceptable inequity when it comes to obtaining greater \nfuel economy for the vehicles we choose to drive. We did not take this \nroad currently less traveled towards decreasing our nation's need to \nimport greater and greater amounts of foreign oil from the most \nvolatile area of the globe, and at the same time, decrease polluting \nvehicle emissions that affect both the public's and the planet's \nhealth.\n  I am also concerned that the United States is not moving ahead to \ntake actions to address climate change, although, for the first time, \nthe U.S. Senate passed a sense of the Senate resolution on climate \nchange that officially recognizes that there is no doubt that \ngreenhouse gases are irrevocably impacting our climate and that \nmandatory caps on greenhouse gas emissions are necessary.\n  This truly global problem requires solutions based on cooperation and \nconsensus, and I hope that, as the G8 countries, the world's economic \nleaders and largest emitters of greenhouse gases, meet this next week \nin Glenagles, Scotland, they will use the summit as a forum to reach \nagreement on practical and reasoned solutions to confront climate \nchange, setting the stage to bring the developing world to the table.\n  This is what the International Climate Change Taskforce, for which I \nam the Cochair, set out to do well over a year ago. This group of \ninternational leaders came up with a blueprint to set out a pathway to \nengage all countries in concerted action on climate change, including \nthose not bound by the Kyoto Protocol.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe ICCT ``Meeting the Climate Challenge'' Summary of Main \nRecommendations and Appendix B: Taskforce members. We should bequeath \nto all our children a world as rich in life and opportunity as the one \nwe inherited. And, we need to start pursuing economically and \nenvironmentally sound ways to meet this challenge now.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Summary of Main Recommendations\n\n       1. A long-term objective be established to prevent global \n     average temperature from rising more than 2 deg.C (3.6 deg.F) \n     above the pre-industrial level, to limit the extent and \n     magnitude of climate-change impacts.\n       2. A global framework be adopted that builds on the UNFCCC \n     and the Kyoto Protocol, and enables all countries to be part \n     of concerted action on climate change at the global level in \n     the post-2012 period, on the basis of equity and common but \n     differentiated responsibilities.\n       3. G8 governments establish national renewable portfolio \n     standards to generate at least 25% of electricity from \n     renewable energy sources by 2025, with higher targets needed \n     for some G8 governments.\n       4. G8 governments increase their spending on research, \n     development, and demonstration of advanced technologies for \n     energy-efficient and low- and zero-carbon energy supply by \n     two-fold or more by 2010, at the same time as adopting near-\n     term strategies for the large-scale deployment of existing \n     low- and no-carbon technologies.\n       5. The G8 and other major economies, including from the \n     developing world, form a G8+ Climate Group to pursue \n     technology agreements and related initiatives that will lead \n     to large emissions reductions.\n       6. The G8+ Climate Group agree to shift their agricultural \n     subsidies from food crops to biofuels, especially those \n     derived from cellulosic materials, while implementing \n     appropriate safeguards to ensure sustainable farming methods \n     are encouraged, culturally and ecologically sensitive land \n     preserved, and biodiversity protected.\n       7. All developed countries introduce national mandatory \n     cap-and-trade systems for carbon emissions, and construct \n     them to allow for their future integration into a single \n     global market.\n       8. Governments remove barriers to and increase investment \n     in renewable energy and energy efficient technologies and \n     practices through such measures as the phase-out of fossil \n     fuel subsidies and requiring Export Credit Agencies and \n     Multilateral Development Banks to adopt minimum efficiency or \n     carbon intensity standards for projects they support.\n       9. Developed countries honour existing commitments to \n     provide greater financial and technical assistance to help \n     vulnerable countries adapt to climate change including the \n     commitments made at the seventh conference of the parties to \n     the UNFCCC IN 2001, and pursue the establishment of an \n     international compensation fund to support disaster \n     mitigation and preparedness.\n       10. Governments committed to action on climate change raise \n     public awareness of the problem and build public support for \n     climate policies by pledging to provide substantial long-term \n     investment in effective climate communication activities.\n\n[[Page S7901]]\n\n                     Appendix B: Taskforce members\n\n     Co-chairs\n       Rt Hon.

Mr. President, from the day she became the first woman \nto sit on the U.S. Supreme Court, Sandra Day O'Connor has been an \ninspiration for millions of Americans, particularly for women and \ngirls. I know this is true because she inspired me.\n\n[[Page S7903]]\n\n  I was a young woman in my twenties serving in the Louisiana State \nLegislature when Justice O'Connor was appointed to the Supreme Court, \nand I remember that day very clearly. I always knew I wanted to serve \nthe people of my country, and on that day I realized that there was no \nlimit to what one woman could do.\n  And today, 24 years later, I am a woman standing on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate while the number of women in the Louisiana State \nLegislature has grown from 2 to 24. We all owe a great debt to \npioneering women like Sandra Day O'Connor who broke the judicial glass \nceiling and paved the way for me and for millions of other women.\n  But O'Connor's legacy is not limited to the barriers she broke. \nThroughout her 24 years of service, Justice O'Connor has proven herself \nto be one of our Nation's leading legal scholars, consistently putting \nthe rule of law ahead of politics. She has been a champion of the law, \na champion for our rights, and a champion for our country.\n  Finding an appropriate successor to such a dedicated jurist is a \nheavy task indeed.\n  To protect the rights and liberties of all Americans, there is \nperhaps no more important decision a President makes than nominating a \nJustice to the Supreme Court. I strongly urge President Bush to rise \nabove the partisan politics that have gripped recent judicial \nconfirmations and to reach out to both Republican and Democratic \nSenators as he selects a nominee to succeed Justice O'Connor.\n  It is the Senate's constitutional duty to provide advice and consent. \nTo provide real advice and to grant real consent, every single Senator \nmust weigh the nomination carefully and consciously.\n  Senators from both sides of the aisle must come together to ensure \nthat the next member of the Supreme Court will uphold the rights of the \nAmerican people and base his or her decisions on the law and the \nConstitution--not on political ideology.\n  I hope President Bush will join us in this partnership and allow us \nto provide real advice at this historic time.\n  Working together, I am confident that we can find a suitable Justice \nwho will follow the great precedent of Sandra Day O'Connor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/01/senate-section/article/S7903-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7903-S7904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DESTRUCTION IN ZIMBABWE\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I call attention to and condemn the \ncurrent tragic actions by the government of Zimbabwe.\n  At present, more than 200,000 people have been made homeless as a \nresult of ``Operation Restore Order''--a 5-week-old government campaign \nto destroy informal dwellings and businesses in Zimbabwe's cities. \nAlternatively, the operation is also being called Operation \nMurambatsvina--meaning operation ``Drive Out Rubbish.''\n  Whatever the name, this operation is horrific. It is appalling. And \nit must end.\n  As a State Department spoke\nsman affirmed last week--``it's uncondonable, inexcusable, and we will \ncontinue to speak out and act diplomatically to achieve justice for \nthose who have been so senselessly disadvantaged.'' That is why I speak \ntoday.\n  The targets of this ongoing campaign are Zimbabwe's very poorest \ncitizens--individuals who are already suffering from 80 percent \nunemployment, 600-percent inflation and widespread food shortages. An \nthe true reasons for this campaign have not been made fully clear.\n  Zimbabwe's President, Robert Mugabe, says the crackdown is designed \nto ``restore sanity'' in urban areas--areas which he says have become \noverrun with criminals.\n  But Zimbabwe's cities are also the centers of opposition political \nactivity.\n  Due to the worsening situation in the urban areas, including a lack \nof fuel and a diminishing food supply, the government may be moving \npoor people out of the cities in an effort to increase control over the \npopulation.\n  Unfortunately, because of Mugabe's government controls, there has \nbeen a severe lack of verifiable information coming out of Zimbabwe. \nBut daily dispatches are telling us of people being forced into labor \non state-run farms, and young people being sent to youth militia camps. \nMost disturbing are the tragic reports that children are being crushed \nand killed in these raids.\n  Last Friday, these events led 10 United Nations special rapporteurs \non human rights to issue a strong statement of concern about the \n``recent mass forced evictions in Zimbabwe and related human rights \nviolations.''\n  I briefly read a portion of this statement, which was issued through \nthe Office of the U.N. High Commissioner on Human Rights:\n\n       Since 18 May 2005 Zimbabwean authorities are reported to \n     have forcibly evicted an estimated 200,000 people from Harare \n     and 29 other locations across Zimbabwe, with some reports \n     stating that up to a million people may face eviction if the \n     operation continues. . . . These evictions have targeted . . \n     . informal traders and families living in informal \n     settlements, including women with HIV/AIDS, widows, children \n     with disabilities. Many evictees, including women, are \n     reported to have been beaten up by police. The evictees have \n     been given no prior notice, no opportunity to appeal and no \n     opportunity to retrieve property and goods from homes and \n     shops before destruction . . . With the exception of a few \n     inadequate transit camps, there is no evidence that the \n     Government has explored any alternatives to the evictions or \n     offered adequate alternative housing and many evictees have \n     been left completely homeless.\n\n  I find this situation to be alarming at the very least. These \ndemolitions sound a lot like political retribution and forced human \ndisplacement. And the deliberate destruction of the homes is a clear \nviolation of fundamental human rights.\n  In light of this alleged, sustained and deliberate destruction, I \ncommend Kofi Annan's recent decision to send Ms. Anna Kajumulo \nTibaijuka as his Special Envoy to Zimbabwe to further investigate and \nrespond to this tragedy.\n  Anna currently serves as the Under-Secretary General and Executive \nDirector of U.N. HABITAT, and is a good friend.\n  This past Sunday, Anna arrived in Harare as the head of a seven-\nmember delegation to investigate the true impact of Mugabe's so-called \n``cleaning'' operation.\n  Sending Anna and the delegation is a very positive step, and I am \nencouraged by the visit. And I urge President Mugabe to continue to \nallow Anna and her team full access to impacted areas. I look forward \nto hearing about and reading the delegation's findings.\n  At the same time, I want to commend international leaders, including \nBritish Prime Minister Tony Blair, Australian Prime Minister John \nHoward, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, as well as over 200 \ninternational human rights and civics groups for publicly condemning \nthese continued atrocities and human rights abuses.\n  As an international community, we share a collective responsibility \nto assist the people of Zimbabwe and bring about a meaningful end to \nthis man-made tragedy.\n  But I also echo international calls for Zimbabwe's neighbors to step \nforward and put pressure on the Mugabe government. I urge Zimbabwe's \nAfrican neighbors to take effective action and intervene. In \nparticular, I urge the African Union to take meaningful action.\n  The fact is, the latest demolitions are part of a larger, sustained \npattern of human rights violations being carried out by President \nMugabe and his government.\n  As the 2004 State Department Human Rights Report relates, and I will \nread a brief paragraph directly:\n\n       President Mugabe and his party used intimidation and \n     violence to maintain political power. A systematic, \n     government sanctioned campaign of violence targeting \n     supporters and perceived supporters of the opposition \n     continued during the year. Security forces committed at least \n     one extrajudicial killing. Ruling party supporters, with \n     material support from the Government, continued their \n     occupation of commercial farms, and in some cases killed, \n     abducted, tortured, intimidated, raped, or threatened farm \n     occupants. Security forces, government-sanctioned youth \n     militias, and ruling party supporters tortured, raped, and \n     otherwise abused persons perceived to be associated with the \n     opposition; some persons died from their injuries.\n\n  I remind my colleagues that this very same government is also a \ncurrent member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights--which \nis yet another travesty.\n  But the immediate issue facing us today is the current government \ncampaign to demolish Zimbabwe's urban areas. We cannot ignore this \ncontinued destruction and abuse. We simply cannot look the other way.\n\n[[Page S7904]]\n\n  As Secretary Rice outlined in her confirmation hearing before the \nForeign Relations Committee earlier this year, Zimbabwe remains one of \nthe outposts of tyranny.\n  And as Secretary Rice rightly remarked, ``America stands with \noppressed people on every continent.''\n  At the time, she referenced Natan Sharansky and what he calls the \n``Town Square Test,'' saying that the world should apply that test. To \nquote the Secretary directly, ``if a person cannot walk into the middle \nof the town square and express his or her views without fear of arrest, \nimprisonment, or physical harm, then that person is living in a fear \nsociety, not a free society. We cannot rest until every person living \nin a ``fear society'' is living in a ``free society.''\n  These remarks are even more relevant in light of current events. The \npeople living in Zimbabwe's cities are clearly living in a society of \nfear. Their town squares are literally being torn down--the rubble \ncrushing the people of that country.\n  I look forward to working with the Administration, and supporting \ninternational efforts to provide meaningful assistance to the people of \nZimbabwe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/01/senate-section/article/S7904-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CENTRAL AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to speak a moment about why I am \nstrongly opposed to the Dominican Republic/Central American Free Trade \nAgreement Implementation Bill, or CAFTA it is often referred to. CAFTA \nthreatens a proud heritage and a way of life in Louisiana that dates \nback more than 250 years. Our great-great-great grandfathers were \nraising cane long before our country was even born. Since 1751, \nLouisiana sugar cane farmers have been farming the fertile soil of our \ngreat State. Before the marble Walls of Congress were ever erected, \nLouisianans built an industry that would weather hurricanes, the Great \nDepression and even the Civil War.\n  These farmers have good reason to be proud. American sugar producers \nare among the most efficient in the world. Two-thirds of the world's \nmore than 100 sugar-producing countries produce at a higher cost than \nthe U.S. And in my State of Louisiana, farmers produce about 20 percent \nof the sugar grown in the United States and currently rank fourth in \nthe Nation in production of sugar, producing an average revenue of $750 \nmillion per year.\n  But today, we are prepared to deal this proud industry a death blow. \nWe are talking about undoing centuries of tradition and stripping away \njobs from efficient Louisiana farmers. As passed, this trade agreement \nwould have a serious and harmful effect on sugar producers in my State: \nCAFTA will equal job loss and financial despair for 27,000 Louisiana \nsugar workers and farmers. Along with additional bilateral trade \nagreements, CAFTA could cost my State $750 million in direct sugar \nsales, as well as $2 billion in industry-related revenue each year.\n  In any trade negotiation, there are losses and there are wins. \nOftentimes we are willing to accept the impacts these deals might have \non our domestic producers because in the long run the good outweighs \nthe bad. But that is not the case. CAFTA is a relatively small trade \ndeal with a group of countries whose combined economies are smaller \nthan that of New Haven, CT. Nearly half of all Central Americans earn \nless than $2 a day, and they simply cannot afford the meats or crops we \nhave to sell. That is why the Louisiana Farm Bureau has joined other \nState farm bureaus, the National Association of State Departments of \nAgriculture, and numerous national farm groups in opposing CAFTA. Even \nour own Government's economic estimates say that CAFTA will mean little \nto agriculture or to our country as a whole; and these are known to be \nquite optimistic estimates. That is because as the administration \npoints out time and time again--we already dominate the import market \nof this poor region.\n  According to estimates by the U.S. International Trade Commission, \nCAFTA would actually increase our trade deficit with Central America \nwhile benefiting our economy by less than one-hundredth of 1 percent. \nThat is worth repeating again. The administration's economists say that \nCAFTA will increase our trade deficit with the region while boosting \nour own economy by less than 0.01 percent.\n  This same study concluded that for other farmers CAFTA would have ``a \nnegligible impact on total U.S. production and employment.'' Why then \nare we talking about dismantling my State's sugar industry? U.S. \nfarmers and ranchers get little in return for sending thousands to the \nranks of the unemployed.\n  So what we have here is another raw deal for Louisiana sugar. I urge \nmy colleagues to take a long, hard look at our country's current \nagricultural trade agenda. This year, the USDA says America will import \nas much food as we export. The agricultural trade surplus that stood at \n$27 billion less than 10 years ago is now gone. The promises made to \nfarmers during the NAFTA debates have come up flat. And the promises \nthat will be made today about CAFTA are contradicted by the \nadministration's own estimates.\n  In closing, let me say I support free trade, so long as it is fair. \nFair free trade requires that all players operate on as equal and level \na playing field as possible, accountable to the same labor laws, \nenvironmental standards, and governmental intervention. To sacrifice \neven one job for a trade deal that will deepen our agricultural trade \ndeficit is a travesty. And, having to tell thousands of hard-working \nfarmers in Louisiana that they must look for work, because sugar was \nused as a bargaining chip, is unacceptable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/01/senate-section/article/S7904-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7904-S7907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                ZIMBABWE\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to express my shock and alarm \nover the most recent turn taken in Zimbabwe's deepening political and \neconomic crisis. As my colleagues know, the ruling regime in Harare \nrecently launched a massive campaign to destroy the homes of hundreds \nof thousands of urban Zimbabweans, evicting men, women, and children--\nin at least one case reportedly evicting even AIDS orphans--under the \nauspices of ``driving out the rubbish.''\n  Many analysts believe that the Government is attempting to forcibly \nrelocate the urban population--which tends to support the political \nopposition--to rural areas in order to diffuse resistance to its \nrepressive policies. The ruling party may also be attempting to \nrevitalize the agricultural sector, which has been devastated by its \npolicies, through this campaign of forced relocation to rural areas. \nWhat is certain is that this kind of deliberate displacement of people \nin a country where 3 to 4 million already need food assistance is an \nabsolute outrage.\n  Sadly, this is what we have come to expect from President Mugabe and \nhis cronies. This same government has refused food assistance for \nhungry people; manipulated available food assistance for political \npurposes; systematically attacked the independence of the judiciary; \nsilenced independent media voices; and created, often through coercion, \nbrutally violent youth militias to terrorize civilians.\n  I commend Chairman Martinez for speaking out so forthrightly on this \nissue. I am pleased to join him here today. I have also joined with my \ncolleague, Senator Durbin, in working to encourage U.N. Secretary \nGeneral Kofi Annan to treat this crisis with the urgency it deserves, \nand I also thank him for his leadership. And I recently joined with \nSenator McCain to assure Secretary of State Rice of the strong, \nbipartisan support that exists here for an energized Zimbabwe policy.\n  But we can and must do more to oppose this campaign of abuse. We must \ncontinue to speak plainly to Southern African leaders about the toll \nthat their silence about this ongoing crisis takes on their \ncredibility, and about the loss of investor and donor confidence in the \nregion that is a consequence of Zimbabwe's ceaseless downward spiral \nover the past 5 years.\n  The administration has spoken out commendably regarding the Zimbabwe \ncrisis, but more could be done to take action that would bolster their \ntough talk. Targeted sanctions could have more bite, and the U.S. and \nother key donors could more clearly link support for laudable \ninitiatives such as the New Economic Partnership for Africa's \nDevelopment to restoration of respect for civil and political rights \nand the rule of law in Zimbabwe.\n  Those of us who have followed the crisis in Zimbabwe often feel a \nsense of frustration as we watch so much of\n\n[[Page S7905]]\n\nwhat was promising about that country be systematically dismantled by \nthe current ruling party. But we must not give up on the people of \nZimbabwe, many of whom continue to fight against repression despite \nconsiderable risk. Once Zimbabwe's corrupt leadership finally releases \nits grasp on power, the country will require substantial international \nassistance to rebuild the institutions of democracy and regain its \neconomic footing.\n  I was pleased to work with the majority leader on the Zimbabwe \nDemocracy and Economic Recovery Act, which became law in 2001. This law \nspells out Congress's commitment to come forward as a strong partner of \na recovery in Zimbabwe when change finally does come and Zimbabwe's \nlong, sad slide into authoritarianism and economic collapse has been \nhalted. I still believe in the promise of that bill and look forward to \nthe day conditions allow all of us to realize that promise, and to join \nwith the people of Zimbabwe in rebuilding their country and \nsafeguarding their democracy.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, earlier this week I introduced the \nProfessional Sports Integrity and Accountability Act. This is not a \nbill I relish introducing, and I wish Congress did not have to get \ninvolved in this issue.\n  Unfortunately, this might be the only way to get professional sports \nto finally clean up their act. As a former major league baseball player \nand a member of The Baseball Hall of Fame, protecting the integrity of \nour national past time is a matter near and dear to my heart. I know it \nis near and dear to the hearts of so many fans across America.\n  I do not have any personal experience with steroids. I never \nencountered them during my years in the major leagues. But I can tell \nyou this--players who use steroids are cheaters. When I played ball, if \nyou got caught cheating--whether it was by sharpening your spikes or \ncorking your bat--you were suspended. The same should hold true for \nthose athletes who use illegal performance enhancing drugs.\n  Something needs to be done to strike out drugs in sports. Some sports \nleagues have taken baby steps in an attempt to implement a new or \nimprove a current testing program. While I can appreciate their \nefforts, I just do not think they have done enough. For example, the \npenalties under baseball's current drug testing program are--at best--\npuny.\n  My bill would not only toughen baseball's standards, but it would \napply to a host of professional sports leagues, such as Major and Minor \nLeague Baseball, Arena and National Football Leagues, men's and women's \nNational Basketball Associations, Major League Soccer, and the National \nHockey League.\n  Under my legislation, players would be tested at least three times a \nyear. Tests would be conducted randomly with no advance notice to the \nathlete. Substances tested would include all those substances that are \nprohibited for all sports by the Olympics. Players testing positive \nwould be suspended without pay from all leagues for two years on their \nfirst offense. If they test positive a second time they are banned from \nall sports forever.\n  These are the kind of hard-nosed penalties that will finally wake \nplayers up to the reality that the need to stop doping up and risking \nlosing their entire livelihood. It is going to be up to the players. I \ndo not think too many of them will risk playing with fire. Because if \nyou play with fire, you will get burned.\n  In this legislation, leagues would also be required to disclose to \nthe public the names of those players who violate the testing policy, \nthe penalty they receive, and the substances involved. Any athlete who \nrefuses to take a drug test will be immediately penalized the same as \nif he or he failed the test. These penalties would also apply to anyone \nwho assists in a violation of the drug testing policy.\n  Tests will be conducted by an independent entity not controlled by \nany league. This is necessary to ensure the integrity of the tests. \nThis independent entity will be responsible for the collection, \ntransport, and analysis of all samples. Lab analysis will be conducted \nat a lab in the United States that meets Olympic standards. All leagues \nwill be required to keep records of these tests which will be subject \nto inspection by the Federal Trade Commission.\n  It is important that people realize this is not about conducting a \nwitch hunt, and that is why my bill also includes some protections for \nthese athletes. As a former player, I recognize that training and \nplaying a sport can take a tremendous toll on the body. Therefore, my \nbill would allow athletes exemptions for substances prescribed by their \ndoctor.\n  My bill requires that leagues provide violators with a hearing and \nfair appeals process upon testing positive. These results must be \ndisclosed to the public. However, no information about an athlete's \nhealth is required to be disclosed. In order to ensure that leagues are \nin compliance, the Federal Trade Commission is designated with \noversight of the drug testing program. Leagues can be fined up to $1 \nmillion per day if they do not enforce this testing policy.\n  This legislation also encourages--but does not require--leagues to \ninvalidate the records of any athlete who is caught using performance \nenhancing drugs. History is an important part of any sport and records \nshould mean something. Yes, records are made to be broken. But it does \nnot mean you should be able to cheat to do so.\n  I was blessed to play 17 years in the major leagues. I never saw a \nplayer hit more home runs at age 40 than he was hitting at age 25. \nUnlike a good wine, professional athletes generally do not get better \nwith age. The body breaks down and you become more prone to injury. You \njust do not recover as quickly from the grind of playing day after \nday--year after year.\n  Some may ask why congress would be getting involved in the business \nof trying to regulate major league sports. Well, the answer is really \nquite simple. It is not just about the integrity of the game. It is \npartly about the health of the athlete. But really, it is about the \nkids.\n  The game of baseball has been tarnished by the use of steroids. \nUnfortunately, this not only affects players taking these substances. \nBut it also sends the wrong message to kids who see players as role \nmodels, and who also feel such pressure to perform so well at a young \nage. It is very important that we understand just how harmful steroids \ncan be on a person's health.\n  Side-effects of steroids include fatal liver cysts, liver cancer, \nkidney disease, blood clotting, and they can even lead to heart attack \nor stroke. Our children look up to players as heroes. And it is \nimportant that players set a good example.\n  As Members of Congress we can play an important role in educating the \npublic on the terrible health effects from steroids. Illegal \nperformance-enhancing drugs have become a serious problem in \nprofessional sports and it needs to stop.\n  Fans expect it to stop and former professional athletes expect it to \nstop. My friend and fellow baseball Hall of Famer--Dave Winfield--wrote \nme recently. He sent me a copy of an opinion piece he wrote on the \nsteroid issue. In his piece, Dave outlines not only the negative \nphysical health effects steroids cause. But he touches on the negative \npsychological effects, too. Dave also cites a recent survey by a \nnational healthcare provider that nearly one million kids in America \nare using steroids and other substances to boost their athletic \nperformance.\n  Finally, he raises the important question to athletes: ``How do you \nwant to play your sport--clean and fair, or by cheating with drugs?''\n  The fans and former athletes do not want our national pasttime and \nfavorite sports to end up with black eyes because of this mess. \nEverywhere I go I hear sports fans and former athletes whistling for an \nend to the use of drugs in sports. I and others in this body are \nlistening. Players and leagues must be held accountable for the State \nof their respective sports. And this legislation demands accountability \nby putting real penalties on those who cheat.\n  It is time to restore some integrity to the sports we all watch, pour \nour hearts out to, and love. I hope my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this important cause. I recognize that other senators, \nincluding Senator Stevens, Senator McCain, and Senator Rockefeller, \nhave helped to highlight this issue, and I look forward to the Senate\n\n[[Page S7906]]\n\nmoving this debate and legislation forward to clean this mess up in a \nbi-partisan way.\n  Before I yield the floor, I want to share a letter I received last \nmonth from a young boy--Joseph Mattingly--from Louisville, KY. Joseph \nwrites:\n\n       Dear Senator Bunning, my name is Joseph Mattingly. I am a \n     Boy Scout from Troop 327. At this year's summer camp, I am \n     working on a merit badge that requires me to write a letter \n     to a Member of Congress representing my State--Kentucky. This \n     letter was required to be about a national issue which I \n     share the same view with you. I wrote you because I am a fan \n     of Major League Baseball and I would agree that Congress \n     should get involved in the steroids scandal. I say this for \n     many reasons. One is that Major League Baseball needs some \n     help. If they cannot clear up this problem, Congress could. \n     Another reason is that taking performance enhancing drugs is \n     cheating. Cheating should not be the American way of doing \n     things. A third reason is that steroids are drugs. \n     Performance enhancing drugs should be made illegal for sale \n     without a prescription. Finally, you are a Hall of Famer with \n     much baseball experience. For this reason, Major League \n     Baseball should let you help them with their problems. These \n     are my views on why Congress should get involved in bringing \n     down the steroids scandal in baseball and all other sports. \n     Sincerely, Joseph Mattingly.\n\n  This is the voice from a young fan--a child who loves the game of \nbaseball. He echoes the thoughts and words of so many others across \nAmerica. There is passion in this young boy's heart, and wisdom in his \nwords.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \neditorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill and editorial was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1334\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

I \n     have seen and heard many opinions, but few (if any) offered \n     on having success without performance-enhancing drugs.\n       The view from some in the Baseball Hall of Fame is this: \n     Acknowledging that no one is perfect, there is no one in the \n     Hall of Fame who used steroids. Overall there is a dim view \n     of those who have padded their statistics by steroid use. No \n     one likes their historic performances and careers \n     marginalized by those who have an unfair advantage, whether \n     the drugs were legal or not. Longtime records fall in time \n     (that's what records are for), but with the advent of these \n     drugs you destroy the integrity of the feat. The issue here \n     is how to compare the achievements of baseball greats from \n     different eras.\n       More important, I am a parent who cares about children and \n     the game of baseball, and will continue to be a role model to \n     others I work with, whether it is Little League \n     International, the Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities program, \n     or with collegiate, or professional baseball players.\n       In this era of immediate gratification, let me give a \n     perspective on achieving long-term success and gratification. \n     Let me be one of many who take the side of advocating success \n     and enjoyment in sports without pharmaceutical enhancements. \n     Hopefully, I may cause others to speak up and give young \n     people a positive path to follow.\n       Here are reasons you should not use anabolic steroids: \n     Although they are known to make athletes stronger and faster, \n     they do not improve athletic skill, and the health risks are \n     numerous. They can cause acne, hair loss, blood-pressure \n     changes, nausea, vomiting, aching joints, testicular \n     shrinkage, urinary problems and impotence or sterility. Other \n     effects include shortening of adult height; paranoia, violent \n     behavior (in some notable cases suicide) and increased risk \n     of developing heart disease, stroke and some types of cancer.\n       I can't recommend harming your body to try to improve your \n     athletic performance. Those short-term goals can lead to \n     long-term physical, legal and career problems.\n       It's frightening and dismaying to hear that recent surveys \n     by a national health-care provider indicate that nearly 1 \n     million kids in America are using steroids and other \n     substances to improve their sports performance. You can gain \n     a competitive advantage in so many other ways and not risk \n     your health. Yes, there is an allure to participate and be \n     successful in sports because of the adulation, the potential \n     attractiveness to the opposite sex, scholarship opportunities \n     and a possible professional career, with all the money and \n     fame and security that go with that. But it comes down to \n     risk and reward, right and wrong--the values you live by.\n       How do you want to play your sport--clean and fair, or by \n     cheating with drugs? I live in California, where our governor \n     used steroids for years to compete in and win many \n     bodybuilding championships. Today there are separate \n     competitions for users and nonusers. Baseball should be the \n     same--where there are no drug users.\n       In the major leagues, when you approach the game \n     incorrectly or illegally, you injure your health, reputation, \n     family, fans, the sport itself, and all the young people who \n     want to be just like you.\n       I played Major League Baseball a long time, and left after \n     the 1995 season. I heard back then that some people were \n     using performance-enhancing drugs, but it was never apparent \n     or evident in the clubhouses I played in.\n       Because people look for shortcuts to success, I talked to \n     my friends who succeeded the right way: Rickey Henderson, Don \n     Mattingly, Eddie Murray, Tony Gwynn and Cal Ripken Jr. They \n     an achieved the heights of this game without performance-\n     enhancing drugs.\n       Henderson, the all-time stolen base leader, said, ``I \n     advocate nutrition, flexibility and exercise.''\n       He understood his speed, eyesight and patience at the plate \n     could help him become a great player.\n       Gwynn, an eight-time batting champion, said, ``My success \n     came from knowing I'm a singles hitter.''\n       He had no desire to try to hit the long ball to be \n     successful. Speed and defense made him an all-around player.\n       Ripken played more consecutive games than anyone in the \n     history of baseball. He never led the league in home runs, \n     runs batted in or stolen bases, but said, ``It was my \n     defense, long-term health, stamina and consistency that gave \n     me success on the diamond.''\n       Murray possessed the ability to switch-hit with power, \n     enabling him to hit more than 500 homers and drive in more \n     than 1,900 runs. He played superb defense and was the \n     consummate team player. He said the hallmarks of his success \n     were ``my baseball instincts, competitiveness and love of the \n     game.''\n       Mattingly, the 1985 American League MVP, didn't have the \n     height; weight or strength of others, but what made him a \n     great player was his knowledge of the fundamentals and \n     techniques of hitting. ``I listened and learned from coaches \n     about using my body to maximum effectiveness, and how to \n     solve pitchers,'' he said.\n       The primary things these guys had in common were their \n     understanding of the game, their work ethic and a tough \n     mental approach that gave them longevity in the game.\n       People might think the only reason I didn't entertain drug \n     use was because I already had size, strength, speed and \n     versatility by playing other sports. Sure, it helps to start \n     with ability, but I wouldn't have had the career I did if I \n     didn't listen to the voices of baseball telling me to learn \n     how to play and make adjustments to grow and improve.\n       When I entered the majors, I was not a polished, consistent \n     player. I wasn't an All-Star until my fifth season, and \n     certainly wasn't a shoo-in for the Hall of Fame. It takes \n     time to integrate the knowledge, instincts, training, and \n     experience as a player to become all you can be; that's \n     called maturity.\n       I stress that you work to become a complete player. There \n     is too much emphasis today on only hitting the long ball; \n     many feel that is the sure way to a large payday. Learn to \n     play every part of the game well. There are fewer five-tool \n     players (who can run, hit, hit for power, field and throw) \n     than ever; with a virtual elimination of infield practice \n     before games, the ranks of those without strong arms and good \n     gloves grow every year.\n       I hope the proceedings of the last few months--the first \n     suspensions for steroid use in the major and minor leagues, \n     with better regulation and enforcement--bring the game back \n     to the way it was meant to be played.\n       This is an issue that may test the character of many, but \n     think about your life and lifestyle. Drugs might help you for \n     the short term, but can you imagine anyone taking them for 10 \n     or 20 years? It may bring short term success, but no doubt a \n     shorter life. Choose a lifestyle of nutrition, fitness, \n     dedication and hard work in whatever you do. Don't risk \n     losing your health, career, reputation, freedom or your life \n     from dealing in illegal drugs. It's very simple. It's not \n     worth it!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/01/senate-section/article/S7907-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7907-S7908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 CONGRATULATING ALAMOGORDO, NEW MEXICO\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \ncity of\n\n[[Page S7908]]\n\nAlamogordo, NM, for doing an outstanding job in the All America City \nAward competition. Alamogordo finished in the top 30, which is a great \nachievement considering it was their first time in the competition.\n  The National Civic League, NCL, focuses its efforts on strengthening \nand promoting community democracy by bringing together all sectors of \nsociety in addressing common needs. The All America City Award, \nsponsored by the NCL, recognizes that the basis of a healthy democratic \nsociety is cooperation and participation of private citizens, \ngovernment, voluntary organizations and government. Those communities \nthat foster an environment where citizens can express their needs and \nconcerns and articulate challenges they face, and then bring together \nall of its resources to address those needs, exemplify democracy at \nwork. These political systems respond to the needs of its citizens and \nin doing so, allow them to focus on their pursuit of their American \ndream. Alamogordo should take pride in the fact that they foster this \nenvironment in their community.\n  As the Alamogordo All America City award application mentions, the \ncommunity's efforts in three specific areas, water conservation, \neconomic development and healthy youth, attest to the community's \nstrength and spirit of cooperation. The success of Alamogordo's water \nconservation efforts is truly a model for the State, decreasing usage \nfrom 6.61 million gallons per day in 2000 to 4.82 million gallons per \nday in 2003, even while experiencing population growth. The community-\nwide efforts to develop the local economy, and create jobs have been a \ntremendous success, leading not only to new jobs, but to multiplier \neffects in healthcare, community charitable giving and education. The \nthird area of focusing on healthy youth is exemplified in the \nskateboard park, which provides safe recreation alternatives for 12,600 \nkids each year.\n  Further, the community of Alamogordo actively encourages basic and \nnecessary democratic practices--encouraging citizens to take active \nroles in articulating and resolving community issues, encouraging \neffective and efficient local government, and harnessing local \nphilanthropic and volunteer resources with the end goal of cooperating \nand building consensus, reinvigorating the community's vision for \nitself, facilitating intergroup relations, sharing information in the \ncommunity, and inspiring community pride.\n  The hard work and dedication of a handful of notable public servants \nwho acted as delegates for the presentation, and contributed to this \ntremendous success include: Joan Griggs; Anne Romero; Gwen McCourt; Don \nand Rosemarie Carroll; Maureen Schmittle; Inez Moncada; Donald Cooper; \nSusan Flores; Sharon and Al Hodges; Kory Guerra; Phillip Flores; Peter \nMadrid; Tammie and Ana Reynolds; Elva Oesterreich; Forst Hibler; Laura \nand Austin Harris; Major John Bryan; Elizabeth Upton; Ed Carr; Sharon \nMasters; Flori and Raschal McElderry; Amanda Runnels; Shannon Flanagan; \nPenina Nunnelley; Tony Taylor; and Dr. Rodger and Judy Bates.\n  I would also like to recognize other team members who were not able \nto make the trip to Atlanta, but whose hard, tireless work made the \npresentation possible. Finally, I congratulate each and every \nAlamogordo citizen on their efforts to build this model community, and \nfor setting an example that we can all look to for inspiration. I \nappreciate their efforts in representing New Mexico on the on the \nnational level as an example of civic pride and partnership in \ncommunity improvement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/01/senate-section/article/S7908-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE PASSING OF SOL STETIN\n\n Mr. LAUNTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \na man who dedicated his life to the working men and women of New Jersey \nand the entire country, Sol Stetin. Sol passed away a few weeks ago, \nright after his 95 birthday. For many of those years he was a dear \nfriend to me and my family. My family and I, and millions of others who \nknew Sol by name or reputation, will miss him very much.\n  From the time since Sol's family arrived at Ellis Island in 1921, \nwhen he was just 10 years old, Sol worked hard to help his father \nprovide for their family. At 16, Sol went into business for himself \ndelivering newspapers. He even employed several other young men to help \nhim. Sol was also a caddy at a local gold club and an amateur boxer.\n  Sol grew up on the streets of Paterson, NJ, which is my home town. \nBack then, Paterson was a blue collar mill town where the people worked \nhard, often under extremely dangerous conditions. Like my own father, \nSol took a job as a dye worker in a silk mill. In 1932, the workers \ndeclared a strike at the mill and although Sol's job remained safe, he \njoined those struggling workers and helped to lead their effort, \nultimately becoming one of the organizers.\n  After that first strike on behalf of the hard-working men at that \nPaterson silk mill, Sol Stetin decided to dedicate his life to \ndefending the rights of those who worked so hard to keep their families \nfed, housed, and clothed. Sol began his career in the labor movement \nand quickly became one of the most respected advocates for the workers \nin this country, rising through the ranks to become a member of the \nexecutive council of the AFL-CIO and the Vice President of the \nAmalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union.\n  Sol knew how important it was to preserve and teach the history of \nthe labor movement so he was one of the founders of the American Labor \nMuseum-Botto House National Landmark in Haledon, NJ. As president of \nthe Museum, he was instrumental in creating a training center that is \nnow the model for educating those who continue to fight for fairness \nand safety in the workplace.\n  Sol Stetin was a legendary figure in Paterson, where you could often \nfind him sitting in a diner or standing on a street corner, talking and \nmeeting with people who wanted to thank him for what he had done, or to \nseek his advice. He truly was one of those rare people who come along \nonce in awhile and make a real difference in other people's lives.\n  Sol's brother Irving Stetin was one of my father's closest friends \nwhen they were young men. They both worked in the silk mills in \nPaterson long before unions were in place, and they suffered from \ninadequate wages, no pay for holidays off, no healthcare, and no \ncompensation for my mother when my father died at age 43. The cause of \nhis death was attributed to unsafe and unhealthy working conditions in \nthe mill.\n  A powerful lifetime impression was created for me as I lived through \nthose dreadful days with my mother and my little sister. I learned \nfirst-hand, the hard way, about the things working people need for \ntheir well-being and a decent quality of life. Those memories will \nalways be with me and they serve as a guide for my decisions, not \nwithstanding my good fortune as an executive in a very successful \nbusiness.\n  Because of the tireless work of Sol Stetin and his colleagues in the \nearly days of the labor movement, what happened to my father is no \nlonger the rule, but the exception.\n  Sol Stetin's family came to America in search of a better life. Then \nSol dedicated himself to helping other people in that same search. Sol \ndedicated himself to giving something back to this country we love so \nmuch. For that, each and every American should be as grateful to him as \nI am.\n  Sol Stetin lived a long life. But more important, he lived a good \nlife, devoted to helping others. We mourn his passing, but we celebrate \nhis tremendous accomplishments on behalf of so many working men and \nwomen and their families and the country.

A bill to establish an Unsolved Crimes Section in the Civil \nRights Division of the Department of Justice; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I join the Senators from Missouri and \nConnecticut in introducing the Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. I do so \nbecause I believe that this legislation takes the right approach when \ndealing with the wrongs of our past. It takes action. It takes positive \nsteps forward to correct injustices. It recommits us to one of our \nhighest ideals as Americans--that justice will not be denied.\n  Specifically, the bill creates a new office within the Department of \nJustice Civil Rights Division specifically tasked to investigate ``cold \ncase'' murders from the civil rights era. It will commit the resources \nof the Department of Justice to work in conjunction with State and \nlocal law enforcement to aggressively prosecute criminals in those \ncases.\n  The Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act might well be named in honor of \nJames Chaney, Michael Schwerner, and Andrew Goodman--the three civil \nrights workers who were shot to death by former Ku Klux Klansman Edgar \nRay Killen. Forty-one years later, thanks to the efforts of the \nvictims' families, Mississippi State officials, and many others who \nwould not let this crime go unpunished, Killen sits in solitary \nconfinement in a State prison outside Jackson, Mississippi, right where \nhe belongs.\n  Justice will not be denied. And the Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act \nwill see to it that others like Edgar Ray Killen are punished for their \ncrimes. It will pour new resources into the investigations of other \nunsolved cases--like that of 14-year old Emmett Till, who was kidnapped \nand murdered in 1955.\n  Recently, the Senate apologized for the failure of earlier Senators \nto enact federal antilynching legislation in the 1930s and 1940s. In \ndiscussing that resolution, I reminded my colleagues of how often we as \na Nation have failed to live up to our great ideals. But usually when \nwe have failed, we have recognized that failure and recommitted \nourselves to those ideals and reached for them again. We did not simply \nacknowledge our failure and give up--we took action to correct our \nshortcomings. We abolished slavery. We granted women the right to vote. \nWe desegregated our schools. Here, with this bill, we take action once \nmore.\n  Actions speak louder than words. If the Edgar Ray Killen conviction \nis any indication, then the action we would take by passing this bill \nwould speak very loudly indeed. When Killen was convicted, the \nNashville City Paper ran an editorial, which I will include in full \nfollowing my remarks, that summed up just why taking action is so \nimportant. The editorial concluded, ``As long as Civil Rights era \nkillers are still alive and free, justice has not yet been fully \nserved. Hunting them down and bringing them to account for their \nactions is far and away the best apology any of us can make for their \ncrimes.''\n  Today, we do not merely rest on words of apology--we take action. \nWhen it comes to questions of civil rights that has always been what I \nhave tried to do. In 1962 when I was the student newspaper editor, \nVanderbilt University's undergraduate school was segregated. I could \nhave apologized for the actions of the board of trust; instead, I \nhelped integrate the school. As Governor and President of the \nUniversity of Tennessee, instead of apologizing for my predecessors, I \nappointed the first African American Supreme Court Justice and \nuniversity vice-presidents. Instead of apologizing for Tennessee \nlegislatures that had refused to enact the Martin Luther King Holiday, \nI helped make it law. I did not think it was effective merely to \napologize for what others had failed to do. America is a work in \nprogress. If we were to apologize for every failure to reach our lofty \ngoals, there would be no end to it.\n\n[[Page S7911]]\n\n  I believe it is better to look forward and take action rather than \nlook backward and apologize for others. I believe this bill does just \nthat. Passing this bill today hopefully means that tomorrow one more \nunsolved case is opened; one more criminal is brought to justice; one \nmore family can find peace.\n  Justice delayed is justice denied. This bill will help make sure that \njustice will be delayed no longer. And it is for that reason that I am \nproud to join my colleagues in cosponsoring the Unsolved Civil Rights \nCrime Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article I referenced earlier be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the (Nashville) City Paper, Jun. 28, 2005]\n\n            Punishing Men Like Killen Best Possible Apology\n\n       For most of early June, a heated debate raged in this \n     country over whether the U.S. Senate acted properly in \n     apologizing for failing to pass a federal anti-lynching law. \n     Much of the criticism was directed at Sen. Lamar Alexander, \n     who declined to co-sponsor the resolution.\n       It is hard to dispute that the federal government should \n     have acted sooner to protect the rights of all Americans \n     during the Civil Rights struggle. There was certainly no harm \n     in the Senate acknowledging its predecessors' institutional \n     failure in this matter. As Alexander and others pointed out, \n     however, an apology on behalf of long-dead third parties, \n     whatever their failures, is ultimately a gesture. This is not \n     the case with the conviction of Edgar Ray Killen in \n     Philadelphia, Miss.\n       Almost 41 years to the day after three Civil Rights workers \n     were set up by law enforcement officers and brutally murdered \n     by Klansmen, a Mississippi jury convicted Killen, one of the \n     crime's organizers, of three counts of manslaughter. In doing \n     so, the state of Mississippi did what it should have done \n     long ago: It fixed personal responsibility for this hideous \n     act on one of the perpetrators, as it took responsibility for \n     seeing justice done.\n       As author Robert Heinlein once observed, ``It is impossible \n     to shift blame, share blame, distribute blame . . . as blame, \n     guilt, responsibility are matters taking place inside human \n     beings singly and nowhere else.'' By prosecuting and \n     convicting Edgar Ray Killen, the state of Mississippi did \n     more than simply make a gesture shifting the responsibility \n     to past state leaders. As certainly as the verdict put some \n     of the responsibility for the murders on Killen, it also \n     demonstrated the acceptance by individual Mississippians of \n     the guilt and blame, not for the murders, but for the 41-year \n     wait for justice.\n       The task is not yet finished. As long as Civil Rights era \n     killers are still alive and free, justice has not yet been \n     fully served. Hunting them down and bringing them to account \n     for their actions is far and away the best possible apology \n     any of us can make for their crimes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT (for himself, Mr. Conrad, and Mr. Byrd):\n  S. 1370. A bill to provide for the protection of the flag of the \nUnited States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Conrad that has to do with the desecration \nof the flag. All of us are angered when we see someone burn or \notherwise desecrate the American flag, and I believe it is appropriate \nthat we take such steps as are appropriate to deal with such \ndesecration.\n  Over the years I have been in the Senate, I have opposed amending the \nConstitution to deal with this issue for two reasons. First, there are \nnot that many cases of flag desecration for us to see as we look around \nthe country. And I am reluctant to amend the Constitution to deal with \na non-problem. Flag desecration hit its peak during the Vietnam years, \nbut it has virtually disappeared now and occurs, ironically, only when \ndebate about amending the Constitution becomes a subject of public \ndiscourse. We seem to stimulate flag desecration when we have the \ndebate on amending the Constitution with respect to it.\n  So for that reason, I have consistently opposed a constitutional \namendment on desecration of the flag.\n  However, as I have studied the matter and spent time with the legal \nexperts at the Congressional Research Service over at the Library of \nCongress, I have found that there are things that can be done with \nrespect to flag desecration that also establish our reverence for the \nflag, but do not require a constitutional amendment.\n  I have introduced this legislation before. It has not progressed in \nthe congressional process to the opportunity for a vote, and I am not \nsure it will this time. But I wish to make it clear to my constituents \nand to others who have concern about this problem that my objection to \na constitutional amendment should not be construed as demonstrating \nindifference to the issue of reverence for the flag.\n  Senator Conrad has joined me on this occasion as he has at previous \ntimes when this legislation has been introduced, and I am happy to have \nhim as an original co-sponsor on the bill at this time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I wish to associate myself with the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator, and I would appreciate if he would add my name \nas a co-sponsor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am happy to ask unanimous consent that \nthe honorable Senator from West Virginia be added as an original co-\nsponsor to the bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I have been interested at the reaction that has come \nfrom my constituents as I have held this position over the years. I \nremember a conversation with Utah's most respected pollster just before \nI cast my first vote against the flag amendment. He said: Senator, \naccording to my polls, 80 percent of the people of Utah are in favor of \na constitutional amendment with respect to the flag, and something like \n60 percent of them consider it a voting issue. That is, they would be \nmore likely to vote against a candidate who voted against the flag \namendment than they would to vote for him. We talked about it, and he \nsaid: What are you going to do? I said: Regardless of the poll numbers, \nI am going to vote against the amendment. He laughed a little and he \nsaid: That is what I thought. I think it will stand you in good stead \nwith your constituents who will respect your courage even if they do \nnot agree with your position.\n  I was grateful for those words of encouragement, and I am happy to \nreport that has happened.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the end of my statement, two \neditorials be printed in the Record from Utah's two newspapers with the \nhighest circulation, the Salt Lake Tribune and the Deseret Morning \nNews.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Salt Lake Tribune editorial makes this comment:\n\n       If respect for something has to be required by law, then it \n     isn't respect. If regard for a symbol of freedom has to be \n     imposed by carving a hole out of our basic charter of rights, \n     then it isn't freedom.\n\n  And it concludes with this sentence:\n\n       The rare act of torching an American flag is one of two \n     things: pointless or meaningful. If it is pointless, the \n     worst it could be called is vandalism, and should be treated \n     as such. If it is meaningful, even full of meaning we don't \n     like, then it is and must remain constitutionally protected \n     expression.\n\n  Now turning to the editorial from the Deseret Morning News, the lead \nparagraph there says:\n\n       Once again, the House of Representatives has passed a \n     constitutional amendment to protect the American flag from \n     desecration. This is an annual event almost as predictable as \n     the swallows returning to Capistrano. So, too, is the \n     Senate's annual ritual of not passing it.\n\n  They conclude with this comment which I am happy to include in the \nrecord because it says nice things about me. We always like comments \nthat do that. It says:\n\n       One of the Senate votes against it belongs to Utah Senator \n     Bob Bennett, who normally agrees with much that Senator Hatch \n     supports. He has said he is unwilling to overturn 200 years \n     of tradition in regard to the First Amendment.\n       He's right. The Constitution is no place for feel-good \n     amendments that do nothing but restrict freedoms.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, I share with you the comment that I have had \nfrom one of my colleagues also, and I will not speak directly for him \nbut associate myself with the line. He said: When my Senate career is \nover, I don't want the most important constitutional vote that I have \ncast to be one that weakens the first amendment.\n\n[[Page S7912]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair. I am glad to be here in the Chamber \nduring the remarks of the Senator from Utah and have him explain for \nall of our benefit his position on important issues such as flag \ndesecration. While I think some of us differ about the means to the \nend, I think the end is important, and that is protecting the symbol of \nour country and the symbol of our freedom. For myself, I think if we \ncan offer protection to a symbol of our country like the bald eagle, \nthen we should offer protection to other symbols of our country \nincluding our flag. But I always consider Senator Bennett to be one of \nthe wise men in the Senate, and I certainly defer to his great judgment \nand wisdom. I appreciate his introduction today, and I look forward to \nstudying it more closely.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Deseret Morning News, Jun. 24, 2005]\n\n                        Dump the Flag Amendment\n\n       Once again, the House of Representatives has passed a \n     constitutional amendment to protect the American flag from \n     desecration. This is an annual event almost as predictable as \n     the swallows returning to Capistrano. So, too, is the \n     Senate's annual ritual of not passing it.\n       This year, there is reason to think the Senate may be \n     inching closer to passing it, and that's a concern.\n       Few things are as reprehensible as watching someone protest \n     the government by burning the flag. Particularly at a time \n     when the nation is involved in a military conflict, it is a \n     stunning affront to brave men and women who are sacrificing \n     their all for freedom.\n       But it would be wrong to rewrite the Constitution to equate \n     a forced honoring of the flag with other freedoms guaranteed \n     by the Bill of Rights. As upsetting as it is, flag burning is \n     a form of expression every bit as much as flag waving. And a \n     nation that attributes part of its greatness to its \n     willingness to tolerate dissent and protest can't afford to \n     stifle this type of speech.\n       Flag burning--an occurrence so rare most Americans would be \n     hard-pressed to pinpoint the last time they saw it--would not \n     disappear because of an amendment. Chances are, it would \n     become more prevalent, out of some misguided attempt to stand \n     on principle. That would harm public morale at an important \n     point in history, and the pride many Americans feel in their \n     ability to tolerate free speech would feel more hollow.\n       Besides, an amendment would raise a number of troubling \n     questions that surely would be tested by 1 the nation's \n     detractors. Would it be illegal to desecrate something that \n     was almost a flag? For instance, if protesters create \n     something that looks like the flag but has less than 50 \n     stars, could they be punished for burning it? And what about \n     hanging the flag upside down or in other ways considered \n     disrespectful? A lot of clothes these days, from hats to T-\n     shirts to blue jeans, contain images of the flag. Would \n     these, too, be covered under the amendment? Would they, \n     themselves, be illegal?\n       Courts would be kept busy for decades answering these and \n     other questions.\n       This is the sixth time the flag amendment has passed the \n     House. Should it pass the Senate, where its sponsor is Utah \n     Sen. Orrin Hatch, it would be almost assured of ratification \n     by the states. All 50 states already have resolutions calling \n     for it to pass.\n       One of the Senate votes against it belongs to Utah Sen. Bob \n     Bennett, who normally agrees with much that Hatch supports. \n     He has said he is unwilling to overturn 200 years of \n     tradition in regard to the First Amendment.\n       He's right. The Constitution is no place for feel-good \n     amendments that do nothing but restrict freedoms.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Salt Lake Tribune, Jun. 24, 2005]\n\n   Flag Desecration: Amendment Would Limit the Rights That the Flag \n                               Symbolizes\n\n       If respect for something has to be required by law, then it \n     isn't respect. If regard for a symbol of freedom has to be \n     imposed by carving a hole out of our basic charter of rights, \n     then it isn't freedom.\n       We sympathize with those whose eyes water, fists clench or \n     guts churn whenever they see someone destroying an American \n     flag. It is generally a juvenile act by someone who just \n     wants to attract attention by shocking the straights.\n       But living in a free nation requires putting up with a lot \n     of attention-getting behavior, especially the kind that \n     neither breaks our arm nor picks our pocket.\n       Thus much praise is due Utah's Sen. Robert Bennett and Rep. \n     Jim Matheson for showing the political maturity to again \n     oppose a proposed constitutional amendment that would allow \n     Congress to ``prohibit the physical desecration of the flag \n     of the United States.''\n       That amendment passed the House Wednesday, with Utah Reps. \n     Chris Cannon and Rob Bishop in the 286-130 majority. It now \n     goes to the Senate, where Utah's Orrin Hatch will again push \n     for its passage.\n       It is sad to see Hatch, who has been showing some wisdom \n     born of soul-searching on issues such as immigration reform \n     and stem-cell research, still clinging to this rote response \n     to a problem that doesn't exist and wouldn't need solving if \n     it did.\n       For one thing, the amendment is represented as a simple \n     patriotic statement. But the fact is that it would, if \n     passed, by two-thirds of the Senate and ratified by three-\n     fourths of the states, become a field day for anti-anything \n     activists, smarty-pants lawyers and activist judges.\n       By one definition of the word, to ``desecrate'' is to \n     defile a sacred object. Sacred is a religious, not a civil, \n     term. Thus it could be argued that it is etymologically \n     impossible to ``desecrate'' a symbol of an earthly nation.\n       The other meaning of the word is basically to treat \n     something with disrespect. That would including burning and \n     soiling. But would it also include the woman who just the \n     other day wore a flag-patterned bikini top to frolic in the \n     Olympic fountain at the Gateway?\n       The rare act of torching an American flag is one of two \n     things: pointless or meaningful. If it is pointless, the \n     worst it could be called is vandalism, and should be treated \n     as such. If it is meaningful, even full of meaning we don't \n     like, then it is, and must remain, constitutionally protected \n     expression.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, as we prepare to celebrate our Nation's \nindependence this weekend, many familiar images come to my mind: \nfireworks, family, celebration, community, parades, apple pie and \neverything American. Above all, I think of the flag on the Fourth of \nJuly.\n  The American flag is a powerful symbol in this country. It represents \nmany things to many Americans--our Nation, our independence, our \nprinciples, and our sacrifices, among other things. To some of our \nbrave servicemen and women who fought for this country, the flag \nsymbolizes our freedom. To others, including parents of soldiers killed \nin battle, the flag is symbolic of all Americans who gave their lives \nin all wars.\n  I have the utmost respect for the flag as a symbol of our Nation and \nour freedom, and abhor acts of desecration against it. Burning a flag, \nor otherwise dishonoring it, is repugnant to me, my colleagues, and the \nbrave men and women who serve and have served in the Armed Forces, as \nwell as the vast majority of American citizens. We must protect the \nflag from the acts of those few who would dishonor it.\n  That is why I am joining Senator Bennett today in introducing the \nFlag Protection Act of 2005, to criminalize flag desecration. While \nother flag protection statutes have been found to be unconstitutional, \nthis bill was carefully crafted to avoid the problems of previous \nstatutes. In fact, the American Law Division of the Congressional \nResearch Service has studied it and believes it would pass \nConstitutional muster.\n  It is my hope that we can act quickly to protect the flag. This bill \nwill accomplish that goal, and I ask my colleagues to give it serious \nconsideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Martinez, and Mr. \n        Allen):\n  S. 1372. A bill to provide for the accuracy of television ratings \nservices, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President. I rise to introduce the FAIR Ratings bill. \nI am pleased to be joined in introducing this bill by my colleagues, \nSenators Martinez, Snowe, and Allen.\n  As a former broadcaster, I understand that when TV stations plan \ntheir programming, they and their advertisers must rely on the \ninformation provided by commercial TV ratings companies. And it is \nvital that this data be as accurate, fair, and inclusive as possible, \nbecause TV ratings ultimately determine what programming ends up on the \nair. They also help broadcasters to meet their public interest \nobligations. For these reasons, I feel that it is very much in the \npublic interest for TV ratings to be fair, accurate, and as fully \nrepresentative of the population as possible.\n  The dominant company that provides TV ratings, and has done so for \nthe last 50 years, is Nielsen Media Research. Nielsen is a great \ncompany and a great American institution--no doubt about it. The \ninnovation that Nielsen showed in its early years, and continues to \nshow today in other ways, show that its leading role in the field is \nwell-deserved.\n\n[[Page S7913]]\n\n  Our friends from Nielsen may have already spoken to many of you about \nthis bill, and let me assure you up front that this is not a bill \n``against'' Nielsen. It would apply to any other company or new \ntechnology whose ratings service determines what we see on TV. But \nNielsen will definitely be the most affected party if the bill passes, \nso let me characterize this instead as a bill to keep Nielsen honest \nand accountable to its customers, and to the public.\n  Because Nielsen today is pretty close to being a monopoly, any way \nyou look at it. A private, unregulated monopoly provider of an \nessential public service. And as basic economics and everyday practice \nshow, monopolies have the ability to abuse their power, because they \nare not constrained by competition--there is nowhere else for a TV \nstation or advertiser to go if they don't like what they get or how \nthey are treated. Barriers to entry are pretty high in that business--\nit is not simple or cheap to set up a nationwide TV ratings service.\n  And that monopoly power has been abused in the past. Forty years ago \nor so, there were a couple of nationwide scandals about TV ratings. I \nremember that well, and some of you may even have seen the movie. \nPayola and game shows. At that time, Nielsen's service was found to be \nmixed up with all that in some way, and was reporting flawed data.\n  And Congress got involved. The Senate had hearings for many months, \nand at the end of it, there was a report--the Harris Commission \nreport--that called for the creation of an independent, industry-run, \nprivate oversight body to audit and accredit Nielsen's ratings \nmeasurement systems for accuracy.\n  That body was created in 1964 and is now called the Media Rating \nCouncil. It continues to audit and accredit TV ratings systems to this \nday, consulting closely with Nielsen and its own members, who are the \nmain consumers of TV ratings data. It has long experience and great \nexpertise at conducting audits of ratings data for quality and \naccuracy. And it has broad industry support and participation.\n  The Media Rating Council's role today, and its relationship with \nNielsen, or any other TV rating company that may come to equal \nprominence in the future, are what concern me and moved me to introduce \nthis bill.\n  Last year, Nielsen introduced a new technology called Local People \nMeters, which was designed to measure viewer behavior in a more \naccurate way and to replace the old paper diaries. This system was \nsimilar to a technology that Nielsen had introduced in the late 1980s. \nIn both cases, there were big changes in the TV ratings when Nielsen \nmoved from the old system to the new one. To the extent that these \nchanges simply captured viewer preferences more accurately, this was \ngood for the industry and for TV viewers in general. There is no public \ninterest in which channel gets higher or lower ratings, so long as the \nmeasurement is accurate.\n\n  But in certain cases, in four of our largest cities last year, it was \nnot. It turns out that, since the meters operate differently from the \ndiary system, there were flaws in the measurement of the underlying \ndata by demographic group, due to higher ``fault rates'' among certain \ngroups: African-Americans, Hispanics, younger viewers, larger families, \nand certain others.\n  And here is where the Media Rating Council came in. They had audited \nthe data and examined the people meter system in certain cities in \nadvance, in a trial period, and identified these problems. And they \ntold Nielsen about them in advance. And they told Nielsen that the \nundercounting should be fixed before it sold the data from this system \ncommercially.\n  And what did Nielsen do? It effectively ignored the MRC's prior \nfindings. It said it would work to fix the system while it was already \n``live'' and producing real TV ratings--with those flaws--and would \ncontinue to roll out the new technology in other cities before the \nproblems were fixed in the old ones.\n  I chaired a hearing last summer in the Commerce Committee on this \nissue, and have continued to monitor the situation closely since then. \nAt that hearing, Nielsen indicated that it would have the problems \nfixed within a few weeks. Now, a year later, they are still not fixed, \ndespite clear instructions from the Media Rating Council. And while \nNielsen has been cooperative with customers and critics--to its \ncredit--the fundamental issue of oversight enforcement has not been \nresolved.\n  Now I agree with Nielsen, and most others do too, that the people \nmeters, when implemented correctly, produce better numbers than the \ndiaries. And we should be glad that Nielsen is devoting the resources \nto developing new technologies, as it should. The diary system, after \nall, hasn't really changed much since the 1950s.\n  But it is also clear that Nielsen should not have moved ahead without \nthe full prior approval of the Media Rating Council, which is the \nexpert organization set up--at the behest of Congress--to ensure TV \nratings accuracy. It was this action, more than any of the other \ndetails of the controversy, that indicated to me that the oversight \nsystem was missing some essential teeth.\n  So my bill simply makes prior Media Rating Council accreditation for \nTV ratings systems mandatory, not voluntary, as it is today. It \nbackstops a system that has been in place for 40 years.\n  It is not a bill about the Local People Meter system. It is not a \nbill about the ratings of one broadcast company or any group of \ncompanies. It is not even a bill about Nielsen, although it will \nclearly be the most affected company.\n  Further, there is no government role whatsoever envisioned in this \nbill. It does not create any new government standards, regulation, or \nbureaucracy: the oversight will be carried out by a private, self-\ngoverning, industry body that has already been operating for 40 years.\n  So, I hope we can all agree that accurate TV ratings are in the \npublic interest. I hope we can all agree that private industry \noversight, by the entity set up by Congress 40 years ago, is the best \nway to ensure that. And if we can, I hope all of my colleagues in the \nSenate will support this bill, on behalf of all television viewers \nthroughout the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/01/senate-section/article/S7913-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7913-S7914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 186--AFFIRMING THE IMPORTANCE OF A NATIONAL WEEKEND \n OF PRAYER FOR THE VICTIMS OF GENOCIDE AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY IN \n  DARFUR, SUDAN, AND EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT JULY 15 \n THROUGH JULY 17, 2005, SHOULD BE DESIGNATED AS A NATIONAL WEEKEND OF \n             PRAYER AND REFLECTION FOR THE PEOPLE OF DARFUR\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Coburn, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \nDurbin, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Salazar) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. McCONNELL (for Mr. Stevens (for himself and Mr. Inouye)) \nproposed an amendment to the bill S. 50, to authorize and strengthen \nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's tsunami \ndetection, forecast, warning, and mitigation program, and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Tsunami Preparedness Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Tsunami are a series of large waves of long wavelength \n     created by the displacement of water by violent undersea \n     disturbances such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, \n     landslides, explosions, and the impact of cosmic bodies.\n       (2) Tsunami have caused, and can cause in the future, \n     enormous loss of human life, injury, destruction of property, \n     and economic and social disruption in coastal and island \n     communities.\n       (3) While 85 percent of tsunami occur in the Pacific Ocean, \n     and coastal and island communities in this region are the \n     most vulnerable to the destructive results, tsunami can occur \n     at any point in any ocean or related body of water where \n     there are earthquakes, volcanoes, or any other activity that \n     displaces a large volume of water.\n       (4) A number of States and territories are subject to the \n     threat of tsunamis, including Alaska, California, Hawaii, \n     Oregon, Washington, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. \n     Virgin Islands.\n       (5) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is \n     responsible for maintaining a tsunami detection and warning \n     system for the Nation, issuing warnings to United States \n     communities at risk from tsunami, and preparing those \n     communities to respond appropriately, through--\n       (A) the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Ewa Beach, \n     Hawaii, which serves as a warning center for Hawaii, all \n     other United States assets in the Pacific, and Puerto Rico;\n       (B) the Alaska/West Coast Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, \n     Alaska, which is responsible for issuing warnings for Alaska, \n     British Columbia, California, Oregon, and Washington;\n       (C) the Federal-State national tsunami hazard mitigation \n     program;\n       (D) a tsunami research and assessment program, including \n     programs conducted by the Pacific Marine Environmental \n     Laboratory;\n       (E) the TsunamiReady Program, which educates and prepares \n     communities for survival before and during a tsunami;\n       (F) an archive of historical tsunami data, held at the \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National \n     Geophysical Data Center; and\n       (G) other related programs, including those operated in \n     coordination with academic institutions.\n       (6) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n     also represents the United States as a member of the \n     International Coordination Group for the Tsunami Warning \n     System in the Pacific, administered by the Intergovernmental \n     Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO, for which the Pacific \n     Tsunami Warning Center acts as the operational center and \n     shares seismic and water level information with 26 member \n     states, and maintains UNESCO's International Tsunami \n     Information Center, in Honolulu, Hawaii, which provides \n     technical and educational assistance to member states.\n       (7) The Tsunami Warning Centers receive seismographic \n     information from the Global Seismic Network, an international \n     system of earthquake monitoring stations, from the United \n     States Geological Survey National Earthquake Information \n     Center, the Alaska Earthquake Information Center, and \n     cooperative regional seismic networks, and use these data to \n     issue tsunami warnings and integrate the information with \n     data from their own tidal and deep ocean monitoring stations, \n     to cancel or verify the existence of a damaging tsunami. \n     Warnings are disseminated by the National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration to State emergency operation \n     centers.\n       (8) Current gaps in the International Tsunami Warning \n     System, such as the lack of regional warning systems in the \n     Indian Ocean, the southwest Pacific Ocean, Central and South \n     America, the Mediterranean Sea, and Caribbean, pose risks for \n     coastal and island communities.\n       (9) The tragic and extreme loss of life experienced by \n     countries in the Indian Ocean following the magnitude 9.0 \n     earthquake and resulting tsunami in that region on December \n     26, 2004, illustrates the destructive consequences which can \n     occur in the absence of an effective tsunami warning and \n     notification system.\n       (10) An effective tsunami warning and notification system \n     is part of a multi-hazard disaster warning and preparedness \n     program and requires real-time seismic, sea level, and \n     oceanographic data, high-speed data analysis capabilities, a \n     high-speed tsunami warning and notification system, a \n     sustained program of education and risk assessment to develop \n     response strategies, and an established local infrastructure \n     for timely and effective dissemination of warnings to \n     activate evacuation of tsunami hazard zones.\n       (11) The Tsunami Warning System for the Pacific is a model \n     for other regions of the world to adopt, and can be expanded \n     and modernized to increase detection, forecast, and warning \n     capabilities for vulnerable states and territories, reduce \n     the incidence of costly false alarms, improve reliability of \n     measurement and assessment technology, and increase community \n     preparedness.\n       (12) Tsunami warning and preparedness capability can be \n     developed in other vulnerable areas of the world, such as the \n     Indian Ocean, by identifying tsunami hazard zones, educating \n     populations, developing alert and notification \n     infrastructure, and by deploying near real-time tsunami \n     detection sensors and gauges, establishing hazard \n     notification and warning networks, expanding global \n     monitoring of seismic activity, encouraging the increased \n     exchange of seismic and tidal data between nations, and \n     improving international coordination when a tsunami is \n     detected.\n       (13) UNESCO has recognized the need to establish tsunami \n     warning systems for regions beyond the Pacific Basin that are \n     vulnerable to tsunami, including the Indian Ocean, and has \n     convened a working group to lead an effort to expand the \n     International Tsunami Warning System in the Pacific to such \n     vulnerable regions.\n       (14) The international community and all vulnerable nations \n     should take coordinated efforts to establish and participate \n     in regional tsunami warning systems and other hazard warnings \n     systems developed to meet the goals of the United Nations \n     International Strategy for Disaster Reduction.\n       (15) On February 16, 2005, the United States, together with \n     53 other Nations participating in the Third Earth Observation \n     Summit in Brussels, Belgium, adopted a 10-year implementation \n     plan as the basis for establishing the Global Earth \n     Observation System of Systems.\n       (16) The Global Earth Observation System of Systems will \n     consist of existing and future earth observation systems, \n     including the United States tsunami detection and warning \n     system.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to improve tsunami detection, forecast, warnings, \n     notification, preparedness, and mitigation in order to \n     protect life and property both in the United States and \n     elsewhere in the world;\n       (2) to improve and modernize the existing Pacific Tsunami \n     Warning System to increase coverage, reduce false alarms and \n     increase accuracy of forecasts and warnings, and expand \n     detection and warning systems to include other vulnerable \n     States and United States territories, including the \n     Caribbean/Atlantic/Gulf region;\n       (3) to increase and accelerate mapping, modeling, research, \n     assessment, education, and outreach efforts in order to \n     improve\n\n[[Page S7920]]\n\n     forecasting, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery \n     of tsunami and related coastal hazards;\n       (4) to provide technical and other assistance to speed \n     international efforts to establish regional tsunami warning \n     systems in vulnerable areas worldwide, including the Indian \n     Ocean; and\n       (5) to improve Federal, State, and international \n     coordination for tsunami and other coastal hazard warnings \n     and preparedness.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Marine Debris Research \n     Prevention and Reduction Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The oceans, which comprise nearly three quarters of the \n     Earth's surface, are an important source of food and provide \n     a wealth of other natural products that are important to the \n     economy of the United States and the world.\n       (2) Ocean and coastal areas are regions of remarkably high \n     biological productivity, are\n\n[[Page S7927]]\n\n     of considerable importance for a variety of recreational and \n     commercial activities, and provide a vital means of \n     transportation.\n       (3) Ocean and coastal resources are limited and susceptible \n     to change as a direct and indirect result of human \n     activities, and such changes can impact the ability of the \n     ocean to provide the benefits upon which the Nation depends.\n       (4) Marine debris, including plastics, derelict fishing \n     gear, and a wide variety of other objects, has a harmful and \n     persistent effect on marine flora and fauna and can have \n     adverse impacts on human health.\n       (5) Marine debris is also a hazard to navigation, putting \n     mariners and rescuers, their vessels, and consequently the \n     marine environment at risk, and can cause economic loss due \n     to entanglement of vessel systems.\n       (6) Modern plastic materials persist for decades in the \n     marine environment and therefore pose the greatest potential \n     for long-term damage to the marine environment.\n       (7) Insufficient knowledge and data on the source, \n     movement, and effects of plastics and other marine debris in \n     marine ecosystems has hampered efforts to develop effective \n     approaches for addressing marine debris.\n       (8) Lack of resources, inadequate attention to this issue, \n     and poor coordination at the Federal level has undermined the \n     development and implementation of a Federal program to \n     address marine debris, both domestically and internationally.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish programs within the National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration and the United States Coast Guard \n     to help identify, determine sources of, assess, reduce, and \n     prevent marine debris and its adverse impacts on the marine \n     environment and navigation safety, in coordination with other \n     Federal and non-Federal entities;\n       (2) to re-establish the Inter-agency Marine Debris \n     Coordinating Committee to ensure a coordinated government \n     response across Federal agencies;\n       (3) to develop a Federal information clearinghouse to \n     enable researchers to study the sources, scale and impact of \n     marine debris more efficiently; and\n       (4) to take appropriate action in the international \n     community to prevent marine debris and reduce concentrations \n     of existing debris on a global scale.\n\n     SEC. 3. NOAA MARINE DEBRIS PREVENTION AND REMOVAL PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Program.--There is established, within \n     the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a Marine \n     Debris Prevention and Removal Program to reduce and prevent \n     the occurrence and adverse impacts of marine debris on the \n     marine environment and navigation safety.\n       (b) Program Components.--Through the Marine Debris \n     Prevention and Removal Program, the Administrator shall carry \n     out the following activities:\n       (1) Mapping, identification, impact assessment, removal, \n     and prevention.--The Administrator shall, in consultation \n     with relevant Federal agencies, undertake marine debris \n     mapping, identification, impact assessment, prevention, \n     and removal efforts, with a focus on marine debris posing \n     a threat to living marine resources (particularly \n     endangered or protected species) and navigation safety, \n     including--\n       (A) the establishment of a process, building on existing \n     information sources maintained by Federal agencies such as \n     the Environmental Protection Agency and the Coast Guard, for \n     cataloguing and maintaining an inventory of marine debris and \n     its impacts found in the United States navigable waters and \n     the United States exclusive economic zone, including \n     location, material, size, age, and origin, and impacts on \n     habitat, living marine resources, human health, and \n     navigation safety;\n       (B) measures to identify the origin, location, and \n     projected movement of marine debris within the United States \n     navigable waters, the United States exclusive economic \n     zone, and the high seas, including the use of \n     oceanographic, atmospheric, satellite, and remote sensing \n     data; and\n       (C) development and implementation of strategies, methods, \n     priorities, and a plan for preventing and removing marine \n     debris from United States navigable waters and within the \n     United States exclusive economic zone, including development \n     of local or regional protocols for removal of derelict \n     fishing gear.\n       (2) Reducing and preventing loss of gear.--The \n     Administrator shall improve efforts and actively seek to \n     prevent and reduce fishing gear losses, as well as to reduce \n     adverse impacts of such gear on living marine resources and \n     navigation safety, including--\n       (A) research and development of alternatives to gear posing \n     threats to the marine environment, and methods for marking \n     gear used in specific fisheries to enhance the tracking, \n     recovery, and identification of lost and discarded gear; and\n       (B) development of voluntary or mandatory measures to \n     reduce the loss and discard of fishing gear, and to aid its \n     recovery, such as incentive programs, reporting loss and \n     recovery of gear, observer programs, toll-free reporting \n     hotlines, computer-based notification forms, and providing \n     adequate and free disposal recepticals at ports.\n       (3) Outreach.--The Administrator shall undertake outreach \n     and education of the public and other stakeholders, such as \n     the fishing industry, fishing gear manufacturers, and other \n     marine-dependent industries, on sources of marine debris, \n     threats associated with marine debris and approaches to \n     identify, determine sources of, assess, reduce, and prevent \n     marine debris and its adverse impacts on the marine \n     environment and navigational safety. Including outreach and \n     education activities through public-private initiatives. The \n     Administrator shall coordinate outreach and education \n     activities under this paragraph with any outreach programs \n     conducted under section 2204 of the Marine Plastic Pollution \n     Research and Control Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. 1915).\n       (c) Grants.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator shall provide financial \n     assistance, in the form of grants, through the Marine Debris \n     Prevention and Removal Program for projects to accomplish the \n     purposes of this Act.\n       (2) 50 percent matching requirement.--\n       (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (B), \n     Federal funds for any project under this section may not \n     exceed 50 percent of the total cost of such project. For \n     purposes of this subparagraph, the non-Federal share of \n     project costs may be provided by in-kind contributions and \n     other noncash support.\n       (B) Waiver.--The Administrator may waive all or part of the \n     matching requirement under subparagraph (A) if the \n     Administrator determines that no reasonable means are \n     available through which applicants can meet the matching \n     requirement and the probable benefit of such project \n     outweighs the public interest in such matching requirement.\n       (3) Amounts paid and services rendered under consent.--\n       (A) Consent decrees and orders.--The non-Federal share of \n     the cost of a project carried out under this Act may include \n     money paid pursuant to, or the value of any in-kind service \n     performed under, an administrative order on consent or \n     judicial consent decree that will remove or prevent marine \n     debris.\n       (B) Other decrees and orders.--The non-Federal share of the \n     cost of a project carried out under this Act may not include \n     any money paid pursuant to, or the value of any in-kind \n     service performed under, any other administrative order or \n     court order.\n       (4) Eligibility.--Any natural resource management authority \n     of a State, Federal or other government authority whose \n     activities directly or indirectly affect research or \n     regulation of marine debris, and any educational or \n     nongovernmental institutions with demonstrated expertise in a \n     field related to marine debris, are eligible to submit to the \n     Administrator a marine debris proposal under the grant \n     program.\n       (5) Grant criteria and guidelines.--Within 180 days after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall \n     promulgate necessary guidelines for implementation of the \n     grant program, including development of criteria and \n     priorities for grants.

I rise today in support of S. 362, the Marine Debris \nResearch, Prevention, and Reduction Act, legislation I introduced with \nSenator Stevens, with the cosponsorship of Senators Cantwell, Snowe, \nLautenberg, Kerry, Sarbanes, Akaka, and Murray.\n  This bill, which I am proud to say passed the Senate unanimously in \nthe 108th Congress, focuses on one particular impact that goes \nunnoticed by many and has been largely ignored by the global community: \nmarine debris. This problem is so important, and so pervasive, that it \nmerited an entire chapter of the 2004 Report of the U.S. Commission on \nOcean Policy.\n  While marine debris includes conventional ``trash,'' it also includes \na vast array of additional materials that may find their way to sea, \nsuch as discarded or lost fishing gear, cargo washed overboard, and \nabandoned equipment from our commercial fleets. Marine debris is not \nonly unsightly and dangerous to navigation, but it is also deadly to \nsea creatures, which may die entangled in a discarded fishing net or \nafter ingesting plastic items such as lighters and toys.\n  While the problem is vast, it is also reversible when given \nsufficient emphasis, coordination, and funding. The bill being \nconsidered by the full Senate today aims to meet this challenge by \nadopting the measures recommended by both the Ocean Commission and the \n2000 International Marine Debris Conference to help remove manmade \nmarine debris from the list of ocean threats. The bill has strong \nsupport from the Bush administration, environmental groups, and others \nwith an interest in the marine debris problem, including the Ocean \nConservancy and the Northwest Straits Commission.\n  Specifically, our legislation would establish a Marine Debris \nPrevention and Removal Program within the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, NOAA, direct the U.S. Coast Guard to \nimprove enforcement of laws designed to prevent ship-based pollution \nfrom plastics and other garbage, reinvigorate an interagency committee \non marine debris, and improve our research and information on marine \ndebris sources, threats, and prevention. The bill would authorize $10 \nmillion in funding for the NOAA program, and $5 million in funding for \nthe Coast Guard program. I am pleased to say that congressional action \nlast year provided $5 million in appropriated funding to NOAA \nspecifically toward this problem, and the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee has recommended increasing this amount to $6.4 million in \nfiscal year 2006. We challenge the administration to likewise increase \nfunding for this initiative in coming years.\n\n  In Hawaii, the impacts of marine debris are more visible because of \nthe convergence caused by the North Pacific Tropical High. Atmospheric \nforces cause ocean surface currents to converge on Hawaii, bringing \nwith them the vast amount of debris floating throughout the Pacific. \nSince 1996, a total of 484 tons of debris have been removed from coral \nreefs in the northwestern Hawaiian Islands, which is also home to many \nendangered marine species. In 2004 alone, the program removed over 125 \ntons of debris. However, because more debris arrives daily, the job is \nfar from done.\n  I am pleased that the coordinated approach taken to address the \nthreats posed by marine debris in the northwestern Hawaiian Islands has \nprovided a model for the nation. We have learned that our best path to \nsuccess lies in partnering with one another to share resources, and it \nis my hope that others may adapt our project to their own shores \nthrough the partnership and funding opportunities set forth in this \nbill.\n  We must also bear in mind that no matter how zealously we reform our \npractices, the ultimate solution lies in international cooperation. The \noceans connect the coastal nations of the world, and we must work \ntogether to reduce this increasing threat to our seas and shores. The \nMarine Debris Research, Prevention, and Reduction Act will provide the \nUnited States with the tools to develop effective marine debris \nprevention and removal programs on a worldwide basis, including \nreporting and information requirements that will assist in the creation \nof an international marine debris database.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting \nenactment of the Marine Debris Research, Prevention, and Reduction Act. \nThis bill will provide the United States with the programs and \nresources necessary to protect our most valuable resources, our oceans.\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1099) was agreed to, as follows:\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The bill (S. 362), as amended, was read the third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/01/senate-section/article/S7929-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7929-S7930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL OCEAN EXPLORATION PROGRAM ACT\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill (S. 39) to establish a \ncoordinated national ocean exploration program within the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1100\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n  The amendment (No. 1100) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The bill (S. 39), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I rise today in support of S. 39, the National Ocean \nExploration Program Act. As a cosponsor of S. 39, I join my good friend \nChairman, Stevens in supporting an enhanced national effort to explore \nour oceans, as was strongly recommended by the U.S. Commission on Ocean \nPolicy. The oceans cover nearly three-quarters of the Earth's surface \nand contain a diversity of life which greatly exceeds that found in \nterrestrial systems, and yet our oceans remain poorly understood. I \ntherefore commend my friend, Chairman Stevens, for his initiative in \nthis area and thank Senators Snowe, Dodd, Kerry, Lautenberg, Cantwell, \nand Reed for their support in cosponsoring this legislation.\n  Despite the importance of the oceans in human history, in regulating \nclimate change, guaranteeing food security, providing energy resources, \nand enabling worldwide commerce, the U.S. spends only 3.5 percent of \nits research budget on ocean science, and far less on ocean \nexploration. Approximately 95 percent of the ocean floor remains \nunexplored. It is hard to understand our inattention to this exciting \narea of research given the opportunity ocean exploration provides for \ndiscovering new habitats, species, artifacts, and resources. Ocean \nexploration expeditions can provide images of ancient human artifacts, \nrare or previously undiscovered species, and exciting new ecosystems. \nThese images ignite the imagination of the general public and engage \nthem in marine science and conservation.\n  This bill is a reflection of Senator Stevens' and my long history of \nworking together to increase the funding for ocean exploration, as well \nas to secure a dedicated vessel to conduct these activities in U.S. \nwaters and worldwide. To accomplish these goals our bill would \nestablish a national ocean exploration program within the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration that, in coordination with the \nNational Science Foundation, would conduct interdisciplinary ocean \nexploration voyages and give priority attention to deep ocean regions.\n  To facilitate the aims of the exploration program, the bill would \nalso establish a Federal exploration technology and infrastructure task \nforce. This task force would be charged with strengthening interagency \ncoordination for the purposes of developing and\n\n[[Page S7930]]\n\nfacilitating the transfer of new exploration technologies, \ncommunication infrastructure and data management systems to the \nexploration program. Long-term funding levels are also dedicated for \nocean exploration in the bill.\n  I hope that my colleagues will work with us today to ensure the swift \npassage of the National Ocean Exploration Program Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/01/senate-section/article/S7930-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7930-S7936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TSUNAMI PREPAREDNESS ACT\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill (S. 50) to authorize and \nstrengthen the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's \ntsunami detection, forecast, warning, and mitigation program, and for \nother purposes, which had been reported from the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation, with an amendment.\n  (Strike the part shown in black brackets and insert the part shown in \nitalic.)\n\n                                 S. 50\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     [SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       [This Act may be cited as the ``Tsunami Preparedness Act''.\n\n     [SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       [(a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       [(1) Tsunami are a series of large waves of long wavelength \n     created by the displacement of water by violent undersea \n     disturbances such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, \n     landslides, explosions, and the impact of cosmic bodies.\n       [(2) Tsunami have caused, and can cause in the future, \n     enormous loss of human life, injury, destruction of property, \n     and economic and social disruption in coastal and island \n     communities.\n       [(3) While 85 percent of tsunami occur in the Pacific \n     Ocean, and coastal and island communities in this region are \n     the most vulnerable to the destructive results, tsunami can \n     occur at any point in any ocean or related body of water \n     where there are earthquakes, volcanoes, or any other activity \n     that displaces a large volume of water.\n       [(4) A number of States and territories are subject to the \n     threat of tsunamis, including Alaska, California, Hawaii, \n     Oregon, Washington, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. \n     Virgin Islands.\n       [(5) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is \n     responsible for maintaining a tsunami detection and warning \n     system for the Nation, issuing warnings to United States \n     communities at risk from tsunami, and preparing those \n     communities to respond appropriately, through--\n       [(A) the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Ewa Beach, \n     Hawaii, which serves as a warning center for Hawaii, all \n     other United States assets in the Pacific, and Puerto Rico;\n       [(B) the Alaska/West Coast Tsunami Warning Center in \n     Palmer, Alaska, which is responsible for issuing warnings for \n     Alaska, British Columbia, California, Oregon, and Washington;\n       [(C) the Federal-State national tsunami hazard mitigation \n     program;\n       [(D) a tsunami research and assessment program, including \n     programs conducted by the Pacific Marine Environmental \n     Laboratory;\n       [(E) the TsunamiReady Program, which educates and prepares \n     communities for survival before and during a tsunami; and\n       [(F) other related programs.\n       [(6) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n     also represents the United States as a member of the \n     International Coordination Group for the Tsunami Warning \n     System in the Pacific, administered by the Intergovernmental \n     Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO, for which the Pacific \n     Tsunami Warning Center acts as the operational center and \n     shares seismic and water level information with 26 member \n     states, and maintains UNESCO's International Tsunami \n     Information Center, in Honolulu, Hawaii, which provides \n     technical and educational assistance to member states.\n       [(7) The Tsunami Warning Centers receive seismographic \n     information from the Global Seismic Network, an international \n     system of earthquake monitoring stations, from the United \n     States Geological Survey National Earthquake Information \n     Center, and from cooperative regional seismic networks, and \n     use these data to issue tsunami warnings and integrate the \n     information with data from their own tidal and deep ocean \n     monitoring stations, to cancel or verify the existence of a \n     damaging tsunami. Warnings are disseminated by the National \n     Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to State emergency \n     operation centers.\n       [(8) Current gaps in the International Tsunami Warning \n     System, such as the lack of regional warning systems in the \n     Indian Ocean, the southwest Pacific Ocean, Central and South \n     America, the Mediterranean Sea, and Caribbean, pose risks for \n     coastal and island communities.\n       [(9) The tragic and extreme loss of life experienced by \n     countries in the Indian Ocean following the magnitude 9.0 \n     earthquake and resulting tsunami in that region on December \n     26, 2004, illustrates the destructive consequences which can \n     occur in the absence of an effective tsunami warning and \n     notification system.\n       [(10) An effective tsunami warning and notification system \n     is part of a multi-hazard disaster warning and preparedness \n     program and requires near real-time seismic, sea level, and \n     oceanographic data, high-speed data analysis capabilities, a \n     high-speed tsunami warning communication system, a sustained \n     program of education and risk assessment, and an established \n     local communications infrastructure for timely and effective \n     dissemination of warnings to activate evacuation of tsunami \n     hazard zones.\n       [(11) The Tsunami Warning System for the Pacific is a model \n     for other regions of the world to adopt, and can be expanded \n     and modernized to increase detection, forecast, and \n     warning capabilities for vulnerable states and \n     territories, reduce the incidence of costly false alarms, \n     improve reliability of measurement and assessment \n     technology, and increase community preparedness.\n       [(12) Tsunami warning and preparedness capability can be \n     developed in other vulnerable areas of the world, such as the \n     Indian Ocean, by identifying tsunami hazard zones, educating \n     populations, developing alert and notification communications \n     infrastructure, and by deploying near real-time tsunami \n     detection sensors and gauges, establishing hazard \n     communication and warning networks, expanding global \n     monitoring of seismic activity, encouraging the increased \n     exchange of seismic and tidal data between nations, and \n     improving international coordination when a tsunami is \n     detected.\n       [(13) UNESCO has recognized the need to establish tsunami \n     warning systems for regions beyond the Pacific Basin that are \n     vulnerable to tsunams, including the Indian Ocean, and has \n     convened a working group to lead an effort to expand the \n     International Tsunami Warning System in the Pacific to such \n     vulnerable regions.\n       [(14) The international community and all vulnerable \n     nations should take coordinated efforts to establish and \n     participate in regional tsunami warning systems and other \n     hazard warnings systems developed to meet the goals of the \n     United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction.\n       [(b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       [(1) to improve tsunami detection, forecast, warnings, \n     notification, preparedness, and mitigation in order to \n     protect life and property both in the United States and \n     elsewhere in the world;\n       [(2) to improve and modernize the existing Pacific Tsunami \n     Warning System to increase coverage, reduce false alarms and \n     increase accuracy of forecasts and warnings, and expand \n     detection and warning systems to include other vulnerable \n     States and United States territories, including the \n     Caribbean/Atlantic/Gulf region;\n       [(3) to increase and accelerate mapping, modeling, \n     research, assessment, education, and outreach efforts in \n     order to improve forecasting, preparedness, mitigation, \n     response, and recovery of tsunami and related coastal \n     hazards;\n       [(4) to provide technical and other assistance to speed \n     international efforts to establish regional tsunami warning \n     systems in vulnerable areas worldwide, including the Indian \n     Ocean; and\n       [(5) to improve Federal, State, and international \n     coordination for tsunami and other coastal hazard warnings \n     and preparedness.\n\n     [SEC. 3. TSUNAMI DETECTION AND WARNING SYSTEM.\n\n       [(a) In General.--The Administrator of the National Oceanic \n     and Atmospheric Administration shall operate regional tsunami \n     detection and warning systems for the Pacific Ocean region \n     and for the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico \n     region that will provide maximum detection capability for \n     United States coastal tsunami.\n       [(b) System Requirements.--\n       [(1) Pacific system.--The Pacific tsunami warning system \n     shall cover the entire Pacific Ocean area, including the \n     Western Pacific, the Central Pacific, the North Pacific, the \n     South Pacific, and the East Pacific and Arctic areas.\n       [(2) Atlantic, caribbean, and gulf of mexico system.--The \n     Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf system shall cover areas of the \n     Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico that \n     the Administrator determines--\n       [(A) to be geologically active, or to have significant \n     potential for geological activity;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Tsunami Preparedness Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Tsunami are a series of large waves of long wavelength \n     created by the displacement of water by violent undersea \n     disturbances such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, \n     landslides, explosions, and the impact of cosmic bodies.\n       (2) Tsunami have caused, and can cause in the future, \n     enormous loss of human life, injury, destruction of property, \n     and economic and social disruption in coastal and island \n     communities.\n       (3) While 85 percent of tsunami occur in the Pacific Ocean, \n     and coastal and island communities in this region are the \n     most vulnerable to the destructive results, tsunami can occur \n     at any point in any ocean or related body of water where \n     there are earthquakes, volcanoes, or any other activity that \n     displaces a large volume of water.\n       (4) A number of States and territories are subject to the \n     threat of tsunamis, including Alaska, California, Hawaii, \n     Oregon, Washington, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. \n     Virgin Islands.\n       (5) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is \n     responsible for maintaining a tsunami detection and warning \n     system for the Nation, issuing warnings to United States \n     communities at risk from tsunami, and preparing those \n     communities to respond appropriately, through--\n       (A) the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Ewa Beach, \n     Hawaii, which serves as a warning center for Hawaii, all \n     other United States assets in the Pacific, and Puerto Rico;\n       (B) the Alaska/West Coast Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, \n     Alaska, which is responsible for issuing warnings for Alaska, \n     British Columbia, California, Oregon, and Washington;\n       (C) the Federal-State national tsunami hazard mitigation \n     program;\n       (D) a tsunami research and assessment program, including \n     programs conducted by the Pacific Marine Environmental \n     Laboratory;\n       (E) the TsunamiReady Program, which educates and prepares \n     communities for survival before and during a tsunami;\n       (F) an archive of historical tsunami data, held at the \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National \n     Geophysical Data Center; and\n       (G) other related programs, including those operated in \n     coordination with academic institutions.\n       (6) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n     also represents the United States as a member of the \n     International Coordination Group for the Tsunami Warning \n     System in the Pacific, administered by the Intergovernmental \n     Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO, for which the Pacific \n     Tsunami Warning Center acts as the operational center and \n     shares seismic and water level information with 26 member \n     states, and maintains UNESCO's International Tsunami \n     Information Center, in Honolulu, Hawaii, which provides \n     technical and educational assistance to member states.\n       (7) The Tsunami Warning Centers receive seismographic \n     information from the Global Seismic Network, an international \n     system of earthquake monitoring stations, from the United \n     States Geological Survey National Earthquake Information \n     Center, the Alaska Earthquake Information Center, and \n     cooperative regional seismic networks, and use these data to \n     issue tsunami warnings and integrate the information with \n     data from their own tidal and deep ocean monitoring stations, \n     to cancel or verify the existence of a damaging tsunami. \n     Warnings are disseminated by the National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration to State emergency operation \n     centers.\n       (8) Current gaps in the International Tsunami Warning \n     System, such as the lack of regional warning systems in the \n     Indian Ocean, the southwest Pacific Ocean, Central and South \n     America, the Mediterranean Sea, and Caribbean, pose risks for \n     coastal and island communities.\n       (9) The tragic and extreme loss of life experienced by \n     countries in the Indian Ocean following the magnitude 9.0 \n     earthquake and resulting tsunami in that region on December \n     26, 2004, illustrates the destructive consequences which can \n     occur in the absence of an effective tsunami warning and \n     notification system.\n       (10) An effective tsunami warning and notification system \n     is part of a multi-hazard disaster warning and preparedness \n     program and requires real-time seismic, sea level, and \n     oceanographic data, high-speed data analysis capabilities, a \n     high-speed tsunami warning communication system, a sustained \n     program of education and risk assessment to develop response \n     strategies, and an established local communications \n     infrastructure for timely and effective dissemination  of \n     warnings to activate evacuation of tsunami hazard zones.\n       (11) The Tsunami Warning System for the Pacific is a model \n     for other regions of the world to adopt, and can be expanded \n     and modernized to increase detection, forecast, and warning \n     capabilities for vulnerable states and territories, reduce \n     the incidence of costly false alarms, improve reliability of \n     measurement and assessment technology, and increase community \n     preparedness.\n       (12) Tsunami warning and preparedness capability can be \n     developed in other vulnerable areas of the world, such as the \n     Indian Ocean, by identifying tsunami hazard zones, educating \n     populations, developing alert and notification communications \n     infrastructure, and by deploying near real-time tsunami \n     detection sensors and gauges, establishing hazard \n     communication and warning networks, expanding global \n     monitoring of seismic activity, encouraging the increased \n     exchange of seismic and tidal data between nations, and \n     improving international coordination when a tsunami is \n     detected.\n       (13) UNESCO has recognized the need to establish tsunami \n     warning systems for regions beyond the Pacific Basin that are \n     vulnerable to tsunami, including the Indian Ocean, and has \n     convened a working group to lead an effort to expand the \n     International Tsunami Warning System in the Pacific to such \n     vulnerable regions.\n       (14) The international community and all vulnerable nations \n     should take coordinated efforts to establish and participate \n     in regional tsunami warning systems and other hazard warnings \n     systems developed to meet the goals of the United Nations \n     International Strategy for Disaster Reduction.\n       (15) On February 16, 2005, the United States, together with \n     53 other Nations participating in the Third Earth Observation \n     Summit in Brussels, Belgium, adopted a 10-year implementation \n     plan as the basis for establishing the Global Earth \n     Observation System of Systems.\n       (16) The Global Earth Observation System of Systems will \n     consist of existing and future earth observation systems, \n     including the United States tsunami detection and warning \n     system.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to improve tsunami detection, forecast, warnings, \n     notification, preparedness, and mitigation in order to \n     protect life and property both in the United States and \n     elsewhere in the world;\n       (2) to improve and modernize the existing Pacific Tsunami \n     Warning System to increase coverage, reduce false alarms and \n     increase accuracy of forecasts and warnings, and expand \n     detection and warning systems to include other vulnerable \n     States and United States territories, including the \n     Caribbean/Atlantic/Gulf region;\n       (3) to increase and accelerate mapping, modeling, research, \n     assessment, education, and outreach efforts in order to \n     improve forecasting, preparedness, mitigation, response, and \n     recovery of tsunami and related coastal hazards;\n       (4) to provide technical and other assistance to speed \n     international efforts to establish regional tsunami warning \n     systems in vulnerable areas worldwide, including the Indian \n     Ocean; and\n       (5) to improve Federal, State, and international \n     coordination for tsunami and other coastal hazard warnings \n     and preparedness.\n\n     SEC. 3.

In preparing the regional assessments, the \n     Administrator shall collect and compile current information \n     on tsunami, climate change, sea level rise, natural hazards, \n     coastal erosion and mapping, and ongoing regional efforts to \n     address them.\n       (2) Scope.--Regional assessments under the pilot program \n     shall include an evaluation of--\n       (A) the social impacts associated with threats to and \n     potential losses of housing, communities, and infrastructure;\n       (B) the physical impacts such as coastal erosion, flooding \n     and loss of estuarine habitat, saltwater intrusion of \n     aquifers and saltwater encroachment, and species migration;\n       (C) the economic impact on local, State, tribal, and \n     regional economies, including the impact on coastal \n     infrastructure and the abundance or distribution of \n     economically important living marine resources; and\n       (D) opportunities to enhance the resilience of at-risk \n     communities, economic sectors, and natural resources.\n       (c) Selection Criteria.--The Administrator shall rely on \n     the following criteria in identifying appropriate regional \n     pilot projects:\n       (1) Vulnerability to tsunami, hurricanes, extreme weather, \n     flooding, climate, and other coastal hazards.\n       (2) Dependence on economic sectors and natural resources \n     that are particularly sensitive to coastal hazards.\n       (3) Opportunities to link and leverage related regional \n     risk observation, research, forecasting, assessment, \n     educational and risk management programs.\n       (4) Demonstration of strong, interagency collaboration in \n     the area of risk management.\n       (5) Access to NOAA and other Federal agency programs, \n     facilities, and infrastructure related to tsunami and other \n     coastal hazards monitoring, warning, forecasting, research \n     assessment, and data management.\n       (d) Regional Adaptation Plans.--The Administrator shall, \n     within 3 years after the commencement of each project under \n     subsection (b), submit to the Congress regional adaptation \n     plans--\n       (1) based on the information contained in the regional \n     assessments conducted under subsection (b);\n       (2) developed with the participation of other Federal \n     agencies, State, tribal, and local government agencies, and \n     non-governmental entities (including academia and the private \n     sector) that will be critical in the implementation of the \n     plan at the State, tribal, and local levels;\n       (3) that recommend targets and strategies to address \n     coastal impacts associated with tsunami, climate change, sea \n     level rise, or climate variability;\n\n[[Page S7935]]\n\n       (4) that include recommendations for both short- and long-\n     term adaptation strategies; and\n       (5) that include recommendations on--\n       (A) Federal flood insurance program modifications;\n       (B) areas that have been identified as high risk through \n     mapping and assessment;\n       (C) enhancing the effectiveness of State coastal zone \n     management programs in mitigating or preventing coastal \n     risks;\n       (D) mitigation incentives such as rolling easements, \n     strategic retreat, State or Federal acquisition in fee simple \n     or other interest in land, construction standards, and \n     zoning;\n       (E) land and property owner education;\n       (F) economic planning for small communities dependent upon \n     affected coastal resources, including fisheries; and\n       (G) funding requirements and mechanisms.\n       (e) Technical Planning and Financial Assistance.--The \n     Administrator, through the National Ocean Service, shall \n     establish a coordinated program--\n       (1) to provide technical planning assistance and financial \n     assistance to coastal States, tribes, and local governments \n     as they develop and implement adaptation or mitigation \n     strategies and plans under this section; and\n       (2) to make products, information, tools, and technical \n     expertise generated from the development of the regional \n     assessment and the regional adaptation plan available to \n     coastal States for the purposes of developing their own \n     State, tribal, and local plans.\n\n     SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the \n     Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration--\n       (1) $35,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2006 through 2012 \n     to carry out this Act (other than section 8); and\n       (2) $5,000,000 for each of such fiscal years to carry out \n     section 8, of which at least $3,000,000 for each fiscal year \n     shall be used to carry out the pilot projects authorized by \n     section 8(b).\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I rise in support of S. 50, the \nTsunami Preparedness Act, which Senator Stevens and I introduced in \nJanuary 2004, and which is now being considered by the full Senate. We \nare joined by 24 of our friends and colleagues as cosponsors, including \nSenators Cantwell, Burns, Lautenberg, Snowe, Akaka, Murkowski, Clinton, \nSmith, Murray, Lieberman, Landrieu, Bill Nelson, Kerry, Chambliss, \nWyden, Dayton, Boxer, Feinstein, Mikulski, Sarbanes, Corzine, Lott, \nGregg, and Ben Nelson.\n  This bill, which the Commerce Committee unanimously approved in \nMarch, provides a scientific and technological response to minimize the \nthreats posed by tsunami to our own shores and coastal communities \naround the world. While we have had limited observation and detection \ncapabilities dating back to 1949, we must have a more robust, reliable, \nand well-maintained tsunami warning system. The appalling scope of the \nIndian Ocean tsunami of December 26, 2004 made clear the need and the \nurgency to develop more advanced detection capabilities.\n  Our legislation builds on our previous work and will establish a \nwarning system in the Pacific that is a model for the world. It also \nprovides for expansion and improvement to repair gaps that have been \nidentified recently.\n  Protecting human life and property from natural disaster requires \nthree components: the ability to reliably detect and forecast, the \ncapacity to broadcast warnings in a timely and informative manner, and \nthe capability to respond and safely evacuate coastal communities. \nAbove all, however, it requires the willingness to invest resources to \nprepare for a threat that is largely unseen and unpredictable, until \nthe last moment, when a monstrous wave actually strikes.\n  The people of Alaska and Hawaii have long memories and a keen \nawareness of the threat of tsunami. Perhaps it is because Hawaii sits \nin a position of terrible vulnerability in the Pacific Ocean, which is \nthe site of 85 percent of the world's tsunami activity, and because \nAlaska, perched on the northern edge of the Pacific's Ring of Fire, \nsuffers frequent tsunami-generating earthquakes. Yet we are not the \nonly States at risk from tsunami. There is a 14 percent chance that the \ncoast of Oregon will, within the next 50 years, see a tsunami similar \nin magnitude to the one that recently took so many lives in the Indian \nOcean. A recent study by the University of Southern California found \nthat undersea slumping off the California coast could generate a \ntsunami with the potential to take many thousands of lives and cause \nover $40 billion in damages.\n\n  In order to protect local communities, Hawaii established in 1949 a \ntsunami warning center, following a tragic Hilo tsunami. In response to \nthe Good Friday earthquake and tsunami of 1964, which accounted for 90 \npercent of the deaths in the State that year, Alaska established an \nobservatory in Palmer, AK, in 1967. Collaborations between the two \ncenters and other partners led to a nascent capacity for predicting and \nwarning coastal communities about potential tsunami in Alaska and \nHawaii and beyond.\n  As we came to understand the broader threat that tsunami posed, Ted \nStevens and I worked together to pass legislation in 1994 to direct the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, to develop a \nTsunami Hazard Mitigation Program. We are pleased to report that the \nprogram has laid the foundation for tsunami preparedness.\n  Through its Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, PMEL, NOAA has \ndeveloped Deep Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tunami--or ``DART''--\nbuoys, which accurately measure the subtle variations in the ocean's \nsea level caused by tsunami traveling over open water. With these \nmeasurements, as well as readings from coastal gauges, mathematical \nmodels can forecast tsunami direction, speed, and inundation with \nastonishing accuracy. Although the worldwide network of seismic sensors \noperated by the U.S. Geological Survey, USGS, provides excellent notice \nof earthquakes with the potential to generate tsunami, the DART buoys \nrepresent a next-generation approach to detection and forecasting of \ntsunami that will form the backbone of our domestic preparedness.\n  Interpreting these data and issuing warnings are Hawaii's Pacific \nTsunami Warning Center, and Alaska's West Coast/Alaska Tsunami Warning \nCenter, which jointly have the capacity to cover our domestic shores, \nand, at the same time, to reach out to all cooperating nations of the \nworld.\n  Forecasting and warning networks, however, depend on ears who know \nhow to respond, and so the Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program has \npartnered with States and local authorities to produce inundation \nmapping, develop evacuation routes, and conduct tsunami education. As a \nresult of much hard work, 15 counties along the West Coast and in \nAlaska and Hawaii have become national and world leaders by becoming \n``tsunami ready.''\n  The appalling scope of the Indian Ocean tragedy illustrates the \nimportance and necessity of our work of the past 10 years, and with \nstark clarity, we can see that despite our best efforts, much remains \nto be done. Now, as before, Senator Stevens and I have come together to \nlead the charge toward national and international tsunami preparedness.\n  The bill formally authorizes NOAA to establish, operate, and maintain \na dependable national tsunami warning system that would provide maximum \ntsunami detection capability for the Nation. The system would build on \nthe model established in the Pacific, and provide for its repair, \nexpansion and modernization by the close of calendar year 2007. The \nsystem would include four components: an expanded and upgraded \ndetection and warning system, a Federal-State tsunami hazard mitigation \nprogram, a tsunami research program, and a modernization and upgrade \nprogram. In addition, S. 50 would direct NOAA to provide any necessary \ntechnical or other assistance to international efforts to establish \nregional systems in other parts of the world, including the Indian \nOcean.\n  The detection and warning system established by the bill would cover \nthe Pacific Ocean region, as well as the Atlantic-Caribbean-Gulf of \nMexico region. The system would incorporate a variety of seismic and \ntsunami detection technologies, including deep ocean buoys. The system \nalso would encompass tsunami warning centers charged with collecting \nand analyzing the data and distributing warnings, including the \nexisting Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii and the West Coast/\nAlaska Tsunami Warning Center in Alaska, as well as any others deemed \nnecessary by the NOAA Administrator.\n  The bill formally authorizes NOAA's Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program \nand its community-based tsunami hazard mitigation program to improve \ntsunami preparedness of at-risk areas. The bill directs a Federal-State \ncoordinating committee for the program to work together to improve \ninundation mapping, community outreach and education, and promote and \nintegrate tsunami warning and mitigation measures, including rescue and \nrecovery\n\n[[Page S7936]]\n\nguidelines. The program would provide grants to States to ensure the \nprogram elements are implemented in coastal communities.\n  The bill requires NOAA to establish, along with other agencies and \nacademic institutions, a tsunami research program to continuously \nimprove detection, prediction, communication, and mitigation science \nand technology to support tsunami forecasts and warnings. This program \nwould also focus on the potential for improved communications systems \nfor tsunami and other hazard warnings, including telephones, wireless \nand satellite technology, the Internet, television and radio, and any \ninnovative combination of these technologies.\n  Another critical component of the bill requires NOAA to upgrade and \nmodernize the U.S. tsunami detection system by December 2007, and \nprovide accountability for the long-term operation of the system. NOAA \nis required to repair and upgrade the system, ensuring deployment of \nexisting deep ocean detection buoys and related detection equipment, as \nwell as notify Congress immediately not only of any equipment or system \nfailures that will impair regional detection, but also of significant \ncontractor failures or delays. In addition, the bill calls for the \nNational Academy of Sciences to review the system for further \nmodernization recommendations.\n  One of the changes we made to the bill resulted from testimony at the \ncommittee's February 2, 2005, hearing, and focuses on improving warning \nand preparedness for all coastal hazards, not only tsunami. The bill \nnow contains a Coastal Community Vulnerability and Adaptation program \nat NOAA would encourage collaboration among Federal, State, local, and \nregional efforts through pilot projects focusing on: No. 1, development \nof vulnerability maps for coastal communities to a wide array of \npotential hazards; No. 2, better integration of risk management with \ncommunity planning; No. 3, rick management leadership training for \npublic officials; No. 4, development of risk assessment technologies; \nNo. 5, new data services to support the new risk management activities; \nand No. 6, new risk communication systems. The bill would authorize $5 \nmillion annually for fiscal year 2006-2012 for the program.\n  The bill also recognizes the need for global coordination on tsunami \npreparedness, and as such, requires NOAA, and the interagency \ncoordinating committee of the U.S. Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program, \nto provide technical assistance and advice to international entities as \npart of an international effort to develop a fully functional global \ntsunami warning system. The bill would also encourage nations to share \ninformation and funding for such activities.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes $35 million annually for 6 years to \nsupport tsnunami related activities. Through this legislation, the work \nSenator Stevens and I started over ten years ago will step up to the \nnext level, and provide our Nation with coverage and protection that it \nneeds, while fulfilling our duties as citizens of the global community.\n  I believe that this bill will provide services of incalculable value \nto our Nation. The return on our investment may not happen this day or \nthe next but it will happen. I hope that you will join me and my \ncosponsors in supporting enactment of the Tsunami Preparedness Act.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, Oregon's 363 miles of coastline are \nextremely susceptible to tsunamis. Just 2 weeks ago, at 7:40 p.m. on \nJune 14, 2005, the tsunami threat became reality for those living on or \nvisiting the coast. A 7.0 earthquake off the coast of California \ntriggered an automatic tsunami warning for the entire west coast of the \nUnited States. The emergency response capabilities of these communities \nwere put to the test. Fortunately, the warning was called off at 9:09 \np.m. after it was determined that the earthquake failed to produce a \ntsunami.\n  Looking back, a lot of things went right. In Oregon, in cities such \nas Seaside and Cannon Beach, the alarms were sounded and people \nevacuated. However, there is a lot more that needs to be done. Models \nindicate that should an offshore earthquake trigger a tsunami, coastal \ntowns will only have between 12 and 30 minutes before the first wave \nhits the beach. On June 14, for many people on the coast, the \ninformation would have come too late.\n  I am pleased that the Tsunami Preparedness Act, S. 50, of which I am \na consponsor and strong supporter, will pass the Senate by unanimous \nconsent today. The world has recently seen how potentially devastating \na tsunami can be. America needs to take steps to prepare and be ready. \nOregonians are acutely aware that, at some point, a tsunami could hit \nthe coast of the United States. This bill will give our coastal \ncommunities opportunities that weren't afforded the victims of the \ntragic tsunami in Southeast Asia last year. It will harness the brains \nand expertise of universities, like Oregon State University and Oregon \nHealth and Science University, to improve our tsunami detection and \nwarning system and to make available the resources necessary to \nadequately prepare, inform, and protect U.S. citizens.\n  The U.S. has the tools to establish a top-notch national tsunami \nwarning system and hazard mitigation program. Oregon universities are \nleading the way in tsunami research, and the practical applications of \nthis research must be used. Our region, and the other vulnerable areas \nin the Nation, will benefit from better knowledge about the tracking, \nforecasting, and effects of tsunami waves. I look forward to the \nimplementation of the Tsunami Preparedness Act and to reviewing the \nfirst annual report to Congress on the status and progress of work on \nthis issue.\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1101\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n  The amendment (No. 1101) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The bill (S. 50), as amended, was read the third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/01/senate-section/article/S7936-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7936-S7939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            OCEAN AND COASTAL OBSERVATION SYSTEM ACT OF 2005\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill (S. 361) to develop and \nmaintain an integrated system of ocean and coastal observations for the \nNation's coasts, oceans, and Great Lakes, improve warnings of tsunamis, \nand other natural hazards, enhance homeland security, support maritime \noperations, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1102\n\n  (Purpose: To develop and maintain an integrated system of ocean and \n coastal observations for the Nation's coasts, oceans and Great Lakes, \n    improve warnings of tsunamis and other natural hazards, improve \n  management of coastal and marine resources, and for other purposes)\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The amendment (No. 1102) was agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1103) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       Amend the title so as to read ``A bill to develop and \n     maintain an integrated system of ocean and coastal \n     observations for the Nation's coasts, oceans and Great Lakes, \n     improve warnings of tsunamis and other natural hazards, and \n     for other purposes.''.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, thank you for allowing the Senate to \nconsider S. 361, the Ocean and Coastal Observation Systems Act of 2005. \nI must also thank my cosponsors, Senators Kerry, Stevens, Inouye, \nCollins, Sarbanes, Lautenberg, Lott, and Cantwell. Their commitment to \nsound, science-based marine policy enabled us to craft this critical \nlegislation that would do nothing less than revolutionize our \nunderstanding of the oceans.\n  This bill, the Ocean and Coastal Observation Systems Act of 2005, \nwould create an integrated network of ocean monitoring systems around \nour Nation's coastlines, enabling comprehensive ocean data to be \ncollected, compiled, and utilized in ways that enhance our safety, \nlivelihoods, and overall quality of life.\n  Although 140 million Americans live along our Nation's 95,000 miles \nof coastline, most of these coastal residents would be surprised to \nlearn how little we know about what happens at and below the sea's \nsurface. Marine scientists strive to collect data on the biological, \nphysical, and chemical properties of the ocean, yet many of their \nquestions about our complex marine environment remain unanswered. \nMoreover, there is a tremendous and\n\n[[Page S7937]]\n\ngrowing need to translate data about ocean conditions into a form of \ninformation that people can use to improve their activities in and on \nthe water--whether for marine science, resource management, and \nmaritime transportation and safety.\n  Having more than 5,000 miles of shoreline, my home State of Maine has \na strong heritage linked to the sea. Our coastal communities are highly \ndependent on the fisheries resources and other essential services \nprovided to us by the Gulf of Maine, and for centuries our lives and \nlivelihoods have required us to understand and adapt to ever-changing \nocean conditions.\n  This critical need for information was the driving force behind the \ninnovation that led to the Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System, or \nGoMOOS. A partnership of marine science institutions and ocean-\ndependent organizations launched GoMOOS in 2001 with the deployment of \nten observation buoys in the Gulf of Maine. Since then, these buoys \nhave taken nearly continuous measurements of wind speed, wave height, \ntemperature, fog, currents, salinity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and \nother key environmental variables. By modifying the instrumentation, \nscientists can gather other data from these platforms, and they can \nfurther link it to ocean information relayed by radar and satellites. \nGoMOOS compiles these data and makes it available to any ocean \nstakeholder via the internet, on a near real-time basis. Not only is \nthis a tremendous public service to those affected by sea conditions, \nbut it also provides a tremendous economic return--nearly $6 for every \n$1 invested--to the New England region.\n  The impact of GoMOOS in our region has been profound. Fisheries \nscientists and managers use this information to predict ocean \nconditions that affect productivity, and they are finding new ways to \napply this information in resource management. Fishermen, sailors, \nCoast Guard search-and-rescue units, the military, and others who \ntraverse the ocean are better able to predict safe sea conditions, and \nshippers can transport their goods more efficiently. Ocean scientists \nand regulators are better able to understand, predict, and rapidly \nrespond to marine pollution and hazardous ocean conditions such as \nharmful algal blooms. Educators and students are learning more about \nmarine science.\n  Of course, all States that border our Nation's oceans and Great Lakes \nwould benefit from easy access to this kind of ocean information. \nFollowing the example of GoMOOS, more than a dozen ocean and coastal \nobserving systems are being developed and implemented around the \nNation, many in conjunction with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration or NOAA, State coastal managers, universities, marine \nindustries, and other regional partners. While these systems can \nprovide valuable services to their region, we have found that they use \ndifferent--and sometimes incompatible--methods for collecting, \nmanaging, processing, and communicating their data. When this happens, \nwe lose the ability to develop a comprehensive assessment of coastal \nand ocean conditions around the Nation.\n  S. 361, the Ocean and Coastal Observation Systems Act of 2005, would \nfacilitate action to correct this problem. This bill would coordinate \nthe regional ocean and coastal observation efforts and link them at the \nnational level under the leadership of NOAA. It would help further \ndevelop regional observation systems, link them through a nationwide \nnetwork, and ensure public access to the information so that anyone, \nanywhere, at any time could better understand and track ocean and \ncoastal conditions. It would authorize the National Ocean Research \nLeadership Council to establish an interagency program office that \nwould plan and coordinate operational activities and budgets, as well \nas oversee a research and development program. Further, this bill would \ncharge NOAA as the lead Federal agency to ensure that this national \nnetwork of regional observation associations, such as GoMOOS and others \nunder development, effectively integrate and utilize ocean data for the \nbenefit of the American public.\n  As the U.S. Ocean Commission made clear in its final report issued in \nSeptember 2004, ocean and coastal observations are a cornerstone of \nsound marine science, management, and commerce, and the potential uses \nof this system are nearly unlimited. As chair of the Subcommittee on \nFisheries and Coast Guard and as a coastal State Senator, I am \nextremely proud to sponsor and support this bill. It is imperative that \nwe in Congress facilitate the development and funding of a national, \nintegrated, and sustained ocean observation network, and we can start \nby passing the bill before us. This bill, once enacted, will provide a \ntremendous public service along our Nation's oceans and coasts, and I \nthank my colleagues for supporting it.\n  The bill (S. 361), as amended, was read the third time, and passed, \nas follows:\n\n                                 S. 361\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ocean and Coastal \n     Observation System Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Ocean and coastal observations provide vital \n     information for protecting human lives and property from \n     marine hazards, predicting weather, improving ocean health \n     and providing for the protection and enjoyment of the \n     resources of the Nation's coasts, oceans, and Great Lakes.\n       (2) The continuing and potentially devastating threat posed \n     by tsunamis, hurricanes, storm surges, and other marine \n     hazards requires immediate implementation of strengthened \n     observation and data management systems to provide timely \n     detection, assessment, and warnings to the millions of people \n     living in coastal regions of the United States and throughout \n     the world.\n       (3) The 95,000-mile coastline of the United States, \n     including the Great Lakes, is vital to the Nation's \n     prosperity, contributing over $117 billion to the national \n     economy in 2000, supporting jobs for more than 200 million \n     Americans, and supporting commercial and sport fisheries \n     valued at more than $50 billion annually.\n       (4) Responding to coastal hazards and managing fisheries \n     and other coastal activities require improved monitoring of \n     the Nation's waters and coastline, including the ability to \n     provide rapid response teams with real-time environmental \n     conditions necessary for their work.\n       (5) While knowledge of the ocean and coastal environment \n     and processes is far from complete, advances in sensing \n     technologies and scientific understanding have made possible \n     long-term and continuous observation from shore, from space, \n     and in situ of ocean and coastal characteristics and \n     conditions.\n       (6) Many elements of an ocean and coastal observing system \n     are in place, but require national investment, consolidation, \n     completion, and integration at Federal, regional, State, and \n     local levels.\n       (7) The Commission on Ocean Policy recommends a national \n     commitment to a sustained and integrated ocean and coastal \n     observing system and to coordinated research programs in \n     order to assist the Nation and the world in understanding the \n     oceans, improving weather forecasts, strengthening management \n     of ocean and coastal resources, and mitigating marine \n     hazards.\n       (8) In 2003, the United States led more than 50 nations in \n     affirming the vital importance of timely, quality, long-term \n     global observations as a basis for sound decision-making, \n     recognizing the contribution of observation systems to meet \n     national, regional, and global needs, and calling for \n     strengthened cooperation and coordination in establishing a \n     Global Earth Observation System of Systems, of which an \n     integrated ocean and coastal observing system is an essential \n     part.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to provide \n     for--\n       (1) the planning, development, and maintenance of an \n     integrated ocean and coastal observing system that provides \n     the data and information to sustain and restore healthy \n     marine and Great Lakes ecosystems and the resources they \n     support, enable advances in scientific understanding of the \n     oceans and the Great Lakes, and strengthen science eduation \n     and communication;\n       (2) implementation of research, development, education, and \n     outreach programs to improve understanding of the oceans and \n     Great Lakes and achieve the full national benefits of an \n     integrated ocean and coastal observing system;\n       (3) implementation of a data and information management \n     system required by all components of an integrated ocean and \n     coastal observing system and related research to develop \n     early warning systems and insure usefulness of data and \n     information for users; and\n       (4) establishment of a system of regional ocean, coastal, \n     and Great Lakes observing systems to address local needs for \n     ocean information.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \ntransportation, which I co-chair with my good-friend Senator Daniel \nInouye, has unanimously passed out of committee, four bills to protect \nour oceans and enhance the collective knowledge of the marine \nenvironment. The Senate just passed these four bills by unanimous \nconsent, and I look forward to working with the House to get this \nimportant legislation enacted into law.\n  Water covers over 70 percent of the Earth's surface. It is estimated \nthat 80 percent of life on Earth is in the oceans. The Atlantic, \nPacific, and Arctic Oceans, and the Gulf of Mexico, make up the waters \nof the United States Exclusive Economic Zone. In fact, the Pacific \nOcean alone covers nearly an entire hemisphere of the globe. But little \nis known about these waters.\n  The four bills the Senate passed today will provide greater \nunderstanding of the complex ocean environment. Together, they will \nincrease the coordination and effectiveness of the Federal agencies \nthat contribute to the research and management of these critical marine \necosystems.\n  The four bills are: S. 50, the Tsunami Preparedness Act; S. 39, the \nNational Ocean Exploration Program Act; S. 361, the Ocean and Coastal \nObservation System Act of 2005; and S. 362, the Marine Debris Research, \nPrevention, and Reduction Act of 2005.\n  The Tsunami Preparedness Act is the first bill that Senator Inouye \nand I drafted as the new Co-chairmen of the Commerce Committee. It was \ndeveloped in the wake of the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami that took \nlives in 11 countries and provides an expanded tsunami detection and \nwarning system for the United States. The bill authorizes the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, to establish, operate, \nand maintain a dependable national tsunami warning system that would \nprovide maximum tsunami detection capability for the Nation. The system \nwould build on the model established in the Pacific, and provide for \nits repair, expansion and modernization by the close of calendar year \n2007. In addition, the bill directs NOAA to provide any necessary \ntechnical support or other assistance to international efforts to \nestablish regional tsunami detection and warning systems in other parts \nof the world, including the Indian Ocean.\n  I wrote the next bill, National Ocean Exploration Program Act, for \nthe simple fact that very little is known about our oceans and more \nresearch and exploration is desperately needed. Approximately 95 \npercent of the ocean floor remains unexplored, much of it located in \nthe polar-regions and southern ocean. We know more about the surface of \nthe moon than the ocean floor; this bill is intended to change that. \nThe National Ocean Exploration Program Act establishes a national \nprogram within NOAA to conduct inter-disciplinary ocean exploration \nvoyages in partnership with other Federal agencies or academic \ninstitutions. The Act will strengthen interagency coordination on ocean \nexploration for the purposes of developing and facilitating the \ntransfer of new exploration technologies, communication infrastructure, \nand data management systems to the Program. The bill gives priority \nattention to the exploration of deep ocean regions to make exciting new \ndiscoveries. In addition, it will promote the development of improved \noceanographic research, communication, navigation, and data collection \nsystems, in an effort to increase understanding of the ocean \nenvironment.\n\n  The Ocean and Coastal Observation System Act of 2005, developed by \nSenator Snowe, will also contribute to our knowledge of the oceans with \ngreater monitoring and observation of this dynamic environment. The \nbill will establish a national, integrated ocean and coastal observing \nsystem that will collect, compile, and make available data on ocean \nconditions in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone, including the Great \nLakes. The ocean and coastal observation system will help improve \nweather and flood forecasting, promote understanding of climatic \nvariability processes, enhance safety and efficiency of marine \noperations, facilitate research, improve management of marine and \ncoastal ecosystems, and provide information to raise public awareness \nof oceans.\n  And finally there is the Marine Debris Research, Prevention, and \nReduction Act of 2005. Authored by Senator Inouye, this bill responds \nto the immediate need to prevent and reduce significantly the amount of \ntrash that is collecting in our oceans. The bill establishes separate \nprograms within NOAA and the Coast Guard to identify, assess, reduce \nand prevent marine debris and its adverse impacts on the marine \nenvironment and navigation safety. In addition the bill creates an \nInteragency Committee on Marine Debris to coordinate federal efforts to \nprevent and reduce marine debris.\n  I look forward to the new information and management capabilities \nthese bills will provide. Alaska has more coastline than the rest of \nthe country combined. The oceans are a vital part of our way of life, \nand we depend on sound scientific research to maintain them. These \nbills are important to increase our efforts to be good stewards of our \noceans.\n  I thank my colleagues on the Commerce Committee and those in the \nSenate for their overwhelming support of these bills.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/01/senate-section/article/S7939-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DISCHARGE AND REFERRAL--S. 759\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 143, S. 432.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 432) to establish a digital and wireless network \n     technology program, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, today I rise to respectfully urge my \ncolleagues to support S. 432, the Minority Serving Institution Digital \n& Wireless Technology Opportunity Act of 2003. This legislation will \nprovide vital resources to address the technology gap that exists at \nmany minority serving institutions, MSIs. It establishes a new grant \nprogram within the National Science Foundation, NSF, that provides \nannually for 5 years up to $250 million to help historically black \ncolleges and universities, Hispanic serving institutions, and tribal \ncolleges to close what I often referred to as the ``digital divide'', \nbut is more like an ``economic opportunity divide.''\n  Since before I was elected to the Senate, my goal has always been to \nlook for ways to improve education and empower all of our young \npeople--regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion or economic \nbackground--to compete and succeed in life.\n  Additionally, I have always been one who embraces innovations and \nadvances in technology--especially as a means to provide greater \nopportunities or security for Americans.\n  In my view, increasing access to technology provides our young people \nwith an important tool for success both in the classroom and in the \nworkforce.\n  We all know, the best jobs in the future will go to those who are the \nbest prepared. However, I am increasingly concerned that when it comes \nto high technology jobs--which pay higher wages--this country runs the \nrisk of economically limiting many college students in our society. It \nis important for all Americans that we close this economic opportunity \ngap.\n  This Nation's economic stability and growth are increasingly \ndependent on a growing portion of the workforce possessing \ntechnological skills.\n  African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans constitute one-\nquarter of the total U.S. workforce. Approximately one-third of all \nstudents of color in this Nation are educated at minority serving \ninstitutions. It is estimated that in 10 years minorities will comprise \nnearly 40 percent of all college-age Americans.\n  Yet, members of these minorities represent only 7 percent of the U.S. \ncomputer and information science workforce; 6 percent of the \nengineering workforce; and less than 2 percent of the computer science \nfaculty.\n  U.S. information technology companies are increasingly relying on \nforeign workers to fill important IT positions. I am not against legal \nimmigration, but I say let's properly educate and train Americans to \nget and fill those good-paying technology jobs. Let's make sure all \nAmerican students are prepared to meet the requirements on the 21st \ncentury workforce.\n  However, minority serving institutions still lack desired information \nand digital technology infrastructure. A study completed by the \nDepartment of Commerce and the National Association for Equal \nOpportunity in Higher Education indicated that:\n  No historically black college or university, HBCUs, requires computer \nownership for their undergraduate students;\n  Thirteen HBCUs reported to have no students--not one--owning their \nown personal computer;\n  Over 70 percent of the students at HBCUs rely on the universities to \nprovide computers, however only 50 percent of those universities can \nprovide their students access to computers in computer laboratories, \nlibraries, classrooms or other locations; and\n  Most of these minority serving colleges do not have the private \nfoundation resources to provide financial support to upgrade their \nnetwork infrastructure.\n  So it is not surprising that most HBCUs do not have high-speed \nInternet access especially the desired ATM or asynchronous transfer \nmode technology and that only 3 percent of HBCUs have financial aid \navailable to help students close the computer ownership gap.\n  Access to the Internet is no longer a luxury, it is a necessity. \nBecause of the rapid advancement and growing dependence on technology, \nbeing technologically proficient has become more essential to \neducational advancement.\n  The fact is 60 percent of all jobs require information technology \nskills. And jobs in information technology pay significantly higher \nsalaries than jobs in non-information technology fields. Thus, students \nwho lack access to these information technology tools are at an \nincreasing disadvantage. Consequently, it is vitally important that all \ninstitutions of higher education provide their students with access to \nthe most current IT and digital equipment.\n  This technology program will allow eligible HBCUs, HSIs and tribal \ninstitutions the opportunity to acquire equipment, networking \ncapability, hardware and software, digital network technology and \nwireless technology and infrastructure--such as wireless fidelity or \nWi-Fi--to develop and provide educational services. Additionally, the \nfunds in this bill could be used to offer students much needed \nuniversal access to campus networks, dramatically increasing their \nconnectivity rates or make necessary infrastructure improvements.\n  There are over 200 Hispanic serving institutions; over 100 \nhistorically black colleges and universities and 34 tribal colleges \nthroughout our country.\n  It is clear that minority serving institutions in the U.S. are \nproviding a valuable service to the educational strength and future \ngrowth of our Nation. These institutions must upgrade their technology \ncapabilities for their students. We cannot leave any college student \nbehind!\n  I am proud to say Virginia is home to five HBCUs--Norfolk State \nUniversity, St. Paul's College, Virginia Union University, Hampton \nUniversity and Virginia State University.\n  I will continue to look for ways to: (1) improve education; (2) \ncreate new jobs; and (3) seek out new opportunities to benefit the \npeople of Virginia and America. By improving technology-education \nprograms in minority serving institutions, we can accomplish all three \nof these goals for students throughout our Nation.\n  We all recognize the technology requirements on the 21st century \nworkforce call for tangible action, not rhetoric. Our future economic \nand national security needs depend on and demand all of our young \nstudents have the highly technical skills needed to compete and succeed \nin the workforce.\n  We must tap the underutilized talent of our minority serving \ninstitutions to ensure that America's workforce is prepared to lead the \nworld.\n  I thank my colleagues for joining me today: Senators McCain, Warner, \nBurns, Graham, Hutchison, Lincoln, Pryor, Talent, Cornyn, Grassley, \nLautenberg, Lott, Murkowski, Santorum, and Thune.\n  This legislation is a significant, constructive, and positive action \nto ensure that many more of our college students are provided access to \nbetter technology and education, and most importantly, even greater \nopportunities in life.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the\n\n[[Page S7942]]\n\ntable, and any statements related to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 432) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 432\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Whereas Sandra Day O'Connor, the daughter of Harry and Ada \n     Mae, was born in El Paso, Texas, and was raised by her family \n     on a cattle ranch in southeastern Arizona;\n       Whereas Sandra Day O'Connor began an academic journey at \n     Stanford University, earning a bachelor's degree in economics \n     and graduating magna cum laude;\n       Whereas Sandra Day O'Connor continued her education at \n     Stanford University, by enrolling in the Stanford Law School, \n     where she served on the Board of Editors of the law review;\n       Whereas, graduating in just 2 years from

William H. \n     Rehnquist;\n       Whereas Sandra Day O'Connor married her great love, John \n     Jay O'Connor III, in 1952;\n       Whereas Sandra Day O'Connor began a legal career as the \n     Deputy County Attorney of San Mateo, California;\n       Whereas, when John Jay O'Connor III was drafted into the \n     JAG Corps in 1953, the young couple moved to Frankfurt, \n     Germany, where Sandra Day O'Connor worked as a civilian \n     attorney for Quartermaster Market Center;\n       Whereas, after 4 years in Europe, Sandra Day O'Connor \n     returned to Maryvale, Arizona, where she

hard work anything is possible;\n       Whereas, throughout her tenure on the Supreme Court of the \n     United States, Sandra Day O'Connor has not lost sight of her \n     values and has not wavered from her well-grounded views;\n       Whereas President Ronald Reagan, on the date he appointed \n     Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court of the United \n     States, said, ``[s]he is truly a

`brethren' who have preceded \n     her'';\n       Whereas now, more than 23 years later, the comments \n     President Reagan made about Sandra Day O'Connor still ring \n     true;\n       Whereas when Sandra Day O'Connor took the oath of office as \n     Associate Justice, she pledged to uphold the Constitution, \n     and has since then proven a steadfast commitment to the rule \n     of law;\n       Whereas the wisdom, intellect, respect for others, and \n     humility of Sandra Day O'Connor have allowed her to become \n     well-respected among her colleagues, including those with

has \n     proudly served the United States for 4 decades as an Arizona \n     State Senator and majority leader, State court judge, an \n     Assistant Attorney General for Arizona, and for more than 23 \n     years as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas through her experiences, Justice Sandra Day \n     O'Connor has brought a unique perspective and understanding \n     of checks and balances to the Supreme Court of the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas, Sandra Day O'Connor, a brilliant jurist and a \n     compassionate woman, has earned a place in history as the \n     first woman to serve on the Supreme Court of the United \n     States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of \n     the United States Sandra Day O'Connor as a great American, a \n     life-long public servant, a brilliant legal scholar, a superb \n     jurist, and the first woman ever to serve as an Associate \n     Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States; and\n       (2) pays tribute to Sandra Day O'Connor, Associate Justice \n     of the Supreme
