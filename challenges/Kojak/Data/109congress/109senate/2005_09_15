Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the monthlong \ncelebration honoring the heritage of Hispanic Americans. That monthlong \ncelebration begins today.\n  Nearly 40 years ago, Congress authorized President Lyndon Johnson to \nproclaim National Hispanic Heritage Week. Two decades later, George \nHerbert Walker Bush expanded the celebration to 4 weeks. National \nHispanic Heritage Month was born. Every year we set aside a month to \npay special regard to the contributions of Hispanic Americans.\n  Over the centuries, Hispanic Americans have profoundly affected the \ncourse of human history. Their influence predates the birth of our \nNation, tracing back to the first footsteps of Spanish explorers now \nmore than 400 years ago.\n  DeSoto and his men were the first to discover the mighty Mississippi. \nCoronado's expedition unearthed the Grand Canyon. DeAnza blazed a trail \nfrom Mexico to California's Pacific coast.\n  Since the dawn of early explorers, millions of men and women from \nMexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Central America, South America, and Spain \nhave continued the tradition of settling in America. They have come in \nsearch of freedom, peace, and prosperity, and they have gotten far more \nthan they sought.\n  Through the ages, Hispanic Americans have left an indelible mark on \nthe history, the culture, and the values of our Nation. It is those \nvalues and contributions that we celebrate.\n  Some names stand out. David Barkley was the first Hispanic American \nto receive the Congressional Medal of Honor. Barkley voluntarily swam \nthe frosty Meuse River in France during World War I to gather \ninformation behind enemy lines. He gave his life to our country, \ndrowning on his swim back to land.\n\n  Luis Alvarez, a Nobel Prize recipient, revolutionized the safety of \nair travel by inventing the ground control radar system for aircraft \nlandings.\n  Ellen Ochoa was the world's first Hispanic-American astronaut.\n  Sara Martinez Tucker, who I had the opportunity to meet at a dinner I \nrecently hosted, her story intrigued me so much. A native of Laredo, \nSara worked her way up from humble beginnings to be the first Hispanic \nfemale to hold an executive position at AT Time Magazine recently \nnamed her one of the top 25 most influential Hispanic Americans. But \nmost important is what she has done to help other Hispanic Americans \nrealize their own dreams. As CEO of the Hispanic Scholarship Fund, she \nhas grown the scholarship fund from $3 million tenfold to $30 million \nin scholarship money distributed every year, and she is not stopping \nthere. Sara wants to nearly\n\n[[Page S10058]]\n\ndouble the percentage of Hispanics with college degrees by 2010, and I \nbelieve with her determination, she will accomplish just that.\n  David Barkley, Luis Alvarez, Ellen Ochoa, Sara Martinez Tucker, Alex \nRodriguez, Nancy Lopez, Richard Serra, Rita Hayworth, Cesar Chavez, \nAlberto Gonzales, Jose Gonzalez--I mention Jose because he has a \nspecial place in my heart. Jose was the chief surgical resident at \nMassachusetts General Hospital when I was in my training in Boston. I \nwas an intern at the time. Jose walked me through my very first hernia \noperation, an operation I have performed many times since that first \noccasion, an occasion which I remember vividly, an operation I continue \nto perform in Africa on medical mission work.\n  The list goes on. There are doctors, entrepreneurs, public servants, \nathletes, artists, philanthropists, scientists, scholars. In all of \nthese professions, in all of these fields, the huge contributions that \nhave been made in the past, all have contributed to that rich fabric of \nAmerican life. We are a more vibrant nation and we are a more vibrant \npeople because of it.\n  These names stand out, but there are many others, large and small, \nwho move America forward every day. They are the countless heroes who \nhave fought in our wars, who work in our hospitals, who teach in our \nschools, and who serve in our Government. Many have come to America \nwith a simple hope of a better life and through hard work they have \nachieved that goal. We honor their character, their determination, and \ntheir enduring optimism.\n  It is the spirit of the American character which gives flight to the \nAmerican dream and has fueled the progress of our great Nation.\n  Today as we begin a monthlong celebration of Hispanic heritage, I \njoin with all Americans in recognizing the invaluable role of Hispanic \nAmericans in shaping and enriching these United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10058-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n MAKING APPROPRIATIONS FOR SCIENCE, THE DEPARTMENTS OF STATE, JUSTICE, \n        AND COMMERCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES FOR FISCAL YEAR 2006\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, on a separate issue, I want to take the \nopportunity to mention a meeting I am honored to be hosting later today \nwith Colombian President Alvaro Uribe, who is visiting our country and \nwho will be here with us in the U.S. Capitol. He has served as \nColombia's President since his election in 2002 and has done a \nremarkable job. I have had the privilege of meeting with President \nUribe during visits, both here in Washington as well as on a trip that \nI took to Colombia in January of 2004. Throughout his term, the \nPresident has enjoyed high levels of popular support. He has earned it. \nHe deserves it. He ran on the platform of public security and he has \ndelivered.\n  Since his election, Colombia has seen significant decreases in \nhomicides, decreases in crime, decreases in acts of terrorism. Coca and \npoppy cultivation have decreased by over a third while he served in \noffice. President Uribe has worked hard to promote greater respect for \nthe rule of law, institute judicial reform, and improve Colombia's \nrecord on human rights.\n  Colombia is one of our Nation's strongest allies and our close \npartnership is key to advancing U.S. interests in the Western \nHemisphere. Colombia is the third most populous country in Latin \nAmerica after Brazil and Mexico. Because of its size and strategic \nlocation, Colombia is a key player in regional issues. In addition, it \nhas played an active role in multilateral institutions such as the \nUnited Nations and the Organization of American States.\n  The close bilateral relationship that America enjoys with Colombia \ncenters on our efforts to counter terrorism and stop illicit drug \ntraffic. Together, our two countries are working hard to promote \nstability and promote security, to promote prosperity in Colombia and \nthe region. I look forward to discussing all of these issues with the \nPresident this afternoon.\n  At the top of the list, we will address the President's efforts to \ndefeat Colombia's insurgent groups. Three main illegal armed groups \noperate in Colombia: The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, FARC; \nthe National Liberation Army, or ELN; and the United Self-Defense \nForces of Colombia, known as AUC. All three thrive on the illegal \nnarcotics trade. The U.S. Secretary of State has designated all three \ngroups as foreign terrorist organizations. For years, FARC, ELN, and \nAUC have terrorized the Colombian people with bombings, murders, \nkidnappings, extortion, hijackings, and the list goes on. They have \nkidnapped dozens of American citizens, and they have murdered at least \n10.\n  Their drug-sponsored terrorist activity has created destabilizing \neffects on Colombia and the region and threatens the United States. The \nU.S. Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that more than 80 \npercent of the worldwide powder cocaine supply and approximately 90 \npercent of the powder cocaine smuggled into the United States is \nproduced in Colombia. Colombian producers also account for 50 percent \nof the heroin entering the United States. The United States spends \nhundreds of millions of dollars each year in Colombia to train the \ncounternarcotics forces, shore up their civilian counterdrug efforts, \nand help provide crop alternatives for farmers. We are getting results.\n  Aerial eradication alone has cut coca and poppy cultivation by a \nthird since 2001.\n  Human rights is another topic that the President and I and leadership \nwill be discussing. Members of Congress have repeatedly and rightly \nvoiced concerns about continuing human rights violations in Colombia. \nFARC, ELN, and AUC are notorious culprits. I hope to learn more about \nhow President Uribe plans to demobilize these troops and address \nallegations of human rights abuses within Colombia's Armed Forces.\n  The United States and Colombia have worked hard to build a solid \nfoundation for a close, cooperative relationship. I look forward to \nhearing the President's ideas on how we can continue to work together \non all of these issues of huge concern. I urge my colleagues in the \nSenate to continue to support President Uribe in his efforts, his \nconvictions, his determination to fight the illicit drug trade, \nstrengthen the rule of law, expand economic opportunity and foster \npeace and stability in his country and in the region.When we strengthen \nthe security of our neighbors, we increase our security at home.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S10059]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside so I may call up amendment No. 1718.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1718\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1718.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, let me briefly describe what this amendment \ndoes, and then I understand the representative of the minority will \ninterpose an objection.\n  This is an amendment that embodies a bill to prohibit Internet \ngambling and permit the enforcement of that prohibition. Most States, \nif not all States, already have laws on the books that prohibit \nInternet gambling. The problem is that those bills are difficult to \nenforce by the individual State attorneys general because the Internet \nis ubiquitous--it is across the State lines--and the attorney general \nin Arizona can't go to Montana and enforce such prohibition in that \nState.\n  About 10 years ago, the State Attorneys General Association came \nbefore our subcommittee and asked for this Federal legislation so that \nthere could be a national enforcement that would enable them to give \nforce to all of the different States' laws prohibiting Internet \ngambling. We have worked on this now for a decade, and twice the \nlegislation has passed the Senate. Twice the legislation has passed the \nHouse of Representatives, each time in somewhat different form. But we \nhave never been able to get the two bodies to pass legislation in the \nsame year in order to effectuate that.\n  It is very troublesome because the process by which we have to \nconsider legislation makes it very difficult for something like this to \nget floor time and have a week or several days on the floor to debate \nback and forth, get it passed, and do the same thing with the House and \nthen work out a conference committee and the like. That is why we have \nhad to resort to attaching amendments such as this to appropriations \nbills or other bills that are on the floor already and moving forward \nso that we can gain consideration of this issue. It is not particularly \ncontentious. It is certainly not partisan. The legislation has enjoyed \nwide bipartisan support in both bodies.\n\n  Let me briefly describe it. All it does is it allows banks and credit \ncard companies to do what most of them are already doing voluntarily; \nthat is, simply not honoring a credit card debt for Internet gambling. \nWhen some Internet gambling site in Aruba, for example, submits the \nbill to Master Charge or Bank of America and says, Joe Blow here \ngambled away $1,000 of his money, put it on the credit card, and you \nnow owe that to our Internet gambling site in Aruba, the bank or credit \ncard company says, No. That was against the law. You can't do that. We \nare not paying.\n  It has had some effect on these operations. But to show you why it \nhasn't had enough, when we started a decade ago, there were 20-some \nsites. Today, there are over 2,000 sites. The amount of money was \nrelatively insignificant back then. Now it is hundreds of billions of \ndollars. It is incredible.\n  A Harvard law professor described this kind of Internet gambling with \nregard to kids doing it on the Internet. He said it is like the crack \ncocaine of gambling; it is so addictive; there is no supervision.\n  We have gambling in Las Vegas, Atlantic City, and on Indian \nreservations, and it is tightly supervised and regulated. Even our \nsubcommittee found testimony from the New Jersey Gambling Commission \nand said one reason we can do it is we highly regulate it. But there is \nno way to regulate these offshore sites. That is why it is against the \nlaw in every State.\n  We have a Federal act called the Wire Act which prohibits horse \ngambling. That is now being done on the Internet. There is a means of \nenforcing existing law in a meaningful way and ensuring that all of the \nState laws can be enforced as well. I want to indicate who is in favor \nof this, and then I will allow the process here to occur.\n  Obviously, sports groups are very concerned about the adulteration of \nsports. We have seen it in college sports. Even one of the universities \nin my State was involved in a point-shaving scandal not too long ago. \nWhy did this young athlete involved have to shave points in the games \nin which he played? It was because he got into trouble with gambling \ndebts.\n  The NFL, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, National \nBaseball Association, National Collegiate Athletic Association, and the \nNCAA strongly support this legislation because they understand that if \nInternet gambling becomes part of their sports, nobody can count on \nthose sports being pure. There is always the possibility that they have \nbeen adulterated by gambling.\n  There are a lot of groups. The National Gambling Commission called \nfor legislation such as this, and a lot of the groups that testified \nbefore that Commission are also strongly in support. The National \nCoalition Against Gambling Expansion and groups such as the Family \nResearch Council, Focus on the Family, Concerned Women for America, the \nChristian Coalition, United Methodist Church, Southern Baptist \nConvention, together with their comembers of the National Council of \nChurches, and the National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion--it \nincludes a whole host of organizations.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have this list printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows;\n\n                               Supporters\n\n       National Football League, Major League Baseball, National \n     Hockey League, National Baseball Association, and National \n     Collegiate Athletic Association.\n       Family Research Council, Focus on the Family, Christian \n     Coalition, Concerned Women for America, National Coalition \n     Against Gambling Expansion, United Methodist Church, and \n     Southern Baptist Convention.\n       Together with their co-members of The National Council of \n     Churches, which includes:\n       African Methodist Episcopal Church, The African Methodist \n     Episcopal Zion Church, Alliance of Baptists, American Baptist \n     Churches in the USA, and The Antiochian Orthodox Christian \n     Archdiocese of North America.\n       Diocese of the Armenian Church of America, Christian Church \n     (Disciples of Christ), Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, \n     Church of the Brethren, and The Coptic Orthodox Church in \n     North America.\n       The Episcopal Church, Evangelical Lutheran Church in \n     America, Friends United Meeting, Greek Orthodox Archdiocese \n     of America, Hungarian Reformed Church in America, \n     International Council of Community Churches, Korean \n     Presbyterian Church in America, Malankara Orthodox Syrian \n     Church, and Mar Thoma Church.\n       Moravian Church in America Northern Province and Southern \n     Province, National Baptist Convention of America, National \n     Baptist Convention, U.S.A., Inc., National Missionary Baptist \n     Convention of America, Orthodox Church in America, \n     Patriarchal Parishes of the Russian Orthodox Church in the \n     U.S.A., and Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of the Religious \n     Society of Friends.\n       Polish National Catholic Church of America, Presbyterian \n     Church (U.S.A.), Progressive National Baptist Convention, \n     Inc., Reformed Church in America, and Serbian Orthodox Church \n     in the U.S.A. and Canada.\n       The Swedenborgian Church, Syrian Orthodox Church of \n     Antioch, Ukrainian Orthodox Church of America, and United \n     Church of Christ.\n       The National Thoroughbred Racing Association.\n\n  Mr. KYL. This is a page and a half of religious institutions in \nsupport of this legislation.\n  Even groups that also are involved in sports that do involve some \nform of gambling, such as the National Thoroughbred Racing Association, \nunderstand that for their sport to remain pure--and it is highly \nregulated, as well--for them not to have the taint of gambling, they \nsupport this kind of legislation.\n  It has been very frustrating for me because there is such broad-based \nsupport, it makes such sense. It is so dangerous, especially for the \nkids in our\n\n[[Page S10060]]\n\nsociety. We have a very tight bill. It is quite similar to the bill \nthat got through the Committee on Banking last year. The various groups \ndirectly involved in this are supportive of the legislation, or at \nleast are not in opposition.\n  It is time to get this done before this phenomenon explodes any \nfurther and--and I underline this--before the lobbying money of these \ngroups defeats it again. I will not name names, but people who are \ntoday in trouble with the law were partially responsible for the defeat \nof this legislation previously.\n  This kind of money should not be brought to bear as a special \ninterest on our bodies to keep us from adopting important legislation \nsuch as this. That is why I have attempted to use the appropriations \nbill that is before the Senate as the vehicle to bring up this matter \nagain. I understand from a purely technical parliamentary point of view \nit is incumbent upon the distinguished ranking member of the \nsubcommittee to interpose a rule XVI objection. I understand that. I \nappreciate her need to maintain the committee jurisdiction and the \nprocess.\n  However, I note in conclusion we have legislated on appropriations \nbills in the past. So this is not something that has never been done \nbefore. I had hoped we would be permitted to do it in this case because \nof the importance of the issue, the fact that there is a very large \nconsensus to get this done. It is very difficult to do it any other \nway. I am disappointed we are not able to do it at this time.\n  When the objection is interposed, I ask the Presiding Officer's \nindulgence to direct a brief inquiry to the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I wish to acknowledge the validity of \nthe fact that the Senator from Arizona has worked long and hard on this \nissue and sees this as a consumer protection issue, and protection-of-\nour-sovereignty issue also.\n  Without taking any prejudice on the merits of the amendment, I have \nto make a point of order under rule XVI that the amendment does \nconstitute general legislation on an appropriations bill and is not in \norder.\n  Mr. KYL. With the Presiding Officer's indulgence, I ask a question, \nand I appreciate that the ranking member may not know the answer to \nthis question.\n  Can the ranking member advise me who it is that is requiring the \nimposition of this so I can speak to that Senator or those Senators to \ntry to reach some kind of an accommodation so we can take this matter \nup in the future?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I say to my friend and member of the \nJudiciary Committee, I do not know. I truly do not know. I do know that \nthese parliamentary mechanisms were worked out at the leadership level.\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate that. I appreciate the words of the ranking \nmember and make this point that this will proceed in some way at some \ntime when we find out who is making the objections, if anyone. It may \nsimply be a procedural matter to preserve the committee's jurisdiction.\n  We will proceed. It will become law at some point at some time. I ask \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle, if you have problems with \nthis legislation, please let me know so we can try to work on those \nproblems. There should be no reason we cannot move forward. We will be \nback. The next time I am back, I hope there is no one who is \ninterposing an objection.\n  I appreciate the comments of the ranking member.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I call for the ruling.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained. The amendment \nfails.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1706\n\n (Purpose: To provide funds for educational assistance to individuals \n               and schools impacted by Hurricane Katrina)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent the pending amendment be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I call for consideration of amendment No. 1706.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     and Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Reid, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n     Dodd, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n     Schumer, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Corzine, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1706.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that Senators Lautenberg and \nCorzine be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, this amendment deals with a most \nurgent matter. It is an amendment I offer on behalf of myself, Senator \nLandrieu, Senator Reid, Senator Kennedy, Senator Mikulski, Senator \nDodd, Senator Akaka, Senator Clinton, Senator Murray, Senator Dayton, \nSenator Schumer, Senator Lieberman, and as I mentioned, Senators \nLautenberg and Corzine.\n  The purpose of the amendment is to provide some level of temporary \nand immediate short-term relief to local school districts and \ncommunities that have been devastated by Hurricane Katrina. With great \nsadness, all of us, I am sure, have watched the faces of children who \nhave been impacted by this terrible tragedy. Some of those children \nhave literally lost everything. They have lost their family members, \nthey have lost their homes, their schools, and their entire \ncommunities.\n  Officials in the Department of Education estimate there are 330,000 \nchildren from Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, who have been \ndisplaced by Hurricane Katrina. Many of these children are now homeless \nand have taken up residence in emergency shelters in one State or \nanother.\n  I am confident everyone in the Senate wants to do what is right by \nthese children. What has happened at the State and local level is \namazing to watch, the way communities have come out to assist; the way \nfamilies, individuals, volunteers, nonprofit organizations have come to \nthe assistance of these children. Continuing the education of these \nchildren needs to be a top priority.\n  Right now, there are hundreds of thousands of children from New \nOrleans and Gulfport and Biloxi and Pascagoula who are sitting at \ndesks. Some of those are in Baton Rouge, some in Houston, some in \nWichita, or Albuquerque, Memphis, Olympia, or even Philadelphia. These \nschools have not only opened their doors to these displaced children, \nthey have also provided these students with classrooms, with teachers, \nwith books, with supplies, with equipment and, most importantly, with a \nquality education.\n  The obvious question is, What are the resources they are calling upon \nto do this? We know many of our school districts already face \nsignificant fiscal constraints. How can we expect these school \ndistricts to educate hundreds of thousands of additional children \nwithout additional resources?\n  We should act now and provide some immediate relief to assist the \ntransition of these students into their new and, hopefully, temporary \nclassrooms. I am, however, very concerned that some of the ideas that \nhave been discussed, at least in news accounts, are problematic and \ncould get us into a difficult circumstance in Washington.\n  For example, the Washington Post had an article that some believe \nthis tragedy is a new opportunity to proceed with a large-scale voucher \nsystem and use these children to experiment on how to implement a \nvoucher system. That would be a very unfortunate course to follow. As \neveryone in this Senate knows, when the subject of vouchers comes up, \nwe have a great deal of disagreement. We should not be debating new \nexperimental ways of providing educational assistance as part of our \neffort to assist these children in these circumstances.\n  Another example of a concern, a problem that I have seen reference \nto, is the suggestion in one piece of legislation that we should \nrequire these displaced students to wear identifying insignia to \ndifferentiate them from the other students in their new schools. \nObviously, there are all sorts of reasons we should not visit that kind \nof a requirement on these students at this point.\n\n[[Page S10061]]\n\n  The officials at the State level, at the local level, and at the \nFederal level, are just beginning to assess the magnitude of the \ndevastation that has been experienced. Unfortunately, we have already \nbegun to see the extent of the damage to some of the schools on the \ngulf coast. I understand the New Orleans School District, in \nparticular, has been almost completely destroyed. Many schools in the \nregion are still completely flooded and remain underwater and will have \nto be rebuilt completely. Others suffered extensive water and wind \ndamage and remain unsafe.\n  Last week the HELP Committee received testimony from Dr. Diane \nRoussel, the superintendent of schools in Jefferson Parish, LA, which \nhas 85 schools, 51,000 students, 3,600 teachers, that lies south of New \nOrleans. It was directly in the path of Katrina. Dr. Roussel testified \nthat in Jefferson Parish, much like the rest of Louisiana, the local \ntax base provided for much of the district's resources, and any \nsurpluses the district had have now been expended. Jefferson Parish and \nmany other school districts impacted by Hurricane Katrina are totally \nout of money, are not able to pay their teachers, are not able to \nconduct school in any way.\n  Dr. Roussel said in her testimony:\n\n       Money is not always the answer to solving the ills of our \n     public schools, but when you are talking about equipment, \n     supplies, rebuilding, and maintaining a teaching workforce, \n     money is the answer.\n\n  Communities cannot thrive without their schools. Families will not \nreturn to these communities if their children do not have a place to go \nto school. Local businesses cannot survive if those families do not \nreturn to those communities.\n  Rebuilding the schools has to be a first priority, not a last \npriority. These communities need our help now. The extent of the \ndevastation is known by all, or at least we are beginning to know.\n  Let me mention one other area of great concern that we try to address \nin this amendment, the issue of displaced college students. There are \nliterally tens of thousands of displaced college students. The colleges \nin the New Orleans area have been devastated by this storm. I am very \nencouraged to see the way other States, other educational institutions \nhave stepped up to provide assistance.\n  In my own State of New Mexico, we have some examples of that. New \nMexico State University has welcomed the University of New Orleans \nbaseball team to Las Cruces. Members of the University of New Orleans \nbaseball team will be going to school at New Mexico State University \nand playing baseball there as the New Orleans team.\n  The Federal Government needs to step up to the plate and do all it \ncan, and do so right now. The amendment does not attempt to meet all \nthe needs we will be identifying resulting from this catastrophe, but \nit does begin the process. It does indicate that the Senate believes it \nneeds to be a priority to provide some immediate relief. These \ncommunities need to know now that we are willing to act to help them.\n  It provides temporary assistance to school districts experiencing \nunexpected increases in their student populations because of Katrina. \nIt provides funds, grants to school districts, it facilitates the \ntemporary placement of students in elementary and secondary schools \nwithin their jurisdiction, and it helps to ensure that quality \ninstruction is available.\n  This is a very worthwhile amendment and one that we should adopt as \npart of this first appropriations bill being considered since we have \nreturned from the August recess. I hope very much my colleagues will \nagree to add this to the bill.\n  I understand there will be a point of order raised in connection with \nthis, but I urge my colleagues to vote with me to override that point \nof order.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1665\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I call for the regular order with \nrespect to amendment No. 1665.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1713 To Amendment No. 1665\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I send a second-degree amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1713 to amendment No. 1665.\n\n  The amendment reads as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide that funds must be used in a manner consistent \n       with the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002)\n\n       Strike all after ``Sec.  522.'' and insert the following: \n     ``None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by this Act may be used in a manner that is inconsistent with \n     the principle negotiating objective of the United States with \n     respect to trade remedy laws to preserve the ability of the \n     United States--\n       ``(1) to enforce vigorously its trade laws, including the \n     antidumping, countervailing duty, and safeguard laws;\n       ``(2) to avoid agreements that--\n       ``(A) lessen the effectiveness of domestic and \n     international disciplines on unfair trade, especially dumping \n     and subsidies; or\n       ``(B) lessen the effectiveness of domestic and \n     international safeguard provisions, in order to ensure that \n     United States workers, agricultural producers, and firms can \n     compete fully on fair terms and enjoy the benefits of \n     reciprocal trade concessions; and\n       ``(3) to address and remedy market distortions that lead to \n     dumping and subsidization, including overcapacity, \n     cartelization, and market-access barriers.''.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, what I have tried to do in this \nsecond-degree amendment is correct some flaws in the Dorgan amendment. \nMy amendment is also meant to ensure that we maintain the strength of \nour trade remedy laws.\n  My amendment makes it clear that no funds may be used to negotiate \ntrade agreements that do not enable the United States to preserve our \nability to enforce rigorously our trade laws, including antidumping and \nsafeguard laws.\n  Quite obviously, if we have laws on our books to protect our economy \nfrom unfair competition, every Senator wants to make sure those laws \nare rigorously enforced, including antidumping and safeguard laws.\n  In addition, under my amendment, our trade negotiators must avoid \nagreements that lessen the effectiveness of domestic and international \ndisciplines on unfair trade, especially for dumping and subsidies. This \npertains to a situation if they would lessen the effectiveness of \ndomestic and international safeguard provisions.\n  My amendment is a good amendment which will ensure our trade remedy \nlaws remain strong and that U.S. workers have effective protection \nagainst unfair import competition.\n  The underlying amendment I am amending, the Dorgan amendment No. \n1665, purports to do the same thing. And it might. But it also has some \nvery serious--and perhaps, hopefully, unintended--consequences. The \nDorgan amendment says no funds may be used ``to negotiate or enter into \na trade agreement that modifies or amends any law of the United States \nthat provides safeguards from unfair foreign trade practices. . . .''\n  Now, that sounds pretty good. But if you look at this amendment a \nlittle deeper, you can see that it has serious problems. Such a \nsweeping amendment would prohibit our negotiators from entering into \ntrade agreements even if the trade agreement resulted in stronger trade \nremedy laws.\n  For example, if we could not negotiate bilateral agricultural \nsafeguards similar to those we have recently negotiated in our \nbilateral agreements with Chile and Australia--and these are only two \nexamples--or maybe even in the plurilateral agreement, such as passed \nby the Senate, CAFTA--we could not negotiate multilateral agreements \nsuch as the OECD steel negotiations that could strengthen our trade \nremedy laws.\n  At the same time, the Dorgan amendment would severely hamper our \nability to negotiate trade agreements that benefit U.S. exporters.\n  Now, that may be a well-intended position of my friend from the \nagricultural State of North Dakota--and I work with him on a lot of \nagricultural legislation--but it is a slippery path where we cannot \neven discuss trade remedies even if those discussions end up \nstrengthening some of these remedies, such as in the case of CAFTA and \nAustralia and Chile.\n  It will happen that our trade partners will respond by demanding \nother items\n\n[[Page S10062]]\n\nbe taken off the table. In other words, once we go to the table in good \nfaith to negotiate, and we start saying, ``This is not negotiable, that \nis not negotiable,'' then you could understand that trading partners \nare all going to have their pet projects off the table. If we want to \nnegotiate strengthening some remedies, as we did in the case of \nAustralia, Chile, we could not do that. So I am trying to correct some \nof the inadequacies within this amendment.\n  Of course, when you start getting things taken off the table--the \nUnited States takes something off; the European Union takes something \noff; India takes something off--it has to have all items on the table \nin order to protect the economic interests of the United States. \nParticularly I found that going back to the Uruguay Round of trade \nnegotiations, you had to have everything on the table to win any \nbenefit for American agriculture.\n  The amendment by my friend from North Dakota would only serve to \nhamstring our negotiators, particularly if those negotiators want to \nstrengthen our positions, as we did in Australia and Chile. And this \namendment would be doing it at a time just as we are pushing the \nEuropeans, we are pushing the Brazilians, we are pushing the G20 group, \nthe G10 group--and for that matter I think we are pushing every other \nG-numbered group you can think of--to get some help for the American \neconomy, which comes from negotiations to get down trade barriers, to \nget all of these groups, Europeans, Brazilians, G20, G10, G-everybody, \nserious and start making meaningful concessions in these negotiations, \nespecially for the benefit of American agriculture.\n  Today, foreign agricultural markets are among the most protected \nsectors in world trade. Global tariffs on agriculture average about 62 \npercent. The United States, I believe, is about 11 percent. Thus, \nAmerica's farmers and ranchers have much to gain if we can deliver a \ncomprehensive, multilateral trade agreement that lowers tariffs across \nthe board and forces subsidizing nations to harmonize and reduce their \ntariffs.\n  Let me quantify that: 62-percent worldwide average of tariffs up here \nof other countries; the United States at 11 percent down here. We bring \nthese other countries down to ours, or down part way to ours; or if we \nbring ours down lower, as they bring theirs down lower. Common sense \ndictates a win-win situation for our farmers.\n\n  Because of some of these concerns as to the Dorgan amendment that I \nhave raised about maybe the inability to even strengthen some of our \ntrade remedies, as we did in Australia and Chile, many groups have been \nconcerned. This amendment by my distinguished friend from North Dakota \nhas been before the Senate now for about 4 days, so a lot of other \ngroups have written to me about their opposition because they are \nconcerned about it: the American Farm Bureau, the Business Roundtable, \nCoalition of Service Industries, the Comprehensive Market Access \nCoalition, the Emergency Committee for American Trade, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the National Foreign Trade Council, the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, the U.S. Council for International Business, \nand, lastly--and one that is very important to the upper Midwest--the \nCorn Refiners Association.\n  All of these groups I have listed have expressed their strong \nopposition to the Dorgan amendment and I would hope would be satisfied \nwith the amendment I have put before the Senate.\n  Even more important than those who want this bill to become law, the \nadministration has weighed in strongly against the Dorgan amendment. I \nwould like to quote from a letter I received from our Commerce \nSecretary, Mr. Gutierrez, and our U.S. Trade Representative, former \nCongressman and now Ambassador Rob Portman:\n\n     . . . Senator Dorgan's amendment would undermine our efforts \n     to protect our workers and firms from unfair trade practices \n     and to open foreign markets to America's goods and services. \n     . . . the amendment would prevent us from negotiating \n     agreements to improve protections against unfair trade \n     practices where the current rules may not be fully effective.\n\n  Then they go on to say:\n\n       The amendment could also prevent us from negotiating \n     stronger disciplines on foreign subsidies and protections for \n     U.S. exporters against abuses by foreign users of trade \n     remedy laws.\n\n  In fact, the Secretary and the Ambassador feel so strongly about the \ndamages this amendment could do, they sent a letter saying they would \nrecommend that the President veto the Commerce-Justice-Science \nappropriations bill if the Dorgan amendment is included.\n  So the bottom line: the choice is pretty simple. If Senators want to \ntake away an opportunity to strengthen trade remedy laws, in effect, \nhamper our negotiators, and at the same time ensure a veto of this \nbill, a veto of a bill that is very important, then support the Dorgan \namendment. But if Senators want to preserve strong trade remedy laws, \nand even opportunities to make them stronger, and avoid a veto, then \nplease support my second-degree amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to carefully consider the stakes in this vote. I \nthink the stakes are high. There is a way to both preserve and improve \nour trade remedy laws, also a way of avoiding a Presidential veto, and \nthat would be voting for my amendment No. 1713, which is a second-\ndegree amendment to the Dorgan amendment No. 1665.\n  I do not know whether the Senator from North Dakota intended to not \ngive our negotiators an opportunity to strengthen our trade remedy \nlaws, as we did in Australia and Chile, but my amendment will take care \nof that oversight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, my colleague from Iowa, Senator \nGrassley, has offered a second-degree amendment to the amendment I have \npending dealing with our trade laws. This amendment is just fine, as \nfar as I am concerned. I hope everyone will support it. It restates \nwhat is already in the underlying bill. It reminds me of those days \nwhen, as a young boy, I used to buy magic kits and they would have \nvanishing ink. You would write it and then you wouldn't see it. There \nwas nothing there. So we have these vanishing ink amendments that mean \nnothing, say nothing, do nothing. I am for it. We apparently will have \nan opportunity to vote on the Grassley amendment. I hope we will have \nside-by-side opportunities to vote on the Grassley amendment that does \nnothing, and then an amendment that does something, something that \nstands up for the economic interests of the American people.\n  This is probably one of the only institutions in the entire world in \nwhich failure is deemed a success, and the more failure, the more we \nought to do of it, according to the philosophy of some here in the \nSenate.\n  This chart shows our trade deficits, the red ink. This is the record \ntrade deficit of last year, and it is going to be higher now. This is a \ndescription of how much we are buying from abroad more than we are \nselling abroad and, therefore, a description of how many American jobs \nare being sent abroad. That is what it means. Every single day--today \nis Thursday--we buy $2 billion more from other countries in goods and \nservices than we sell to other countries. That means every single day \nsomeone outside of this country ends up with a $2 billion claim against \nAmerica, American assets, American securities, American property.\n  Does it matter? To some it doesn't. Some think this is wonderful. \nThey are like hogs in a corncrib; they can't get enough of this. Why? \nBecause as we move American jobs overseas and fire American workers and \nthen hire workers in Bangladesh or Indonesia or China, and pay them 33 \ncents an hour to make bicycles and trinkets and trousers and shirts and \nshoes, and send them to the big box retailers in America in Toledo and \nLos Angeles and Chicago and Fargo, the consumer gets to go in and buy \nan Etch A Sketch for $9.99 or a shirt for $9.99.\n  What a wonderful thing that is that the consumers get to buy a cheap \nshirt\n\n[[Page S10063]]\n\nmade in Indonesia or China, a shirt that used to be made by an American \nworker who got fired. Because we buy all of that merchandise, goods and \nservices from abroad every day, and because China ships $170 billion \nmore of it to our country in 1 year than it buys from our country, it \nmeans American jobs are leaving in wholesale numbers.\n  So this is what results, massive trade deficits, getting worse and \nworse, and nobody seems to care. This body, the White House, the entire \nCongress seems to sleep through it all. It is kind of a ``Rip Van \nWinkle'' public policy strategy. Why? Because there is not one person \nhere who is going to lose their job over it. There is not one person \nwearing suspenders, not one person wearing a blue suit or smoking a \ncigar who is going to lose their job because jobs are outsourced to \nIndonesia or China. It is working folks. Bob Wills of the Texas \nPlayboys--I have quoted him often in a song from 1941 which says: The \nlittle bee sucks the blossom, the big bee gets the honey. The little \nguy picks the cotton, the big guy gets the money.\n  So it is all of this red ink for America and jobs moving overseas \nwhich is represented as a foundation of injury to American workers and \nprofits to those who can pole-vault over all of those nuances in public \npolicy, such as child labor laws, minimum wages, environmental laws, \nthe right to organize.\n  Well, the small trade amendment I have offered to this bill that \ncaused such an apoplectic seizure yesterday so that we could not \ncontinue to vote, that small trade amendment I offered, does the \nfollowing: It says there is a trade negotiation going on in a place \ncalled Doha. Not many have been to Doha. It is not a secret why trade \nnegotiations are held behind closed doors in Doha because if they held \nthem in any major city in the world there would be traffic jams with \nprotesters, people concerned about what this is doing to their jobs.\n  There is a negotiation going on in Doha, and in that negotiation \nother countries have objected to something we have done in this \ncountry. We have something called antidumping laws to try to protect \nAmerican businesses, American farmers, American workers. If other \ncountries decide, look, we are going to target the American \nmarketplace, there is only one American marketplace on this Earth of \nours, we are going to target it because we want to go in and dump \nproducts at below cost, destroy the domestic industry, and then we will \nhave the entire market to ourselves in the United States. If they try \nto do that, it is unfair trade. That is unfair trade.\n  So we have something called antidumping laws that would take action \nagainst those countries that try to engage in unfair trade. We also \nhave laws that deal with countervailing duties if a country is deeply \nsubsidizing its product in order to dump it into the U.S. marketplace. \nSo we have protections for American businesses, American workers, \nAmerican farmers, American ranchers.\n  At the trade negotiation in Doha, other countries are demanding that \nwe get rid of the protections that exist that would prohibit dumping of \nproducts into our marketplace. They demand that we get rid of these \nprotections. Our trade negotiators have said, all right, everything is \non the table to be negotiated. It should not be, and I do not agree \nthat it should be, and so I have introduced an amendment that says \nnothing in this act that funds our U.S. trade ambassador's office or \nthe Commerce Department should allow them or can allow them to engage \nin negotiations that will weaken the basic protections that exist in \nthis country that require trade fairness.\n  The White House has issued a veto notice if my amendment should pass. \nCurious and strange that a provision that stands up for the economic \ninterests of our country would engender a threatened veto from the \nWhite House.\n  The Cato Institute has sent around the following, and they can be \ncounted on, by the way, to provide aggressive support. They have \neverything except the pompoms to be bona fide cheerleaders. As we get \nin deeper and deeper trouble, these folks think moral failure \nrepresents success. Here is what the Cato Institute says: This \namendment--speaking of my amendment--is highly irresponsible, \nshortsighted, opportunistic, and severely detrimental to the U.S. \neconomic interests and the conduct of U.S. trade and foreign policy.\n  I do not know, but as I read that work, it seems they do not support \nmy amendment.\n  The United States hopes to open foreign agricultural, \nnonagricultural, and service markets. To achieve those goals, it must \nbe willing to reform its agricultural and antidumping policies. What \ndoes that mean? The United States must be willing to reform its \npolicies on antidumping and agricultural policies? Interesting, is it \nnot?\n  This is what the Cato Institute is really saying: We have to get rid \nof these protections that exist in current law in this country to \nprotect American workers and American business. We have to get rid of \nthat because others do not like it, so let us negotiate it away. If it \nhurts farmers, so what. I mean, that is the attitude. Talk about \nelitists. A lot of people throw around the term ``elitists.''\n\n  If it hurts farmers and ranchers, so what; just negotiate away the \nprotections that currently exist for farmers and ranchers in \ninternational trade, protections incidentally that are seldom \nimplemented because we have trade officials who do not have a will, a \nbackbone, or a nerve. Aside from those anatomical deficiencies, they \nexist in law. Now we have people who want to negotiate away the basic \nprotections.\n  My colleague has come to the floor to offer a second-degree \namendment, the purpose of which is to kill the basic premise of what I \nam trying to do. The second-degree amendment is interesting, and I was \nat first thinking curious, but it is not curious because it is simple. \nIt simply restates that which is in current law. It will do nothing to \nprevent our negotiators from doing what they say they are able to do in \nthe current Doha negotiations, which is to negotiate away the basic \nprotections that exist for our farmers, our ranchers, our businesses, \nand our workers.\n  The Cato Institute further says: If Senator Dorgan is unhappy with \nthe final text of the Doha agreement, should it come to fruition, he \ncan vote against its passage.\n  Well, one can do that for sure. The only thing one cannot do is they \ncannot amend it. Why? Because this Congress, with the support of Cato \nand the President, decided what would be smart for all of us to do is \nput all of us in a straitjacket and decide beforehand that we will give \nfast-track trade authority for people to negotiate--in this case in \nDoha--behind closed doors, in secret, and the product they bring back \nto this institution will not be able to be amended. We are able to \namend almost anything else, including nuclear arms agreements, but \ntrade agreements, no; no, because those are negotiated in secret. And \nwhen they come back, they come back under something called fast track. \nSo there are no amendments, even to correct the obvious deficiencies.\n  We have had almost this exact scenario previously. It occurred in \n2002, May 14, my birthday, incidentally. We had an amendment on the \nfloor of the Senate by Senator Dayton and Senator Craig, a bipartisan \namendment, that would have done essentially the same thing. It said \nthere is no fast-track authority for any trade agreement that comes \nback in which our negotiators have negotiated away the basic \nprotections, the antidumping laws and so on, that exist for our \nfarmers, ranchers, and businesses. That passed with 61 votes. It was \ntrue then that I believe either Senator Grassley or Senator Baucus \noffered another amendment that was kind of a cover amendment, and that \npassed 98 to 0 because it did not particularly mean much. It set up \nobjectives but objectives that are similar to a strainer, enough holes \nso that whatever one wants to put through it goes through it.\n  So Senator Grassley now has a second-degree amendment that says: Let \nus all agree to that which we previously agreed to that does not do \nanything.\n  So sign me up. If there is a list, let me be signed up real quick to \nsay: Let me agree to that which was previously agreed to that does \nnothing. And then we will have a vote on my amendment that says: Let us \nstand up for the economic interests of this country; let us stand up \nfor the economic interests of businesses and workers and insist to\n\n[[Page S10064]]\n\nother countries that the right way to do trade is fair trade. If it is \nnot fair, then every country has a right to use its remedies to address \nand take action against unfair trade.\n  I mentioned yesterday we very seldom take any kind of action under \nany circumstances. We do not ever take trade action. We did once \nagainst Europe recently. We slapped the Europeans with tariffs on \ntruffles, goose liver, and Roquefort cheese. That scared the devil out \nof the Europeans. This big old strong country decided to take action \nagainst Europe. We are going to single out truffles, Roquefort cheese, \nand goose liver.\n  That is hardly the ``John Wayne'' approach to dealing with what we \nunderstand and know to be unfair trade.\n  This represents a crisis. This represents a real problem, and nobody \nseems to care very much. My amendment is an attempt to prevent further \ndamage in the new negotiations. It is not, as the Cato Institute \ninsists, that I do not believe in trade. I believe in expanded trade. I \nbelieve it makes sense to have expanded trade, provided it is fair. I \nbelieve trade ought to try to lift other countries up, not press \nAmerican workers and firms down.\n  Perhaps there will come a time when we will look back and say: Why \ndid we not understand what this meant to our country? Why did we not \nunderstand the danger that buying $2 billion a day from abroad more \nthan we send abroad in exports, the danger that portrayed to our \neconomy? Why did we not understand that? Why did we not catch it? Why \ndid somebody not blow the whistle on it?\n  My hometown is 400 people, and we had a whistle similar  to a lot of \nhometowns. We have a fire whistle, but it is also used for other \npurposes. Every noon, the whistle blew in my hometown. Every day at 6 \nthe fire whistle blew in my hometown. Every day at 10 the whistle blew. \nWe had the fire whistle blowing three times in a town of 400 people. \nSmall towns did that to signal that it is 12. Everybody in town should \nknow it is 12, the fire whistle is blowing. We do not have any signals \naround here.\n\n  I would like to see somebody blow a whistle around here at some \npoint. When do you blow the whistle--at a $700 billion, $800 billion, \n$1 trillion trade deficit in 1 year? We had people doing gymnastic \nexercises earlier this week because the trade deficit in the past \nmonth, I think it was announced last Friday, was only 57-plus-billion \ndollars in 1 single month, the fifth worst trade deficit in history, \nand people said: What a great thing that is. It actually improved a \nlittle from the month before momentarily.\n  My only point is, I think that those who are content to sleep through \nwhat is a growing American crisis do no favors to American workers and \nAmerican business and certainly do no favors to future economic \nopportunity in this great country of ours. This country is measured in \nterms of its wealth, not by what it consumes but rather by what it \nproduces, and if we do not stand up for producers to insist and demand \nfair trade, yes, ranchers and farmers, manufacturers and businesses, we \ndo not have the strength and backbone to do that, if we are content to \nlet people with tiny, little glasses and big degrees go halfway around \nthe world, behind closed doors, and negotiate in secret trade \nagreements that continue to give us this kind of performance and move \nAmerican jobs overseas and undermine American business and undermine \nAmerican farmers and ranchers, then this Senate and this Congress ought \nto hang its head.\n  We can do a lot better, and should, and the place to start the first \nbaby step, in my judgment, is to start with two things: Vote for the \nGrassley second-degree amendment that says we agree with which we have \npreviously agreed and want to vote yes for something that does nothing, \nbut it does not harm anything, so we will all vote yes and then vote \nfor the amendment that I have offered--it has been now pending for \nalmost a week--that does stand up for this country's economic \ninterests. It does not impede fair trade or free trade. It demands and \ninsists that we have the right to protect ourselves when others will \nuse trade practices to injure our country, our workers, our \nmanufacturers, our farmers, our ranchers. So we will vote at some point \nand my hope is that those who feel as I do will support the amendment I \nhave offered for the reasons I have described.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1713, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the \nGrassley amendment No. 1713 be modified to be a first-degree amendment \nand that at 11:45, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the \nGrassley amendment No. 1713, as modified, to be followed by a vote in \nrelation to the Dorgan amendment No. 1665, with no amendments in order \nto the amendments prior to the votes and with 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided prior to the second vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There are now 2 minutes equally \ndivided on the Dorgan amendment.\n  Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have spoken previously on this \namendment. I will not prolong the debate. This amendment is very \nsimple. It says that our negotiators, in negotiating a new trade round, \nshall not be allowed to negotiate the weakening of the basic \nprotections in our trade law, antidumping laws, countervailing duties, \nthe protections that protect American ranchers and farmers and \nbusinesses and workers. We must stand up for the economic interests of \nthis country.\n  The reason this amendment is necessary is because it has been widely \nannounced that our negotiators are prepared to agree with others to lay \non the table the weakening of our basic protections, such as \nantidumping laws and countervailing duties. That would injure this \ncountry, move more jobs outside of this country, hurt farmers, \nranchers, businesses, and workers.\n  I hope support for this amendment will send a very strong signal to \nthose who are negotiating these trade treaties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to vote against this \namendment, No. 1, because Commerce Secretary Gutierrez and Mr. Portman, \nour Trade Representative, have said they are going to recommend a veto \nof the bill if the Dorgan amendment is adopted.\n  Also, I have these organizations that have sent a letter in \nopposition to the amendment. The organizations include the American \nFarm Bureau Federation, the American Peanut Product Manufacturers, \nInc., the American Soybean Association, the Corn Refiners Association, \nthe Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, the Food Products \nAssociation, the Grocery Manufacturers Association, the International \nDairy Foods Association, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the \nNational Chicken Council, the National Corn Growers Association, et \ncetera, et cetera--with about eight more I could read.\n  We have adopted my amendment now. We have a policy that is broad to \nmake sure things are not weakened, but if they want to be strengthened, \nthey can be strengthened, as well, as we don't take a lot of things off \nthe negotiating table. If we are going to be successful in agriculture, \nwe have to have a broad number of issues on the table to get any \nsuccess for agriculture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.

Mr. President, on Tuesday night, Senator Baucus and I \nintroduced a package of tax relief measures designed to help the \nvictims of Hurricane Katrina both in the short and long term.\n  We know that tax incentives helped to revitalize New York after 9/11. \nThey can do the same for New Orleans, Gulfport, and other hurricane-hit \nareas. We are pleased that the Members of the affected region join us \nin this effort, including Senators Lott, Landrieu, Vitter, Cochran, and \nShelby.\n  The immediate relief package will help get short-term aid to the \nhurricane victims by encouraging food donations and the employment of \ndisplaced persons, as two examples.\n  For those who have suffered casualty losses, we have liberalized the \ntax rules to permit affected taxpayers to deduct losses from damaged \nproperty.\n  We also want to help protect Katrina victims from undeserved IRS \nharassment.\n  We expect to see prompt action by Congress on this tax relief \npackage. We need to get these tax incentives on the books and help \nKatrina victims make a fresh start.\n  After this package is completed, our focus in the committee will be \non longer term tax incentives to help rebuild homes and businesses. We \nare looking at depreciation changes, tax-exempt bond authority, and \nenterprise zone initiatives.\n  Life will never be the same for our fellow citizens in the gulf \nregion, and what we have all seen over the last 2 weeks will stay in \nthe hearts and minds of all of us for years to come.\n  With this first initiative from the Finance Committee, a bipartisan \ninitiative--and I thank Senator Baucus for his extreme cooperation, in \nfact, even leadership in getting this to where it is now--this first \ninitiative--and there are going to be more in other areas where we have \njurisdiction--we want the victims in all the affected areas to know \nthey can count on us to create a set of measures that will help return \nvitality and vigor to the gulf region.\n  Mr. President, I defer now to Senator Baucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Grassley, \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee. We believe that Congress must \nact quickly. We bypassed the usual committee process. Senator Grassley \nand I sat down with our staffs and said: What can we do right away to \nhelp Katrina victims? What can we do to help the States and get \nsomething passed very quickly?\n  Time is of the essence, clearly. We decided that people needed cash. \nSo we have enacted several provisions in this legislation which allows \npeople to have more cash or ways so they do not have to make payments \nthat otherwise they would have to make.\n  Second, we are trying to help ease some of the dire housing \nconditions in the affected areas. We have provisions which allow people \nto take an exemption for taking in Katrina victims. We think that will \nhelp significantly.\n  We are also helping by giving incentives to employers so they can \nmore quickly hire people and, if they cannot hire them, we are going to \nmake sure we get more dollars into former employees' pockets.\n  This is a start. We clearly have to do more. I very much hope that \nlater on today we can pass legislation with respect to Medicaid \nassistance. Senator Grassley and I have been working very hard in both \nthese areas. In the not too long term, we obviously are going to bring \nup a package for long-term assistance--enterprise zones, increasing \nappreciation acceleration, bonding authority--to help rebuild the \ninfrastructure.\n  I thank Senator Grassley very much for his help. I also thank him \nvery much for helping clear some objections to this bill on the other \nside. There were two Republican holds on this bill today. I had hoped \nto bring this bill up this morning and get it passed. We did have some \nholds. I thank very much the Senator from Iowa for his help in getting \nthose holds released so we can get this bill passed.\n  I also hope, as I mentioned, we can get the Medicaid bill passed \ntoday. This is the week. We have to pass this legislation. We, as \nSenators, cannot get too wrapped around the axle. We cannot be too \nconcerned about how the I's are dotted or the T's are crossed. We have \nto act. Congress will meet another day. We can make up differences. We \ncan amend legislation in future days if something is not quite perfect \neither today or in the next couple of days. Let's not let perfection be \nthe enemy of the good here.\n  This is good legislation. We are getting this tax package passed. \nThat is good. I very much hope we can get the Medicaid package passed. \nIt is good, too.\n  I urge all of us to work together and rise to the occasion. This is \nan emergency. Let's get this legislation passed--not only this package \nbut the Medicaid package as well.\n  Again, I thank Senator Grassley for working to get those holds on the \nbill removed so we could get this legislation passed.\n  I am proud to announce that Saturday is the Senator's birthday. So I \nhope this will be a good birthday present for the Senator, to get both \nof these bills passed today so we can, on this coming Saturday, know \nthat a couple days earlier, the chairman of the Finance Committee got \nlegislation passed that did some good for people in the affected area.\n  Mr. President, I thank the chairman for helping.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, obviously, I thank Senator Baucus for \nthe personal comment he made about my upcoming birthday. More \nimportantly, once again, we have had such smooth working relationships \non these two very important bills. Our staffs have cooperated very \nclosely. There has been some compromise but not a lot because I think \nwe are all going in the same direction.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, pursuant to the remarks I \nmade and the remarks Senator Baucus has made, that the Committee on \nFinance be discharged from further consideration of S. 1696 and that \nthe Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n\n[[Page S10067]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1696) to provide tax relief for the victims of \n     Hurricane Katrina, to provide incentives for charitable \n     giving, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank Senate Finance Chairman Grassley \nand Ranking Member Baucus for their extraordinary work, to so \nexpeditiously draft this important legislation in a bipartisan manner. \nThis package will provide immediate tax relief to those directly \naffected by this incredible disaster.\n  As we have rightfully focused on rescuing, reuniting and rebuilding, \nwe must also make sure to take care of our strained military families. \nThe first and best definition of patriotism is keeping faith with those \nwho wear our uniform. That means giving our troops the resources they \nneed to keep safe while they are keeping us safe. And it means \nsupporting our troops at home as well as abroad.\n  More than 40 percent of military reservists and National Guard \nmemberssuffer pay cut when they are called to defend our Nation, \nincluding those serving in the gulf coast today. These citizens serve \nnobly. They are much more than weekend warriors. Currently, there are \nover 140,000 reservists called up for active duty in the war against \nterrorism and over 10,000 of these reservists and guardsman are from \nLouisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. Over 50,000 National Guard members \nhave been called up to assist with Hurricane Katrina.\n  Many of these reservists are being hit with a double-whammy. After \nrecent service in Iraq or Afghanistan, they are coming home to an area \nthat has been devastated. The all-volunteer Army depends on these \nreservists. They have been serving our country with distinction and \npride for many years, and should not be penalized financially for their \nhonorable service.\n  Businesses on the gulf coast want to do the right thing for their \nemployees. But in the wake of this disaster, most just can't afford it. \nThis legislation will help businesses do the right thing. The bill will \nprovide an employee retention credit which provides a 40 percent tax \ncredit for wages paid up to $6,000 after August 28, 2005 and before \nDecember 31, 2005. This credit will help employers in the gulf coast \nwho pay employees that are not able to work because the business was \neither damaged or destroyed and pay reservists and guardsmen that \nworked for them right up to the time before they were deployed.\n  For the last couple of years, Senator Landrieu and I have worked on \nlegislation to provide assistance to businesses that employ reservists \nwho have been called up to active duty. That legislation would provide \ntax credits to employers who pay reservists wages that are above their \nmilitary pay and to help with the costs of hiring replacement workers. \nI thank Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus for working with me \nto include wages paid to eligible reservists and guardsman as part of \nthe employee retention tax credit.\n  The Hurricane Katrina tax relief legislation helps our reservists and \nthe businesses that employ them to ensure that our great tradition of \ncitizen soldiers does not fade or end because of the effect service can \nhave on work and family in this time of crisis.\n  I am also pleased that this tax package has a set of provisions to \nencourage charitable giving. We have all been overwhelmed by the \ngenerosity and compassion of the American people, who have sacrificed \ntheir time and money, sent food and supplies south by the truckload, \nand even opened up their homes to strangers. This provision will make \ngiving easier, particularly by allowing rollover contributions from IRA \naccounts.\n  This legislation is the right thing to do in the face of this \ndisaster. It can help make sure our reservists' families don't have to \nsacrifice beyond their means while our brave men and women are away \nfrom home helping other families. This legislation can make it easier \nfor the incomparable generosity of the American people to continue by \neasing some restrictions on charitable giving.\n  Again, I thank Senators Grassley and Baucus for their efforts on this \npackage.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment at the desk be agreed to, that the bill, as amended, be read \nthe third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that the bill be held at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1722) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The bill (S. 1696), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I was honored to join Majority Leader \nFrist in cosponsoring S. Res. 238 recognizing Hispanic Heritage Month \nand celebrating the vast contributions of Hispanic Americans to the \nstrength and culture of our Nation. S. Res. 238 passed the Senate by \nunanimous consent today, September 15, the kickoff of a month-long \ncelebration and observation of Hispanic-American strength and culture \nin this country.\n  Diversity truly represents the best of America, a nation where each \nof us can be proud of our ancestry, our heritage, and our native \nlanguage, yet a nation\n\n[[Page S10068]]\n\nwhere we at the same time can stand together with our neighbor, \nregardless of our own background, and all call ourselves Americans.\n  Hispanic Americans have much to be proud of and much to celebrate. I \nhave said this before, but I am so proud to have been elected the first \nCuban American in the Senate. I feel a great weight of responsibility \nin representing not only the Cuban-American community and the great \nState of Florida but in a way the entire Hispanic-American community in \nour country. I know my colleague from Colorado, Senator Salazar, must \nfeel the same weight of responsibility. I am very honored to serve in \nthis Senate with him.\n  As I like to say, in America, when you work hard and play by the \nrules, anything is possible. This year, Judge Alberto Gonzales was \nsworn in as our Attorney General.\n  Alberto Gonzales is the first Hispanic American to ever serve in one \nof the four elite Cabinet posts in Government--Defense, Treasury, State \nand Attorney General, which he now proudly occupies. He is an \ninspiration for our next generation. The second Cuban American to serve \nin the President's Cabinet also took office this year--Secretary Carlos \nGutierrez at the Department of Commerce. I was proud to support both \ntheir nominations.\n  We have made great strides in breaking into the highest echelons of \nGovernment. And although I do not want to employ any litmus test of \nethnicity, there would indeed be much to celebrate if our next Supreme \nCourt nominee became the first Hispanic-American Justice of the Supreme \nCourt.\n  Hispanic pride in our heritage has helped many look to their past for \nstrength and use this strength to forge a better future for ourselves \nand our families in all facets of American life. Our achievements have \ngreatly influenced America's policymaking, its economy, and the medical \nand artistic fields. \n  In fact, we should also point out that many Hispanic Americans \nproudly serve in our Armed Forces during this time of need. In fact, \nmany have given their last measure of sacrifice, while others have \nsuffered serious injuries.\n  But moving to other fields, now-deceased Cuban-American business \nleader and former chief executive officer of Coca-Cola Roberto Goizueta \nclimbed the corporate ranks and helped Coca-Cola remain one of the \npremier brands around the world. Nobel Prize winner Severo Ochoa \ndiscovered the process that allows humans to create RNA in a test tube.\n\n  My close and personal friend, Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, \nbecame the first Hispanic-American woman and first Cuban-American to be \nelected to the U.S. Congress. And within the artistic field, Brazilian \nartist Romero Britto, whose concern for the youth of the world, \ncombined with social and political sources, has had his work appear in \nover 60 national and international publications.\n  Just like throughout the Nation, the Hispanic community within \nFlorida continues to grow rapidly, and our creativity and ingenuity \nkeep contributing to American culture. Hispanic American and owner of \nNGI Solutions, Martha Korman, is making significant economic \ncontributions to the greater Tampa area.\n  Puerto Ricans, like Orange County Commissioner Mildred Fernandez, \nclimbed the ranks and is working to encourage homeownership and growth \nof small businesses in the Orlando region.\n  Like many other Hispanics, Cuban-American Gus Machado began with \nnothing but a dream and dedicated himself to his business and his \ncommunity, making him today the owner of the number one Ford car \ndealerships in the Miami area. In Jacksonville, FL, Dr. Javier Garcia-\nBengochea made his mark as the innovator of several instruments and \nsystems used to improve spinal surgeries.\n  And in Florida, just this week, a young man named Marco Rubio was \nnamed the first Cuban-American Speaker in the Florida House of \nRepresentatives, and, I might add, the first Hispanic American. I know \nthat he is going to be a great leader and voice for the State of \nFlorida, and a great role model for our next generation of Hispanic \nAmericans who want to make a difference.\n  We are proud to be Americans. We gladly stand together with all \nAmericans of all races, creeds, and beliefs in this great country that \nwe call home.\n  Our goal in observing Hispanic Heritage Month is not to set ourselves \napart, but to ask our fellow citizens to join us in celebrating our \nculture, our heritage, and our achievements.\n  With great pride we celebrate the pioneers in our Nation and in \nFlorida during this National Hispanic Heritage Month.\n  We pay tribute to America's diversity and honor the countless \ncontributions Hispanics have made throughout the history of this great \ncountry.\n  And finally, we celebrate the values of the Hispanic-American \ncommunity--family, faith, liberty, love of this country and love of our \nroots.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ.

Mr. President, it has been 3 weeks since Hurricane \nKatrina came ashore bringing with her a wide swath of damage. Her winds \nwhipped structures to devastation, her rains destroyed thousands of \nagricultural crops, and, sadly, the force of this storm resulted in \ndeath.\n  While I rise to speak of Hurricane Katrina, I do want to focus my \nremarks on the devastation this storm brought to the State of Florida. \nWe all know of the devastation on the Gulf Coast States of Alabama, \nMississippi, and Louisiana. Before that, Katrina paid a costly and \ndeadly visit to the State of Florida. Florida suffered 14 deaths and \nover $1 billion in damages.\n  The Governor declared a state of emergency and evacuations took \nplace. As you may recall, last year, Florida was visited by four \nserious hurricanes. By the time Katrina hit, we already had received \nover 150 percent of the normal rainfall for the year. And more rain \nbrought about a substantial amount of flooding.\n  Before Katrina came to Florida, we had been visited by, as I said, \nfour hurricanes last year. Over 10 percent of Florida's homes were \ndamaged. The storm displaced tens of thousands of people into shelters, \nand today over 20,000 Floridians are still living in some form of \ntransitional housing.\n  The backlog of roof repair is so severe that we are sending our \nchildren to schools that are developing mold problems. Whole sectors of \nour agricultural industry are devastated. Frankly, it will take years \nto replant and renourish those crops.\n  I wish to take a few moments to mention that even though the people \nof my State are still recovering from the effects of Katrina and Dennis \nand Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne--even though folks are still \nliving in trailers outside of their homes that have blue tarps on their \nroofs, Floridians are proudly pitching in to help the people of the \ngulf coast region.\n  Sarasota, FL, is sending teams of 140 trained Red Cross volunteers in \n2-week cycles and in some cases longer than that. These volunteers are \nheaded to the very areas where evacuees are streaming out. There is no \npower, no clean water, no hot showers. They are bringing evacuees back \nwith them to Sarasota County--over 300 so far.\n  Early this week, I had occasion to visit the Red Cross center in \nOrlando. Over 200 people are volunteering their services there, as \nhundreds and expected thousands of evacuees are coming into that \ncentral Florida area, where they are finding that the hotel industry \nhas made arrangements for them to receive temporary housing in the area \nof many hotels, and, at the same time, the community is pouring out \ntheir love and their care in helping find jobs and dealing with issues \nof physical as well as mental health, as well as incorporating children \ninto the school system.\n  The Tampa Incident Management Group has sent 22 members to Hancock \nCounty, MS, where they have worked\n\n[[Page S10069]]\n\n16-hour days for 7 days. The group included emergency management \npersonnel, firefighters, logistical support, public information \nofficers, police, and crisis counselors. One of the members of the \nHardee County EOC, Mr. Richard Shepard, says he felt a responsibility \nto go to Mississippi because he needed to give something back for all \nthe help he had received last year.\n  The South Florida Urban Search and Rescue Team, comprised of 80 \nfirefighters from agencies throughout Miami-Dade and Broward Counties, \nreturned home after spending nearly 2 weeks helping Hurricane Katrina \nvictims in the gulf coast.\n  A group of Bascom Palmer Eye Institute ophthalmologists is heading to \nBaton Rouge this week aboard the institute's 40-foot Vision Van to \ntreat displaced victims of Hurricane Katrina who have lost eyeglasses \nand suffered other vision problems because of the storm.\n  The Panama City Boatmen's Association sent a three-truck convoy to \nLouisiana and Mississippi. Among the supplies: 150 cases of water, 80 \ncases of Gatorade, and 10 large bags of dog and cat food because the \nevacuees said they had something to eat, but their pets were literally \nstarving.\n  Similar stories can be heard from throughout the State of Florida. \nMembers of our Armed Forces and our National Guard have also answered \nthe call and sought to help. But I want to particularly talk about a \nFlorida resident and Navy pilot. LT J.G. Bale Dalton is a member of \nHelicopter Sea Combat Squadron 21--the Blackjack Squadron out of \nSan Diego. When the call came through that hurricane relief was needed, \nhis squadron flew helicopters across the country in order to be there \nin time for them to help. Now his father, who is my dear and long-time \nfriend--currently my general counsel--Skip Dalton, has allowed me to \nread a little bit from his communications in those first few frantic \ndays.\n\n  Writes LT J.G. Bale Dalton, on September 3:\n\n       My first flight into New Orleans was incredibly hectic. We \n     went due east from Pensacola, so I was not able to see any of \n     the Mississippi coast. The scene was chaos. Hardly anyone was \n     able to get into the city on the ground, and the water was \n     still rising. Helicopters from all services and even \n     civilians were operating in the area, rescuing people and \n     bringing food and supplies to rally points.\n       An airborne command and control element P-3 was tasking \n     airplanes as fast as they could, but most often they were not \n     able to give more than a GPS coordinate and a ``good luck.''\n\n  Another entry from September 3:\n\n       We were sent to a nursing home to remove what we thought \n     were invalid older people. What we found was a small island \n     of land with a field large enough to land three helicopters \n     around what used to be a nursing home. We moved approximately \n     50 people--all families that were directed by New Orleans \n     police to that spot.\n\n  September 4:\n\n       No rest for the weary. After returning to work with about \n     five hours of rest (not sleep, just time from landing to \n     briefing again) we again began to build a picture of what was \n     going on.\n       People that had been stranded since the day the storm hit \n     were beginning to come out of the woodwork. It was obvious \n     that the first priority was to save people from the rising \n     tides.\n       I went back into New Orleans later that day with a mission \n     to find fire buckets and begin putting out fires.\n\n       Here is another entry from later that day:\n\n       We attempted to hoist people from an apartment complex into \n     our helicopter, but were refused when they saw an ambulance a \n     few blocks away that they were going to try to swim to.\n       Hard to understand for me, but I am sure the thought of \n     being hoisted up on a wire to a helicopter is a scary \n     prospect for most people. We moved from that area to an \n     affected area in the northern part of the city to begin \n     evacuating another group of people gathered by the police. We \n     landed on a tennis court to get these people. They had not \n     had food or water for five days.\n\n  I could go on and on with stories of Floridians helping out in the \ngulf coast, providing relief, aid, assistance, and, as you heard in the \ncase of Navy LT J.G. Bale Dalton, rescuing people from the rising \ntides. But dramatic as these stories are, they are not unusual. This is \nwhat America is all about. If there is a need, Americans are there to \nhelp.\n  Given the impact of the stories and images of the devastation, I \nunderstand how our hearts and minds are turned to these current \nproblems. But I am humbly here to ask that we simply do not overlook \nthe fact that there has been a lot of suffering in Florida, that we, \ntoo, have suffered significant losses as a result of four very \ndifficult hurricanes last year--an unprecedented number of major \nhurricanes to hit, crisscrossing the State of Florida--only to be \nrevisited again by Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina this year. The extent \nof hurricane damage from last year was severe. In fact, we continue to \ntry to dig out from under it.\n  Affordable long-term housing is one of the serious problems we are \nfacing in Florida not only because of so much housing stock, \nparticularly the affordable type, that was damaged last year, but now \nwith the influx of evacuees into the State, some real long-term \nproblems are beginning to present themselves. I have contacted the \nPresident and Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns. I have talked with \nFEMA and my colleagues in the Senate. We have received some measure of \nassistance, but we must continue to look forward to the time when all \nFloridians will be made whole and when life will begin to be normal \nagain for all Floridians.\n  Katrina did pay us a devastating visit in the early part of that \nstorm. So while we continue to pour our hearts out to those in the gulf \ncoast, I do have to hope that the people of Florida will not be \nforgotten, as we seek to make all of the necessary decisions for the \nrelief and recovery not only short term and medium term, but where \nFlorida is now in the long term, when the needs of long-term housing, \nthe needs of long-term health care problems, the needs of \nreconstruction of public facilities, such as schools, become all the \nmore necessary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10069-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10069-S10070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION'S REORGANIZATION\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, earlier today, the Federal Communications \nCommission Chairman, Kevin Martin, created a new FCC bureau dedicated \nto public safety and homeland security functions. The new FCC bureau \nwill be named the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau and will \nhandle issues that are currently spread over several separate FCC \nbureaus and offices. For instance, it will handle enhanced 911 calls. \nIt will handle priority emergency services, an emergency alert system, \ndisaster management coordination, and communications infrastructure \nprotection.\n  My generation relied on radio. Now all of us have different forms of \ncommunications. But there was no uniform communication mechanism such \nas radio was back in the 1930s or 1940s. Chairman Martin's \nreorganization recognizes the change in the technologies that can be \nused for emergency communications.\n  I commend the FCC, under Chairman Martin, for its leadership in \ndirecting the Universal Service Program to play a significant role in \nrebuilding the communications infrastructure, something that they have \nannounced today also. Since its inception, the focus of the Universal \nService Program has been on ensuring that all Americans are connected \nand able to communicate. As the citizens of Louisiana and Mississippi \nrebuild and return to their homes, they need to know that they can pick \nup their phones and make a call, which is why we have universal \nservice. The steps that the FCC announced today, giving priority to \nrebuilding activities using universal service funds will help both in \nthe short and long term.\n  The FCC is using these universal service funds temporarily to support \nwireless handsets, coupled with a package of free minutes for evacuees \nand people still in the affected area that are without telephone \nservice. The FCC is also helping health care providers and the Red \nCross shelters by modifying the health care program to double discounts \nfor public and nonprofit health care providers. The FCC is allowing \nhealth care providers to submit new or revised universal support \napplications--requests for the money--for 2005, since their needs have \nobviously changed.\n  On the rebuilding front, universal service will help schools \nreconnect to the Internet, consumers reconnect to\n\n[[Page S10070]]\n\ntheir phones, and telephone companies to rebuild. Specifically, the FCC \nis designating schools and libraries struck by the hurricane to receive \nthe highest level of priority under the E-Rate Program for 2005 and \n2006. They are allowing schools and libraries serving evacuees to amend \ntheir 2005 application to account for the unexpected increase in \npopulation. They are using the Link-Up Program to provide support to \npay the cost of reconnecting consumers to the network as the disaster-\nstruck area is rebuilt. And they are providing BellSouth flexibility to \nuse high-cost model support to rebuild wire centers affected by the \nhurricane.\n  In other words, this is a unique use of universal service funds. It \ntook courage to do so. I am proud to hear of the FCC's willingness to \nwork around the clock to assist companies in the affected areas with \nneeded waivers. I also commend the FCC for its plans to establish the \nnew Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau. We have all seen the \ndevastation and communications outages caused by the massive flooding \nand the storm surge.\n  Certainly, we will have to look at improving our Nation's alert and \ndisaster warning systems as well as our communications \ninteroperability. As chair of the Commerce Committee in the Senate, \nalong with my cochair and good friend, Senator Dan Inouye of Hawaii, I \nintend to work closely with my colleagues in the Senate and the House, \nthe FCC, and others on these issues. We will pursue permanent \nsolutions. Chairman Martin and the FCC members deserve credit for \nhaving acted so rapidly to deal with the disaster-related issues before \nus today.\n  I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

When he is on the floor, I will thank, publicly and personally, \nthe distinguished Senator from Alabama, Mr. Shelby. We certainly worked \non a bipartisan basis to move this bill, to accomplish national \nobjectives, and to respond to the compelling human and financial needs \nof our neighbors in the Gulf States. Moving this legislation has been \nenjoyable because there has been such a spirit of bipartisan \ncooperation. Senators have worked on their amendments. They have \noffered them jointly. In a few minutes, we will be voting on an \namendment by Senator Snowe of Maine and John Kerry of Massachusetts to \nhelp small business, particularly, in relation to Katrina. That has \nbeen the example throughout.\n  As the ranking member on this new subcommittee, I hope the spirit of \nthe Senate, in moving forward on this bill, will be the spirit of the \nSenate all the time. We need more of that. We need more civility. We \nneed more collegiality and more of that spirit of ``let's get it done'' \nand ``let's get it done together.''\n  There were many issues that were new to me, at least the depth of the \nnational problem. We are all familiar with Katrina. One of the things \nthat came up was the whole methamphetamine issue, which seems to have \nthe country in its grips, to listen to the Senators from North Dakota \ntalk about what it means in a rural State, to listen to other Senators \nwho have come in either with individual projects or with national \nissues. Again, in a spirit of bipartisanship, Senators Dayton and \nChambliss came in with a request to restore over $200 million to fight \nthis scourge that seems to be gripping people at all economic levels. \nThe methamphetamine issue has reached epidemic levels. That bipartisan \nsupport added money to the budget and added resources for local \ncommunities.\n  Another champion, of course, was the Senator from Washington, Ms. \nCantwell. She offered an amendment for $20 million on the Hot Spot \nProgram. Where are the real hotspots of meth? We worked with her to \nadopt that amendment. We thank her and particularly the Senator from \nMinnesota, Senator Dayton, the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss, for \nbeing strong advocates. Every other Senator came to me and said: We are \nglad this is in the bill.\n  Senator Cantwell, focusing on the hotspots, sends vital Federal \nsupport to law enforcement officers and first responders who are on the \nfrontlines of the meth epidemic. Actually, those crime fighters have a \ngreat friend in Senator Cantwell.\n  We thank everyone who has helped move this legislation. We are \nlooking forward to moving to final passage. We have two more \namendments, and then we will move to final passage. Again, the spirit \nof the Senate has been wonderful. We are meeting real needs--whether it \nis Katrina, fighting the methamphetamine epidemic, providing weather \nservices, and so on.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to a vote on or in relation to Snowe-Kerry amendment No. 1717, \nwith no second-degree amendments in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. For the information of my colleagues, we are now down to \none or two outstanding issues. That is good news in the Senate on a \nThursday afternoon. During the next vote, we will try to finalize those \namendments. Senator Mikulski and I, the managers of the bill, have been \nworking with everybody in the Senate to try to move the bill forward. \nIt is our expectation that we will quickly proceed to passage of the \nbill. I, therefore, alert all Senators now that they should remain \nclose to the Chamber, following this upcoming vote, hopefully for final \npassage.\n  I yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, first of all, once again, we are coming \nnow to the final aspects of this bill. We have been able to achieve \nthis because of the wonderful bipartisan support that existed between \nSenator Shelby, myself, and our staffs. We want to thank them for doing \nthat. I will thank them as we go into wrapup.\n  Our colleagues, we thank them again for their cooperation in moving \nthe amendments, working on a bipartisan basis. And now as we go to the \nSnowe-Kerry amendment and the vote, we ask Senators who have those \noutstanding amendments to consult with the floor and leadership staff, \nand ourselves as well, because we think we could have a vote--not \npromptly but expeditiously--after the conclusion of the Snowe-Kerry \namendment.\n  Again, I say to my colleagues to come, vote, stick around, let's work \ntogether, and we can finish our bill. People need this bill. It funds \nthe FBI. It funds Katrina help. It funds the methamphetamine help about \nwhich we have been talking, and our very important Weather Service. \nThere are so many provisions in it.\n  I yield the floor and look forward to the vote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1717\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby], for Ms. Snowe, for \n     herself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Vitter, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. Talent, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1717.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Thursday, September 14, \n2005, under ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. SHELBY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1717.\n\n[[Page S10071]]\n\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Mississippi (Mr. Lott), the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nThune), and the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nThune) would have voted ``yea.''\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 96, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 233 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--96\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dayton\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Corzine\n     Lott\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n  The amendment (No. 1717) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KERRY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1695\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the pending business, I believe, is my \noriginal amendment. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say quickly I thank my colleagues, \nand I thank Senators Snowe and Landrieu and Vitter for their work on \nthis amendment. I think the Senate has made a very important statement \ntoday about what can be done and what we need to do to respond \nimmediately to the small business needs with respect to Katrina and \npeople impacted across the country.\n  This amendment details virtually everything in the Kerry-Landrieu \namendment, from disaster loan deferments to financial assistance for \nsmall businesses and farmers struggling to afford the high prices of \ngasoline, natural gas, and heating oil. It expands on assistance to \nsmall businesses that have SBA 504 loans for buildings or equipment, or \nfor those who will need them. It includes agreed upon language to make \nsure the money is appropriated to carry out the assistance. And it \nretains a critical grant program to the states to get money into the \nhands of small businesses that need immediate access to capital to stay \nafloat until they get other more comprehensive loans or insurance \nreimbursements.\n  For all the good this amendment will do, I am disappointed that two \nvery important provisions were not included. I am against taking out \nthe funding for the Federal government's largest small business loan \nprogram, the 7(a) Loan Guarantee Program, that would reduce fees on \nborrowers and lenders. Even before the destruction of Hurricane Katrina \nand its impact on our economy, small businesses were struggling with \nhigher insurance premiums, higher energy prices, and higher prices for \ncapital because of rising interest rates. We should not be adding to \ntheir expenses by raising loan fees. As I said yesterday, according to \na document from the Small Business Administration, since the \nAdministration raised fees in that program, loans to Hispanics have \ndeclined by 14 percent. With Katrina causing problems well beyond the \nstate lines of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, and Texas, \nthose small businesses need relief too. We asked our colleagues, at the \nvery least, to include language that would reduce fees if the SBA \novercharges borrowers or lenders, or if there are excess \nappropriations. They would not agree. They also eliminated the \nprovision that directed the SBA to assume payments for SBA 7(a) and 504 \nloans that victims had before the Hurricane but cannot now pay. To help \nthese business owners make ends meet, and to avoid defaults or worse, \nit is my hope that these small businesses will make use of the \nprovision we put in the amendment that allows them to refinance \nexisting business debt with low-cost SBA disaster loans.\n  Hopefully, because this bill may well be tied up for a period of \ntime, it may be possible to break this amendment out and add to it a \ncouple of components that were not in it today.\n  We hope to do that. We obviously will work with both sides to do it \nin the same bipartisan fashion.\n  This morning Senator Landrieu met with some of the top members of the \nbusiness community of New Orleans. They are very afraid for those small \nbusinesses that have to lease, contract, move, and they are afraid of \nlosing for a long period of time, if not forever, the small business \nbase of their community. What the Senate has done today is to address \nthat need in a very realistic and helpful way. I thank my colleagues \nfor doing so.\n  With that stated, my original amendment, which we now combined into \nthis one, is no longer necessary. I ask unanimous consent it be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield the floor, but first let me thank Senator Mikulski \nand Senator Shelby also for their long forbearance in this effort. I \nappreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1678\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I call up my amendment if it has not \nalready been placed in order. It is amendment No 1678.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 1678 is the regular order.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. This amendment is an attempt to apply an offer of \nfinancial relief to victims of Hurricane Katrina in very personal ways \nto answer the questions that hundreds of thousands of people in the \ngulf coast region are now asking themselves, by extending current \nprograms or creating a couple of new ones.\n  Let me be more specific. This amendment would say to folks who \nsuffered this hardship that they can meet their immediate needs for \nhousing and other assistance because we are going to waive the caps and \nState cost-sharing requirements under the Stafford Program. It would \nallow survivors of Katrina to cover rent or mortgage payments, if they \nare suffering financial hardship; that is, by reinstatement of the \nmortgage or rental program.\n  It would extend the time that these people can apply for unemployment \ninsurance to 90 days. It would impose a moratorium on obligations for \npaying student loans and other payments on Federal loans in the \nimmediate aftermath of a hurricane. It would authorize people to take \nmoney out of their retirement plans to keep themselves going without \nhaving to pay a penalty. And it would extend and expand eligibility for \nfood stamps and WIC programs.\n  Finally, for victims of Hurricane Katrina and survivors living in the \narea of hardship, it would extend the bankruptcy protections under \ncurrent law that would otherwise soon go out of effect with the \nadoption of the recent Bankruptcy Act.\n  This is the stuff of enabling people to put their lives back \ntogether. It is very human, it is very personal, it is real, and it is \nvery urgently needed.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1706, Withdrawn\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, before we move to the vote on the \namendment of the Senator from Connecticut, I ask unanimous consent to \nwithdraw Bingaman amendment No. 1706.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n[[Page S10072]]\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  I ask for regular order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1678\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is on Lieberman amendment \nNo. 1678.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the Lieberman \namendment violates rule XVI.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, pursuant to the notice properly filed, \nI move to suspend the rule with respect to this amendment, No. 1678, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n           Amendments Nos. 1716, 1724, as Modified, and 1725\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, we have three additional amendments that \nhave been cleared on both sides of the aisle. I send those amendments \nto the desk, and I ask unanimous consent that the amendments be \nconsidered and agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable. This has been cleared with the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1716\n\n    (Purpose: To extend the provisions an expiring provision of the \n       Universal Service Antideficiency Temporary Suspension Act)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ------.

SMALL BUSINESS FEES.\n\n       (a) Fees.--Section 7(a)(23) of the Small Business Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 636(a)(23)) is amended by striking subparagraph (C) \n     and inserting the following:\n       ``(C) Lowering of fees.--\n       ``(i) In general.--Subject to clauses (ii) and (iii)--\n\n       ``(I) the Administrator may reduce fees paid by small \n     business borrowers and lenders under clauses (i) through (iv) \n     of paragraph (18)(A) and subparagraph (A) of this paragraph; \n     and\n       ``(II) fees paid by small business borrowers and lenders \n     shall not be increased above the levels in effect on the date \n     of enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005.\n\n       ``(ii) Determinations.--A reduction in fees under clause \n     (i) shall occur in any case in which the fees paid by all \n     small business borrowers and by lenders for guarantees under \n     this subsection, or the sum of such fees plus any amount \n     appropriated to carry out this subsection, as applicable, is \n     more than the amount necessary to equal the cost to the \n     Administration of making such guarantees.''.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1725\n\n   (Purpose: To provide additional funding for the Federal Bureau of \n  Investigation for processing of background checks for petitions and \n applications pending before U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services)\n\n       On page 121, line 19, after the semicolon insert ``of which \n     not less than $1,200,000 shall be for the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation for processing of background checks for \n     petitions and applications pending before U.S. Citizenship \n     and Immigration Services;''.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1716\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senator Inouye, co-\nchairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science & Transportation, to \ndiscuss amendment to safeguard the Universal Service Fund, or USF, the \ninstitution that allows rural and low-income Americans to obtain \naffordable telephone service, allows America's schools and libraries to \nprovide Internet access to all segments of society through the E-Rate \nprogram, and permits rural health care providers to obtain \ntelecommunications and Internet services at reduced rates. The concept \nof Universal Service has been with us nearly as long as the telephone \nitself, and this amendment today marks one key step in ensuring that \nthis vital policy remains intact in the 21st Century.\n  Before I go into the merits of the amendment, I want to assure my \ncolleagues that this amendment touches upon an issue that has been in \ndiscussion for a long time. In fact, it is almost identical to \nlegislation, S. 241, which I introduced early in the 109th Congress \nalong with, Senator Rockefeller and the chairman and co-chairman of the \nCommerce, Science and Transportation Committee, Senators Stevens and \nInouye. A total of 41 co-sponsors are on the bill today. Countless \ntelecommunications companies and educational organizations have also \nendorsed the bill. Moreover, the Senate Commerce Committee held a \nhearing this past spring to discuss the need for such legislation.\n  I stand before you today offering this amendment because our time is \nrunning out. As I will explain more in a moment, the exemption of the \nUniversal Service Fund from the Anti-Deficiency Act is about to expire. \nIf it is not extended soon, the programs supported by the Universal \nService Fund will be in jeopardy.\n  The amendment today pertains specifically to the Universal Service \nAdministration Company, or USAC, the private, nonprofit corporation \nthat Congress created to administer the USF. Both this amendment and S. \n241 are very similar to S. 2994, a bill that I introduced during the \n108th Congress and that was passed right before adjournment as part of \na larger telecommunications package, H.R. 5419. That bill temporarily \nexempted USAC from complying with new, arbitrarily imposed accounting \nrules that had severely disrupted the E-Rate program and threatened to \ncause huge spikes in consumers' telephone bills. Many will recall that \nhundreds of millions of dollars in E-Rate funding for schools and \nlibraries stayed unissued for months because of the accounting rule \nchange, and immediate action was necessary to resolve the problem.\n  According to USAC's Federal regulators, these new accounting rules \nneeded to be imposed to ensure that the USF was compliant with the \nFederal Anti-Deficiency Act, a law which prevents Government agencies \nfrom incurring financial obligations beyond the amount that has been \nappropriated to them by Congress. However, USAC, in administering the \nUSF, does not receive any appropriated funds from Congress. Rather, the \nUSF is funded by a regular disbursement, on a more or less monthly \nbasis, of moneys derived from a surcharge placed on the revenue \ngenerated from interstate telephone calls. The existence of this \npredictable revenue stream negates any of the risks and concerns that \nthe Anti-Deficiency Act was designed to prevent.\n  After government accounting rules were imposed on USAC last year, the \nentire E-Rate program was frozen. On the eve of the start of the school \nyear, this program--which has enabled 93 percent of schools and \nlibraries in the country to hook up to the Internet--was unable to \nreview and act upon the funding recommendations of thousands of \napplicants. Many recipients of E-Rate funding actually shut off their \nInternet connections because they had no money available to maintain \nservice. In order to alleviate this problem, Congress decided last fall \nto exempt the USF from the Anti-Deficiency Act for 1 year until a \npermanent solution to this problem was found. Senator Rockefeller and I \ndecided to pursue a 1-year exemption in order to ensure speedy passage \nof the legislation before adjournment, so that schools and libraries \ncould receive their funding again. Today's legislation provides a \nsecond extension of the exemption until a permanent solution is found.\n  Clear precedent exists for such an exemption. Numerous other Federal \nprograms already are exempt from complying with the Anti-Deficiency \nAct, including the National Park Service and the Conservation Trust. \nMoreover, an exemption is the rational solution to ensure that this \nproblem does not continue to recur. As I previously mentioned, an \nexemption is particularly appropriate in this instance because the USF \nhas a funding mechanism different from most Federal programs. The USF \nfunctioned very well for many\n\n[[Page S10073]]\n\nyears utilizing the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles used by \nthe entire American business world. Trying to engraft special \ngovernment rules onto USF is akin to forcing a square peg into a round \nhole. And the result would be another stoppage in E-Rate--and likely \nthe USF Rural High Cost Fund as well--and also a spike in the USF \nsurcharge on consumers' telephone bills.\n  Last year we undertook a bipartisan effort among members on the \ncommittees of jurisdiction in both Houses of Congress to enact a \ntemporary exemption for the USF from unnecessary, burdensome \nregulations. In undertaking that effort we worked closely with the \nFederal Communications Commission, and enjoyed widespread support among \nthe telecom industry, educators, and State and local governments. The \ntemporary extension that we worked so hard to pass has almost expired. \nWe must extend the exemption 1 more year so that the Universal Service \nFund can continue to support rural consumers, schools, libraries, \nhospitals and low-income households.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the disposition of the Lieberman amendment, the bill be read \na third time, and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the bill \nwith no intervening action or debate; provided further that the \namendment to the title then be agreed to, the Senate then insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the first vote there \nbe 2 minutes equally divided between the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, only to \nsay that as we move to the closing of this bill, I want to thank \nSenator Shelby and his staff for all the many courtesies. It has been \nan outstanding way to move this bill.\n  I do not object to the Senator's request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to suspend the rules for \nthe consideration of amendment No 1678. The yeas and nays have been \nordered.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an \nimportant project being undertaken by the University of Miami: The \nCenter for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing, or CSTARS. \nThis state-of-the-art system will perform real-time analysis from \nmultiple satellites of the ocean, atmosphere, environment and weather \naround the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean and the Southeastern U.S.\n  Every year, Florida and the entire Southeast must prepare itself for \nhurricane season. People around the Nation and the world have seen the \ndevastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana, Alabama and \nMississippi. The images we are seeing daily on television are horrific \nand greatly disturbing, and we all are hurting for the victims of this \ntragedy. Last year, four hurricanes hit Florida within 5 weeks, causing \nbillions in damage, which we are still digging out of. Many scientists \npredict that we are seeing the beginning of 20 to 30 years of storms of \nthis magnitude.\n  The information available through CSTARS will greatly enhance our \nability to monitor storms and the conditions in which they develop by \nobserving ocean temperatures, wind speed and air pressure. After \nstorms, CSTARS can provide rapid assessments of urban and coastal \ninfrastructure and coastline damage. Programs like CSTARS are vital for \nstates that regularly have to prepare for these storms and recover from \nthe damage left in their wake.\n  Additionally, CSTARS can assist our comprehension of inland water \nlevels, pollution, vegetation growth, coastal erosion, ocean currents, \nvolcanic activity and much more. It is a deserving program, and I hope \nthat this Senate is able to find the funds necessary to support it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I say to my colleague from Florida that I understand \nthe importance, to the Gulf states and the Nation, of providing funding \nfor research and analysis of weather systems. The Senator from Florida \nhas been a leader on this issue. While in these tight budget times, we \nare unable to fund every worthy program, I will continue to work with \nhim to ensure that our Nation has the very best research available to \nunderstand hurricanes and other environmental concerns.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator from Maryland for her \nknowledge of this issue and her readiness to work with me on it.\n\n\n               Virginia Key Marine Life Science Building\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an \nimportant project by both NOAA and the University of Miami.\n  Virginia Key, FL is the home of two important NOAA programs dealing \nwith the oceans and fisheries and the home to the University of Miami \nRosentiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. Because of their \nproximity, overlap in focus, and the quality of the research at both \nNOAA and the Rosentiel School, the two have developed a close, mutually \nbeneficial working relationship.\n  As the Rosentiel School has grown in prominence it has also grown in \nsize to over 500 professors, graduate students, researchers and staff, \nand can no longer fit in its current facilities. The school had \nconsidered relocating, but moving away from Virginia Key would weaken \nthe relationship between it and NOAA. That is why last year Congress \nfound it appropriate to pass a bill authorizing NOAA to grant land to \nthe University of Miami to construct a new Marine Life Science Center \nin Virginia Key.\n  This new center would be home to both the Rosentiel School and NOAA \nstaff, allowing their collaboration to continue and to grow. The \nresearch performed on marine habitats, fishery\n\n[[Page S10074]]\n\neconomics, ocean chemistry and tropical meteorology will be brought \ntogether in a modern facility where it can be presented and shared.\n  Currently, planning is underway to develop this center, and I believe \nwe should assist NOAA and the University of Miami with the design and \nschematic plans of this joint facility. Once design plans are in place, \nthe University of Miami plans to finance the building construction \nthrough non-Federal funds. Once completed, up to 50 percent of the \nspace will be used by NOAA.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. It is wonderful to see collaboration between the \nFederal Government and our Nation's top universities, and we should \nsupport those efforts whenever possible. In these tight budget times, \nit is difficult to fund every deserving project such as this one. I \nwill work with the Senator from Florida so that we can find ways to \nfurther partnerships like these.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator from Maryland for her \nassistance and I look forward to working with her.\n\n\n                       PROJECT SAFE NEIGHBORHOODS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support \nfor the remarkable crime-prevention results from the President's \nProject Safe Neighborhoods initiative. We must ensure that adequate \nappropriations continue to fully support this productive crime-fighting \neffort.\n  I am concerned that the appropriations bill we are considering today \nmakes no provision for the State and local grant program of Project \nSafe Neighborhoods, an important component of the President's \ninitiative, and I am not alone. A number of our colleagues share my \nconcern that this important program for fighting crime in our streets \nand in our neighborhoods should be funded adequately.\n  I am pleased that my friend from Alabama, Senator Sessions, joins me \ntoday. Does the Senator share this concern?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes I do, and I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Texas. In Alabama, we have enjoyed great successes from the \nimplementation of Project Safe Neighborhoods and its State and local \ngrant program for which full funding is important. What would represent \nsufficient funding for this important program?\n  Mr. CORNYN. The President requested in his budget $73,800,000 for \nState and local grants. And according to the Department of Justice, in \norder for Project Safe Neighborhoods to continue as a flagship gun \ncrime reduction initiative, the $73.8 million dedicated to the Project \nSafe Neighborhoods State and local grant program, is essential.\n  The State and local grants are critical to the success of the \nPresident's Project Safe Neighborhoods program. The grants support the \nremoval from our streets and our neighborhoods of these criminals who \nuse guns to carry out their crimes.\n  The idea did not start in Washington. Indeed, the first program of \nits kind saw enormous success in Richmond, VA, where crime was \nsignificantly reduced as gun crime prosecutions increased \nsubstantially.\n  When I was Attorney General of Texas, I joined with then-Governor \nBush to launch Texas Exile, modeled after Richmond's Project Exile. \nThis Texas program also met with extraordinary success, providing local \nprosecutors the funds necessary to get more than 2,000 guns off the \nstreets, and to issue more than 1,500 indictments for gun crimes. This \nresulted in almost 1,200 convictions during the first 3 years of the \nprogram's existence.\n  When President Bush came to Washington, he built upon our success in \nTexas by making Project Safe Neighborhoods one of his top priorities. \nHe launched the Project Exile program nationally, providing desperately \nneeded resources to combat gun-related crimes to jurisdictions \nthroughout our country.\n  In the short time this initiative has been up and running, the \nresults have been astonishing. Project Safe Neighborhoods' prosecution, \nprevention, and deterrence efforts have helped fuel historical lows in \ngun crime across America as well as a 30-year low in the violent crime \nvictimization rate. Over the past 4 years, Federal gun crime \nprosecutions have increased by 76 percent and virtually all of these \ncriminals spend time in prison. For example, 94 percent of those \noriginally charged with a Federal gun crime received prison terms in \nfiscal year 2004.\n  The administration has devoted over $1.3 billion to implement Project \nSafe Neighborhoods since its inception in 2001. These funds have been \nused to hire almost 200 new Federal prosecutors dedicated to gun crime \nand to provide grants to hire approximately 540 new State and local gun \nprosecutors. The additional Federal funding for these State and local \ngun prosecutors, as well as the associated community outreach efforts \nand other initiatives are critical to the success of the program and to \nthe national reduction of violent crime.\n  As the Senator mentioned, the program as implemented in Alabama has \nenjoyed significant successes, isn't that right?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is absolutely right. In fact, in 2002, all of the \nU.S. Attorney's Offices in Alabama kicked off Alabama ICE, which stands \nfor Isolate the Criminal Element. It is a partnership among Federal, \nState, and local law enforcement officials designed to help get guns \nout of the hands of convicted felons.\n  As an example, the number of indictments for the Middle District of \nAlabama is expected to reach 110 by the end of this fiscal year, up \nfrom 15 in 2001. The program allows law enforcement to charge convicted \nfelons with felonies through the Federal court system if found in \npossession of a gun, or in possession of a gun during violent or drug \ntrafficking crimes. If charged at the State level, a convicted felon \nwould likely be charged with a misdemeanor if found in possession of a \ngun.\n  And the results have been exceptional. As I said, Alabama ICE was \nfirst implemented in Alabama in April 2002. During the first 11 months \nof 2003, the number of violent crimes in Montgomery showed significant \ndecreases. Criminal homicides decreased 45 percent, robberies 10 \npercent, aggravated assaults 16 percent, and domestic violence \naggravated assaults 43 percent.\n  I know the Senator must have countless examples from his home State \nof Texas; isn't that right?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Examples from my home State of Texas clearly demonstrate \nthat Project Safe Neighborhoods is working. Consider:\n  The Northern District of Texas has shown a 31 percent increase in the \nnumber of Federal gun cases opened in 2004 over 2003. The Project Safe \nNeighborhoods Task Force continues to work harmoniously and effectively \nin contributing to the reduction of gun-related crimes citywide and in \nthe targeted neighborhoods.\n\n  PSN prosecutions in the Northern District of Texas have targeted some \nof the worst gun offenders, and have resulted in safer neighborhoods \nwithin the district. For example, in August 2002, the Dallas Division \ncoordinated a long-term gang investigation under the PSN Program with \nthe ATF and the Dallas Police Department. The investigation resulted in \ntwo separate indictments charging 18 gang members with being involved \nin a drug trafficking conspiracy, crack cocaine, along with other \nstreet gang members.\n  And the efforts of the Western District of Texas to energize Project \nSafe Neighborhoods through effective partnering with State and local \nlaw enforcement are demonstrated most clearly by their impressive \nprosecution statistics. They have seen a 74 percent increase in \nprosecutions from fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2004, and a 13 \npercent increase in the past fiscal year.\n  That is why I am so concerned that there was no funding included in \nthis appropriations bill. While I appreciate any effort this body might \ntake to embrace fiscal discipline, I question the efficacy of choosing \nto eliminate a program that is saving thousands of lives nationwide as \nopposed to many other less critical projects and programs.\n  I am pleased the senior Senator from Alabama, who has been working so \nhard on this Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill is here with \nus. I ask Senator Shelby, is this something that he believes we can \nwork to resolve in conference given the difficulty in making changes at \nthis time?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I would like to thank the Senator from Texas and my \ncolleague from Alabama for their willingness to work with me to resolve \ntheir\n\n[[Page S10075]]\n\nconcerns. This program, as with many programs for which we struggle to \nfind adequate funding, is important. This program received no \nappropriation in the fiscal year 2005 conference report. I understand \nrelated funding has been appropriated in the House CJS bill and I will \nwork to address the concerns of my colleagues as the appropriations \nprocess moves forward.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would like to thank my friend from Alabama and I \noffer any assistance that I or my staff can give as you work on this \nimportant issue for us.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would like to thank my colleagues. The Project Safe \nNeighborhoods program serves as a model of coordinated Government \nefforts, with Federal, State and local governments sharing the burden \nof prosecuting criminals and coordinating their resources to do so. At \na time when some Federal agencies are struggling to coordinate \nefficiently with State and local governments, the Project Safe \nNeighborhoods program serves as a model of efficiency and \neffectiveness.\n  I appreciate that Senator Shelby points out that the State and local \ngrant program received no appropriation in fiscal year 2005, an \nunfortunate reality that gives me even greater concern about the future \nof the Project Safe Neighborhoods program. It is now even more critical \nthat in conference we find the funds necessary to continue this program \nthat so clearly has reduced rates of violent crime and victimization \nacross our country.\n\n\n   National Waterborne disease Recognition and Disaster Preparedness \n                                Program\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to engage my friend, the \nSenator from Maryland who serves as the ranking member of the newly \nformed appropriations subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and Science, \nin a colloquy regarding a program of national importance, and its \ninclusion in the fiscal year 2006 CJS appropriations bill. I thank my \nfriend for her service in this body and for her tireless and passionate \nwork on this bill. I particularly want to thank her for showing support \nfor several projects of significant importance to New York State. The \naftermath of Hurricane Katrina has left much of the gulf region under \ntoxic floodwaters. I would like to secure funding for a National \nWaterborne Disease Recognition and Disaster Preparedness Program based \nat the Arnot Ogden Medical Center in Elmira, NY. This waterborne \ndisease recognition program has been funded by the EPA for the past 3 \nyears but was not included in the President's fiscal year 2006 budget. \nFunding for this important program through NOAA will be essential for \nongoing disaster relief efforts in the gulf region, as well as \npreparedness efforts for future natural disasters or water terrorism \nevents.\n  It is obvious that there will be long-term medical and public health \nchallenges ahead for the gulf region resulting from the massive water \ncontamination event associated with Katrina. The medical risks for the \ngulf residents and first responders will include gastrointestinal \nsyndromes resulting from waterborne exposure to biological agents such \nas Hepatitis A, E. coli from fecal contamination, and waterborne \nparasites. Exposure to a diverse array of toxic chemical contaminants \nfrom industrial sites, oil and gas installations, and household \nchemicals may lead to long-term health effects yet to be determined. \nThis National Waterborne Disease Recognition and Disaster Preparedness \nProgram is a one-of-a-kind program that has a proven track record of \ndelivering high-quality, cost-effective educational interventions to \ncommunities throughout the United States, addressing waterborne disease \nrecognition, natural disaster preparedness, and water terrorism \nreadiness.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. We have all become aware of the dangers of exposure to \ncontaminated water and the health risks to residents, first responders \nand volunteers. Many challenges lay ahead, as flooded gulf communities \ncontinue to pump out this contaminated water as we speak.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The National Waterborne Disease Recognition and Disaster \nPreparedness Program based at the Arnot Ogden Medical Center is \nuniquely situated to address these challenges. This program will assist \nFederal disaster response efforts by providing technical assistance to \nthe Department of Homeland Security, the EPA, CDC, and Department of \nDefense regarding water quality management, waterborne diseases, and \nthe health effects of water contamination. It also provides educational \ntraining and support for local and regional healthcare providers to \nenhance accurate diagnosis and management of people with exposure to \nwaterborne agents. I am hopeful that as the CJS appropriations bill \nmoves forward that we may work together to see if this important issue \ncan be addressed in conference.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator from New York for bringing this \nprogram to my attention and I will work with him to find ways to \nfurther this important program.\n\n\n                    Noaa's National Weather Service\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The people of Florida and the nation owe \nNOAA's National Weather Service a debt of gratitude for their work last \nyear predicting the four hurricanes that hit Florida and the southeast \nand this year for their work predicting Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina. \nThe National Weather Service website had more than 9 billion hits \nduring the four storms last year. That site provided vital information \nto the people of Florida as they prepared their homes and evacuated \ntheir families from the path of the hurricanes. For these reasons, I \nwant to thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the \nCommerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill, Senators Shelby and \nMikulski, for working with me to ensure that the National Weather \nService's ability to continue to provide the American people with \nweather forecasts and warnings through the internet and other sources \nwill not be undermined or limited. I agree with the chairman of the \nSenate Subcommittee on Disaster Preparedness and Prediction, Senator \nDeMint, that the National Weather Service deserves an ``A'' for its \npredictions about Hurricane Katrina.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I agree with the Senator from Florida. NOAA's National \nWeather Service has the unique expertise and responsibility to provide \nthe nation with general weather and flood warnings and forecasts to \nprotect life and property. The National Weather Service shall have the \ncontinued flexibility to disseminate these warnings and forecasts in \nall formats necessary to ensure timely delivery to the taxpayers. \nFurthermore, I want to commend the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration for their exceptionally accurate Katrina forecasts.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Let me be clear, I am absolutely opposed to efforts to \nprivatize the weather service. The National Weather Service must \ncontinue to provide forecasts and warnings through its website and \nother sources without limitation. The National Weather Service provides \ncritical information to our citizens and saves lives and livelihoods \nand it must continue to do so.\n\n\n                      National Science Foundation\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, as a fiscal conservative there are very \nfew areas in which I believe Federal funding should be increased. One \nof those few areas, however, is that of the National Science \nFoundation.\n  Funding of the National Science Foundation should be a national \npriority.\n  Congress established the National Science Foundation in 1950 with the \nbroad mission ``to promote the progress of science; to advance the \nnational health, prosperity, and welfare; and to secure the national \ndefense.'' In this capacity, NSF plays a critical role in underwriting \nbasic research at colleges, universities, and other institutions \nthroughout our Nation.\n  Basic research supported by NSF in chemistry, physics, \nnanotechnology, genomics, and semiconductor manufacturing has brought \nabout some of the most significant innovations of the last 20 years.\n  For example, the World Wide Web, magnetic resonance imaging and fiber \noptics technology all emerged through basic research projects that \nreceived NSF funding.\n  Research supported by NSF accounts for approximately 40 percent of \nnon-life-science basic research at U.S. academic institutions while \nrepresenting less than 4 percent of the Federal funding for R \nSupport for NSF's efforts to fund basic research is particularly \nimportant due to the impact of such research on innovation and global \ncompetitiveness.\n\n[[Page S10076]]\n\n  To remain globally competitive in the 21st century, the United States \nmust continue to lead the world's innovation. Innovation fosters the \nnew ideas, technologies, and processes that lead to better jobs, higher \nwages and a higher standard of living. While innovation is the key to \nthe future, basic research is the key to future innovation. And today, \nthe future of basic research appears vulnerable.\n  Over the last 30 years, Federal funding in support of basic research \nhas remained flat in constant dollars and decreased by 37 percent as a \nshare of GDP. Especially given increased competition from nations like \nChina and India, failure to support the NSF and basic research creates \na serious long-term risk for our nation. U.S. competitiveness in global \nmarkets and the creation of good jobs at home rely increasingly on the \ncutting edge innovation that stems from high-risk basic research. U.S. \ntechnological leadership, innovation, and jobs of tomorrow require a \ncommitment to basic research funding today.\n  Congress approved and President Bush signed the National Science \nFoundation Authorization Act of 2002. That Act authorized funding for \nNSF at appropriate levels, but funding for NSF has consistently lagged \nbehind the amounts authorized. In fiscal year 2005, NSF received \nfunding that was approximately $2 billion less than authorized. In \nfiscal year 2006, we are considering funding NSF at levels \napproximately $3 billion less than authorized.\n  As we consider funding priorities on the CJS bill and in the future, \nI urge the chairman, ranking member, and my fellow colleagues to make \nit a priority to fund NSF and to support increased basic research.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada and \nrecognize the importance of the basic research done through NSF. I \nshare his interest in basic research funding and look forward to \nworking with him to strengthen our Nation's capabilities through basic \nresearch.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I thank the chair and the ranking member for their \nleadership on this legislation, and look forward to working with both \nof them on promoting the basic research done at NSF in our country.\n\n\n                         stem education funding\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about the status of \nscience education funding in the Commerce, Justice, and Science \nappropriations bill. I commend Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member \nMikulski of the Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations \nSubcommittee for their hard work on this bill. With full recognition of \nthe challenging task they have faced in ensuring adequate funding for \nso many needed projects, I am compelled to take a moment to address a \ngrowing crisis in America.\n  The educational programs for the STEM disciplines--science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics--are essential for America's \nfuture competitiveness and are severely underfunded. As a result, \nAmerica's STEM education is falling behind. United States international \ntest scores in science and mathematics remain unacceptably low. At the \nsame time, countries in Europe and Asia are investing crucial resources \ninto their own research and education infrastructure to ensure future \nworld market success. These factors combine to make American businesses \nlook to move overseas for high-tech workers, outsourcing our jobs and \nour competitiveness.\n  This problem is multi-faceted. We have to provide today's teachers \nwith the skills and materials they need to teach these disciplines \nwell. We have to attract new teachers to the field--the teachers of \ntomorrow. We have to research ways to teach science and math to find \nout how this material is best learned and how interest in these fields \nis best promoted. It is in the best interest of our Nation to address \neach of these issues and it will require a greater investment on the \npart of our Federal Government.\n  Unfortunately, in too many ways, we seem to be pointed in exactly the \nwrong direction. I find it especially troubling that the National \nScience Foundation's Education and Human Resources Directorate has seen \nsignificant setbacks in the fiscal year 2006 proposed budget.\n  The Math and Science Partnership Program, which awards competitive \ngrants to build a bridge between higher education and K-12 math, \nscience, and engineering educators has achieved excellent results and \nhas endeavored to improve learning in mathematics and science for all \nK-12 students. For fiscal year 2006, we are seeing this highly \nsuccessful program slowly phased out of NSF. I would like to thank the \nchairman and ranking member of the committee for providing an \nadditional $4 million above the request by the President, but also note \nthat in the past 2 years more than half of the funding for this program \nhas been cut, from $139 million 2004 to the $64 million proposed in \nthis bill for fiscal year 2006.\n  Furthermore, the Research, Evaluation, and Communication, REC, \ndivision, which works to increase the number of students obtaining \ncollege degrees in STEM and to support educational research projects on \ncollege degree attainment in STEM, has also been cut. Results from REC \nresearch areas such as physics education have led to teaching methods \nthat more than double the information learned and retained by our \ncollege students when compared with traditional methods. But REC has \nbeen cut from $60 million in 2005 to a mere $33.8 million in this \nproposal.\n  These are just a few examples, but it is not the entire story. Taken \nas a whole these cuts are extremely troubling because they will have \nlong-lasting impacts.\n  I ask that both the chairman and the ranking member of the Commerce, \nJustice and Science Appropriations Committee work to protect and \nincrease STEM education funding in conference.\n  This is not a partisan issue. It is the future of our country and the \nsuccess of our children that concerns me, and, I trust, concerns my \ncolleagues as well.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I share the views of my colleague from \nColorado. Money is tight, but our future competitiveness as a nation \nhangs on our ability to educate our future scientists and engineers.\n  It is important to make sure that we encourage our children to take \ninterest in science, technology, engineering and math. It is important \nto make sure we provide our teachers with the appropriate tools and \ntraining so our children will keep that interest. And it is important \nto research how our students learn science, and to research the best \nways to teach them these disciplines.\n  I would like to see science education funding returned to at least \nlast year's levels and will work toward that goal in conference.\n  I respectfully join the Senator from Colorado and also ask the \nChairman of the Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations \nSubcommittee to help me reach that goal.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from Colorado and \nMaryland and recognize the importance of their interest in funding \nscience education. I share their interest in supporting education \nfunding at NSF and will work to find opportunities for science \neducation funding during conference.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank the chair and the ranking member \nfor their leadership on this legislation, and look forward to working \nwith both of them on promoting and improving science education in our \ncountry.\n\n\n                          aeronautics funding\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I would like to engage my colleague, \nChairman Shelby in a colloquy on the state of our government's funding \nfor aeronautics research and development and the importance of the \ndiscipline to our Nation's national security and economic \ncompetitiveness.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I would be happy to do so.\n  Mr. ALLEN. As my colleague from Alabama may know, aeronautics \nresearch at NASA has played an integral role in our country's unrivaled \nmilitary air power and until recently, our dominance of the commercial \naviation market. Specifically, NASA engineers have developed \ninnovations such as shaping for stealth; multi-axis thrust vectoring \nexhaust nozzles integrated with aircraft flight-control systems; fly-\nby-wire flight control technologies; high-strength and high-stiffness \nfiber composite structures; and tilt-wing rotorcraft technology. These \nbreakthroughs have contributed to American security and economic \nprosperity.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I understand Senator Allen has had a long-\n\n[[Page S10077]]\n\ntime interest in this issue and appreciate the point he is making with \nregard to the benefit of aeronautics research and development to our \nnational defense and our economy.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank my colleague and would further argue that \naeronautics is a vital and important science to our country. The U.S. \naerospace and aviation industry employed 2 million workers in 2001. \nThese workers earn incomes that are 35 percent higher that the average \nincome in the U.S. Further, despite a recent decline in market share, \nU.S. commercial aviation is one of the few areas of U.S. manufacturing \nwhere we actually have a positive balance of trade.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I would tell my colleague I agree that we must find ways \nto support sciences and disciplines that contribute positively to the \nUnited States trade relationship with its partners.\n   Mr. ALLEN. Yet, even as our national security and economy are \ndependent on the breakthroughs in aeronautic research and developments, \nin recent years, NASA has significantly reduced its investment in this \nvital science. The administration's 2006 budget proposes to cut over \n$700 million out of NASA's aeronautics budget over the next 5 years. \nThat will reduce the effective levels of NASA's aeronautic investment \nto about half the level it is today--and today's level is about half \nthe level which existed--adjusted for inflation--that the U.S. made \njust a decade ago.\n\n  Moreover, the President's budget called for eliminating NASA's entire \n``vehicle systems'' program--the very initiative that over the last \nfive decades has provided major technology advances that have been used \non every major civil and military aircraft over that period of time.\n  The last two administrations have consistently reduced NASA's \naeronautics funding and allowed a valuable competency and the human \nresource to atrophy and now the U.S. is second to the Europeans in \naircraft sales.\n  I would like to point out that there have been a number of well \nresearched, thoughtful reports on the importance of aeronautics \nresearch to our economic and national security. The National Institute \nof Aerospace recently released a comprehensive study that outlines \npriorities and funding requirements to meet the challenges we face from \nforeign competition and realize the innovations and breakthroughs of \nthe future. Specifically, the report finds that NASA's aeronauts budget \nrequires an average 5-year increase of $885.5 million over the fiscal \nyear 2005 levels. This proposed budget would bring NASA's aeronautics \nprograms back to 1998 levels when factoring inflation. Further, the NIA \nreport finds that NASA is uniquely suited to carry out this kind of \nresearch, given its vast infrastructure and world-class. Importantly, \nthe report follows by noting that the outcome of aeronautics research \nadds to the nation's wealth, not to any particular aviation company.\n  I understand we are not going to make those types of commitments in \nthe fiscal year 2005 Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations bill. \nHowever the House version of this measure includes some additional \nfunding for aeronautics programs within NASA. The House provision would \nappropriate $54 million above what the President requested in his \nfiscal year 2006 budget recommendation to the Congress. This relatively \nsmall increase would maintain aeronautics funding at levels \nappropriated in fiscal year 2005.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am aware that our House counterparts \nhave appropriated funding for NASA aeronautics programs at the fiscal \nyear 2005 levels.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I would respectfully request that Chairman Shelby and the \nother Senate conferees to this bill give all due consideration to the \narguments we have made today and to the possibility of adhering to the \nHouse provision on fiscal year 2006 for NASA's aeronautics programs.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I say to Senator Allen that I will give every \nconsideration to his request when we begin conferencing this bill.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I offer my sincere appreciation for Chairman Shelby's \nwillingness to work with me on this issue which is vitally important \nfor America's security and leadership in aeronautics innovation. He has \nbeen accommodating to my concerns and creative in trying to find a way \nto address our country's aeronautics needs for the coming fiscal year.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank my colleague for his interest in this legislation \nand his work on this issue.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to offer a few observations with \nrespect to Stabenow amendment No. 1688 to H.R. 2862, which was accepted \nby the Senate yesterday, as modified, and elaborate on why I supported \nthis amendment.\n  As my colleagues well know, I have long supported the legalization of \nprescription drug importation in this country. In fact, I have \nsponsored a bill to legalize the importation of prescription drugs. \nThat bill is S. 334, the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety \nAct of 2005. I want to thank Senators Dorgan, Snowe, Kennedy, and \nMcCain for working with me to carefully develop legislation that I \ncould fully support. I worked very closely with my colleagues to draft \nS.334 in way that does not create any litigation risk with respect to \nany of our trade agreements. We achieved that in S. 334. I believe S. \n334 is fully consistent with the terms of our trade agreements, \nincluding our agreements with Singapore, Morocco, and Australia.\n  The Stabenow amendment is not limited to pharmaceutical patents. That \nconcerns me. I believe the international trade obligations of the \nUnited States allow us to apply a special rule of patent exhaustion to \npharmaceutical patents as long as we respect the principles of national \ntreatment and most-favored-nation treatment. I hope that the Stabenow \namendment will be further refined in conference so that its scope is \nlimited to pharmaceutical patents.\n  By legalizing the importation of prescription drugs we will increase \ncompetition and keep the domestic pharmaceutical industry more \nresponsive to consumers. Drug companies will be forced to reevaluate \ntheir pricing strategies, and American consumers will no longer be \nforced to pay more than their fair share of the high cost of research \nand development for new innovative pharmaceuticals. Prescription drug \nimportation legislation has been stalled in Congress for far too long. \nMy support for the Stabenow amendment is intended to help kickstart the \nlegislative process, so we can pass prescription drug importation \nlegislation without any more delay. The American people deserve no \nless.\n  Mrs. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to thank Senators Shelby \nand Mikulski and their staff for their aid in including an amendment \nthat my colleague, Senator Vitter, and I offered. I also am pleased \nthat Senators Dorgan, McCain, Durbin, Levin, Schumer, Feingold, Kohl, \nand Snowe co-sponsored this amendment.\n  Our amendment simply matches a provision in the House's appropriation \nbill that prohibits the US Trade Representative from inserting anti-\ndrug-importation language into free trade agreements. Our provision \nwill remove a huge obstacle to creating a meaningful drug importation \nplan.\n  One of yesterday's headlines was that the cost of health insurance \nfor working Americans climbed 9.2 percent this year, far outpacing both \ngeneral inflation and workers' pay increases, according to a nationwide \nsurvey by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n  On average, health insurance for a family cost $10,880 this year, \nwith the employer paying $8,167 and the worker $2,713, the survey \nfound. The total cost almost exactly matches the total annual earnings \nof a person working full time at the minimum wage, the survey noted.\n  One of the key drivers of health care is the cost of prescription \ndrugs. Rising drug costs place a huge financial burden on all \nAmericans: from our senior citizens on fixed incomes, to working \nfamilies without insurance, to small businesses with high health plan \ncosts, to hospitals struggling to stay afloat, to states grappling with \nMedicaid drug costs. In April of this year, AARP reported last week \nthat wholesale prescription drug costs rose an average of 7.1 percent \nlast year. There is no way that our health system, our citizens, our \ngovernment, and our taxpayers can continue to endure these increases \nyear after year.\n\n[[Page S10078]]\n\n  And these rising costs have an enormous health consequence for us, \ntoo. Prescription drugs are not like other products. They can do \nwonderful and amazing things but only if you can afford them. We might \nbe able to make do and not buy a new pair of shoes, but we cannot off \nour medicine.\n  Because my home State borders Canada, I know what a difference \nreimportation has on people's lives. For years, I have joined my fellow \nMichiganians on their bus trips to Canada for medicine. What I \ndiscovered on my bus trips was almost unbelievable. Across Michigan's \nthree bridges to Canada, my constituents have been able to buy safe, \nFDA-approved drugs at a fraction of the cost. For example, the \ncholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor is about 40 percent less; ulcer \nmedication Prevacid is 50 percent less; and anti-depression medication \nZyprexa is 70 percent less.\n  Today, the majority of Americans recognize that drug importation is a \nfair trade issue. They know that drug makers already bring drugs \nmanufactured in other nations back into the U.S. And FDA inspectors go \nall over the world to inspect manufacturing lines that will produce \ndrugs that ultimately will be brought into the U.S. I think many \nAmericans would be surprised to learn that their drugs might be made in \nChina, India, or Slovakia. In fact, one quarter of all drugs consumed \nby Americans were made in other nations and brought into the U.S.\n\n  But unfortunately for the millions of Americans who are struggling to \nafford their medication, PhRMA also has recognized that drug \nimportation is a trade issue. According to its lobbying disclosures, \nPhRMA has actually lobbied the U.S. Trade Representative, our \ngovernment's top international trade official, more than it lobbied the \nFDA, which directly oversees the industry's products. The Center for \nPublic Integrity reported that PhRMA has contacted USTR more than any \nother lobbying organization.\n  That lobbying has paid off. Provisions in three different Free Trade \nAgreements with Singapore, Australia, and Morocco have created new \npatent rights for prescription drugs that would make it a violation to \nimport drugs from those nations. Although none of the drug importation \nbills pending before the Senate propose importing drugs from all of \nthose nations, these provisions are setting a dangerous precedent.\n  USTR has testified before Congress that new legislation on drug \nimportation ``could give rise to an inconsistency between U.S. law and \na commitment under this trade agreement.''\n  Worse, we are also hurting the ability of citizens in other nations \nto produce generic drugs. CAFTA contains language that will \ndramatically limit millions of patients' access to these low-cost, \nhigh-quality alternatives. In many Central American nations, brand-name \ndrugs cost 22 times more than their generic equivalents.\n  This has already caused unrest. For example, HIV/AIDS patients in \nGuatemala have demonstrated against changes in their nation's generic-\ndrug manufacturing laws as a result of CAFTA. Does this make any sense \nwhen we are trying to push for more resources to fight global AIDS?\n  Senators Vitter, McCain, and I introduced a bill in July that would \nprohibit such unfair language as well as make sure that consumer \nvoices--our voices--are heard in free trade negotiations regarding \npharmaceutical issues. This bill has been endorsed by numerous groups \nincluding Consumers Union and the Center for Policy Analysis on Trade \nand Health.\n  The amendment accepted yesterday merely says that USTR should not \nadopt language creating obstacles to drug importation. The Stabenow-\nVitter amendment is a fair compromise. We need to have an open \ndiscussion about drug importation--it shouldn't be decided for us as a \nprovision in an unamendable trade agreement.\n  This amendment is not an attack on intellectual property or enforcing \ntrade agreements. I am very concerned about enforcing our patents and \nensuring other nations respect our companies' intellectual property. In \nfact, I am a cosponsor of Senators Specter and Leahy's legislation on \nintellectual property.\n  Nothing in this amendment would preclude USTR from negotiating \nstrongly-worded trade agreements that would protect and preserve our \nnation's patents and intellectual property. But surely USTR can \nnegotiate and fight for language that isn't a back-handed way of \nblocking drug importation.\n  We know that, if given the chance, we can pass a good drug \nimportation bill with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress. \nThe bill that I have co-sponsored with Senators Dorgan, Snowe, McCain, \nand others would reduce total drug spending in the U.S. by about $50 \nbillion over the 2006-through-2015 period.\n  But if USTR continues to insert provisions against importation into \nour trade agreements--agreements that are supposed to help American \nconsumers--then our hard work will be for nothing.\n  The drug makers have a complete monopoly on those prescription drugs. \nNo one else--doctors, pharmacists, patients, and employers--has the \nsame opportunity to purchase those FDA-approved drugs at low prices. \nAgain, only the drug makers can bring in these safe, FDA-approved \ndrugs. We need to change this policy.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Cantwell \nfor tireless leadership in the fight against meth. Methamphetamine \nabuse has reached epidemic levels across our country, and by working to \nensure that we don't shift the burden onto local communities, Senator \nCantwell has given State and local law enforcement an important ally. \nAccepting her amendment to add $20 million to the hotspots program \nbrings funding for meth State and local enforcement to $80 million. \nCoupled with the bipartisan addition of $43 million of meth \nauthorization dollars that Senator Cantwell cosponsored and other meth-\nrelated funding, this bill makes an enormous Federal commitment to help \nour State and local effort to fight the meth battle. Senator Cantwell's \namendment sends vital Federal support to law enforcement officers and \nfirst responder on the front lines of the meth epidemic everywhere. \nThese crimefighters need more funds to help combat this dangerous drug, \nand Senator Cantwell has fought to give them resources they need. I \nappreciated her work to improve this bill, as do countless law \nenforcement officers across America.\n  Mr. President, as part of H.R. 2862, the fiscal year 2006 Commerce, \nJustice, Science Appropriations bill, the Senate has included \ncomprehensive relief assistance for small business harmed by Hurricane \nKatrina. I am glad we were able to come to agreement on a bipartisan \npackage and I thank Senators Snowe, Kerry, Vitter and Landrieu for \ntheir work and for ensuring that we could move forward to pass these \nprovisions so vital to small businesses in the Gulf Coast. One of the \nkey differences between the Snowe-Vitter and Kerry-Landrieu amendments \nwas that the latter included appropriations for the 7(a) Loan Guarantee \nProgram. Our support of the compromise Hurricane Katrina small business \npackage should not be interpreted as our taking a position today on \nwhether to include appropriations for the 7(a) Loan Guarantee Program. \nWhile we were not able to address the 7(a) program today, I am aware \nthat there is $79 million included in the House version of our bill for \nthe 7(a) program and that we will be addressing this issue in \nconference. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that \nthe 7(a) program continues to provide access to capital to small \nbusinesses across the Nation.\n  Mr. President, we are now coming to the end of our bill. We thank the \nleadership for all the help and support they gave us, and also working \nwith the Judiciary Committee to accommodate their schedule.\n  This is the first time this subcommittee has come out with a bill. We \nare a newly constituted committee. I have had the chance to work with \nsomeone I had worked with in the House. Chairman Shelby and I worked \ntogether in the same committee in the House of Representatives. Now we \nare together in Appropriations. I thank him for working with me in such \na collegial and consultive way.\n  Also, his staff is outstanding: Katherine Hennessey, Jill Long, Nancy \nPerkins, Art Cameron, Allen Cutler, Shannon Hines, and Ryan Welch.\n  I also thank my staff: Paul Carliner, Kate Fitzpatrick, Gabrielle \nBatkin,\n\n[[Page S10079]]\n\nand Alexa Sewell, who is not here today because she has a new baby.\n  So I thank everyone because I think we are about to pass a good bill. \nI think the Senate can be very proud of this bill because we support \nlaw enforcement at all levels in our communities. We support technology \nand development and scientific discovery. And working with agencies \nsuch as the National Weather Service, we save lives and livelihoods.\n  So I am ready to move to final passage and, once again, express my \nappreciation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I will try to be brief. We are getting \ntoward the end.\n  I am pleased we have completed consideration of this 2006 Commerce-\nJustice-Science appropriations bill. This is not an easy bill, as \neveryone knows. With such broad jurisdiction, this bill attracts a lot \nof attention--sometimes too much--on the Senate floor and throughout \nthe process.\n  It is our job--Senator Mikulski's and mine, with the help of \nleadership on both sides--to ensure the bill addresses my colleagues' \nconcerns and effectively supports the operations of its Federal \nagencies. We have tried to do this. I think we have.\n  I thank my colleagues for understanding this and for working with us \nto ensure the viability of this bill, both here in the Senate and in \nconference.\n  I believe overall this is a good bill. It reflects the priorities of \nthis body, and it addresses the needs of the Nation. Some needs are now \nmore urgent than others, as we know in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, \nand we have and will continue to make adjustments in the Small Business \nDisaster Loan Program, the Economic Development Administration's Public \nWorks Grants, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's \nhurricane-related programs.\n  We will take this bill to the House of Representatives in conference. \nWe have only a short time left in the year, as the leader keeps telling \nus. We will do our best to get a conference report to the President as \nsoon as we can.\n  I also offer my thanks to the distinguished Senator from Maryland, \nMs. Mikulski, for all of her work and the work of her staff. We have \nworked together for years. Without us working together in a bipartisan \nspirit, we would not be where we are today. She and her staff have \nworked with our side of the aisle in a truly bipartisan manner, and it \nis reflected in the bill.\n  I also thank Senator Cochran, chairman of the full committee, for all \nof his work and advice. It has been appreciated. I also thank the \nleaders, Senators Frist and Reid, and the floor staff, especially Dave \nSchiappa, Bill Hoagland, and my staffer, Katherine Hennessey, and \nothers. They did an excellent job helping us move this bill along, and \nwe are in their debt.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read \na third time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a very few seconds we will proceed to \npassage of the CJS bill. I congratulate the two managers for the \noutstanding job they have done, Senators Shelby and Mikulski. They \npatiently stayed on the floor day and night working through the \namendments. We thank them for their efforts. It has been a matter of a \nlot of patience, in part due to the coordination with the Judiciary \nCommittee and those hearings. In a few moments after passage of the \nbill, we will be turning to the Agriculture appropriations bill. The \nmanagers are here. They will be making their opening statements, but we \nwill not have rollcall votes later today. Tomorrow we have an important \ncongressional delegation traveling to the Gulf States. In addition, we \nhave a delegation attending a celebration for the national day of \nprayer and remembrance. Therefore, we will not be in session on Friday. \nWe will return on Monday. We will have a vote Monday, late afternoon, \nat approximately 5:30. We will alert all Members when that vote is \nlocked in.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the \nbill pass? The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Mississippi (Mr. Lott), the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nThune), and the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nThune) would have voted ``yea.''\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senate from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine) \nand the Senator from Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 91, nays 4, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 235 Leg.]\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dayton\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--4\n\n     Coburn\n     Enzi\n     Inhofe\n     Thomas\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Corzine\n     Landrieu\n     Lott\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n  The bill (H.R. 2862), as amended, was passed.\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. SHELBY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the title amendment \nis agreed to.\n  The Senate insists on its amendments, requests a conference with the \nHouse, and the Chair appoints Mr. Shelby, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Stevens, Mr. \nDomenici, Mr. McConnell, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bond, Mr. \nCochran, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Kohl, Mrs. Murray, \nMr. Harkin, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Byrd conferees on the part of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has \napproved H.R. 2862, the fiscal year 2006 appropriations bill providing \nvital funding for the Departments of Commerce and Justice and related \nagencies. I am, however, disappointed about the fact that this bill \nunderfunds some important priorities. I am also disappointed that the \nSenate rejected several worthy amendments that would have improved this \nbill and helped to meet our obligations to the victims of Hurricane \nKatrina.\n  Whether we call police officers ``law enforcement'' or ``first \nresponders,'' I believe that Congress, in partnership with States and \nlocal communities, has an obligation to provide State and local law \nenforcement with the tools, technology, and training they need to \nprotect our communities. I am deeply concerned about proposed cuts in \nFederal funding programs for our nation's law enforcement officers. I \nhave consistently supported a number of Federal grant programs, \nincluding the Community Oriented Policing and Problem Solving, COPS, \nProgram, which is instrumental in providing funding to train new \nofficers and provide crime-fighting technologies. I also support \nfunding for the Byrne grant\n\n[[Page S10080]]\n\nprogram, which provides funding to help fight violent and drug-related \ncrime, including support to multi-jurisdictional drug task forces, drug \ncourts, drug education and prevention programs, and many other efforts \nto reduce drug abuse and prosecute drug offenders. I know how important \nthese programs have been to Wisconsin law enforcement efforts, in \nparticular with regard to fighting the spread of methamphetamines.\n  Unfortunately, not everyone sees it that way. Once again this year, \nthe administration's budget proposal would have drastically cut the \nCOPS Program, and would have eliminated all funding for the Byrne grant \nprogram. I have already supported efforts to restore this funding \nthrough the budget process, and am proud to continue to fight in the \nappropriations process to make sure that state and local law \nenforcement receive the Federal grants that they need and deserve. We \nshould be doing more, not less, to support our local law enforcement. \nIn particular, I was proud to support Senator Biden's amendment that \nprovided additional COPS funds for the hiring of local police officers, \nan aspect of the COPS Program that has been dramatically cut back. The \namendment also would have provided $19 million to help find children \ndisplaced by Katrina and reunite them with their families, and to \nsupport victims of domestic violence and sexual assault affected by \nKatrina. I regret the Senate's decision to reject this amendment.\n  On the other hand, I am pleased that an amendment offered by Senators \nDayton and Chambliss to increase Byrne/local law enforcement block \ngrant funding by $275 million was accepted. This amendment, which I \ncosponsored, restores funding for these important programs to fiscal \nyear 2003 levels, and I hope it will be retained in conference.\n  While I strongly support the efforts of Senator Stabenow to address \nthe need for first responders to have interoperable communications \ncapabilities, I could not support her amendment. My colleague from \nMichigan rightly notes that making sure that all of our first \nresponders can communicate with each other must be a priority for our \nNation, and I admire her efforts to advance this cause. However, 4 \nyears after September 11 tragically highlighted this vitally important \nissue, we still do not have unified national interoperable \ncommunications standards. Without these standards, there is no \nguarantee that a new $5 billion grant program for equipment would \ncreate the interoperable communication system we need and that our \nfirst responders and communities deserve. When spending such massive \namounts of money and such a large percentage of all first responder \nfunding on this new program, we must make sure that we are spending the \nmoney wisely. Without standards we cannot meet this test and that is \nwhy I regretfully voted against this amendment.\n  I am disappointed that the Senate did not adopt the amendment I \ncosponsored offered by Senator Clinton that would have created a \ncommission to investigate and identify the problems with the \ngovernmental response to Katrina. Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath \ndevastated the gulf region and exposed serious flaws in our Nation's \nresponse capabilities. While the crisis prompted untold acts of heroism \nand compassion that continue to this day, it also revealed gaping holes \nin the Government's reaction and ability to stop, reduce, or mitigate \nthe effects of this terrible disaster.\n  We need answers. We need answers about what went right, what went \nwrong, and what we can do to make sure our response is better to future \ndisasters. We need a serious inquiry unimpeded by political \nconsiderations or posturing, and I believe an independent commission is \nthe right way to do that. Our Nation and this Senate have been willing \nto spend tens of billions of dollars in the last 4 years to address our \ndisaster response capabilities. Hurricane Katrina showed that those \ncapabilities still can't provide Americans with the protection and \nsafety they deserve. We need the serious rethinking and reassessment a \nKatrina commission could provide so that we can effectively address our \nnation's critical response needs. That is why I hope the Senate will \nsoon reconsider establishing such a commission.\n  In closing, I want to note my disappointment that the bill fails to \naddress problems with media concentration. I have long been concerned \nabout concentration and vertical integration in the radio industry, \nwhich was one of the reasons I opposed the Telecommunications Act of \n1996 that relaxed many ownership restrictions. I feel that \nconsolidation has the strong potential for limiting creativity, \nlocalism and diversity on our airwaves. In 1998, twice in 2001 and \nagain in September 2002, the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, \npublished reports on the changes in the radio industry as a result of \nthe 1996 act. These reports showed significant consolidation nationally \nand in local markets. For example in 1996, the largest radio group \nowned less than 65 stations; by 2002 the largest radio group had more \nthan 1,200 stations.\n  I proposed a modest amendment to require the FCC to update and \nprovide Congress with a report on consolidation in the radio industry \nthat the FCC last produced 3 years ago. I was disappointed that I was \ndenied even the opportunity to get a vote on my amendment. As New York \nAttorney General Eliot Spitzer's recent payola settlement shows, there \ncontinue to be problems with the radio industry and therefore there is \na need for updated information about the state of the industry so that \nCongress can decide how to address these problems.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10080-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10080-S10103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2006\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

If the Secretary and the Federal Financing Bank \n     approve such an extension, then the period of the existing \n     guarantee shall also be considered extended.\n       (b) Limitations.--\n       (1) Feasibility and security.--Extensions under this \n     section shall not be made unless the Secretary first finds \n     and certifies that, after giving effect to the extension, in \n     his judgment the security for all loans to the borrower made \n     or guaranteed under this Act is reasonably adequate and that \n     all such loans will be repaid within the time agreed.\n       (2) Extension of useful life of collateral.--Extensions \n     under this section shall not be granted unless the borrower \n     first submits with its request either--\n       (A) Evidence satisfactory to the Secretary that a Federal \n     or State agency with jurisdiction and expertise has made an \n     official determination, such as through a licensing \n     proceeding, extending the useful life of a generating plant \n     or transmission line pledged as collateral to or beyond the \n     new final maturity date being requested by the borrower, or\n       (B) A certificate from an independent licensed engineer \n     concluding, on the basis of a thorough engineering analysis \n     satisfactory to the Secretary, that the useful life of the \n     generating plant or transmission line pledged as collateral \n     extends to or beyond the new final maturity date being \n     requested by the borrower.\n       (3) Amount eligible for extension.--Extensions under this \n     section shall not be granted if the principal balance \n     extended exceeds the appraised value of the generating plant \n     or transmission line referred to in subsection (2).\n       (4) Period of extension.--Extensions under this section \n     shall in no case result in a final maturity greater than 55 \n     years from the time of original disbursement and shall in no \n     case result in a final maturity greater than the useful life \n     of the plant.\n       (5) Number of extensions.--Extensions under this section \n     shall not be granted more than once per loan advance.\n       (c) Fees.--\n       (1) In general.--A borrower that receives an extension \n     under this section shall pay a fee to the Secretary which \n     shall be credited to the Rural Electrification and \n     Telecommunications Loans Program account. Such fees shall \n     remain available without fiscal year limitation to pay the \n     modification costs for extensions.\n       (2) Amount.--The amount of the fee paid shall be equal to \n     the modification cost, calculated in accordance with section \n     502 of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, as amended, of \n     such extension.\n       (3) Payment.--The borrower shall pay the fee required under \n     this section at the time the existing guarantee is extended \n     by making a payment in the amount of the required fee.\n       Sec. 767. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, to \n     provide for consistent regulation of consumer contact lenses, \n     no funds appropriated in this or any other Act may be used in \n     this and each fiscal year hereafter for the approval for sale \n     in the United States of any contact lens produced by a \n     manufacturer unless that manufacturer certifies that it does \n     not discriminate in the distribution of, or restrict consumer \n     access to, any contact lenses it produces, markets, \n     distributes, or sells, and makes any such lenses available in \n     a commercially reasonable and non-discriminatory manner \n     directly to and generally within all alternative channels of \n     distribution: Provided, That for the purposes of this \n     section, the term ``alternative channels of distribution'' \n     means any mail order company, Internet retailer, pharmacy, \n     buying club, department store, mass merchandise outlet or \n     other distribution alternative without regard to whether it \n     is associated with a prescriber, and the term \n     ``manufacturer'' means the manufacturer and its parents, \n     subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns.\n       Sec. 768.

The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all after \nthe enacting clause be stricken; that the text of H.R. 2744, Calendar \nNo. 141, the Senate committee-reported bill, be inserted in lieu \nthereof, considered as original text for the purpose of further \namendments, and that no points of order be waived by reason of this \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That order has been entered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate \nfor myself and the ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator Kohl, \nthe fiscal year 2006 appropriations bill for Agriculture, Rural \nDevelopment and related agencies. This bill contains the funding for \nthe Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission. It also sets a limitation on \nthe funding for the Farm Credit Administration, although no \nappropriated funds are provided for that agency.\n  The bill is at our 302(B) budget authority allocation of $17.348 \nbillion, and it is within our outlay allocation of $18.816 billion. It \nis the product of more than 7 months' examination of the \nadministration's budget proposal and\n\n[[Page S10101]]\n\nmany requests from Senators and other stakeholders. It was approved \nunanimously by the subcommittee and the full committee and is the \nproduct of a completely bipartisan effort with contributions from \nSenators on both sides of the aisle.\n  Since I have been the chairman of this subcommittee, I have had the \npleasure of working with Senator Kohl and his excellent staff and have \nlearned a great deal from that experience. For the record, I thank them \nfor the excellent and professional way in which they have helped us \ncraft this bill. This is truly a bipartisan effort. There has been a \nminimum of difficulty and bickering. This is a tribute to Senator Kohl \nand the staff he has assembled on his side, as well as the staff that \nmade themselves available to me. I express my gratitude to him and to \nall of the staffers involved; also, the members of the subcommittee and \nthe full committee who have cooperated with us in producing the \nunanimous report at both levels.\n  We commonly refer to this as simply the ``Ag appropriations bill,'' \nbut it has a much wider impact on American citizens than just \nagriculture. The largest portion of the funding in this bill, whether \ndiscretionary or mandatory, goes to nutrition and feeding programs for \nmothers and children both in low-income groups and in senior citizens. \nWe often think of the Agriculture appropriations bill entirely in terms \nof farmers, so I wish to make the point that this bill funds the \nfeeding and nutrition program for those I have described.\n  It is also a consumer protection bill for food, drugs, and medical \ndevices. It is an export promotion bill for our farmers and food \nmanufacturers. It is a conservation and natural resources bill, and it \nis a bill to promote the economic development of rural America.\n  The budget authority allocation is $516 million more than last year's \nlevel, which sounds good if one is looking for more spending. Last \nyear, we had a $406 million one-time saving that is not available this \nyear. So when one nets those two numbers out, this bill is virtually \nidentical to the previous allocation.\n  Also, we should note that the administration budget proposes $177 \nmillion in user fees contingent on authorization, which was sent to the \nauthorizing committee only 3 weeks ago and has not been considered. So \nthose user fees also reduce the total amount of the bill. That is why I \nsay in general terms, this bill is level funding of the previous year.\n  I should point out that the previous year was below the year before \nthat. So at least as far as this subcommittee of the Appropriations \nCommittee is concerned, we are not expanding the Federal budget or \nadding to the deficit by increasing every year. We are either going \ndown or, at best, holding steady.\n  We do thank Chairman Cochran for the allocation that gives us the \n$516 million more than that I talked about. Because of the other \nfactors I have described, it is absolutely essential to keep us \neffectively holding steady.\n  At this time when we are concerned about homeland security, I will \noutline the homeland security increases that are in this bill. There is \n$10 million for the National Agricultural Pest Information Systems; \nprovides $166.5 million for food defense activities at FDA. This is an \nincrease of $16.6 million over fiscal year 2005. In addition, the \ncommittee continues to fund FDA counterterrorism activities related to \nmedical product countermeasures at $57.2 million.\n  We provide $13 million for the Food Emergency Response Network in \nUSDA and FDA to integrate the Nation's food testing laboratories for \nthe detection of threat agents in food at the local, State, and Federal \nlevels. We fund the completion of the National Animal Disease Center. \nThose are the increases in the funding levels for terrorism.\n\n  Food safety, we have an increase of $36.2 million, and this includes \nfull funding for food inspection, BSE surveillance--BSE is the more \nappropriate name for what the press calls mad cow disease--as well as \nhumane slaughter. As far as animal health programs are concerned, we \nprovide full funding for BSE surveillance and an increase for the \ndetection of low pathogenic avian influenza.\n  In the area of the research and education program, there is $1.167 \nbillion to support research, education, and extension activities at \nAmerica's land grant colleges and universities. We have learned that is \nthe backbone of research in agriculture, and that is why we continue to \nfund that particular area. We also fund 1890 institutions--those are \nthe historically Black land grant colleges--as well as tribal colleges \nand schools of forestry.\n  There is approximately $1.1 billion for the Agricultural Research \nService, adding money for research in animal diseases, human nutrition, \nand food safety. Then there is $59 million to complete funding for the \nNational Animal Disease Center located in Ames, IA. This is a project \nthat we have been involved in for some years, and with this \nappropriation it will finally be completed.\n  For the farm assistance programs, there is $3.7 billion for farm \nloans; conservation programs, $963 million for conservation and \nwatershed activities; and in the area of rural development, we have \n$454 million for water and waste water grants; $5 billion for low-\nincome housing; over $1 billion in loans and grants for small rural \nbusinesses; $6.2 billion for rural electrification and \ntelecommunications loans; and $550 million for broadband loans.\n  In the area of domestic food programs, WIC funding, Women and Infant \nChildren, $5.257 billion; and for food stamps, $40.7 billion. These are \nvery large numbers. This is the area I spoke of earlier where the bulk \nof the appropriations go, and for those who are concerned about these \nareas of nutrition for people in need, both funding levels provided \nwill meet the expected caseload.\n  Foreign assistance, we have $147.868 million; PL-480 title II funds, \n$1.150 billion; and the McGovern-Dole program, $100 million.\n  Now let us turn for just a moment to the Food and Drug \nAdministration: FDA, $1.841 billion; the medical device review is \ngetting $7.8 million above fiscal year 2005; counterterrorism food \nsafety, $16.6 million above fiscal year 2005; and drug safety, $5 \nmillion above fiscal year 2005.\n  With respect to the limitations on mandatory programs where we have \nlooked for savings, we have two goals: one, to do no serious harm and, \nNo. 2, in whatever limitations are there, that they be fair. We believe \nwe have met both of those goals.\n  This was the work of the subcommittee and the full committee in the \nnormal course of events, and then, of course, Katrina came along. So I \nthink it is appropriate that we make some comments about what may or \nmay not be in this bill with respect to the hurricane disaster in the \nsouthern part of the United States.\n  This bill does not have provisions directly tied to that disaster, \nhaving been written before the disaster came along, but it does provide \nmuch of the resources USDA will need to help the victims of that \ndisaster, resources that were built into the normal course of events. \nThere is money for food stamps, WIC, and food safety, as I have \ndescribed. There is conservation recovery and rural housing, as I have \ndescribed. Many of the people who were hurt, particularly I believe in \nMississippi, are going to be facing rural housing challenges. USDA can \ncontinue its very commendable efforts to assist those in need with the \nexisting authorities as it has with the funds provided in this bill.\n\n  The States affected by Hurricane Katrina are all major beneficiaries \nof these programs. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to help us get \nthis bill passed by the Senate as soon as possible. We should not deal \nwith all of Katrina with supplemental funds when there are funds in the \npipeline in the normal fashion that can be of assistance.\n  We have had a number of requests from Senators on both sides of the \naisle regarding matters that came up after this bill was passed by the \nAppropriations Committee back in June. I and my staff and Senator Kohl \nand his staff are working on a managers' amendment to address these \nrequests, and I will be offering that amendment later during the \nconsideration of this bill.\n  I appreciate the attention of the Senate to this outline of where we \nare.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1726\n\n  I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of myself and Senator Kohl.\n\n[[Page S10102]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I am happy to yield to my ranking member, good friend, \nand full partner, Senator Kohl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the fiscal year \n2006 appropriations bill for Agriculture, Rural Development, and \nRelated Agencies. This year, the Agriculture Subcommittee received a \nbudget allocation of $17.3 billion, the first budget increase in \nseveral years. Along with our increased allocation, however, came \nincreased spending requirements and critical priorities that, in the \nend, left us with essentially the same funding level as last year. \nThanks in no small part to the hard work of Senator Bennett and his \nstaff, I believe we have put together a bill that all Senators should \nbe able to support without hesitation.\n  Before I discuss the bill at hand, however, I believe we would be \nremiss to not express our deepest sympathies to all of those affected \nby Hurricane Katrina. It seems almost unfair to plan for a year ahead, \nknowing there are people still trying to figure out their next hours \nand days. We are aware that so much remains to be done to help these \npeople, and while we do not include funding for specific items related \nto that disaster in this bill, we are working with USDA to ensure that \nimmediate help in the form of food and housing is being provided, and \nwill work to make sure that when a disaster supplemental is passed, all \npossible help that can be provided by the USDA and FDA will most \ncertainly be included.\n  In the bill at hand, however, here are a few of the highlights.\n  With the recent discovery--the first of its kinds--of BSE resulting \nfrom a cow born in the United States, it is important to note that this \nbill fully funds the President's request for all mad cow disease \nprevention and detection activities within the Animal and Plant Health \nInspection Service, the Food Safety and Inspection Service, and the \nFood and Drug Administration. This will allow USDA and FDA to continue \nenhanced inspections of cattle, and to work to ensure the continued \nprevention of BSE in this country.\n  Not to diminish the other important work of keeping our food and drug \nsupply safe done by those agencies, I would like to point out that the \nFood Safety and Inspection Service received an increase of nearly $20 \nmillion above last year's level, which will provide for 7,690 food \nsafety inspectors. The Food and Drug Administration received an \nincrease of nearly $35 million, including nearly $17 million for \ncounterterrorism activities, nearly $8 million for increased medical \ndevice review, and $5 million for increased drug safety activities.\n  The importance of the conservation and watershed programs cannot be \noverstated, especially in light of recent events. This bill provides \n$963 million for the Natural Resources Conservation Service; $820 \nmillion for conservation operations, $5 million for watershed surveys \nand planning; $60 million for watershed and flood prevention programs; \n$27 million for the watershed rehabilitation program, and $51 million \nfor resource conservation and development.\n  In rural development, the bill provides adequate funding for programs \nto meet priority needs for rural communities including business \ndevelopment, water and waste assistance, affordable rural housing, \nelectric, telephone and broadband connections, and essential community \nfacilities. The bill also provides a safety net to preserve rural \nmulti-family housing and prevent low-income rural residents from being \ndisplaced from Government financed rental housing projects due to \nrecent market and legal developments.\n  For the WIC Program, the bill provides $5.25 billion, an increase of \nnearly $22 million from last year's level. Although this amount is less \nthan what the administration originally requested, changes in \nparticipation and food cost estimates allowed these savings, and the \namount provided ensures full access to this program using the most up-\nto-date estimates. This funding level is supported by the \nadministration, as well as noted hunger advocacy groups, all of whom \nhave worked with the committee in determining the proper and adequate \nWIC funding level. This amount includes a contingency reserve of $125 \nmillion, $20 million for improved computer systems, and $15 million for \nbreastfeeding support activities. Further, we did not include the \nPresident's proposals to limit Medicaid eligibility restrictions, nor \nlower the cap on nutrition services administrative funding. All other \nnutrition programs were funded at or above the President's request \nlevel, including $40.7 billion for food stamps, $12.4 billion for child \nnutrition programs, nearly $109 million for the Commodity Supplemental \nFood Program, and $140,000,000 for The Emergency Food Assistance \nProgram.\n  This bill also does not neglect our responsibilities to help other \ncountries. The Foreign Agricultural Service received an increase of $11 \nmillion this year. The PL-480 program, which supplies U.S. commodities \nto fight hunger in other countries, is funded at $1.15 billion, and the \ncommittee did not accept the administration's proposal to shift some of \nthese funds to USAID.\n\n[[Page S10103]]\n\nThe McGovern-Dole program, which provides food for impoverished \nschoolchildren in other countries, receives $100 million.\n  Overall, as I have previously stated, we were able to do everything \nthat everyone wanted us to do. However, I think that Senator Bennett \nhas done a good job in making sure that this bill addresses the most \nimportant needs that we have. I would like to thank him again, as well \nas Jon Ziolkowski, Fitz Elder, Hunter Moorhead, Dianne Preece, and \nStacy McBride on his staff for their hard work and dedication. They \nexhibited professionalism and a strong work ethic throughout this \nentire process, and worked seamlessly with my staff, for which I am \nalso thankful.\n  I strongly support this bill, and I encourage all Senators to vote in \nfavor of it.\n  I look forward to debating and passing this bill on the Senate floor \nand moving one step further toward providing USDA and FDA funds for \nfiscal year 2006 in the regular order. I encourage all Senators with \namendments to this bill to file them early and to work with Senator \nBennett and myself and our staffs to deal with any and all amendments \nthat come up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask further proceedings under the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about the importance of our \nConstitution. In Delaware, we are reminded of that every year, at least \nonce a year, on December 7, because that is Delaware Day. In Delaware, \nwe celebrate on December 7, the day in 1787 when Delaware became the \nfirst State to ratify the Constitution. For one whole week, Delaware \nwas the entire United States of America. After a week or so, we opened \nit up and let other States in, including South Carolina. For the most \npart, we have been pleased with the way things turned out.\n  This year, Constitution Day is going to be commemorated not just in \nDelaware on December 7 but across the country on September 17. That \nwill be Saturday. That is actually the day the Constitution was \napparently signed back in 1787, up in Philadelphia.\n  If you visit the Senate today and all this week and you come into one \nof the galleries, if you walk in, they will give you a copy of the \nConstitution. Today I was bringing in some visitors, from Dover, DE, \nand I was given a copy of the Constitution with the amendments thereto. \nI was reminded that this commemoration of our Constitution for this \nSaturday was made possible by one of our colleagues in the Senate, \nRobert Byrd, who carries with him every day a copy of the Constitution \na little bit smaller than this one. You have probably seen it, Mr. \nPresident. He pulls it out every now and then and waves it in our faces \nto remind us what it is all about. It is because of his love, really \ndevotion, to the Constitution that we will be having a special \ncommemoration on Saturday. I thank Senator Byrd for doing that.\n  I am a Delawarean who treasures what our Constitution does. It is the \nbasic law of our land, the law on which all the other laws are built. \nThe Constitution which is becoming the longest lived Constitution in \nthe history of the world and the Constitution most replicated by every \nnation on Earth is the one we celebrate this Saturday.\n  I wish to take a couple of moments to share and remind us again how \nthe Constitution is introduced. It starts off--many of us know these \nwords. In fact, many of us as schoolchildren, and our children as well, \nhad to learn the preamble to the Constitution, which reads as follows:\n\n       We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more \n     perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic \n     Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the \n     general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to \n     ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this \n     Constitution for the United States of America.\n\n  ``We the people,'' those three words encapsulate the very essence of \nwhat makes America so wonderful. By presenting a united front, our \nFounding Fathers told the world that they stood together when creating \nthis great country. I believe we need to recapture their spirit of \nreconciliation and to focus our energies on healing the rift that has \ndeveloped in our current political climate, a rift that goes back to \nthe beginning of this administration, the previous administration, and, \nfrankly, for some time before that.\n  We have seen how powerful America can be when all of our citizens \nunite to focus on a common goal. During this upcoming weekend, \nSaturday, September 17, I urge all Americans--not just my children who \nare in high school; not just other schoolchildren, but I urge all \nAmericans from all walks of life to pause and contemplate principles \nthat form the cornerstone of this great democracy of ours. By \nunderstanding our past, I believe we can navigate toward a better \nfuture and truly honor the philosophy and spirit of our Founding \nFathers.\n\n  The first 10 amendments to the Constitution are called the Bill of \nRights. They lay out some of the liberties that we take for granted, \nbut people in other places around the world would love to have these \nliberties. They do not and maybe they never will. I hope they will.\n  But our Constitution has, among other liberties, the freedom to bear \narms. It has the right to say what is on our mind. In fact, there are \nnewspapers, television stations, our radio stations--all of us enjoy \nfreedom of speech. People can vote for whomever they want. If they like \nthe job we are doing, they can reelect us; if they don't, they can \nthrow us out and put somebody else in these seats. They can run for the \njob themselves.\n  They have a right to a jury by their peers. They have a right to be \nprotected from unlawful searches without an order of a judge. There are \nall kinds of protections in our Constitution.\n  There is one given a little attention here lately, given a decision \nby a district court judge out in California. The question it raises is \nin the press of late, in the last 24 or 48 hours--again, I might add--\nthe question of whether or not the Pledge of Allegiance to our flag, \nwhere we say ``one nation under God,'' is indeed constitutional.\n  I would have us go back to the beginning of our Nation's history, \nwhen we were born as a nation. I would have us remember, when the first \nPresident, George Washington, was sworn into office and they finished \nthe ceremony--I think it was in New York City--they didn't break up and \ngo off to a bunch of inaugural balls. As I recall, they went to church.\n  Several years before that when they were up in Philadelphia and were \ntrying to hammer out the Constitution itself, whenever they got into an \nespecially difficult place, they would sometimes call a halt to what \nthey were doing and pray about it. They actually began a lot of their \nsessions with prayers, much as we begin our session in the Senate and \nover at the House of Representatives.\n  The folks who gathered up in Philadelphia all those years ago did not \nwant to have a State religion. They didn't want to have a ``Church of \nAmerica.'' They didn't want to have our version of the Church of \nEngland. They wrote that in the Constitution, literally in the first \namendment. This is the way the first amendment starts:\n\n       Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of \n     religion.\n\n  If we go over the copy of the Constitution that we shared with the \nfolks coming into the Senate today as visitors, we read the language \nalongside the raw language of the amendment and it says these words:\n\n       The first amendment protects religious freedom by \n     prohibiting the establishment of an official or exclusive \n     church or sect.\n\n  I am not a lawyer, certainly not a constitutional lawyer. But I think \nI\n\n[[Page S10104]]\n\ncan read. When I read literally the words of the Constitution, I \nbelieve what our Founding Fathers were trying to do is to make sure we \ndon't establish in this country a church that somehow is sanctioned by \nthe Government. They just didn't want to go there. Seeing what happened \nin some other countries, they didn't want to have any part of that.\n  Having said that, our Founding Fathers were a religious people. They \nwere people of faith, and they drew on their faith, frankly, in drawing \nup this document and trying to resolve their differences in reaching \nthe core on this Constitution.\n  The Pledge of Allegiance, I don't believe, existed when those folks \nwere working on the Constitution. In fact, the words ``under God'' were \nonly added, I believe, in 1954, some 51 years ago. I would ask, given \nthe reliance on faith and people calling on their faith in 1787 when \ndrafting the Constitution, how would they feel about a Pledge of \nAllegiance that said, ``one nation under God''? My guess is they would \nfeel pretty good about it. Rather than saying that we ought to strike \nthat language ``under God,'' they would probably say we ought to keep \nthat in, and I would have to agree with them.\n  We will hear more about this issue going forward, I am sure. \nHopefully, when we do, we will think back not just about the \nConstitution and what the words actually say in the first amendment, \nbut we will also think back to the way people comported themselves and \nhow they drew on their faith in 1787 as they wrestled with drafting \nthis document and coming to consensus on this document. I think they \nwould want the words ``one nation, under God'' to be in the Pledge of \nAllegiance if we were to have one.\n  We have all said it hundreds, probably thousands, of times. I think \nwe got it right in 1954, and I think we ought to leave it that way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10104-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Delaware \nspeaking about our Constitution and religious freedoms because I would \nlike to follow up on his remarks. This week, Americans watching the \nconfirmation hearings of Judge John Roberts witnessed something unique \nabout his character, something we had seen before but that is now \nundeniable--his humility. I believe humility is a virtue that we should \nall feel as Americans. We should be humble in light of the blessings \nthat we have in this great country, humble in light of the courage of \nour Founders, and humble in light of the wisdom of the drafters of the \nConstitution.\n  This country was founded on religious freedom by our Founding \nFathers, many of whom were deeply religious. They wanted to create a \nplace where they could worship without fear of persecution. \nUnfortunately, the Federal district court declared yesterday that the \nphrase ``under God'' in our Pledge of Allegiance was unconstitutional. \nThis is deeply troublesome and is no less irrational than it would be \nto declare the Constitution itself unconstitutional.\n  The ruling by the Federal court in California is yet another example \nof the hostility by many activist judges toward a time-honored \ntradition. This tradition has been defended by numerous Justices, \nincluding Justice O'Connor, who said that eliminating such references \nwould sever ties to a history that sustains this Nation even today.\n  The Pledge of Allegiance began in 1892 as a patriotic exercise, \nexpressing loyalty to our Nation. It is a part of an American tapestry \nof time-honored and historically significant traditions that have come \nunder attack in this country. By international standards, we are a \nyoung country. Yet we seem so quick and so willing to throw out parts \nof our heritage that our Founders recognized as important. ``One nation \nunder God'' is no more the establishment or endorsement of religion \nthan our national motto, ``in God we trust,'' which is here above our \ndoor and above the Speaker's chair on the other side of the Capitol; or \nthe phrase ``God bless America,'' the closing words often used by the \nPresident when making public comments or speeches.\n  The Declaration of Independence states that our rights are \ninalienable for one reason, because we are endowed by our creator with \nthese rights. All of our references to God are the ways the Government \nproperly and constitutionally acknowledges our religious heritage.\n  We are a great nation, but we are also one nation under God. We are \nfilled with people who know how fortunate we are and how different our \nlives could be elsewhere.\n  This is why it is important that we are reminded and that our \nchildren are reminded to be humble. Reciting that the United States is \none nation under God is a statement of humility, a way of acknowledging \nthat even as a world superpower, we recognize there is something bigger \nthan we are, that our freedoms in this country come from God--not from \nGovernment. If we expel God from our public life, and if we lose \nhumility that comes with the belief in a creator, our children and \ngrandchildren will inherit an arrogant nation that has little hope for \nthe future.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint).

Mr. President, I have followed with interest the remarks \nof the Senator from Delaware about the Founding Fathers. Like him, I am \nunburdened with a legal education, but like him I believe I can read \nthe English language, and that I have spent some time studying not only \nthe Constitution but the history behind it. In the spirit of the \nremarks that have been made here, I add a few comments of my own.\n  It is very clear to me from studying the history of the first \namendment that the primary concern of the Founders was to prevent the \ncreation of State churches in the various States. There was never any \nmovement to have a national church, but there were movements on the \npart of some of the individual States to have State churches. One of \nthe reasons for the fact that there was not a national movement was \nthat different States were dominated by different religions.\n  For example, the Puritans who came to what became the State of \nMassachusetts came to flee persecution they found in Europe. Then once \nthey had established their colony in Massachusetts, they proceeded to \npersecute those who didn't agree with them. One of them, Roger \nWilliams, went over to found what is now the State of Rhode Island, and \ncreated in Rhode Island a bastion of religious liberty about which the \nSenator from Rhode Island instructed a group of us at noon today. I \nfound his presentation to be very interesting and worthwhile.\n  So a national religion covering all 13 States united in the United \nStates of America was never in the cards. But there were some who felt \nthat individual States might adopt a State church in that particular \nState, in one particular State or another. The Founding Fathers in the \nfirst amendment made it clear that there must not be a State church in \nany of the individual States. That was the driving force behind the \nwords in the first amendment.\n  There are those in today's society who read the first amendment and \nits prescription of freedom of religion to mean that the Government \nshould guarantee everyone freedom from religion, that the Government \nshould vigorously put down any reference to religion that takes place \nin the public square.\n  I think that is a misreading of the Founders' intention, and I think \nthat particular notion is behind the recent court ruling that has given \nrise to the speeches we have heard here on the floor.\n  I want to make one other observation about this, as long as I have \nthe floor. America is known as a religious country. As I travel abroad \nand deal with some of our European friends, I find many of them to be \nperplexed by that. Indeed, one religious commentator said to me that if \nyou are religious in Europe, you will be treated with disdain.\n\n[[Page S10105]]\n\nEurope has now entered its post-Christian era.\n  That is a very interesting statement, to think that Europe went \nthrough a pre-Christian era, then a Christian era, and now it is in a \npost-Christian period.\n  When you go throughout the great cities of Europe and look at the \nmany churches, you find that most of them have been turned into concert \nhalls, or tourist attractions, and they are not used for religious \npurposes anymore.\n  So why is Europe turning away from religion where America remains a \nstrongly religious nation? I am sure there are many reasons, but the \none that strikes me as cogent is the fact that we have never had a \nState church here in America. That means religions in America have had \nto compete for adherence in the public square on the basis of their \ndoctrine, on the basis of their humanity and compassion, on the basis \nof their attractiveness to those who might want to affiliate with them, \nwhereas in Europe you are required by law to join a particular church \nin a particular country.\n\n  When the government and the church become intertwined together in \nthat fashion, even to the point where the government provides funds for \nthe church, that makes it unnecessary for the church to appeal to its \nadherents sufficiently that they will support it out of their own \npocketbook, you get a corruption of both.\n  It was very interesting to me to travel to Russia after the Soviet \nUnion collapsed and spend some time talking with Russian officials \nabout this very issue. The Russian Parliament had passed an act which I \nbelieved was violative of the notion of freedom of religion and I went \nover to visit with them to talk to them about it.\n  After having visits with members of the Duma as well as members of \nthe Yeltsin administration and their justice department, I was assured \nthey would lean on the concept of freedom of religion and that the law \nwould not be used in any way to persecute certain religions that had \ncome in from outside, once the Iron Curtain was over and religions were \nmade welcome there.\n  But the interesting conversation out of all of that in the context of \nwhat I am saying here came from some individuals who were talking about \nthe role of the Russian Orthodox Church in Russian life. After the fall \nof the Soviet Union, the Russians were making an effort to identify \nthemselves once again as something other than Communists, trying to \nfigure out who they were, asking the fundamental question: What does it \nmean to be a Russian? Of course, the members of the Russian Orthodox \nChurch hierarchy said being a member of the Russian Orthodox Church is \nimportant to being a Russian, but they also said we do not want to be a \nState church again. We have been there, and we know how debilitating it \nis for the church to have government involvement in our affairs and to \nhave government financing our affairs.\n  As we have this debate over the words that go into the pledge--a \ndebate that I think will ultimately be settled in the courts one way or \nthe other, and if the precedent is as it has been, the words ``under \nGod'' will be retained in the pledge--let us take the occasion to \nremember why we have such religious strength in this country. It is the \nfact that we have had freedom of religion, and we have had different \ndenominations competing in the public square for their various \nadherents and not depending upon the Government for funding or \ndirection, unlike many of the countries in Europe.\n  America is not in its post-Christian era the way Europe is, and, \nironically, I think one of the reasons is because America has never had \na government dictation of what that would mean, what religion ought to \nbe. But again, even as we celebrate freedom of religion, I hope we \ndon't go so far as to have Government dictate freedom from religion and \ntell us that we must in some way or other, however subtle, persecute \npeople of faith.\n  I had the honor of receiving an honorary degree at one of our \nuniversities, and the commencement speaker was the Catholic bishop of \nthe area served by that university. He made the point that he respects, \nand it is required by our Constitution to respect, all of those who \ndisagree with him and have made the choice not to worship anyone. But \nhe said, I only ask in return that they extend to me the same respect \nfor the fact that I have chosen to worship and that they do not use \nGovernment affairs to persecute me for having chosen to believe, just \nas I say we must not use Government agencies to persecute those who \nhave chosen not to believe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I am here today to discuss a resolution, \nstrongly disapproving of the recent decision by the U.S. District Court \nfor the Eastern District of California that the Pledge of Allegiance is \nunconstitutional. I am hopeful that the Senate will pass this \nresolution later today. ,\n  The Pledge of Allegiance is a record of American values and history \nand the words of the Pledge still resonate in the convictions of \nAmericans today.\n  For more than 50 years, the Pledge of Allegiance has included \nreferences to the flag, to our country having been established as a \nunion ``under God,'' and to this country being dedicated to securing \n``liberty and justice for all.'' The Senate believes, as recognized in \na resolution passed unanimously in 2003, that the Pledge is a fully \nconstitutional expression of patriotism.\n  However, some of our courts have either no respect for or \nunderstanding of these American traditions.\n  Several years ago--June 26, 2002--in what has become an infamous \ncase, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled the \nPledge of Allegiance to be unconstitutional when recited voluntarily \nbecause it uses the phrase ``one nation under God.''\n  On June 14, the Supreme Court at least temporarily preserved the \nphrase ``one nation under God,'' in the Pledge of Allegiance, ruling \nthat the plaintiff could not challenge the patriotic oath because he \ndid not have standing in the case. This procedural ruling did not \ndirectly address whether the pledge recited by generations of American \nschoolchildren is constitutional. It left the Pledge vulnerable to \nanother challenge.\n  Not unsurprisingly, on January 3, 2005, the same plaintiff and four \nothers filed a second suit in the Eastern District of California \nchallenging again the words ``under God'' in the Pledge.\n  Yesterday, the Eastern District of California refused to dismiss the \ncase, holding instead that the Ninth Circuit's ruling in 2002--that the \nwords ``under God'' were unconstitutional--was still good law. The \neffect of the court's ruling is that the Pledge has been deemed \nunconstitutional in three Sacramento-area school districts. This issue \nwill likely be appealed to the Ninth Circuit again.\n  We are a nation of many faiths and beliefs. Tolerance for dissent is \none of our great American values. But so is our common conviction that \nAmerica is a nation that seeks the will and enjoys the protection of \nDivine Providence. The fact that some might disagree with that \nconviction is not a reason to deprive the rest of us of our right to \naffirm it in the Pledge.\n  I hope this body will join me in expressing support for the \nconstitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance by passing this \nresolution that the Senate strongly disapproves of yesterday's decision \nby the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10105-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10105-S10110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HURRICANE KATRINA\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in a few hours President Bush will speak \nto our Nation about Hurricane Katrina, a catastrophe that has \ndevastated the gulf coast and left all Americans deeply shaken.\n  For nearly a week, the entire world watched in horror as tens of \nthousands of American citizens trapped by the floodwaters pleaded for \nrescue, for food, water, and medicine. This didn't happen only in New \nOrleans. It happened in Slidell, in Jefferson Parish, in Pass \nChristian, LA, in Biloxi and Gulfport, MS, and countless other \ncommunities along the gulf coast. The devastation was so widespread.\n  We watched in stunned disbelief--hard to imagine that we were viewing \nour country, our neighbors as a great American city was turned into a \ntoxic lake by a disaster that had been predicted for years. We saw \nfamilies clinging desperately to roofs, pleading\n\n[[Page S10106]]\n\nto be rescued. People died trapped in the attics of their homes. Sick \nand elderly American citizens died, abandoned, in nursing homes. Babies \ndied in their mothers' arms. Bodies floated in rivers and decomposed in \nplain view. The images we saw didn't even look like America. They \nlooked like some foreign land. Yet we knew it was our America.\n  We don't have any idea how many lives Katrina claimed. The numbers \nmay reach hundreds, maybe thousands. We do know that Katrina was the \ngreatest natural disaster America has ever experienced. One million of \nour fellow Americans have been displaced from their homes by this \nhurricane. Many lost their homes, their jobs, their communities, \neverything they owned. They are scattered today across America, living \nin emergency shelters, living with families and friends, and living \nwith compassionate strangers. Many still don't know what has become of \ntheir family members, or whether they even survived.\n  A short time ago, our leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, and \nCongresswoman Pelosi of California from the other Chamber, spoke about \nwhat they hoped to hear the President say tonight. I want to take a few \nminutes to talk about what I--and I believe many Americans--hope to \nhear from the President this evening.\n  First, let me tell you what I hope the President will not say. I hope \nthe President's message to America is not divisive and ideological. \nSome are counseling the President to pursue that course. The lead \neditorial in this morning's Wall Street Journal gives you a sense of \nwhat those words may be like. It tells the President to ``get back on \nthe political and intellectual offensive'' as if we are in some kind of \na political campaign here when it comes to dealing with this great \ntragedy.\n  The solutions the Wall Street Journal proposes for New Orleans and \nthe gulf coast are all out of the ``Ownership Society'' notebook--\nvouchers for health care and education, tax credits, no sense of \ncommunity, no sense of shared purpose. Remember the motto of this \n``Ownership Society'' that we hear from the Wall Street Journal. Their \nmotto is to remember that we are all in this alone. But America knows \nbetter. That tone, those solutions, we have heard them so many times. \nWhen in doubt, the Wall Street Journal camp and those who follow it \nattack the liberals, the trial lawyers, anyone with different ideas.\n\n  Then, their ultimate universal solution for every catastrophe, every \nchallenge and every problem: cut taxes on the rich. That is a cliche \nthat will not work. It is a program that has failed. It is one that we \nshouldn't turn to.\n  For the good of America, it is time to stop attacking these perceived \npolitical enemies and start attacking the real problems: incompetence, \ncronyism, poor planning, poverty, inadequate health care and housing, \nand overwhelmed schools.\n  What do we need in America? What do we need from the President? Two \nwords: unity and community.\n  Two days ago, President Bush said he takes personal responsibility \nfor the Federal Government's disastrous response to Hurricane Katrina. \nThe Governor of Louisiana said the same thing yesterday. So be it. They \nhave accepted responsibility.\n  We need to know what happened. We need to know where we failed. But \nthe finger-pointing should end as of today.\n  I commend the President for acknowledging that the buck stops at the \nOval Office. Harry Truman had that famous sign on his desk: ``The buck \nstops here.'' And the President, with his acknowledgment, said as much \n2 days ago.\n  But responsibility is a word. What we need is accountability. \nAmericans are united in our desire to help our fellow citizens, who \nhave lost so much in this disaster, rebuild their lives and rebuild \ncommunities. It is in our national interest. More important, it is part \nof our national character. Americans do not turn their backs on their \nneighbors.\n  We want answers about the future of the gulf coast. But we also want \nand deserve answers as to how this catastrophe unfolded--not to point \nfingers of blame but to make sure we understand the shortcomings of \ngovernment at a moment when America needed it the most.\n  Something terrible happened on the gulf coast. Government at all \nlevels failed. The most basic test of government is to protect its \npeople. Instead, we had unnecessary death, destruction, suffering, and \nloss. How could it happen in America?\n  After the London subway bombings in July, we called for increased \nspending for rail security in this country. There was a vote on it, but \nthe administration said no. They said rail security was the \nresponsibility of State and local governments.\n  In an interview with the Associated Press, Secretary Chertoff of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security explained that he could not focus on \nevery threat. Then he said something which I am sure he regrets:\n\n       The truth of the matter is, a fully loaded airplane with \n     jet fuel, a commercial airliner, has the capacity to kill \n     3,000 people. A bomb in a subway car may kill 30 people.\n\n  I am certain the Secretary would like to be able to retract those \nwords. Then he said:\n\n       When you start to think about your priorities, you're going \n     to think about making sure you don't have a catastrophic \n     thing first.\n\n  Those are the words of Secretary Chertoff after the London subway \nbombing. Those were his words 6 weeks before Hurricane Katrina.\n  We are committed to the future of New Orleans and the gulf coast. But \nthe American people also want to know what happened before and after \nKatrina hit. Why were we not prepared for such a catastrophe? How could \nour government at all levels have been so unprepared to respond? What \ndid Congress do wrong? What did the Senate do wrong? What did each \nagency of government do wrong? What has been done with the billions of \ndollars we have spent on disaster preparedness since September 11?\n  We have created a new agency, and we have brought new agencies from \nother parts of the government under that roof. We have tried to make it \nleaner and meaner and more effective. Yet when tested with Hurricane \nKatrina, it failed.\n  If our government can't save us from a disaster that has been \npredicted for years--from a blip on the radar which was seen 48 hours \nbefore it caused any destruction in the gulf area how will this \ngovernment save us from a terrorist attack with no warning whatever?\n  Asking those questions is not ``playing the blame game.'' It is \naccountability. It puts a responsibility on my shoulders as a minority \nMember of the Senate as much as any other Member of the Senate.\n  Hurricane Katrina has shaken our faith in our ability of the \ngovernment to protect us. The only way to restore it is to get down to \nthe bottom line and ask the hard questions.\n  You may recall after September 11 there was a suggestion that we have \nan independent nonpartisan commission to analyze what went wrong. Why \ndidn't our intelligence agencies gather the information to warn us in \nadvance? There was resistance to that idea from the White House. Yet we \npressed forward. And the motivating force behind it was not only \npopular opinion but the surviving families of those who died on \nSeptember 11. Those husbands and wives and extended family members came \ntogether and forced the creation of the 9/11 Commission.\n  We need another commission. We need an independent, nonpartisan \ncommission in the mode and style of the 9/11 Commission. The force \nbehind it should be the same: families coming together--those who have \nlost loved ones, those who have lost their homes and lost their \ncommunities--to demand of this government accountability at all levels: \nlegislative, executive, local, State, and Federal.\n  It is regrettable; we had a chance to do this yesterday. Senator \nHillary Clinton of New York, who certainly understands the disaster of \nSeptember 11, as does her colleague, Senator Schumer, said let's put \ntogether this Katrina commission, this independent, nonpartisan \ncommission. Unfortunately, it failed on a party-line vote yesterday in \nthe Senate.\n\n  But that is not the end of the story. We will be back. We will be \nback with this commission proposal until we clearly do have an \nindependent commission we can trust to analyze the situation.\n  Wouldn't it be great tonight if the President, on national \ntelevision, says\n\n[[Page S10107]]\n\nhe now understands we need a Katrina commission? And that it should be \nindependent and nonpartisan, just like the 9/11 Commission? That would \nbe a great way to start.\n  There will be an independent inquiry into Hurricane Katrina because \nthe American people will demand it.\n  I hope the President tonight will announce that he supports a bill \nthat Republican chairman Susan Collins of Maine, and Democrat Senator \nJoe Lieberman of Connecticut have introduced to increase Federal \nfunding for the special inspector general that monitors reconstruction \nin Iraq so that office can also oversee spending on Hurricane Katrina \nrelief and reconstruction.\n  The Katrina reconstruction effort will be the most ambitious Federal \ninvestment effort since the New Deal, the largest-ever Federal \nexpenditure on a natural disaster. The special inspector general has \nthe expertise and infrastructure in place now to monitor the billions \nof dollars of Federal funds that will be needed and make sure the \ntaxpayers' dollars are not wasted.\n  FEMA has never had a sum of money like $60 billion. Trust me, having \nseen government at work for many years, you have to get up to speed and \nyou have to have accountability or money will be wasted. Victims will \nnot be helped when they should be.\n  In addition, Senators Obama, Carper, and Coburn have proposed their \nown idea, a creation of a chief financial officer to monitor financial \nmanagement of the departments involved in Katrina reconstruction. I \nencourage the President to endorse this proposal, as well.\n  We know that the $62 billion in emergency funds Congress has already \napproved for Katrina over the last two weeks is a down payment. We're \ntold that the President tonight will ask for another $50 billion, and \nthe final cost of this catastrophe could reach $200 billion--more than \nwe have spent in 3 years in Iraq to date.\n  Already we have heard troubling reports about contracts being awarded \nfor Katrina work. Listen to this headline from Monday's Wall Street \nJournal:\n\n       No Bid Contracts Win Katrina Work. White House Uses \n     Practices Criticized in Iraq Rebuilding for Hurricane-Related \n     Jobs.\n\n  That is a very disappointing headline. To think we would go down the \nsame path of waste and abuse we have seen in Iraq now in our own \ncountry with Hurricane Katrina is unacceptable.\n  The lead in the story says:\n\n       The Bush Administration is importing many of the \n     contracting practices blamed for spending abuses in Iraq as \n     it begins the largest and costliest rebuilding effort in \n     United States history.\n\n  This was printed in the Wall Street Journal in their news. It is not \nsome political document. It is their analysis. The story says:\n\n       The first large-scale contracts awarded to Hurricane \n     Katrina, as in Iraq, were awarded without competitive \n     building, using so-called `cost-plus' provisions that \n     guarantee contractors certain profits regardless of how much \n     they spend.\n\n  The article quotes a contracting expert at George Washington \nUniversity Law School who says:\n\n       You can easily compare FEMA's internal resources to what \n     you saw in the early days of the Coalition Provisional \n     Authority in Iraq: A small, underfunded organization taking \n     on a Herculean task under tremendous time pressure. This is \n     almost by definition a recipe for disaster.\n\n  Last week, the President signed an Executive order to cut the pay for \nconstruction workers on Katrina reconstruction projects. Think about \nthat for a second.\n  First, the wage scales in the South and Louisiana and Mississippi, in \nparticular, are very low anyway. Imagine you were a construction worker \nand your home or community was devastated by Katrina. You are now \ntrying to put your life and your family back together. You say to your \nfamily, ``the good news is I do construction work and, boy, we will \nneed a lot of that.''\n  The first thing the White House announces, ``we will cut that \nworker's pay.'' So the first thing we do for the workers who have lost \ntheir homes and lived through the devastation of Hurricane Katrina is \nto give them a smaller paycheck. Already, the wage scales are low in \nthis part of the country. The White House wants to cut them to even \nlower levels.\n  The Executive order waives the Davis-Bacon law of 1931. Interestingly \nenough, it is a provision in the law that is supported by management as \nwell as labor to make certain that you have skilled and qualified \nworkers building buildings and bridges and communities that will last \nand not fall apart.\n  Construction workers in New Orleans earn an average of $10.31 an \nhour, which is 25 percent below the national average already. They are \npaid so low now they cannot afford what many workers can buy across \nAmerica. Now President Bush wants to pay these workers, many of whom \nhave to rebuild their homes and their lives from scratch, he wants to \npay them even less. And the White House reportedly is going to do the \nsame thing for service workers on Katrina construction projects.\n  The first decision the President makes about Katrina reconstruction \nis to order a pay cut for workers who are trying desperately to rebuild \ntheir lives and support their families.\n  But not everyone is being asked to sacrifice. Joe Allbaugh was \nPresident Bush's campaign manager in the year 2000. From there he \nbecame Director of FEMA under the President. Then he hired his old \ncollege roommate, Mike Brown, a familiar name to most Americans.\n\n  Today, Mr. Allbaugh has left the Federal Government. He is a \nlobbyist. One of his clients, a company called the Shaw Group, has \nalready received two $100 million no-bid contracts for Katrina work--\none from the Army Corps of Engineers to pump flood water out of New \nOrleans, and the other from FEMA for construction and management for \nemergency housing for Katrina victims.\n  The Shaw Group has updated its Web site, and it reads ``Hurricane \nRecovery Projects--Apply Here!''\n  Now, another one of Mr. Allbaugh's clients, Kellogg, Brown & Root \nServices, a subsidiary of--you guessed it--Halliburton, formally headed \nby Vice President Cheney, is doing repair work at Navy facilities in \nMississippi damaged by Katrina. It received the contract for that work \ndespite the fact that the Pentagon auditors have questioned hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in charges for their work in Iraq. The same \ncompanies under investigation for ripping off taxpayers in Iraq are \nbeing awarded no-bid contracts for Katrina.\n  The President would serve the Nation well tonight if he says that we \nare going to put an end to this daisy chain of favorable contracts to \nold friends. It would be better if he would say that we are going to \nfocus on making sure that taxpayers get the most for the money that is \nbeing spent on this reconstruction, and also that we are going to help \nthe displaced workers in the region first--not well-connected private \ncontractors. We want to make certain those workers struggling to put \ntheir lives back together are the highest priority for Katrina \nreconstruction work.\n  If workers need the training to take on the jobs, they should get it. \nThey should be paid a decent wage for their labor, not a dime less.\n  State and local governments should receive priority over private \ncontractors. And when private contractors are used for Katrina cleanup \nand reconstruction, we need strict oversight for every single dollar.\n  Katrina is a national tragedy. It shouldn't be an opportunity for \nprofiteering.\n  There are other things we hope to hear from the President.\n  Yesterday, the cochairman of the independent September 11 Commission \nreleased a report showing most of its important recommendations still \nhave not been implemented 4 years after September 11.\n  According to Gov. Tom Kean, the Republican Governor of New Jersey who \nwas chair of this Commission:\n\n       The same mistakes made on September 11 were made over again \n     [in Hurricane Katrina], in some cases even worse.\n  Americans want to hear from their President how their Government \nintends to ensure that we are as protected as we can be from terrorist \nattacks, natural disasters, and other potential catastrophes, such as \nnuclear accidents and disease outbreaks, we are going to get it right.\n  Americans want to know that the National Guard has what it needs to \nrespond to emergencies at home.\n\n[[Page S10108]]\n\n  I asked a question the other day of the Secretary of Defense. I am \nnot sure he was happy with it. But I asked him: How far can we stretch \nthe National Guard? In my State, 70 percent of the National Guard men \nand women have already served in Iraq or are currently serving there.\n  Now, of those who have come home, 1 out of every 10 are headed to the \ngulf coast. Many of them returned from Iraq a few months ago. They were \ngetting reacquainted with their families and rebuilding their lives, \ntaking care of their homes and undertaking new responsibilities in \ntheir communities, new jobs.\n  Now, with that spirit of voluntarism, they have stepped forward. But \nthe obvious question is: How many times can we ask the National Guard \nto rise to this national challenge? How are we going to meet the \nrecruiting goals when we are asking so much of these men and women?\n  Guardsmen, Coast Guard members, and so many others have been the \nheroes of Hurricane Katrina. They have saved thousands and thousands of \nlives, at great risk. But the Guard's efforts were hampered by the fact \nthat 3,000 Guard members from Louisiana and 4,000 from Mississippi were \nin Iraq, with their equipment, their humvees, their trucks, their \nhelicopters.\n  The Army National Guard was woefully underequipped before the Iraq \nwar started. It had only 75 percent of the equipment it needed. Today, \nmore than half of the National Guard's equipment is either overseas or \nin need of major repair.\n  Now, we are watching Hurricane Ophelia off the coast of North \nCarolina. We pray it will not cause anywhere near the damage that it \nmight. But we are positioning emergency personnel and the National \nGuard to respond.\n  Time and time and time again, we turn to our National Guard men and \nwomen. The obvious question is: How often can we ask them to perform \nthis heroism? I think that is a legitimate question to ask this \nadministration. When disaster strikes, the Guard is forced to move its \npeople and equipment from farther away. As it does, it takes precious \ntime and delays response.\n  The Guard estimates its equipment needs at $14 billion today to \nupgrade the equipment of the National Guard to where it needs to be. \nThe President's budget recommendation, is it $14 billion for National \nGuard equipment? It is $1 billion. So we are not preparing homeland \nsecurity by equipping the National Guard with what they need today.\n  National Guard members do not lack for courage or commitment. They \nlack for equipment. The President should tell the American people \ntonight that he plans to ensure that the National Guard has what it \nneeds to protect us at home.\n  Let me move to another issue that is affecting families and \nbusinesses across America. The average price of gasoline today is $1.40 \nhigher than it was 4 years ago; for a gallon of gas, $1.40 more. Oil \ncompanies are announcing record profits. According to the Boston \nHerald, ExxonMobil is set to announce $10 billion in profits this \nquarter, after almost $8 billion in profits for the last quarter. They \nare making $110 million a day, and you know it because when you fill up \nyour gas tank, you take a look at what you are paying. This money, \nfrankly, is far in excess of what you should have to pay. These \ncompanies have had more in profits and more in net income than any \ncompanies in recent history in our country.\n  In Illinois, and across America, families have opened up their \nwallets for the victims of Hurricane Katrina. They should not have \ntheir pockets picked by a group of greedy oil companies.\n  Tonight, America wants to hear from President Bush the steps he is \ngoing to take to protect America's families and businesses from unfair \nprice gouging by oil companies. I certainly hope the President is \nwilling to take them on. What steps will the President support to \ndevelop alternative fuels so we can reduce our dependence on foreign \noil? What can our Nation do to make certain we do not have to walk hand \nin hand with Saudi sheiks begging them for their oil for our economy? I \nhope the President will address that this evening.\n  Americans also want to hear President Bush explain how we are going \nto pay for the reconstruction of the gulf coast without shortchanging \nimportant national priorities and without burying our children and \ngrandchildren in debt.\n  In the 1990s, under President Clinton, we eliminated the Federal \ndeficit. The Government was running a surplus. And we were actually \npaying down the national debt so our kids' mortgage, our national \nmortgage would be lower.\n  In the last 4 years, under President Bush's watch, our national debt \nhas increased by $3 trillion. That is a 50-percent increase in the \ncumulative debt of America's entire history--50 percent under President \nBush.\n  The Federal Government has to borrow $2 billion every morning just to \nkeep operating. Some are predicting the cost of Hurricane Katrina could \npush the deficit up to $400 billion this year. We are looking at a \nflood of red ink this year and for years to come.\n  Yet, incredibly, there are those who think our top priority now \nshould be cutting taxes for wealthy Americans. Imagine, no President in \nour history ever, of any administration, has cut taxes in the midst of \na war.\n\n  This President continues to cut taxes as our deficits reach historic \nlevels. And now, with Hurricane Katrina, we still hear Republicans on \nthe other side of the aisle saying: Well, we have to give a tax break \nto the wealthiest Americans by eliminating the estate tax.\n  Accountability means responsibility. It means leadership. Tonight, \nwhen the President speaks to the Nation, he should announce he will \nrefuse to sign any bill eliminating the estate tax or any other tax cut \nthat provides a windfall for the very wealthiest among us, until we \nprovide it for the neediest among us, the victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n  Let me conclude by reminding my colleagues of a statement of Bill \nCohen. Bill is a former Republican Senator from Maine and former \nSecretary of Defense under President Clinton. Here is what he said. \nThis is ``the Cohen Rule'':\n\n       Government is the enemy--until you need a friend.\n\n  The other day I read a variation of this rule. It was said by Senator \nTrent Lott, who is viewed as a very conservative Republican in this \nChamber. Here is what Senator Trent Lott said:\n\n       You're a fiscal conservative--until you get hit with a \n     natural disaster.\n\n  In addition to houses and lives, one of the things swept away by \nHurricane Katrina for many Americans was the myth of this ``ownership \nsociety,'' which we have heard from the most conservative think tanks \nin Washington and from this administration. That is the point of view \nthat says that less Government is always better, and we are all better \noff when we watch out for ourselves and our own families only and don't \nworry about the other guy.\n  For many of the victims of Hurricane Katrina, the only thing less \nGovernment meant was less protection. What Americans need is not \nnecessarily less Government, but smarter Government. We need a \nGovernment that is strong enough to protect us overseas and protect us \nat home, a Government rooted in the most basic American moral values, a \ntradition that goes back to the earliest days of our Nation: banding \ntogether in times of need, to do for each other what none of us can do \nalone--using our common wealth for the common good.\n  Americans want a Government that says: We are all in this together, \nnot: We are all in this alone.\n  We have seen so much heroism from so many people during Hurricane \nKatrina. We have seen the overwhelming kindness of Americans toward the \nsurvivors, the overwhelming, spontaneous outpouring of contributions \nfrom people across America--from the major corporations with their \nmillions of dollars to the kids on the corner selling lemonade--all of \nthem trying to do their part to help their neighbors, the most \nvulnerable in America, the victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n  America is yearning for a leadership and a leader that will speak to \nthat spirit of unity and community. We will listen closely tonight for \nit.\n  The ``ownership society'' is not the right answer--it never was. Nor \nis using this national tragedy to try to divide Americans a good idea, \nwhen we yearn to be drawn together, not pulled apart.\n\n[[Page S10109]]\n\n  We understand there are some challenges so enormous that none of us \nacting alone can meet them. We believe in sharing our blessings and our \nburdens. We believe in shared sacrifice.\n  There was a story in the Washington Post last weekend, the headline \nwas ``The Nation's Castaways.'' It was a story about some of the people \nwho were left behind to fend for themselves in New Orleans when the \nfloods came.\n  The reporter described a man who felt so guilty about the pita bread, \nwater, and juice that he looted from a Wal-Mart to feed his family that \nhe kept a list, so he can pay it back later. ``I feel like an American \nagain,'' the man said on TV after help finally began to arrive. ``I \nthought my country had abandoned me.''\n  Government at all levels failed during Hurricane Katrina, and tens of \nthousands of Americans were left with that same terrible fear--that \ntheir country had abandoned them. But we know from experience that when \nAmericans pull together, we can overcome any obstacle. We have done it \nso many times in our history.\n  The urgent task facing the President tonight, and facing every leader \nin Government, facing every Senator, including this Senator, is to show \nthe American people, not just in words but with actions, that we will \nnot allow this tragedy to be repeated.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to join with the \ndistinguished assistant Democratic leader in his conscientious and \ncontinuing concern for the victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n  I have seen the Senator from Illinois on the floor day after day, \nraising these questions, addressing these concerns. I understand \ntomorrow the Senator is going to New Orleans to tour the area \npersonally, with Senate leadership, to see what needs to be done there \nto address the human suffering. I hear in his voice, and know from his \nlongstanding commitment to the people of Illinois, the depth of his own \nheartfelt concern for their problems and his passion for their \nsuffering and to do what we can, what we must, to address those \nproblems.\n  I look forward to hearing from the Senator next week, after his \nreturn from New Orleans and that area, as to what we can do more \neffectively--all of us as leaders in the Senate, all of us working \ntogether, all of us as Americans, not as Democrats or Republicans, not \nas partisans but as patriots--on behalf of all the people in need.\n  I share his concern. What prompted me to come to the floor is I heard \nthe Senator speaking about some of the difficulties in getting some of \nthe necessary information in order to perform our responsibilities as \nSenators. I share that frustration, or at least let me express my own \nfrustration because as a member of the Senate Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs which has, under the Senate's \norganizing resolution, the responsibility and the authority to oversee \nthe Department of Homeland Security as well as FEMA, the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, which is under that agency, I have been \nconfounded and enormously dismayed by the unwillingness of the Senate \nRepublican leadership to permit that committee to do what it is \nresponsible to do, which is to hold oversight hearings and to \nunderstand what is happening, what is not happening down in that flood-\nravaged part of the country, and also to find out what must be done not \nto look at just failures--also, you hear about successes--not to point \nfingers of blame, but to exercise our oversight responsibility, \nparticularly given that we have now, this body, at the President's \nrequest, appropriated almost $63 billion of taxpayers' money to address \nthese critical emergency needs.\n  I do not question the need to act quickly. And we have done so. But \nto deliver that much money--Federal taxpayers' dollars--to the \nresponsible agencies without any oversight, without any questions asked \nor answers provided about what is being done with that money, and \nparticularly to hear the Senator from Illinois describe published \nreports of sole-source contracting with organizations that have \npolitical connections with the President's former campaign manager, I \nfind it to be shocking and appalling we have not exercised that \nresponsibility.\n  I would ask the leader, and others responsible for these decisions, \nabout when we will be holding public hearings in that committee to \nauthorize our proceeding to do so with those who are directly \nresponsible for the recovery efforts.\n\n  None of us wants to disrupt the recovery efforts in the southern part \nof the country. Lord knows, they have been disrupted enough already by \nwhat has failed to be done there, without any involvement by any of us. \nBut I find it perplexing that Cabinet secretaries who have enough time \nto appear on Sunday talk shows and who are also clearly not in \nLouisiana or Mississippi day and night, 7 days and nights a week around \nthe clock, have, while they are here in Washington, not a single hour \navailable to appear before our committee in a public setting and answer \nthe questions I have, that I know other members of the committee have, \nand that the American people have. We deserve--most importantly, the \nAmerican people deserve--answers to these important questions.\n  Yesterday, we had, after now 2\\1/2\\ weeks since those levees failed \nin New Orleans, the very first public hearing of this committee. We had \na former Governor of California, a former mayor of Grand Forks, ND, a \ncouple of other wonderful former public servants who have expertise \nfrom their own past experiences, but not a single one of the people on \nthat panel had any responsibility for the public response to Hurricane \nKatrina. Similarly, not a single person with public responsibility for \nthat response was willing to appear on that committee.\n  It was 9 days ago that we had before a number of us Senators 10 \nCabinet secretaries, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the \nhead of the National Guard to brief us on the situation right here in \nthe Capitol, but they were not willing to appear in a public setting, \neven though there was not a single word spoken in that briefing that \ncould not and should not have been witnessed and heard by the American \npeople.\n  A week ago we had the Director of Operations for FEMA and the Deputy \nCommandant of the Coast Guard appear before the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Government Affairs, but they would not appear in a public \nsetting. The briefing was behind closed doors. The public and press \ncould not witness what they had to say. We have not yet, on this \ncommittee or any other committee that I am aware of--certainly none on \nwhich I serve, including Armed Services--had a single administration \nofficial willing to appear before us in a public setting and provide us \nwith the information we desire, to allow us to ask questions and to \nprovide answers in front of the committee and the American people. I \nfind that unacceptable.\n  Again, I urge the Republican leadership of the Senate to authorize \nthat committee to proceed as we are responsible to do, to join us and \nmembers of the committee, insist that the administration provide us \ntheir top officials. When they are not in New Orleans or Mississippi, \nwhen they are here in Washington, come up for an hour, an hour once, to \nbegin with. Keep each of those Cabinet secretaries who were present 9 \ndays ago, ask each one of them to come up and tell us in a public \nsetting what their agency is doing to respond, what do they need from \nus, whether it is funding, legislation, removal of regulations, \nrestrictions--tell us what you need from us in order to be more \nresponsive and more effective in the Federal response to the emergency \nthat persists. Come before us in a public setting, as public officials, \nas those who are responsible for the Federal response. Let us ask the \nquestions we must to fulfill our oversight responsibilities, and let's \nstart providing some public answers to the American people.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S10110]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10105-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10105-S10110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HURRICANE KATRINA\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in a few hours President Bush will speak \nto our Nation about Hurricane Katrina, a catastrophe that has \ndevastated the gulf coast and left all Americans deeply shaken.\n  For nearly a week, the entire world watched in horror as tens of \nthousands of American citizens trapped by the floodwaters pleaded for \nrescue, for food, water, and medicine. This didn't happen only in New \nOrleans. It happened in Slidell, in Jefferson Parish, in Pass \nChristian, LA, in Biloxi and Gulfport, MS, and countless other \ncommunities along the gulf coast. The devastation was so widespread.\n  We watched in stunned disbelief--hard to imagine that we were viewing \nour country, our neighbors as a great American city was turned into a \ntoxic lake by a disaster that had been predicted for years. We saw \nfamilies clinging desperately to roofs, pleading\n\n[[Page S10106]]\n\nto be rescued. People died trapped in the attics of their homes. Sick \nand elderly American citizens died, abandoned, in nursing homes. Babies \ndied in their mothers' arms. Bodies floated in rivers and decomposed in \nplain view. The images we saw didn't even look like America. They \nlooked like some foreign land. Yet we knew it was our America.\n  We don't have any idea how many lives Katrina claimed. The numbers \nmay reach hundreds, maybe thousands. We do know that Katrina was the \ngreatest natural disaster America has ever experienced. One million of \nour fellow Americans have been displaced from their homes by this \nhurricane. Many lost their homes, their jobs, their communities, \neverything they owned. They are scattered today across America, living \nin emergency shelters, living with families and friends, and living \nwith compassionate strangers. Many still don't know what has become of \ntheir family members, or whether they even survived.\n  A short time ago, our leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, and \nCongresswoman Pelosi of California from the other Chamber, spoke about \nwhat they hoped to hear the President say tonight. I want to take a few \nminutes to talk about what I--and I believe many Americans--hope to \nhear from the President this evening.\n  First, let me tell you what I hope the President will not say. I hope \nthe President's message to America is not divisive and ideological. \nSome are counseling the President to pursue that course. The lead \neditorial in this morning's Wall Street Journal gives you a sense of \nwhat those words may be like. It tells the President to ``get back on \nthe political and intellectual offensive'' as if we are in some kind of \na political campaign here when it comes to dealing with this great \ntragedy.\n  The solutions the Wall Street Journal proposes for New Orleans and \nthe gulf coast are all out of the ``Ownership Society'' notebook--\nvouchers for health care and education, tax credits, no sense of \ncommunity, no sense of shared purpose. Remember the motto of this \n``Ownership Society'' that we hear from the Wall Street Journal. Their \nmotto is to remember that we are all in this alone. But America knows \nbetter. That tone, those solutions, we have heard them so many times. \nWhen in doubt, the Wall Street Journal camp and those who follow it \nattack the liberals, the trial lawyers, anyone with different ideas.\n\n  Then, their ultimate universal solution for every catastrophe, every \nchallenge and every problem: cut taxes on the rich. That is a cliche \nthat will not work. It is a program that has failed. It is one that we \nshouldn't turn to.\n  For the good of America, it is time to stop attacking these perceived \npolitical enemies and start attacking the real problems: incompetence, \ncronyism, poor planning, poverty, inadequate health care and housing, \nand overwhelmed schools.\n  What do we need in America? What do we need from the President? Two \nwords: unity and community.\n  Two days ago, President Bush said he takes personal responsibility \nfor the Federal Government's disastrous response to Hurricane Katrina. \nThe Governor of Louisiana said the same thing yesterday. So be it. They \nhave accepted responsibility.\n  We need to know what happened. We need to know where we failed. But \nthe finger-pointing should end as of today.\n  I commend the President for acknowledging that the buck stops at the \nOval Office. Harry Truman had that famous sign on his desk: ``The buck \nstops here.'' And the President, with his acknowledgment, said as much \n2 days ago.\n  But responsibility is a word. What we need is accountability. \nAmericans are united in our desire to help our fellow citizens, who \nhave lost so much in this disaster, rebuild their lives and rebuild \ncommunities. It is in our national interest. More important, it is part \nof our national character. Americans do not turn their backs on their \nneighbors.\n  We want answers about the future of the gulf coast. But we also want \nand deserve answers as to how this catastrophe unfolded--not to point \nfingers of blame but to make sure we understand the shortcomings of \ngovernment at a moment when America needed it the most.\n  Something terrible happened on the gulf coast. Government at all \nlevels failed. The most basic test of government is to protect its \npeople. Instead, we had unnecessary death, destruction, suffering, and \nloss. How could it happen in America?\n  After the London subway bombings in July, we called for increased \nspending for rail security in this country. There was a vote on it, but \nthe administration said no. They said rail security was the \nresponsibility of State and local governments.\n  In an interview with the Associated Press, Secretary Chertoff of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security explained that he could not focus on \nevery threat. Then he said something which I am sure he regrets:\n\n       The truth of the matter is, a fully loaded airplane with \n     jet fuel, a commercial airliner, has the capacity to kill \n     3,000 people. A bomb in a subway car may kill 30 people.\n\n  I am certain the Secretary would like to be able to retract those \nwords. Then he said:\n\n       When you start to think about your priorities, you're going \n     to think about making sure you don't have a catastrophic \n     thing first.\n\n  Those are the words of Secretary Chertoff after the London subway \nbombing. Those were his words 6 weeks before Hurricane Katrina.\n  We are committed to the future of New Orleans and the gulf coast. But \nthe American people also want to know what happened before and after \nKatrina hit. Why were we not prepared for such a catastrophe? How could \nour government at all levels have been so unprepared to respond? What \ndid Congress do wrong? What did the Senate do wrong? What did each \nagency of government do wrong? What has been done with the billions of \ndollars we have spent on disaster preparedness since September 11?\n  We have created a new agency, and we have brought new agencies from \nother parts of the government under that roof. We have tried to make it \nleaner and meaner and more effective. Yet when tested with Hurricane \nKatrina, it failed.\n  If our government can't save us from a disaster that has been \npredicted for years--from a blip on the radar which was seen 48 hours \nbefore it caused any destruction in the gulf area how will this \ngovernment save us from a terrorist attack with no warning whatever?\n  Asking those questions is not ``playing the blame game.'' It is \naccountability. It puts a responsibility on my shoulders as a minority \nMember of the Senate as much as any other Member of the Senate.\n  Hurricane Katrina has shaken our faith in our ability of the \ngovernment to protect us. The only way to restore it is to get down to \nthe bottom line and ask the hard questions.\n  You may recall after September 11 there was a suggestion that we have \nan independent nonpartisan commission to analyze what went wrong. Why \ndidn't our intelligence agencies gather the information to warn us in \nadvance? There was resistance to that idea from the White House. Yet we \npressed forward. And the motivating force behind it was not only \npopular opinion but the surviving families of those who died on \nSeptember 11. Those husbands and wives and extended family members came \ntogether and forced the creation of the 9/11 Commission.\n  We need another commission. We need an independent, nonpartisan \ncommission in the mode and style of the 9/11 Commission. The force \nbehind it should be the same: families coming together--those who have \nlost loved ones, those who have lost their homes and lost their \ncommunities--to demand of this government accountability at all levels: \nlegislative, executive, local, State, and Federal.\n  It is regrettable; we had a chance to do this yesterday. Senator \nHillary Clinton of New York, who certainly understands the disaster of \nSeptember 11, as does her colleague, Senator Schumer, said let's put \ntogether this Katrina commission, this independent, nonpartisan \ncommission. Unfortunately, it failed on a party-line vote yesterday in \nthe Senate.\n\n  But that is not the end of the story. We will be back. We will be \nback with this commission proposal until we clearly do have an \nindependent commission we can trust to analyze the situation.\n  Wouldn't it be great tonight if the President, on national \ntelevision, says\n\n[[Page S10107]]\n\nhe now understands we need a Katrina commission? And that it should be \nindependent and nonpartisan, just like the 9/11 Commission? That would \nbe a great way to start.\n  There will be an independent inquiry into Hurricane Katrina because \nthe American people will demand it.\n  I hope the President tonight will announce that he supports a bill \nthat Republican chairman Susan Collins of Maine, and Democrat Senator \nJoe Lieberman of Connecticut have introduced to increase Federal \nfunding for the special inspector general that monitors reconstruction \nin Iraq so that office can also oversee spending on Hurricane Katrina \nrelief and reconstruction.\n  The Katrina reconstruction effort will be the most ambitious Federal \ninvestment effort since the New Deal, the largest-ever Federal \nexpenditure on a natural disaster. The special inspector general has \nthe expertise and infrastructure in place now to monitor the billions \nof dollars of Federal funds that will be needed and make sure the \ntaxpayers' dollars are not wasted.\n  FEMA has never had a sum of money like $60 billion. Trust me, having \nseen government at work for many years, you have to get up to speed and \nyou have to have accountability or money will be wasted. Victims will \nnot be helped when they should be.\n  In addition, Senators Obama, Carper, and Coburn have proposed their \nown idea, a creation of a chief financial officer to monitor financial \nmanagement of the departments involved in Katrina reconstruction. I \nencourage the President to endorse this proposal, as well.\n  We know that the $62 billion in emergency funds Congress has already \napproved for Katrina over the last two weeks is a down payment. We're \ntold that the President tonight will ask for another $50 billion, and \nthe final cost of this catastrophe could reach $200 billion--more than \nwe have spent in 3 years in Iraq to date.\n  Already we have heard troubling reports about contracts being awarded \nfor Katrina work. Listen to this headline from Monday's Wall Street \nJournal:\n\n       No Bid Contracts Win Katrina Work. White House Uses \n     Practices Criticized in Iraq Rebuilding for Hurricane-Related \n     Jobs.\n\n  That is a very disappointing headline. To think we would go down the \nsame path of waste and abuse we have seen in Iraq now in our own \ncountry with Hurricane Katrina is unacceptable.\n  The lead in the story says:\n\n       The Bush Administration is importing many of the \n     contracting practices blamed for spending abuses in Iraq as \n     it begins the largest and costliest rebuilding effort in \n     United States history.\n\n  This was printed in the Wall Street Journal in their news. It is not \nsome political document. It is their analysis. The story says:\n\n       The first large-scale contracts awarded to Hurricane \n     Katrina, as in Iraq, were awarded without competitive \n     building, using so-called `cost-plus' provisions that \n     guarantee contractors certain profits regardless of how much \n     they spend.\n\n  The article quotes a contracting expert at George Washington \nUniversity Law School who says:\n\n       You can easily compare FEMA's internal resources to what \n     you saw in the early days of the Coalition Provisional \n     Authority in Iraq: A small, underfunded organization taking \n     on a Herculean task under tremendous time pressure. This is \n     almost by definition a recipe for disaster.\n\n  Last week, the President signed an Executive order to cut the pay for \nconstruction workers on Katrina reconstruction projects. Think about \nthat for a second.\n  First, the wage scales in the South and Louisiana and Mississippi, in \nparticular, are very low anyway. Imagine you were a construction worker \nand your home or community was devastated by Katrina. You are now \ntrying to put your life and your family back together. You say to your \nfamily, ``the good news is I do construction work and, boy, we will \nneed a lot of that.''\n  The first thing the White House announces, ``we will cut that \nworker's pay.'' So the first thing we do for the workers who have lost \ntheir homes and lived through the devastation of Hurricane Katrina is \nto give them a smaller paycheck. Already, the wage scales are low in \nthis part of the country. The White House wants to cut them to even \nlower levels.\n  The Executive order waives the Davis-Bacon law of 1931. Interestingly \nenough, it is a provision in the law that is supported by management as \nwell as labor to make certain that you have skilled and qualified \nworkers building buildings and bridges and communities that will last \nand not fall apart.\n  Construction workers in New Orleans earn an average of $10.31 an \nhour, which is 25 percent below the national average already. They are \npaid so low now they cannot afford what many workers can buy across \nAmerica. Now President Bush wants to pay these workers, many of whom \nhave to rebuild their homes and their lives from scratch, he wants to \npay them even less. And the White House reportedly is going to do the \nsame thing for service workers on Katrina construction projects.\n  The first decision the President makes about Katrina reconstruction \nis to order a pay cut for workers who are trying desperately to rebuild \ntheir lives and support their families.\n  But not everyone is being asked to sacrifice. Joe Allbaugh was \nPresident Bush's campaign manager in the year 2000. From there he \nbecame Director of FEMA under the President. Then he hired his old \ncollege roommate, Mike Brown, a familiar name to most Americans.\n\n  Today, Mr. Allbaugh has left the Federal Government. He is a \nlobbyist. One of his clients, a company called the Shaw Group, has \nalready received two $100 million no-bid contracts for Katrina work--\none from the Army Corps of Engineers to pump flood water out of New \nOrleans, and the other from FEMA for construction and management for \nemergency housing for Katrina victims.\n  The Shaw Group has updated its Web site, and it reads ``Hurricane \nRecovery Projects--Apply Here!''\n  Now, another one of Mr. Allbaugh's clients, Kellogg, Brown & Root \nServices, a subsidiary of--you guessed it--Halliburton, formally headed \nby Vice President Cheney, is doing repair work at Navy facilities in \nMississippi damaged by Katrina. It received the contract for that work \ndespite the fact that the Pentagon auditors have questioned hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in charges for their work in Iraq. The same \ncompanies under investigation for ripping off taxpayers in Iraq are \nbeing awarded no-bid contracts for Katrina.\n  The President would serve the Nation well tonight if he says that we \nare going to put an end to this daisy chain of favorable contracts to \nold friends. It would be better if he would say that we are going to \nfocus on making sure that taxpayers get the most for the money that is \nbeing spent on this reconstruction, and also that we are going to help \nthe displaced workers in the region first--not well-connected private \ncontractors. We want to make certain those workers struggling to put \ntheir lives back together are the highest priority for Katrina \nreconstruction work.\n  If workers need the training to take on the jobs, they should get it. \nThey should be paid a decent wage for their labor, not a dime less.\n  State and local governments should receive priority over private \ncontractors. And when private contractors are used for Katrina cleanup \nand reconstruction, we need strict oversight for every single dollar.\n  Katrina is a national tragedy. It shouldn't be an opportunity for \nprofiteering.\n  There are other things we hope to hear from the President.\n  Yesterday, the cochairman of the independent September 11 Commission \nreleased a report showing most of its important recommendations still \nhave not been implemented 4 years after September 11.\n  According to Gov. Tom Kean, the Republican Governor of New Jersey who \nwas chair of this Commission:\n\n       The same mistakes made on September 11 were made over again \n     [in Hurricane Katrina], in some cases even worse.\n  Americans want to hear from their President how their Government \nintends to ensure that we are as protected as we can be from terrorist \nattacks, natural disasters, and other potential catastrophes, such as \nnuclear accidents and disease outbreaks, we are going to get it right.\n  Americans want to know that the National Guard has what it needs to \nrespond to emergencies at home.\n\n[[Page S10108]]\n\n  I asked a question the other day of the Secretary of Defense. I am \nnot sure he was happy with it. But I asked him: How far can we stretch \nthe National Guard? In my State, 70 percent of the National Guard men \nand women have already served in Iraq or are currently serving there.\n  Now, of those who have come home, 1 out of every 10 are headed to the \ngulf coast. Many of them returned from Iraq a few months ago. They were \ngetting reacquainted with their families and rebuilding their lives, \ntaking care of their homes and undertaking new responsibilities in \ntheir communities, new jobs.\n  Now, with that spirit of voluntarism, they have stepped forward. But \nthe obvious question is: How many times can we ask the National Guard \nto rise to this national challenge? How are we going to meet the \nrecruiting goals when we are asking so much of these men and women?\n  Guardsmen, Coast Guard members, and so many others have been the \nheroes of Hurricane Katrina. They have saved thousands and thousands of \nlives, at great risk. But the Guard's efforts were hampered by the fact \nthat 3,000 Guard members from Louisiana and 4,000 from Mississippi were \nin Iraq, with their equipment, their humvees, their trucks, their \nhelicopters.\n  The Army National Guard was woefully underequipped before the Iraq \nwar started. It had only 75 percent of the equipment it needed. Today, \nmore than half of the National Guard's equipment is either overseas or \nin need of major repair.\n  Now, we are watching Hurricane Ophelia off the coast of North \nCarolina. We pray it will not cause anywhere near the damage that it \nmight. But we are positioning emergency personnel and the National \nGuard to respond.\n  Time and time and time again, we turn to our National Guard men and \nwomen. The obvious question is: How often can we ask them to perform \nthis heroism? I think that is a legitimate question to ask this \nadministration. When disaster strikes, the Guard is forced to move its \npeople and equipment from farther away. As it does, it takes precious \ntime and delays response.\n  The Guard estimates its equipment needs at $14 billion today to \nupgrade the equipment of the National Guard to where it needs to be. \nThe President's budget recommendation, is it $14 billion for National \nGuard equipment? It is $1 billion. So we are not preparing homeland \nsecurity by equipping the National Guard with what they need today.\n  National Guard members do not lack for courage or commitment. They \nlack for equipment. The President should tell the American people \ntonight that he plans to ensure that the National Guard has what it \nneeds to protect us at home.\n  Let me move to another issue that is affecting families and \nbusinesses across America. The average price of gasoline today is $1.40 \nhigher than it was 4 years ago; for a gallon of gas, $1.40 more. Oil \ncompanies are announcing record profits. According to the Boston \nHerald, ExxonMobil is set to announce $10 billion in profits this \nquarter, after almost $8 billion in profits for the last quarter. They \nare making $110 million a day, and you know it because when you fill up \nyour gas tank, you take a look at what you are paying. This money, \nfrankly, is far in excess of what you should have to pay. These \ncompanies have had more in profits and more in net income than any \ncompanies in recent history in our country.\n  In Illinois, and across America, families have opened up their \nwallets for the victims of Hurricane Katrina. They should not have \ntheir pockets picked by a group of greedy oil companies.\n  Tonight, America wants to hear from President Bush the steps he is \ngoing to take to protect America's families and businesses from unfair \nprice gouging by oil companies. I certainly hope the President is \nwilling to take them on. What steps will the President support to \ndevelop alternative fuels so we can reduce our dependence on foreign \noil? What can our Nation do to make certain we do not have to walk hand \nin hand with Saudi sheiks begging them for their oil for our economy? I \nhope the President will address that this evening.\n  Americans also want to hear President Bush explain how we are going \nto pay for the reconstruction of the gulf coast without shortchanging \nimportant national priorities and without burying our children and \ngrandchildren in debt.\n  In the 1990s, under President Clinton, we eliminated the Federal \ndeficit. The Government was running a surplus. And we were actually \npaying down the national debt so our kids' mortgage, our national \nmortgage would be lower.\n  In the last 4 years, under President Bush's watch, our national debt \nhas increased by $3 trillion. That is a 50-percent increase in the \ncumulative debt of America's entire history--50 percent under President \nBush.\n  The Federal Government has to borrow $2 billion every morning just to \nkeep operating. Some are predicting the cost of Hurricane Katrina could \npush the deficit up to $400 billion this year. We are looking at a \nflood of red ink this year and for years to come.\n  Yet, incredibly, there are those who think our top priority now \nshould be cutting taxes for wealthy Americans. Imagine, no President in \nour history ever, of any administration, has cut taxes in the midst of \na war.\n\n  This President continues to cut taxes as our deficits reach historic \nlevels. And now, with Hurricane Katrina, we still hear Republicans on \nthe other side of the aisle saying: Well, we have to give a tax break \nto the wealthiest Americans by eliminating the estate tax.\n  Accountability means responsibility. It means leadership. Tonight, \nwhen the President speaks to the Nation, he should announce he will \nrefuse to sign any bill eliminating the estate tax or any other tax cut \nthat provides a windfall for the very wealthiest among us, until we \nprovide it for the neediest among us, the victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n  Let me conclude by reminding my colleagues of a statement of Bill \nCohen. Bill is a former Republican Senator from Maine and former \nSecretary of Defense under President Clinton. Here is what he said. \nThis is ``the Cohen Rule'':\n\n       Government is the enemy--until you need a friend.\n\n  The other day I read a variation of this rule. It was said by Senator \nTrent Lott, who is viewed as a very conservative Republican in this \nChamber. Here is what Senator Trent Lott said:\n\n       You're a fiscal conservative--until you get hit with a \n     natural disaster.\n\n  In addition to houses and lives, one of the things swept away by \nHurricane Katrina for many Americans was the myth of this ``ownership \nsociety,'' which we have heard from the most conservative think tanks \nin Washington and from this administration. That is the point of view \nthat says that less Government is always better, and we are all better \noff when we watch out for ourselves and our own families only and don't \nworry about the other guy.\n  For many of the victims of Hurricane Katrina, the only thing less \nGovernment meant was less protection. What Americans need is not \nnecessarily less Government, but smarter Government. We need a \nGovernment that is strong enough to protect us overseas and protect us \nat home, a Government rooted in the most basic American moral values, a \ntradition that goes back to the earliest days of our Nation: banding \ntogether in times of need, to do for each other what none of us can do \nalone--using our common wealth for the common good.\n  Americans want a Government that says: We are all in this together, \nnot: We are all in this alone.\n  We have seen so much heroism from so many people during Hurricane \nKatrina. We have seen the overwhelming kindness of Americans toward the \nsurvivors, the overwhelming, spontaneous outpouring of contributions \nfrom people across America--from the major corporations with their \nmillions of dollars to the kids on the corner selling lemonade--all of \nthem trying to do their part to help their neighbors, the most \nvulnerable in America, the victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n  America is yearning for a leadership and a leader that will speak to \nthat spirit of unity and community. We will listen closely tonight for \nit.\n  The ``ownership society'' is not the right answer--it never was. Nor \nis using this national tragedy to try to divide Americans a good idea, \nwhen we yearn to be drawn together, not pulled apart.\n\n[[Page S10109]]\n\n  We understand there are some challenges so enormous that none of us \nacting alone can meet them. We believe in sharing our blessings and our \nburdens. We believe in shared sacrifice.\n  There was a story in the Washington Post last weekend, the headline \nwas ``The Nation's Castaways.'' It was a story about some of the people \nwho were left behind to fend for themselves in New Orleans when the \nfloods came.\n  The reporter described a man who felt so guilty about the pita bread, \nwater, and juice that he looted from a Wal-Mart to feed his family that \nhe kept a list, so he can pay it back later. ``I feel like an American \nagain,'' the man said on TV after help finally began to arrive. ``I \nthought my country had abandoned me.''\n  Government at all levels failed during Hurricane Katrina, and tens of \nthousands of Americans were left with that same terrible fear--that \ntheir country had abandoned them. But we know from experience that when \nAmericans pull together, we can overcome any obstacle. We have done it \nso many times in our history.\n  The urgent task facing the President tonight, and facing every leader \nin Government, facing every Senator, including this Senator, is to show \nthe American people, not just in words but with actions, that we will \nnot allow this tragedy to be repeated.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to join with the \ndistinguished assistant Democratic leader in his conscientious and \ncontinuing concern for the victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n  I have seen the Senator from Illinois on the floor day after day, \nraising these questions, addressing these concerns. I understand \ntomorrow the Senator is going to New Orleans to tour the area \npersonally, with Senate leadership, to see what needs to be done there \nto address the human suffering. I hear in his voice, and know from his \nlongstanding commitment to the people of Illinois, the depth of his own \nheartfelt concern for their problems and his passion for their \nsuffering and to do what we can, what we must, to address those \nproblems.\n  I look forward to hearing from the Senator next week, after his \nreturn from New Orleans and that area, as to what we can do more \neffectively--all of us as leaders in the Senate, all of us working \ntogether, all of us as Americans, not as Democrats or Republicans, not \nas partisans but as patriots--on behalf of all the people in need.\n  I share his concern. What prompted me to come to the floor is I heard \nthe Senator speaking about some of the difficulties in getting some of \nthe necessary information in order to perform our responsibilities as \nSenators. I share that frustration, or at least let me express my own \nfrustration because as a member of the Senate Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs which has, under the Senate's \norganizing resolution, the responsibility and the authority to oversee \nthe Department of Homeland Security as well as FEMA, the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, which is under that agency, I have been \nconfounded and enormously dismayed by the unwillingness of the Senate \nRepublican leadership to permit that committee to do what it is \nresponsible to do, which is to hold oversight hearings and to \nunderstand what is happening, what is not happening down in that flood-\nravaged part of the country, and also to find out what must be done not \nto look at just failures--also, you hear about successes--not to point \nfingers of blame, but to exercise our oversight responsibility, \nparticularly given that we have now, this body, at the President's \nrequest, appropriated almost $63 billion of taxpayers' money to address \nthese critical emergency needs.\n  I do not question the need to act quickly. And we have done so. But \nto deliver that much money--Federal taxpayers' dollars--to the \nresponsible agencies without any oversight, without any questions asked \nor answers provided about what is being done with that money, and \nparticularly to hear the Senator from Illinois describe published \nreports of sole-source contracting with organizations that have \npolitical connections with the President's former campaign manager, I \nfind it to be shocking and appalling we have not exercised that \nresponsibility.\n  I would ask the leader, and others responsible for these decisions, \nabout when we will be holding public hearings in that committee to \nauthorize our proceeding to do so with those who are directly \nresponsible for the recovery efforts.\n\n  None of us wants to disrupt the recovery efforts in the southern part \nof the country. Lord knows, they have been disrupted enough already by \nwhat has failed to be done there, without any involvement by any of us. \nBut I find it perplexing that Cabinet secretaries who have enough time \nto appear on Sunday talk shows and who are also clearly not in \nLouisiana or Mississippi day and night, 7 days and nights a week around \nthe clock, have, while they are here in Washington, not a single hour \navailable to appear before our committee in a public setting and answer \nthe questions I have, that I know other members of the committee have, \nand that the American people have. We deserve--most importantly, the \nAmerican people deserve--answers to these important questions.\n  Yesterday, we had, after now 2\\1/2\\ weeks since those levees failed \nin New Orleans, the very first public hearing of this committee. We had \na former Governor of California, a former mayor of Grand Forks, ND, a \ncouple of other wonderful former public servants who have expertise \nfrom their own past experiences, but not a single one of the people on \nthat panel had any responsibility for the public response to Hurricane \nKatrina. Similarly, not a single person with public responsibility for \nthat response was willing to appear on that committee.\n  It was 9 days ago that we had before a number of us Senators 10 \nCabinet secretaries, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the \nhead of the National Guard to brief us on the situation right here in \nthe Capitol, but they were not willing to appear in a public setting, \neven though there was not a single word spoken in that briefing that \ncould not and should not have been witnessed and heard by the American \npeople.\n  A week ago we had the Director of Operations for FEMA and the Deputy \nCommandant of the Coast Guard appear before the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Government Affairs, but they would not appear in a public \nsetting. The briefing was behind closed doors. The public and press \ncould not witness what they had to say. We have not yet, on this \ncommittee or any other committee that I am aware of--certainly none on \nwhich I serve, including Armed Services--had a single administration \nofficial willing to appear before us in a public setting and provide us \nwith the information we desire, to allow us to ask questions and to \nprovide answers in front of the committee and the American people. I \nfind that unacceptable.\n  Again, I urge the Republican leadership of the Senate to authorize \nthat committee to proceed as we are responsible to do, to join us and \nmembers of the committee, insist that the administration provide us \ntheir top officials. When they are not in New Orleans or Mississippi, \nwhen they are here in Washington, come up for an hour, an hour once, to \nbegin with. Keep each of those Cabinet secretaries who were present 9 \ndays ago, ask each one of them to come up and tell us in a public \nsetting what their agency is doing to respond, what do they need from \nus, whether it is funding, legislation, removal of regulations, \nrestrictions--tell us what you need from us in order to be more \nresponsive and more effective in the Federal response to the emergency \nthat persists. Come before us in a public setting, as public officials, \nas those who are responsible for the Federal response. Let us ask the \nquestions we must to fulfill our oversight responsibilities, and let's \nstart providing some public answers to the American people.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S10110]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10110-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

This special focus on the \nConstitution came about as a result of an initiative sponsored by our \nsenior colleague from West Virginia. The Consolidated Appropriations \nAct for Fiscal 2005 provides that each educational institution \nreceiving Federal funds during a fiscal year will conduct a program of \nits own devising on the Constitution. Also, each Federal department and \nagency, in connection with this special day, will make available \neducational materials on the Constitution for its employees.\n  Today, we have placed on the desk of each Senator two documents. The \nfirst is an annotated copy of the Constitution. The second contains the \nrecord of the 1787 constitutional convention as pertains to the powers \nand responsibilities of the United States Senate. In the spirit of this \nfirst Constitution Day, I hope all my colleagues will take the time to \nexamine both of these fundamental documents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10110-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the work and \nachievements of Hispanic Americans. Every year since 1968 Americans \nhave formally recognized the importance of Hispanic heritage and the \ncontributions of Latino members of society. Hispanic Heritage Month \nallows the Nation's 41 million Latinos, along with all Americans, to \ncelebrate Latino community and culture.\n  As the fastest growing population in America, Hispanics have the \npotential to significantly impact society through their hard work, \ncommitment to faith and closely-knit families. Aida Gianchello is one \nof the Latina Americans who are changing the world. Aida founded the \nMidwest Latino Health Research, Training and Policy Center at the \nUniversity of Chicago at Illinois. From this Center, Aida works within \nthe Latino community and with the public health network to address \nhealth problems that disproportionately affect Latinos, including life-\nthreatening diabetes, asthma and hypertension.\n  This morning, I had the pleasure of meeting three women from Illinois \nabout to graduate from the National Hispana Leadership Institute. \nJuanita Irizarry is the executive director of Latinos United, a housing \npolicy and advocacy organization in the Chicago area. Eva Serrano is \ndirector of community and school partnerships at Aurora University. \nElena Tijerina is a partner at Lucent Technologies. These are powerful \nwomen, already participating in civic, business and community affairs, \nmoving forward in leadership. We are lucky to have them in Illinois.\n  I also must mention my friend Al Galvan. Al is a veteran of World War \nII and the founder of the first Hispanic organization for Hispanic \nAmerican veterans. The Illinois Hispanic Chamber of Commerce recently \nbestowed its life-time achievement award on Al Galvan.\n  Despite the remarkable accomplishments of many Hispanic leaders, \nHispanic Americans still face daunting challenges, including the 14 \nmillion who do not have health coverage, as well as dangerously low \nlevels of income. But they are rising to face these challenges--the \nrate of minority enrollment in post-secondary institutions continues to \ngrow, as does the number of small businesses owned by Latinos. Leaders \nare recognizing the problems faced particularly by Latinos and are \noffering specific solutions. Aida Gianchello led the charge to serve \nstruggling neighborhoods in Chicago by setting up three diabetes-\nfocused self-care centers which each reach about a thousand residents a \nmonth, many undocumented and uninsured.\n  Individual efforts, like those of the Illinois leaders I have \nmentioned here today, make me proud to acknowledge the work and \nachievements of Latinos throughout Illinois and the country. It is only \nwith the continued dedication and appropriate appreciation of Hispanic \nHeritage that the Latino culture will grow and thrive in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10110-4", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation.

Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On July 1, 2005, a man was beaten outside his home in Destin, FL. \nAccording to police, the apparent motivation for the attack was that \nthe man was gay.\n  I would note that yesterday in the House, hate crimes legislation was \npassed in a bipartisan vote. I strongly believe that we must also move \nsimilar legislation in the Senate. In the months ahead I look forward \nto working with Senator Kennedy as we continue our work in passing a \nhate crimes bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10110-5", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10110-S10111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                           Arthur Ray Mcgill\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I rise with a heavy heart to honor \nthe life of SGT Arthur Ray McGill. It is the story of a carefree and \nloving young man from northwest Arkansas, who was devoted to his family \nand always put them above all else. It is also the story of a \ntrustworthy and brave soldier, who honorably served his Nation in \nuniform, and ultimately gave his life in the name of freedom.\n  Sergeant McGill spent most of his childhood in the small Arkansas \ntown of Decatur. Those who knew him best would describe him as a quiet \nand patient young man who was always considerate of others and treated \nthem with respect. He attended Decatur High School and although he left \nafter his 10th grade year, he went on to earn his general educational \ndevelopment diploma at the age of 17. Soon after, he joined the \nArkansas National Guard, where he would serve for 6 years prior to \nenlisting in the U.S. Army in November of 2002.\n  In his free time, ``Ray'' or ``Big Country,'' as he was known to \nfriends and family, had a love for archery and could often be found \nplaying video games or reading the comic books of his favorite \nsuperhero, Spiderman. But above all, his greatest love was his family, \nparticularly his 7-year old daughter Kaylee. Her welfare was her \nfather's greatest concern, and she knew that he could always be counted \non to protect and care for her as best he could.\n  Sergeant McGill reported for duty in January of 2003 and was deployed \nfor service in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was one of the soldiers in \nthe initial waves of American troops into Baghdad, and served in the \narea until that August. Sergeant McGill returned to Iraq in January of \n2005. In explaining his decision to reenlist for a second tour of duty \nto his loved ones, Sergeant McGill spoke of his feeling of being needed \nin Iraq, and that he was simply doing his part and was proud to do so. \nHe would also speak of his future after the Army, when he hoped to \nstudy criminal justice, buy a home, and become a member of the U.S. \nBorder Patrol in New Mexico.\n  Throughout his military service, Sergeant McGill's hard work and \ndependability quickly earned him the respect and loyalty of his fellow \nsoldiers. They even began calling him ``Tizzley,'' a combination of a \nteddy bear and a grizzly, which aptly described the 6'6'' soldier who \nhad a heart of gold. Though the comradeship with his fellow soldiers \ngrew, Sergeant McGill was still a\n\n[[Page S10111]]\n\nworld away from his family and they were never far from his mind. While \nin Iraq, he had a habit of sending gifts and money back home to provide \nfor them and spoke to them often by phone or through instant messenger \non his computer. To make him feel a little closer to home, he also \nbrought a CD-ROM to Iraq, which he spent a good deal of his free time \nenjoying; it contained over 500 issues of ``The Amazing Spiderman'' and \nwas never far from his side.\n  Tragically, Sergeant McGill was killed on July 19 when a roadside \nbomb exploded near his vehicle while he was patrolling through the \nstreets of Baghdad. Back in Arkansas, friends and family came to show \ntheir respects and bid farewell to their fallen soldier, as his flag-\ndraped coffin was buried at Fayetteville National Cemetery. Kaylee, who \nhad been the love of her father's life, was presented with an American \nflag and her father's dog tags, as well as the Bronze Star and Purple \nHeart he had earned through his courageous service to our Nation.\n  Although her father may no longer be with us, I am hopeful that these \nitems will forever remind her of the courageous and honorable way he \nlived his life. Words cannot adequately express the sorrow felt in the \nhearts of the family and loved ones of Arthur Ray McGill, but I pray \nthey can find solace knowing that his spirit will forever live on in \nthe examples he set and the many lives he touched.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10111-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HURRICANE KATRINA\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to address Hurricane Katrina---\nwhat we have been doing and what we should do next. Much has been said \non this floor about good, and bad, responses to Hurricane Katrina.\n  This morning I would like to reflect on the good responses. I would \nlike to mention a few stories of self-sacrifice and generosity made by \nsome people from my home State of New Mexico. A team from Sandia \nNational Laboratory's and Los Alamos National Laboratory's National \nInfrastructure Simulation Analysis Center is helping to determine the \nimpact of Hurricane Katrina on electric power infrastructure and oil \nand gas infrastructure. The Office of Naval Research deployed an \nExpeditionary Unit for Water Purification from Alamogordo to create \npotable water from brackish water in Mississippi. Evacuees have been \nwelcomed to our State. In one of the many shows of financial generosity \nby New Mexicans, the Sandia Pueblo has donated $1 million to the \nAmerican Red Cross. As another example, earlier this month two Dona Ana \nCounty Commissioners plan to donate their salaries for the rest of this \nyear, totaling almost $12,000, to Katrina victims.\n  Many law enforcement officers, firefighters, and other first \nresponders from across the country are aiding in recovery efforts. One \nsuch group is from Bernalillo County, NM. The Bernalillo County \nSheriff's Office and Fire Department sent 43 individuals to New \nOrleans, including 3 civilians and my good friend Darren White, who is \nthe Sheriff in Bernalillo County. The Bernalillo County team spent \nseveral days on airboats, searching for survivors. At one point, the \nSheriff was thrown from the boat into the toxic floodwaters covering \nNew Orleans. He was sent to a decontamination center, but the \nexperience did not deter him from his mission. Instead, he stayed in \nNew Orleans to continue helping with the team's rescue efforts, which \nsaved more than 200 people. Stories like this make me extremely proud \nof New Mexico's brave law officers.\n  The list does not end there. The New Mexico Disaster Medical \nAssistance Team provided medical care in Louisiana. Task Force New \nMexico, made up of 412 National Guardsmen, is helping a Louisiana \nparish get back on its feet. New Mexico Task Force One, an elite search \nand rescue team, assisted in recovery efforts. This team may sound \nfamiliar because New Mexico Task Force One was sent to the Pentagon \nfollowing the September 11 attacks to help with rescue and recovery \nefforts there.\n  Finally, I would like to quote a September 12, 2005 USA Today news \nclipping I found particularly striking. A ``disaster response director \nfor the San Juan County Red Cross watched as two young boys from \nFarmington emptied their piggy banks . . . the boys were determined to \nsend their money, $32 total, to victims of Hurricane Katrina.'' The \nparents of these two Farmington, New Mexico boys should be very, very \nproud of their sons. I certainly am.\n  This, of course, is not an exhaustive list of New Mexico's \ncontributions to Hurricane Katrina relief efforts, and I know that \nthese stories are not unique to my home State. Many people across the \ncountry have responded with similar acts of courage and kindness. I \nwould like to take this opportunity to say thank you to all of the \npeople from New Mexico and from across the country who are helping with \nKatrina relief and recovery efforts.\n  I would also like to mention a few of the many Federal actions taken \nin response to Hurricane Katrina. Mr. President, 50,000 people have \nbeen rescued, and 53 million liters of water and 22 million meals have \nbeen distributed. U.S. military personnel, Federal law enforcement \nofficers, and other Federal employees have gone to the gulf coast to \nhelp people like Sheriff White with rescue, recovery, and security \nefforts. Federal agencies have provided millions of dollars in grants \nfor emergency energy assistance, agricultural aid, Head Start programs, \nand job creation. The Federal Government has done much more, including \nappropriating more than $62 billion in emergency funding for the gulf \ncoast region.\n  It should be noted that these billions of dollars are being provided \nfor immediate needs; the monies do not include funds for any long term \nrehabilitation or reconstruction projects along the gulf coast. \nHowever, such sums will be needed soon, as we face the most difficult \nlong-term situation that America has ever confronted on her own soil. \nRehabilitating and reconstructing the Gulf Coast will take several \nyears and several billions of dollars. I believe the proper way to \norganize and coordinate these efforts is by creating an office that \nwill work with leadership in the affected area to coordinate Federal, \nState, and local actions and report on reconstruction efforts.\n  I am not asserting that control should be taken away from the States \nand cities that were directly impacted by Katrina. Nor am I advocating \nthat this person should play any role in reviewing the local, State and \nFederal responses to Katrina or in recommending any policy changes that \nmay need to be made because of those responses.\n  However, I do believe we need someone who can oversee the numerous \nFederal projects and Federal funds that will be associated with the \nrebuilding efforts.\n  Creating such an office is not without precedence. I was here in 1972 \nwhen the Mid-Atlantic States were flooded by rainfall from Tropical \nStorm Agnes. These floods caused the costliest natural disaster in U.S. \nhistory at the time. President Nixon had the foresight to appoint Frank \nCarlucci, his Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget, \nto serve as his ``personal representative'' to the disaster area \ncreated by Agnes. Mr. Carlucci coordinated the multistate, multi-agency \nrebuilding efforts associated with Tropical Storm Agnes.\n  I believe that a similar office is needed now to oversee the long-\nterm, multi-state rebuilding efforts associated with Katrina, and I \nhave urged President Bush to create such an office by Executive Order. \nWe are facing an important time in this country, and we must carefully \nchoose how to proceed. I am convinced that the creation of a central \noffice to coordinate the gulf coast rehabilitation is the proper way to \nmove forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10111-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10111-S10113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            BACK TO SCHOOL AND THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, students, teachers, and school personnel \nacross Wisconsin and around the country are settling in for a new \nschool year. Regrettably, thousands of students and teachers in the \nhurricane-ravaged gulf coast region have no schools to which they can \nreturn. According to the Louisiana Department of Education, schools in \nsix parishes have been destroyed or are too damaged to reopen, and more \nthan 240,000 students from that State alone have been displaced as a \nresult. The Federal Department of Education estimates\n\n[[Page S10112]]\n\nthat a total of more than 370,000 students across the region have been \ndisplaced, and many of them will have to spend the entire school year \nattending a different school.\n  I commend the school districts around the region and around the \ncounty, including in Wisconsin, that have opened their doors to \nstudents who have been displaced as a result of Hurricane Katrina and \nthe ongoing devastation left in her wake. While the start of the school \nyear usually means getting new school supplies, renewing friendships \nthat may have lapsed over the summer months, and embarking on new \ncourses of study, for the students displaced by Katrina, starting \nschool may be the first step in restoring a sense of routine and a \nsmall measure of normalcy. Many of these students are separated from \nfamily members and friends and from familiar teachers, counselors, \ncoaches, and other school personnel as they begin classes in another \ndistrict or in another State. We should make every effort to assist the \nschools that are welcoming them with open arms as they work to make \nthis transition as smooth as possible.\n  For these reasons, last week I sent a letter to the Secretary of \nEducation, which I am pleased was cosigned by the senior Senator from \nIllinois, Mr. Durbin, asking that the administration request dedicated \neducation funding for schools in the affected areas and for the States \nand school districts that are enrolling these displaced students. Our \nletter also requested that the Secretary use her statutory authority to \nwaive for 1 year the accountability provisions in the No Child Left \nBehind Act for the schools in the affected areas and for the school \ndistricts that are enrolling the displaced students.\n  Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath also remind us of the importance \nof the availability of school counselors, psychologists, and social \nworkers. These personnel work with teachers, administrators, and \nparents to ensure that students have the resources and tools they need \nto meet the challenges of the classroom and of everyday life. In times \nof great stress or disaster, such as a hurricane, these professionals \nare even more important as they help students cope with the tragedy \nthat they and their loved ones and friends--or family members or \nfriends who lived in the affected area--are experiencing.\n  This natural disaster underscores the need to provide adequate \nresources to ensure that schools have the ability to recruit and retain \nschool counselors, psychologists, and social workers in numbers that \nare appropriate to meet the needs of their students. I share the \nconcern expressed by so many around my State that tight budget \nconstraints and new Federal mandates are forcing school districts to \nmake the difficult decision to cut some of these important positions. \nAnd many of those districts that are able to maintain these positions \nare unable to hire enough counselors, psychologists, and social workers \nto meet the recommended student to professional ratios for those \npositions. I will talk more about the importance of providing promised \nFederal funding for education programs later in my statement, but I \njust wanted to touch on this issue here.\n  As we witness the concerted effort by so many local school districts \nand States to provide education for students displaced by Hurricane \nKatrina, we are reminded that throughout our Nation's history, the \neducation of our children has been viewed as a largely local and state \nresponsibility, and the Federal Government has wisely left decisions \naffecting our children's day-to-day classroom experiences up to the \nschools, districts, school boards, and State education agencies that \nbear the responsibility for--and most of the cost of--educating our \nchildren. Historically, when the Federal Government has stepped in, it \nhas been to ensure that children receive an equal opportunity for a \ngood education by protecting the rights of all children and by \nproviding additional resources for schools and for such related \nactivities as teacher training.\n  The Federal Government has a long history of supporting local and \nState governments in their effort to provide a high quality public \neducation for each child. And we have such an opportunity now to \nsupport local efforts by providing funding to the states and school \ndistricts that have been affected by Hurricane Katrina. I support such \nefforts, which rightly respect the importance of maintaining local \ncontrol of education. For that reason, I opposed the No Child Left \nBehind Act, NCLB, which the President touts as one of his top domestic \nachievements, going so far as to call it ``the most important Federal \neducation reform in history.'' I respectfully disagree with the \nPresident's assessment of this law, the effects of which are beginning \nto reverberate throughout Wisconsin and throughout the country.\n  As I travel around Wisconsin each year to host listening sessions in \neach of our 72 counties, I hear time and again from frustrated \nteachers, administrators, parents, and others about the negative effect \nthat NCLB is having on education in Wisconsin. And the people of \nWisconsin are not alone in their concern about the consequences of this \nlaw. A recent article in the St. Petersburg Times notes that ``[i]t's \nnot unusual for states to chafe at federal rules. But the state revolt \nagainst the federal law that filled America's classrooms with \nstandardized tests is unprecedented. Forty-seven states are \nquestioning, opposing, or rebelling against the most sweeping education \nreform in a generation.''\n\n  In Utah, for example, the State legislature passed and the Governor \nsigned into law a bill that clarifies that State education policy has \nprecedence over Federal education laws. Colorado is allowing individual \nschool districts to ``opt out'' of NCLB. And the State of Connecticut \nrecently filed a lawsuit in Federal court that argues that the law is \nillegal because it constitutes an unfunded Federal mandate on States \nand school districts. The National Education Association had previously \njoined with a number of local affiliates and school districts from \naround the country in filing a similar lawsuit.\n  It is important to note that the Department of Education has made \nsome effort to provide flexibility on some areas of this law in \nresponse to a flood of requests from States and school districts around \nthe country. But this flexibility has been narrow in scope and has \nlargely ignored the central concerns of States and school districts, \nincluding insufficient Federal resources to help schools comply with \nthe law and the likelihood that no State or district--now matter how \ngreat their efforts or their educational progress--will be able to keep \nup with the law's ambitious accountability provisions, including the \nwell-intentioned yet almost wholly unachievable requirement that all \nstudents be proficient in reading and math by the 2013-2014 school \nyear.\n  While I think we all agree that schools should be held accountable \nfor results, I and many Wisconsinites oppose the testing-centered \nmandates in the NCLB. I support some aspects of this law, such as \nincreased funding for title I and for afterschool programs. I opposed \nthis legislation, however, because it takes decisions regarding the \nfrequency of testing out of the hands of local school districts. As \neducators, students, and parents across the country know all too well, \nthis law mandates that students be tested in reading and math in grades \n3-8 beginning during this, the 2005-2006 school year. Further, the law \nmandates that students be tested in science at least once in grades 3-\n5, 6-9, and 10-12 beginning in the 2007-2008 school year.\n  This top-down, one-size-fits-all approach to testing is not good for \nWisconsin students or schools. Washington does not know best when it \ncomes to making decisions such as this, and states and school districts \nare rightly concerned about the effect that this additional layer of \ntesting will have on classroom education.\n  Connecticut, for example, has requested and has been repeatedly \ndenied permission from the Department of Education to continue to test \nits students every other year instead of every year as is mandated by \nNCLB.\n  And it is troubling that the results of these tests are central to \ndetermining whether a school, district, or State is considered to be \n``in need of improvement'' or ``failing'' academically. It is also \ntroubling that the corresponding Federal sanctions for schools deemed \nto be ``in need of improvement'' or ``failing'' will actually take \nbadly needed money from those very schools. And these sanctions are \nbeing imposed despite the fact that the Federal Government has not \nprovided the resources\n\n[[Page S10113]]\n\nto help these school succeed that were promised as part of NCLB. I am \ndeeply concerned that the President's budget requests for each of the \nfiscal years since NCLB was enacted have not provided the funding \nlevels promised by that law, and have, in fact, provided no funding for \na number of important programs included in that law.\n  I began to hear concerns from Wisconsinites more than 4 years ago \nwhen the President first proposed his education initiative, and these \nconcerns have only increased as my constituents continue to learn first \nhand what this law means for them and for their students and children. \nWhile Wisconsinites support holding schools accountable for results, \nthey are rightly troubled by the focus on testing that is the \ncenterpiece of the President's approach.\n  In response to these concerns, in past years I introduced with \nSenator Jeffords and others the Student Testing Flexibility Act, which \nwould have allowed States and school districts that are meeting their \nadequate yearly progress, AYP, goals to waive the additional layer of \ntesting required by NCLB, thus allowing them to maintain their existing \ntesting programs. In addition, this bill would have allowed States to \nkeep the federal money allocated for developing and administering these \nnew tests and to use that money to help those schools and districts \nthat are not meeting their AYP goals. While we have not reintroduced \nthe bill this year, we remain committed to restoring to States and \nlocal school districts the decisions over the frequency and magnitude \nof testing.\n  In addition, earlier this year I sent with some of my colleagues a \nletter to the chairman and ranking member of the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee requesting that the committee have a \nseries of hearings on how the ongoing implementation of the NCLB is \naffecting schools and districts. We asked that these hearings focus on \nissues that are being raised by our constituents, including: the unique \ncircumstances of rural and smaller school districts; the long-term \neffects that meeting the one-size-fits-all AYP provisions will have on \nstudents, schools, and school districts; the concern and likelihood \nthat nearly all public schools may not be able to meet the goal of 100-\npercent proficient scores on reading and math tests by the 2013-2014 \nschool year, even if those schools show a steady increase in student \nachievement each year; the NCLB sanctions structure; the effect that \nFederal funding that is well below the agreed-upon authorization levels \nfor crucial programs such as title I and special education is having on \nschools' ability to meet NCLB and State standards; the need for \nadditional Federal funding for professional development, recruitment \nand retention, and for additional training for paraprofessionals, so \nthat States and school districts can comply with requirements for \nhaving highly qualified teachers and paraprofessionals; the toll that \npreparation for the new federally mandated tests is having on, and will \nhave on, the ability of teachers to spend time on innovative and \nexciting approaches to instruction and assessment, the instruction time \navailable for nontested subjects, such as social studies, art, music, \nand physical education, the strength of State academic standards, and \nthe morale of students and educators; the ongoing efforts to align the \nNCLB and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act; the unique \nchallenges that the accountability provisions pose for students with \nlimited English proficiency; and the implementation of the supplemental \nservices provisions, including implications for Federal civil rights \nlaw.\n\n  It is critically important that we understand the practical effect of \nNCLB on the everyday classroom experiences of students and teachers. I \nhave heard from many educators who are already seeing a narrowing of \ncurricula and increased teaching to the test in preparation for the \nfederally mandated tests in reading and math. One of the purposes of \npublic education is to ensure that students have a well-rounded \ncurriculum that gives them the skills that they need to succeed in \nlife. I remain concerned that the approach encapsulated in NCLB will \nproduce a generation of students who know how to take tests, but who \ndon't have the skills necessary to become successful adults. Test-\ntaking has a place in public education, but it should not be the role \nof the Federal Government to tell schools how and when to require \ntests.\n  I am particularly disturbed that this appears to be only the tip of \nthe testing iceberg. In his fiscal year 2006 budget request, the \nPresident proposed expanding this testing program to additional high \nschool grades. We should not expand the NCLB testing mandates through \nthe budget and appropriations process, and I am pleased that neither \nthe House-passed nor the Senate reported Labor-Health and Human \nServices-Education appropriations bill includes this funding.\n  Students, teachers, and schools are more than a test score, and \neducation should be a well-rounded experience that is not narrowly \nfocused on ensuring that students pass a test to help their schools \navoid being sanctioned by the Federal Government. Standardized tests \nmeasure performance on a particular day under particular circumstances. \nThese tests do not make allowances for outside factors such as test \nanxiety, illness, worry about a troubled home situation, or even the \nfact that the child taking the test may not have eaten that day. To \nmeasure the performance of a school and its teachers and students on \ntwo test scores per grade does a disservice to these same students, \nteachers, and schools. And to compare the test scores of this year's \nthird graders to those of next year's third graders does not provide an \naccurate picture of educational progress.\n  I will continue to monitor the effect of the No Child Left Behind Act \non Wisconsin students, and I hope that the debate on this law, both in \nmy State and nationally, will result in meaningful changes to this \ndeeply flawed law that will ensure that each child is given the \nopportunity to succeed and that each school has the resources necessary \nto give these students that opportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10113-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10113-S10114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PROTECTING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, here in the United States we cherish and \nprotect religious freedom. Citizens of this great Nation exercise this \nfreedom in many places--in their homes, in their workplaces and many \nmore. But no place is more commonly the location of reflection and \nprayer than the house of worship--be it the church or synagogue, mosque \nor temple. The houses of God are infused with sanctity--not because of \ntheir architecture or their art or even holy books housed in them--they \nare sacred because it is where we men and women go to connect to \nsomething larger than themselves. We go there to seek comfort and \npeace. This is, of course, not only true of houses of worship in this \ncountry, but throughout the world. It is thus with a heavy heart that I \ncome to the floor today to describe and to deplore the desecration of \nsynagogues that was perpetrated earlier this week in Gaza.\n  After painful deliberations in Israel's Cabinet, the government of \nIsrael decided to leave standing nineteen synagogues in its twenty-one \ncommunities throughout the Gaza Strip rather than lending a hand to \ntheir destruction. Despite official Israeli requests to protect the \nsanctity and security of the holy sites after it courageously withdrew \nfrom Gaza, the Palestinian Authority rejected out of hand any \nresponsibility and refused to protect the structures from arsonists and \nlooters. In fact, a Palestinian police officer, tasked with keeping the \npeace, shirked his responsibility and allowed the mobs to torch the \nsynagogues, claiming, ``The people have a right to do what they're \ndoing.''\n  Those acts should offend all people of good conscience. We know too \nwell that where houses of God are desecrated, threats to man's liberty \nand life are soon found. As a nation founded by those seeking freedom \nfrom religious persecution, we know that governments must actively \nprotect their citizens' religious freedom. And they have a sacred \nobligation to protect buildings not because they are made of stone, \nglass and wood but out of respect for the worship of God that occurs \ninside them.\n  Houses of worship, central fixtures in any community, are places \nwhere people gather to serve and worship God, seek his counsel, and \nshare common religious experiences. As an American\n\n[[Page S10114]]\n\nwho strongly values religious freedom, I am appalled by the actions of \nPalestinians who desecrated holy sites and I deplore the total \nabdication of leadership demonstrated by the Palestinian Authority.\n  [On this day in 1963,] a bomb exploded at the Sixteenth Street \nBaptist Church in Birmingham, AL. And it took until 2001, almost 40 \nyears later, but, we prosecuted and convicted a man responsible. \nIt pains me as I think of such horrific acts occurring and I am proud \nthat in America we not only have the right to worship freely but where \nwe fully prosecute perpetrators of such crimes to the fullest extent.\n\n  The lawlessness in the streets of Gaza, the lack of human rights, and \nthe disrespect shown to holy sites by the Palestinian Authority is in \nmarked, stark contrast to the way Israel has treated mosques and \nChristian holy sites. Following the torching of synagogues in Gaza, \nIsrael increased security at Arab mosques. We need no further proof of \nthe difference between lawful, civilized nations and those that have no \nplace in the family of nations. A government that fails to honor \nreligious sites and, worse, lacks the ability to restrain its citizens \nfrom committing such heinous acts demonstrates it is not yet a partner \nto peace and not yet interested in normal relations with our great \nfriend, the State of Israel.\n  Rabbi Tzvi Hersh Weinreb, Executive Vice President of the Union of \nOrthodox Jewish Congregations of America said, ``The destruction of a \nsynagogue is akin to a knife being thrust into our very being. When \nsynagogues are destroyed, with either the connivance or lack of action \nof a governing authority, we can only ask, what kind of government is \nthis?''\n  All Americans of good will, of all faiths, ethnicities and \nnationalities feel such pain. I commend and join President Bush who \nyesterday condemned the desecration of the synagogues in Gaza and hope \nthat all Members of this great body do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10114-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10114-S10115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NOMINATIONS OF STEWART A. BAKER AND JULIE L. MYERS\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, regrettably, I was detained at a Veterans' \nAffairs Committee business meeting which precluded my presence at an \nimportant nomination hearing before the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee on two critical nominations for key \npositions within the Department of Homeland Security. The Senate has \nthe responsibility to ensure that the best qualified and most able \npeople serve our country. I ask unanimous consent that my statement for \nthat hearing be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Thank you Chairman Collins. I wish to add my welcome to Mr. \n     Baker, Ms. Myers, and their families and friends.\n       You are both here because you wish to continue your careers \n     in public service by serving as Assistant Secretaries in the \n     Department of Homeland Security (DHS). These positions demand \n     individuals who have demonstrated extensive executive level \n     leadership and the ability to manage a sizable budget and \n     diverse workforce. Mr. Baker, if confirmed, you will be the \n     first DHS Assistant Secretary for Policy, and you will help \n     define the role of the Office of Policy.\n       Ms. Myers, you have been nominated to lead Immigration and \n     Customs Enforcement, an agency that is currently facing \n     significant financial and human resource management \n     challenges.\n       While every nomination considered by the Senate is \n     important, I believe that today's hearing will be watched \n     carefully by the American people, who are looking to this \n     Committee to make sure we ask the appropriate, and sometimes \n     tough, questions. The people of Hawaii, like all Americans, \n     want to make sure that those leading DHS have the necessary \n     experience and qualifications.\n       The creation of DHS in 2003 was the largest reorganization \n     of the federal government since the Department of Defense was \n     established in 1947. The merging of 22 legacy agencies into a \n     single agency has created management challenges that DHS will \n     face for years to come. Because of these significant \n     challenges, DHS needs strong leaders. A qualified candidate \n     must possess extensive experience managing people and budgets \n     in addition to having experience in immigration or law \n     enforcement or intelligence.\n       I am especially concerned about the current state of ICE, \n     which is the second largest federal law enforcement agency \n     with a $4 billion budget and over 15,000 employees in over \n     400 offices around the world.\n       ICE has extraordinary reach, extraordinary responsibilities \n     for our national security, and extraordinary problems.\n       Financial difficulties have resulted in hiring freezes and \n     reductions in training, bonuses, and travel. ICE's financial \n     crisis has resulted in DHS reprogramming $500 million in FY \n     04 and FY 05 funds and requesting an additional $267 million \n     in the April 2005 emergency supplemental. Despite assurances \n     that ICE's financial problems have been resolved, DHS \n     Inspector General Richard Skinner testified in July 2005 that \n     ICE cannot properly account for millions of dollars every \n     month due to its deficient financial management system. This \n     financial crisis has had an adverse impact on the readiness \n     and morale of the ICE workforce.\n       ICE needs strong, experienced leadership to repair these \n     management problems.\n       Mr. Baker, the Administration has submitted legislation to \n     the Congress that this Committee is now considering which \n     would create the position of an Undersecretary for Policy. \n     According to Secretary Chertoff's transmittal letter to the \n     Congress on his proposal, dated July 13, 2005, the new Office \n     of Policy ``will lead a unified, mission-focused policy \n     approach'' and will include a number of existing units, such \n     as the Office of International Affairs, the Special Assistant \n     to the Secretary for Private Sector Coordination, the Border \n     and Transportation Security Policy and Planning Office, \n     elements of the Border and Transportation Security Office of \n     International Enforcement, the Homeland Security Advisory \n     Committee, and the Office of Immigration Statistics. In \n     addition, the Secretary is proposing to add a strategic \n     policy planning office and a refugee policy coordinator.\n       This is an enormous range of new responsibilities and will \n     require someone with extensive management experience and \n     vision.\n       I would argue that the key focus of this office should be \n     on strategic planning. Given the nature of the Department's \n     enormous size and breadth of responsibilities, someone is \n     needed who can provide focus and direction to the mission of \n     preventing and responding to terrorist attacks and natural \n     disasters.\n       Mr. Baker, you are being nominated for the position of \n     Assistant Secretary with the expectation of moving into the \n     Undersecretary position should the Congress pass the reform \n     proposal. One of the issues this Committee will have to \n     address is whether you will need to be reconfirmed at a later \n     date for that higher position should you be confirmed for the \n     Assistant Secretary position.\n       One of the lessons learned from the Hurricane Katrina \n     response is that the senior officials of an agency should \n     have demonstrated leadership skills. The positions of \n     Assistant Secretary for ICE and Assistant Secretary for \n     Policy are no exception.\n       I would like to draw the attention of my colleagues to one \n     measure of leadership skills: the standards the Office of \n     Personnel Management has developed for the government's \n     career Senior Executive Service (SES).\n       To qualify for an SES position, a candidate must possess \n     the following five executive qualifications: leading change; \n     leading people; being results driven; having business acumen; \n     and building coalitions/communications.\n       SES candidates demonstrate these qualifications through \n     experience in key executive skills such as leading others to \n     rapidly adjust organizational behavior and work methods; \n     supervising and managing a diverse workforce; developing \n     strategic human capital management plans; establishing \n     performance standards and plans; managing the budgetary \n     process; overseeing the allocation of financial resources; \n     and developing and maintaining positive working relationships \n     with internal groups and external groups such as Congress, \n     the Office of Management and Budget, and the White House.\n       These qualifications and experiences help ensure that the \n     federal government's senior executives have the ability to \n     establish a clear vision for the organization and to drive \n     others to succeed. While political appointees are not \n     required to meet these qualifications, I believe it would be \n     difficult for an agency head to be successful without them.\n       I look forward to this opportunity to hear from Mr. Baker \n     and Ms. Myers. Thank you Madam Chairman.\n\n[[Page S10115]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10114-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10114-S10115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NOMINATIONS OF STEWART A.

One of the issues this Committee will have to \n     address is whether you will need to be reconfirmed at a later \n     date for that higher position should you be confirmed for the \n     Assistant Secretary position.\n       One of the lessons learned from the Hurricane Katrina \n     response is that the senior officials of an agency should \n     have demonstrated leadership skills. The positions of \n     Assistant Secretary for ICE and Assistant Secretary for \n     Policy are no exception.\n       I would like to draw the attention of my colleagues to one \n     measure of leadership skills: the standards the Office of \n     Personnel Management has developed for the government's \n     career Senior Executive Service (SES).\n       To qualify for an SES position, a candidate must possess \n     the following five executive qualifications: leading change; \n     leading people; being results driven; having business acumen; \n     and building coalitions/communications.\n       SES candidates demonstrate these qualifications through \n     experience in key executive skills such as leading others to \n     rapidly adjust organizational behavior and work methods; \n     supervising and managing a diverse workforce; developing \n     strategic human capital management plans; establishing \n     performance standards and plans; managing the budgetary \n     process; overseeing the allocation of financial resources; \n     and developing and maintaining positive working relationships \n     with internal groups and external groups such as Congress, \n     the Office of Management and Budget, and the White House.\n       These qualifications and experiences help ensure that the \n     federal government's senior executives have the ability to \n     establish a clear vision for the organization and to drive \n     others to succeed. While political appointees are not \n     required to meet these qualifications, I believe it would be \n     difficult for an agency head to be successful without them.\n       I look forward to this opportunity to hear from Mr. Baker \n     and Ms. Myers. Thank you Madam Chairman.\n\n[[Page S10115]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10115-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO GENERAL RICHARD B. MYERS\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and pay tribute \nto General Richard B. Myers, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for \nhis lifetime of service and unfaltering dedication to the United States \nArmed Forces and our country.\n  As both a soldier and a leader, spanning 40 years of military \nservice, General Myers contributions to our peace and security, and \nthat of our children and grandchildren, are a remarkable hallmark in \nmilitary history. During trying times, under sometimes harsh scrutiny, \nand with high national security stakes at hand, General Myers has \nrepeatedly shown his Kansas common sense, leading our military through \ntwo wars and a host of other challenges with a steady hand.\n  Dick Myers was well prepared for leadership. Born in Kansas City, MO, \nin 1942, General Myers graduated from Shawnee Mission North High School \nand attended Kansas State University, where he enrolled in the Air \nForce ROTC and was commissioned second lieutenant in 1965. After his \ncommissioning, General Myers entered pilot training at Vance Air Force \nBase, Oklahoma. As a command pilot, he logged over 4,000 flying hours, \nincluding 600 combat hours over Vietnam and Laos. Serving in a wide \nvariety of assignments over the next several decades, General Myers \nassumed the duties of Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in \nMarch 2000.\n  On October 1, 2001, just weeks after the September 11 terrorist \nattacks, General Myers was named the 15th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff. As the first Vice Chairman to ascend to the office, General \nMyers served as the principal military advisor to the President, the \nSecretary of Defense, and the National Security Council, and played a \ncritical role in the planning and execution of the Global War on \nTerrorism, including the important Operations Noble Eagle, Enduring \nFreedom, and Iraqi Freedom.\n  During General Myers tenure as the chairman, he was constantly faced \nwith unique challenges and responsibilities with both frustrating and \nemotional circumstances, from the worst terrorist attacks on the United \nStates in our proud history to fighting overseas wars against \nterrorists and the enemies of freedom and democracy. Yet, despite all \nof the challenges, General Myers maintained a positive, forward looking \ndetermination and attitude, and never faltered in his responsibility to \nour men and women serving in the armed forces today.\n  General Myers' tenure and accomplishments were not limited to the \nGlobal War on Terrorism, including operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nUnder General Myers' leadership, the Joint Staff produced a far-\nreaching National Military Strategy, complemented by a National \nMilitary Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism, to guide the Armed \nForces for the challenges of the 21st Century. This strategy serves as \na template for the Global War on Terrorism, and was and will be truly \ninstrumental in bringing freedom to the people of Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  General Myers also oversaw the establishment of the United States \nNorthern Command, or NORTHCOM, the first combatant command responsible \nfor the homeland defense of the continental United States. As part of \nthis effort, the chairman advocated joint war fighting among the \nservices and called on the entire U.S. Government to expand the culture \nof jointness in the interagency and international communities. General \nMyers has truly shown great leadership in his efforts to transform and \nmodernize the military.\n  General Myers should also be recognized for his humanitarian role--a \nmission many times missing from the headlines. In late 2004, in \nresponse to the horrific events surrounding the Indian Ocean Tsunami, \nGeneral Myers oversaw ``Operation Unified Assistance'', the largest \ncoordinated and executed military humanitarian relief effort since the \nBerlin Air Lift. Designed to enable more than 15,000 Department of \nDefense personnel, 130 aircraft, and 20 United States Navy warships to \ndistribute more than 400,000 gallons of water, 2,000 tons of food, and \nalmost 3,000 tons of other supplies to those in need, the mission was a \nsuccess.\n  General Myers' impeccable service and brave leadership are also \nreflected in the awards and decorations he has received throughout his \ncareer. General Myers is the recipient of the Defense Distinguished \nService Medal with two oak leaf clusters, Distinguished Service Medal, \nLegion of Merit, Distinguish Flying Cross with oak leaf cluster, \nMeritorious Service Medal with three oak leaf clusters, Air Medal with \neighteen oak leaf clusters, Air Force Commendation Medal, Joint \nMeritorious Unit Award with four oak leaf clusters, and Air Force \nOutstanding Unit Award with ``V'' device with three oak leaf clusters.\n  Mr. President, today I have mentioned but a few of General Richard \nMyers' numerous accomplishments. I not only consider General Myers a \nstrong military leader, in times of both war and peace, and a \ncritically important person in the defense of our great Nation, I am \nprivileged to call him a friend and a colleague. I have often said that \nif I were in a gunfight on Front Street in Dodge City, KS, during our \nStates' pioneer days, there is no person I would rather have by my side \nthan Richard Myers. I know that a grateful Nation shares my \nappreciation for the general--a courageous and honorable man and a \nstrong and steadfast military leader during a truly trying time, and I \nknow my colleagues join me in paying tribute to him and his wife Mary \nJo for the years they have dedicated to our country and to the \nbetterment of the United States Armed Forces. General Myers, we wish \nyou well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10115-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                TRIBUTE TO CPT WILLIAM ``BILL'' MARCLEY\n\n Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate CPT \nWilliam F. ``Bill'' Marcley for his 38 years of service and commitment \nto saving lives and advancing emergency medical services.\n  Bill began this selfless work in 1967 after he and his wife were \ninvolved in a serious car accident, by turning the experience into an \nopportunity to serve as a volunteer on the Inter-City First Aid Squad \nin Lake Park, FL. After helping establish paramedic systems in four \ncounties in Florida, Bill and his family moved to South Carolina in \n1977, where he would serve three counties over the next 28 years in \nmany capacities, inc1uding director of Fairfield County EMS and EMS \nOperations Manage in my home county of Greenville.\n  In addition to his full-time positions, Bill has found time to serve \nhis community as United Way Coordinator for the Department of Public \nSafety, chairman of ``Operation Heartbeat'' for the American Heart \nAssociation, EMT instructor at Greenville Technological College, and he \nannually conducts over 100 special programs promoting public safety and \nemergency medical service education.\n  On behalf of myself and the State of South Carolina. I thank and \ncommend Captain Marcley for the many contributions he has made in the \nlives of countless South Carolinians. Although he officially began his \nretirement on September 9, 2005, I know that his service to South \nCarolina is far from over, and I wish him and his wife, Arlene, many \nmore happy and productive years together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10115-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10115-S10116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO PAT BOONE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to acting and \nmusic legend Pat Boone.\n  While most of us remember him as one of the greatest singers of the \n1950's, he is also known for his abiding Christian faith and strong \nmoral standards which have sustained him throughout his life even \nduring the height of his career in the entertainment industry.\n  Today, Mr. Boone is the spokesman for the 60 Plus Association, a \nnonpartisan senior citizens advocacy group.\n  He recently was interviewed by John Gizzi with Human Events. I ask to \nhave printed in the Record an article titled ``Pat Boone on Politics, \nPorn, and the Death Tax''.\n  The article follows.\n\n               [From Human Events Online, Aug. 19, 2005]\n\n             Pat Boone on Politics, Porn and the Death Tax\n\n                            (By John Gizzi)\n\n       Pat Boone, 71, is one of America's most beloved \n     entertainers. In the 1950s, he was the nation's second most \n     popular singer after\n\n[[Page S10116]]\n\n     Elvis Presley. His hits, ``April Love'' and ``Love Letters in \n     the Sand,'' were No. 1 for six and seven weeks respectively. \n     He starred in 15 movies, including Journey to the Center of \n     the Earth and State Fair. Long an active conservative \n     Republican, Boone is currently spokesman for the 60 Plus \n     Association. Last week, Boone spoke with Human Events \n     Political Editor John Gizzi.\n       You have always been known in Hollywood as a conservative \n     and a Christian. In 1961, in fact, you, Ronald Reagan, Roy \n     Rogers and John Wayne addressed Dr. Fred Schwartz's all-\n     Southern California anti-Communist rally. Has it become more \n     difficult for someone [in Hollywood] to be a conservative and \n     a Christian today?\n       Pat Boone: I was not involved politically at that time. \n     Then, I felt so strongly about anti-communism and I did read \n     Fred Schwartz's book and then came his crusade at the sports \n     arena. What Schwartz said in his book [You Can Trust the \n     Communists--To Be Communists] made perfect sense to me. The \n     phrase, ``Better Red Than Dead,'' was sweeping college \n     campuses at the time.\n       When my time came to say a few words, I quoted that \n     sentiment. I said I've got four little girls and if it ever \n     came to that, although I pray it never will, I would rather \n     see my four daughters blown to heaven in an atomic blast than \n     caught in the hell of a Communist United States.\n       It impressed Reagan and he quoted that a number of times, \n     beginning by saying, ``I once heard a young father say.'' \n     That's what occurred that night.\n       My activism and my being very outspoken never abated after \n     that and it has cost me as an entertainer. There is a \n     visceral antipathy that producers, hirers and firers have. I \n     feel myself in the other direction. I have feelings I have to \n     control of anger and total disregard for certain actors and \n     outspoken people in our business that I think are ruining \n     American culture.\n       Do you care to name any names?\n       Boone: When Norman Lear started People For the American \n     Way, he asked to meet with me. He wanted me to be the voice \n     of People For the American Way--its spokesman. He knew I had \n     considerable influence and a high-profile among Christians \n     and Middle America.\n       I said to him: ``Look, I understand why you have these \n     feelings. You want to promote your point of view. But your \n     main concern is with the Christian right, isn't it?'' He \n     said, ``That's right.'' I said, ``I know you've been openly \n     critical of [Rev.] Jerry Falwell. I know Jerry, although I'm \n     not a member of the Moral Majority. He feels that what you're \n     doing and saying and promoting is at least as harmful for \n     America as you feel his point of view is. So why don't we get \n     you two guys together? I have a feeling that so many of your \n     concerns are similar. Since I know him, I think he'd be \n     willing to meet with you.''\n       Lear said, ``No, I wouldn't meet with him.'' When I asked \n     him why, he said, ``He'll just quote Scripture and I don't \n     know anything about that. I'm not going to meet with him.'' \n     When he left, he knew I wasn't going to be his spokesman.\n       I'm on the unpopular side in the entertainment community. A \n     number of entertainers, Jonathan Winters for one, say to me, \n     ``Boone, I believe everything I ever hear you say. But I \n     don't dare say it.'' Now, here's a comedian who'll say \n     anything if it's funny, but when it comes to politics or \n     spiritual things, he knows that he's written off if he were \n     to express himself as emphatically as he would really like \n     to.\n       Why have you signed on with the 60 Plus Association, and \n     why do you believe its premier cause, abolishing the estate \n     tax, is so critical?\n       Boone: [60 Plus President] Jim Martin, a former Marine and \n     longtime friend of the President, contacted me and asked me \n     if I wanted to join him and his organization. I had been \n     asked to be a spokesman for a number of seniors' groups, but \n     I put it off because I wasn't ready or willing to be \n     considered a senior. Several years ago, in a 10K race here in \n     Los Angeles, I chose a very public moment in front of the \n     network affiliate cameras to come out of the closet and admit \n     I am a senior. Since then, I haven't been reluctant to let \n     people know that, yes, I am a senior and I do feel very \n     concerned about Social Security and the economy and medical \n     costs.\n       I have considered for many years that this estate tax is \n     absolute robbery. You already pay taxes, you save money, \n     you've been a good citizen and a responsible person, you save \n     up something, maybe it compounds, but you've already paid tax \n     on it. Now, when you have the poor judgment to die, the \n     government steps in and says, ``Thank you for doing that all \n     these years. We'll take half of that.'' And maybe your folks \n     have to sell the business and the house.\n       When Bing Crosby's [first] wife Dixie died [in 1952], going \n     back that far, he had to sell assets to pay the estate tax. \n     On top of losing his wife, he was losing assets on which he \n     already paid taxes. I read this was the case and asked him, \n     and he said, ``Oh yes. You can't get away from the long arm \n     of the IRS.''\n       Some say that hip-hop, acid rock and similar modern music \n     is destructive. Do you agree that a lot of it is harmful?\n       Boone: Oh, yes, I've been very vocal about that, too. The \n     culture is being dragged into the gutter, and the ones doing \n     it are not just the performers, but the record company \n     executives. It's calculated on their part because they \n     realize there's some fascination, as we used to be fascinated \n     with Jimmy Cagney in the gangster movies. But in the movies, \n     the criminals always got caught and punished.\n       The executives found some years ago that this ``gangsta \n     rap'' music was being bought and played by kids out in the \n     suburbs. These are the well-to-do kids, not the black kids in \n     the ghetto areas. They were not the ones subscribing to it \n     and making this music so successful. It was the kids driving \n     BMWs that their dads gave them that were playing it very loud \n     and rattling windows of the houses they were going by. \n     They've made a multi, multi-million dollar business out of \n     it.\n       What's the answer to this? Are you talking about \n     censorship?\n       Boone: I had a real head-to-head with Robert Blake one \n     night on the Merv Griffin Show about censorship. I said that \n     no society can survive without some form of censorship. He \n     said, ``You're crazy. We don't have censorship. That's bad.'' \n     I replied, ``Wait a minute. The traffic light at the corner \n     is a form of censorship. It says you stop so that someone \n     else can go. And then you have your turn to go.'' We have \n     laws on the books that prevent you from standing up in a \n     theater and yelling, ``Fire,'' or from walking down the \n     street and opening your trench coat and exposing yourself. \n     There are laws that tell you that you can't do certain things \n     and that's what a society does to protect itself.\n       I believe we need censorship. I don't think the arts we \n     call the arts--literature, movies and certainly not the \n     airwaves--should be exempt from the rules society makes to \n     protect itself. It's the sensibilities of kids and the \n     females we used to call ladies we're talking about. Thanks to \n     ``Sex and the City'' and this other stuff, they can be just \n     as profane and filthy as men.\n       I've watched segments of ``The Sopranos,'' and I just get \n     so sick of the glamour. Talk about Cagney and Bogart. We're \n     making national heroes out of gang bosses.\n       I do advocate censorship for a healthy society with three \n     provisos: that it be majority-approved, self-imposed and \n     voluntary. The ``voluntary'' and ``self-imposed'' may sound \n     like the same thing. The society agrees that we need to \n     protect ourselves, and there are certain bounds beyond which \n     we don't want the public to be exposed to filth. But we will \n     make the rules in a voluntary, majority-approved way. And \n     they can be changed by majority opinion.\n       I have felt that a healthy society should draw some lines \n     in the dirt and say, ``You cannot cross over this line. You \n     cannot say certain words on public television and cable or \n     anything that's going to reach sensibilities. We are going to \n     do something to defend our kids and our ladies and our \n     families.'' But it's something you just can't even talk about \n     in the entertainment industry. But I say, how are we going to \n     protect ourselves if we don't demand responsibility?\n       One final point--friends in California say that you were \n     urged to run for Congress as a Republican in 1968. Why didn't \n     you do it?\n       Boone: That was back when I had all of my kids at home. I \n     just knew that it would be totally time-consuming and if I \n     were elected, I'd have to do the job. I thought I could get \n     elected. But I also knew if I was elected, I would do my best \n     to be a good congressman. However, it would be very \n     disruptive of my family life because I would spend a lot of \n     time away from family. And also, I could never go back to \n     being an entertainer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10116-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10116-S10117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING SAN BERNARDINO'S TEAM INLAND\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

This year, the members of Team Inland placed \nthird in the Nike National Youth Basketball Tournament, became the \nAmateur Athletic Union, AAU, West Coast National Champions, and won the \nAAU Southern Pacific Division 1 Regional Tournament.\n  Team Inland is a nonprofit organization based in the city of San \nBernardino. It is comprised of 11-year-olds, who commit their time to \nprepare for numerous weekend basketball tournaments throughout the \nyear. In 2005, they won 77 percent of their games, earning impressive \nplacements in many tournaments.\n  Making Team Inland's achievement even more meaningful is the fact \nthat team members excelled academically while striving to meet their \nathletic goals, each maintaining a minimum 3.0 grade point average. It \nis clear that these young people have set high standards for themselves \nand put forth tremendous effort to meet them.\n  The members of 2005 Team Inland are: Marquise Drumwright, Ejiro \nEderaine, Tyler Ervin, Quinton Lilley, Jordan Mathis, Myles Pearson, \nIsaiah Pooler, Kameron Presley, Chandler Scott, Justin Snavely, \nDominique Walker, and Arther Ley Williams.\n  The Team Inland players have demonstrated their immense potential to \nachieve. I hope you are heartened, as I am, to learn of young people \nstriving for personal excellence. I extend my sincere congratulations \nto Team Inland\n\n[[Page S10117]]\n\nand thank them for their great team spirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10117-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HONORING WESTERN KENTUCKY NATIONAL MERIT SEMIFINALISTS\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I rise to note the retirement of a \nColorado leader: Ken Bueche, executive director of the Colorado \nMunicipal League. On September 30, Ken Bueche is retiring as executive \ndirector of the Colorado Municipal League, a statewide association of \n265 member cities and towns.\n  Ken Bueche earned his undergraduate degree from Colorado State \nUniversity and his J.D. and Masters in Public Administration from the \nUniversity of Colorado. In 1963, Ken came to CML as a law clerk and by \n1974 rose to become the league's executive director, a position he has \nheld now for more than 30 years.\n  He has been a long-time believer that local governments are closest \nto the people and often produce the best solutions for local \nchallenges. He has helped lead the way for Colorado municipalities to \nstreamline local tax collections, shore up their pension funds for \nfirst responders, and in 1982 launched a feasibility study that led, in \n1982, to the establishment of a self-insurance pool that saves tax \ndollars and provides affordable insurance for cities, towns and special \ndistricts.\n  Ken was the first recipient of the Leo C. Riethmayer Public \nAdministrator of the Year Award from the University of Colorado. He has \nserved on the Board of Directors of the National League of Cities and \nis considered one of the deans of the State municipal league executive \ndirectors corps.\n  Ken and his wife, Bernice, have five children and four grandchildren. \nFinally, after more than 30 years of diligent service to the people of \nColorado, touching virtually every one of their lives, he will be able \nto delve back into the joys of his family.\n  I wish him all the best in his future, for he has given Colorado's \ncities and towns his very best for over three decades. He has been \nlauded as ``a quiet Colorado legend,'' and he will be missed by all \nthose who have worked alongside him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10117-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRATULATING PHELPS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND ST. RAPHAEL THE ARCHANGEL\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I rise to congratulate two \noutstanding Kentucky schools of distinction. Phelps Elementary School \nof Phelps and St. Raphael the Archangel of Louisville are recipients of \nthe 2005 Schools of Distinction Award. This honor is presented \nnationally to 20 schools, of kindergarten through 12th grade, which \nhave demonstrated exceptional commitment to achievement and innovation \nin education.\n  Phelps Elementary School and St. Raphael the Archangel were selected \nfrom more than 3,000 participating schools nationwide. Both schools \nwere chosen as winners based on merit in each of 10 categories: overall \nacademic achievement, literacy, science, mathematics, teamwork, \nleadership, collaboration, professional development, technical \nexcellence and technical innovation. Phelps Elementary School was \nrecognized for outstanding science achievement while St. Raphael the \nArchangel was recognized for outstanding professional development.\n  For their efforts the two schools will each be rewarded with a \n$10,000 cash grant along with their school representatives receiving an \nall-expense paid trip to Washington, DC, to participate in an awards \nceremony. These two schools represent the best in educational \nexcellence and innovation. It is truly an honor to commend Phelps \nElementary School and St. Raphael the Archangel as two of the finest \nschools in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10117-4", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10117-5", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10117-6", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE DEFENSE BASE CLOSURE AND REALIGNMENT \n                           COMMISSION--PM 22\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith the report containing the recommendations of the \nDefense Base Closure and Realignment Commission pursuant to sections \n2903 and 2914 of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, \nPublic Law 101-510, 104 Stat. 1810, as amended. That report includes \nchanges referenced in errata sheets submitted to me by the Commission, \nincluding the enclosed errata sheets dated September 8, September 9, \nSeptember 12, and September 13, 2005.\n  I note that I am in receipt of a letter from Chairman Principi, dated \nSeptember 8, 2005, regarding a district court injunction then in effect \nrelating to the Bradley International Airport Air Guard Station in \nWindsor Locks, Connecticut. Chairman Principi's letter states that, as \na result of that injunction, ``you should consider the portion of \nRecommendation 85 . . . that recommends realignment of the Connecticut \n103rd Fighter Wing withdrawn from the Commission's report.'' The \nChairman's letter further states that ``[i]f the court's injunction is \nlater vacated, reversed, stayed, or otherwise withdrawn, it is the \nintent of the Commission that the entirety of the recommendation be a \npart of the Commission's report.'' On September 9, 2005, the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit granted a stay of the \ndistrict court's injunction. Because the injunction is no longer in \neffect, Recommendation 85 in its entirety is part of the Commission's \nreport.\n  I certify that I approve all the recommendations contained in the \nCommission's report.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat distributions from a section 401(k) plan or a section 403(b) \ncontract shall not be includible in gross income to the extent used to \npay long-term care insurance premiums; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise to bring the Senate's attention to a \nbill I introduced today, the Long-Term Care Act of 2005.\n  Baby boomers will begin to turn 65 years old in 2010 and by 2030, all \n77 million baby boomers will have reached retirement age and the over \n65 population will have doubled. The practicality of these conditions \nwill require the Federal Government and most State governments to spend \nmore money on health care. Presently, Federal and State Governments are \nspending billions of dollars to ensure the health and well-being of our \nfellow citizens.\n  In one sector of the health care arena where costs are dramatically \nrising is in the area of long-term care. In 2000, spending on long-term \ncare was estimated at $123.1 billion and it is expected to triple to \n$346.1 billion by 2040. Currently, 70 percent of long-term care costs \nare spent on nursing home care. The average cost of nursing home care \nis $178 per day or $60,000 per year. That is a significant burden on \nFederal and State Governments as well as the thousands of individuals \nwho pay for that care out of pocket.\n  In addition, almost 75 percent of nursing home care is publicly \nfunded. Medicaid spends about 58.7 percent on long-term care while \nMedicare spends 14.7 percent. According to the Council for Affordable \nHealth Insurance, by the year 2030, Medicaid's nursing home \nexpenditures are expected to reach $130 billion a year.\n  If more people purchased private long-term care insurance, we could \nreduce Medicaid's future institutional-care expenses by more than $40 \nbillion each year, while giving those who are insured alternatives to \nnursing homes, including home care, adult daycare, foster care and \nassisted living. Congress has taken steps to give individuals more \npower to pay for their health care services such as long-term care. One \nsuch outstanding measure was the creation of Health Savings Accounts, \nHSAs.\n  I was pleased to support the passage of the Medicare Modernization \nAct. This landmark legislation created health savings accounts, which \nare a new way that people can pay for unreimbursed medical expenses \nsuch as deductibles, copayments, and services not covered by insurance \nlike long-term care. Eligible individuals can establish and fund these \naccounts when they have a qualifying high deductible health plan and no \nother health plan, with some exceptions. The beauty of these plans is \nthat they have tax advantages such as deductible contributions; tax-\nexempt withdrawals if the individual uses the money for medical \nexpenses; and tax-exempt account earnings.\n  I am confident that with the creation of health savings accounts, \nindividuals and families will be encouraged to set money aside for \ntheir health care expenses and give individuals the means to pay for \nhealth care services of their own choosing, without being constrained \nby insurers or employers. Unfortunately, health savings accounts are \nrelatively new and most individuals will not have the built up funds in \ntheir HSA to pay for a number of costly health care expenses such as \nlong-term care insurance and that is why we need to provide other \noptions to help pay for this important investment.\n  Currently, thousands of Virginians and millions of Americans are \nsaving in their retirement plans to have a comfortable life once they \nbecome seniors, be it 401(k) and 403(b) accounts.\n\n[[Page S10122]]\n\nThese savings plans help prepare individuals for their future \nretirement or any unforeseen circumstance that may arise. Indeed, over \n47 million Americans have 401(k) accounts with $1.8 trillion saved. In \naddition, 6.4 million Americans have 403(b) accounts, amounting to over \n$590 billion saved.\n  These are untapped funds that individuals should be allowed to use to \nhelp pay for their future health care needs. Current tax law and some \nretirement plans allow individuals, in extreme circumstances, to \nwithdraw funds from their retirement accounts, but more often than not, \na 10 percent excise tax applies for early withdrawal. In my opinion, \nthat tax precludes the ability or desirability of individuals to \nprovide for their and their families well-being and that is why I have \nintroduced legislation to provide a new health care option to help \naddress this unfortunate circumstance.\n  My legislation, the Long-Term Care Act, will allow individuals to use \ntheir 401(k) and 403(b) plans to purchase long-term care insurance with \npretax dollars at any age and without early withdrawal penalty. Under \nthe Long-Term Care Act, the consumer has the option to purchase long-\nterm care insurance at the most appropriate amounts for their own needs \nand their spouses.\n  Today, only 6 percent of Americans own a long-term care policy. One \nof the reasons behind this dismally low figure is that individuals wait \ntoo long to purchase long-term care insurance. In fact, purchasing \nlong-term care insurance at age 65 is about twice as expensive as \npurchasing it age 55. That is why we must encourage individuals to plan \nfor their future health care needs and purchase long-term care \ninsurance at an early age. By purchasing long-term care insurance at a \nyounger age, individuals will be saving money in the long run and not \ndepleting their life savings.\n  Our country is heading towards a demographic meltdown on long-term \ncare costs. It is simply unsustainable for individuals and the \ngovernment to maintain the current rate of spending without further \nendangering the state of health care in the United States.\n  Preparing for future costs of health care is something that every \nAmerican should be doing. Long-term care insurance is one way for \nAmericans to plan for periods of extended disability without burdening \ntheir families, going bankrupt, or relying on government assistance.\n  Every American should be preparing for future health care costs and \nit is important that we encourage people to take responsibility today \nfor those costs, be it with the purchase of long-term care insurance or \ninvestment in a health savings account. If Virginians and Americans \nfail to act, it will result in an increased and unsustainable financial \nburden on the Federal Government and taxpayers.\n  My legislation, the Long-Term Care Act, is a commonsense approach \nthat will encourage individuals to plan for their future health care \nneeds and help make long-term care insurance more affordable. While \nthis may not be the solution for some people, it is another option for \nthe millions of Virginians and Americans to help provide for their \nhealth and well-being or the health and well-being of loved ones. I \nlook forward to the Senate's action on this legislation because it not \nonly encourages Americans to plan for their future health needs but \nwill also help sustain the viability of our Nation's health care \nsystem. I thank you for your time and I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 1710. A bill to amend section 255 of the National Housing Act to \nremove the limitation on the number of reverse mortgages that may be \ninsured under the FHA mortgage insurance program for such mortgages; to \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nremove the current cap on the number of reverse mortgages that can be \ninsured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). This legislation \nwill ensure that eligible seniors have access to this important tool \nthat allows them to continue to meet their expenses at a time when they \nhave a reduced income. I am very pleased to be joined in this effort by \nSenator Crapo, who is an original cosponsor of this legislation.\n  I represent a State with the second largest senior population in the \nUnited States. Many of these seniors have worked hard throughout their \nyears and own their own homes. Many of them are also at a time in their \nlives when they are having trouble making ends meet. Reverse mortgages \nallow senior homeowners to convert part of their home equity into tax-\nfree income. The homeowner receives payments from the lender rather \nthan making monthly payments as with a regular mortgage. The homeowner \nmay receive the money in one lump sum, fixed monthly payments, a line \nof credit, or a combination of these. These funds can be used by \nseniors to pay for expenses, while allowing them to stay in their own \nhomes as long as possible. A reverse mortgage helps make services like \nhome healthcare, adult daycare and assisted living a possibility for \nmore American seniors. It can also be used to pay for needed home \nrepairs and other living expenses.\n  Unfortunately, there is currently a statutory limitation on the \nnumber of FHA-insured reverse mortgages that can be issued. This cap \nhas already been increased as the aggregate number of FHA-insured \nreverse mortgages came close to reaching the cap. Unless it is removed \ncompletely, many seniors may be denied the use of this program, which \ncan help to make their later years more stable and comfortable. For \nthis reason, I am pleased to introduce this legislation to permanently \nremove the current cap.\n  I am also pleased to be working on this proposal with my colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania, Representative Michael Fitzpatrick, who has \nintroduced this legislation in the House. I am very hopeful that the \n109th Congress will act to pass this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1710\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, it is an honor to join the chairman of \nthe HELP Committee, Senator Enzi, in introducing a bill to bring much \nneeded support and relief to students, educators, and schools affected \nby Hurricane Katrina. The assistance cannot come too soon.\n  I want to thank the chairman and his staff for all their hard work \nand for working together with us to deliver this relief as quickly as \npossible.\n  We are all familiar with the devastation that hurricanes can cause to \ncommunities. In the past, some of the most destructive storms \ntemporarily closed schools in those communities. Yet those closures \nwere fairly limited and brief. In the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew in \n1992, the Army, Navy, and National Guard joined in helping to repair \nclassrooms and reopen school doors in about 3 weeks. Last year, Florida \nschools damaged by Hurricane Charley reopened within a month, and \nstudents were quickly back on track in their classrooms.\n  But Hurricane Katrina became a different type of devastation, and the \nmagnitude of its damage is vastly more extensive.\n  More than 700 schools and 30 colleges and universities have been \ndamaged and destroyed. Almost all of them have been closed at least \ntemporarily. Many of them will not open until January at the earliest. \nSome are in danger of not reopening at all.\n  The number of students affected is staggering. The estimated total \npopulation of displaced elementary and secondary students is 373,000. \nOver 100,000 college students have been affected by the disaster, and \n18,500 Head Start or Early Head Start children have been affected.\n  These are not just statistics. From this disaster we have been \nreminded that we are all part of the American family. And we have a \nresponsibility to help members of that family when they are in need.\n  Fortunately, America has begun to respond.\n  School districts across the country have pledged to accommodate \ndisplaced students in their schools. Colleges and universities are \ngraciously opening their doors to such students. The Nation is grateful \nto the school principals and superintendents, and the college \npresidents and deans who have pledged their help.\n  But they need help as they struggle to accommodate these students. \nCongress must do our part to respond, to help these devastated \ncommunities get back on their feet and enable students to return to \nschool. We need a response that is as caring and as generous as the \nAmerican spirit.\n  Congress has a responsibility to do all it can to support the needs \nof students, educators, and schools. We need to direct efforts to all \nstages of education--from early childhood through college. Let's make \nsure that these elementary and secondary children don't lose a year of \neducation and that these college students can pursue their \npostsecondary degrees. We need to act quickly to provide the support \nneeded to cope with and overcome this tragedy and rebuild the future.\n  This bill begins the process by strengthening support for educational \ninstitutions affected by Hurricane Katrina. It addresses the needs of \nearly education, elementary and secondary education, higher education, \nand students with disabilities.\n  Thousands of young children affected by Katrina need temporary space \nin safe and healthy settings. We must provide them with quality early \nchildhood programs and facilities, until the children and their \nfamilies can return to their homes and communities.\n  The bill facilitates enrollment in Head Start and Early Head Start by \nwaiving income eligibility and other requirements, so that families \naffected by Katrina will be able to enroll their children more easily. \nIt authorizes funds for affected Head Start centers--providing \nadditional guidance, technical assistance, and resources.\n  We must do more to provide for elementary and high schools struggling \nto cope with the harsh reality of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. \nBecause of closures and the inability to obtain and maintain records, \nwe need to temporarily postpone reporting requirements at affected \nschools. We must also provide them with financial support while they \nare closed to ensure they have the financial stability to reopen.\n\n[[Page S10129]]\n\n  The bill authorizes the Secretary of Education to waive reporting \nrequirements, assessments, and school improvement and corrective action \nfor states, local educational agencies, and schools affected by \nHurricane Katrina.\n  It directs schools in the declared disaster area to use child count \nnumbers collected during the 2004-2005 academic year in seeking Federal \nfunds for the 2006-2007 school year. The Secretary is authorized to \naward special school reopening grants to districts and communities \nsignificantly affected by Hurricane Katrina. These grants will aid in \nthe effort to retain highly qualified teachers, recover data, establish \ntemporary facilities, and take other related steps necessary to reopen \nthe schools. It also provides funds for afterschool services and \nsupplemental educational services to states affected by Hurricane \nKatrina.\n  In addition, we need to acknowledge the efforts of school districts \nin Texas, Georgia, Florida, and other States that offer schooling to \ndisplaced students. School districts in those States deserve funds to \nhelp ease the transition of students into new schools, support basic \ninstruction, and purchase books and materials. We need to help these \nschools temporarily expand their facilities to avoid overcrowding.\n  The bill authorizes the Secretary of Education to make payments to \nlocal educational agencies that enroll displaced students. To alleviate \nthe demand for qualified teachers, the Secretary is authorized to \nencourage States to extend temporary reciprocity for certification of \nschool personnel across State lines. Teachers certified as highly \nqualified in one State will be recognized as meeting this standard in \nother States as well. The bill also modifies title II of the Higher \nEducation Act to target teacher recruitment and retention efforts to \nthe changing needs of the area.\n  We must also help college students find temporary relief so they \ndon't lose a semester or a year of college, and give them the financial \nassistance they need to continue.\n  Students unable to attend a college because of the disaster will be \nexempted from returning grant aid under title IV of the Higher \nEducation Act. These students will be able to place outstanding loans \nin deferment for the remainder of the 2005-2006 academic year. \nAdditionally, financial aid administrators will be encouraged to use \ngreater flexibility in professional judgment in evaluating the needs of \ncollege students affected by Hurricane Katrina.\n  We must also consider the needs of borrowers. College graduates \nresiding in the declared disaster area who lose their jobs deserve \ntemporary relief on their loan repayments. The bill provides a \ndeferment until June, 2006, during which borrowers will not need to pay \ndown the principal on their student loans.\n  To ease the burdens faced by colleges and universities in the \ndeclared disaster area, the Secretary is authorized to waive various \nFederal reporting requirements for colleges and universities. Schools \nwill have up to 5 years to return unallocated Pell grants and \nsupplemental educational opportunity grants. If needed, the Secretary \nwill be able to work with schools after the deadline to arrange a \nrepayment schedule. The bill offers colleges a flexible timeline for \ncrediting undisbursed student loans. Schools have until the end of the \nacademic year or June 30, 2006, to return such funds.\n  To assist colleges in enrolling displaced students, the Secretary is \nauthorized to make arrangements to transfer Federal work-study funds \nfrom affected institutions to receiving institutions.\n  Finally, we must not neglect the needs of children with disabilities, \nteachers, and schools providing special education. Hurricane Katrina \nhas thrown many children and families into a situation of having lost \nor having no records to document their child's special education \nexperience. In addition, many children who were previously not students \nunder IDEA may very well become students under IDEA. The bill requires \nschools to provide early intervening services to all children who need \nacademic or mental health support to benefit from school. This will \nallow the time for children to sort out an individual needs to be \nidentified. The bill also permits States and local education agencies \nto use data from either the 2005 or 2004 fiscal years for reporting and \nfunding purposes to accommodate enrollment fluctuations and guarantee \nfunding for teachers and schools to remain stable.\n  States will also be able to guarantee continuing special education \nservices to students who do not relocate to another State. States, \nunder the Development Disabilities Act, will have the flexibility to \nuse funds to replace assistive technology and durable medical equipment \nfor individuals with disabilities, and under the Vocational \nRehabilitation Act will have the flexibility to develop apprenticeship \nprograms to educate people with disabilities to be part of \nreconstruction efforts.\n  In the weeks and months ahead, we must also focus on rebuilding and \nreconstructing the schools devastated by the tragedy so that, as soon \nas possible, children can return to schools fully stocked with the \nresources they need. We must also consider strategies to encourage \nstudents and educators to return to their schools.\n  Last week, Senator Enzi and I heard moving testimony in the HELP \nCommittee from Dr. Diane Roussel, superintendent of schools in \nJefferson Parish in Louisiana. The parish lies south of New Orleans and \nwas in the direct path of Katrina, and the district's schools, \nstudents, and teachers were all severely affected by the disaster.\n  In her closing remarks, Dr. Roussel emphasized the importance, \nnecessity, and urgency of reopening the schools in her district. When \nschools reopen, she said, people return. When schools reopen, business \nreturns, and life begins to return to normal.\n  In the coming days and weeks, we must work to help life return to \nnormal again for the hundreds of thousands of lives affected by \nHurricane Katrina. This education bill is an impressive first step. I \nurge Congress to continue the work we begin today to meet the needs of \nthe entire Gulf Coast community to reopen its schools.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10129-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10129-S10130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 239--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF INFANT \n                       MORTALITY AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S.

Res. 240\n\n       Whereas the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, approved \n     by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, recognizes \n     that ``the inherent dignity and equal and inalienable rights \n     of all members of the human family is the foundation of \n     freedom, justice, and peace in the world'';\n       Whereas United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379 \n     (1975) concluded that ``Zionism is a form of racism and \n     racial discrimination'' and the General Assembly, by a vote \n     of 111 to 25, only revoked Resolution 3379 in 1991 in \n     response to strong leadership by the United States and after \n     Israel made its participation in the Madrid Peace Conference \n     conditional upon repeal of the resolution;\n       Whereas during the 1991 session of the United Nations \n     Commission on Human Rights, the Syrian Ambassador to the \n     United Nations repeated the outrageous ``blood libel'' that \n     Jews allegedly have killed non-Jewish children to make \n     unleavened bread for Passover and, despite repeated \n     interventions by the Governments of Israel and the United \n     States, this outrageous lie was not corrected in the record \n     of the Commission for many months;\n       Whereas in March 1997, the Palestinian observer at the \n     United Nations Commission on Human Rights made the \n     contemptible charge that the Government of Israel had \n     injected 300 Palestinian children with HIV (the human \n     immunodeficiency virus, the pathogen that causes AIDS) \n     despite the fact that an Egyptian newspaper had printed a \n     full retraction to its earlier report of the same charges, \n     and the President of the Commission failed to challenge this \n     baseless and false accusation despite the request of the \n     Government of Israel that he do so;\n       Whereas Israel was denied membership in any regional \n     grouping of the United Nations until the year 2000, which \n     prevented it from being a candidate for any elected positions \n     within the United Nations system until that time, and Israel \n     continues to be denied the opportunity to hold a rotating \n     seat on the Security Council and it is the longest-serving \n     member of the United Nations never to have served on the \n     Security Council although it has been a member of the \n     organization for 56 years;\n       Whereas Israel continues to be denied the opportunity to \n     serve as a member of the United Nations Commission on Human \n     Rights because it has never been included in a slate of \n     candidates submitted by a regional grouping, and Israel is \n     currently the only member of the Western and Others Group in \n     a conditional status limiting its ability to caucus with its \n     fellow members of this regional grouping;\n       Whereas the United Nations has permitted itself to be used \n     as a battleground for political warfare against Israel led by \n     Arab states and others, and 6 of the 10 emergency sessions of \n     the United Nations General Assembly have been devoted to \n     criticisms of and attacks against Israel;\n       Whereas the goals of the 2001 United Nations World \n     Conference Against Racism were undermined by hateful anti-\n     Jewish rhetoric and anti-Israel political agendas, prompting \n     both Israel and the United States to withdraw their \n     delegations from the Conference;\n       Whereas in 2004, the United Nations Secretary General \n     acknowledged at the first United Nations-sponsored conference \n     on anti-Semitism, that: ``It is clear that we are witnessing \n     an alarming resurgence of this phenomenon in new forms and \n     manifestations. This time, the world must not--cannot--be \n     silent.'';\n       Whereas in 2004, the United Nations General Assembly's \n     Third Committee for the first time adopted a resolution on \n     religious tolerance that includes condemnation of anti-\n     Semitism and ``recognized with deep concern the overall rise \n     in instances of intolerance and violence directed against \n     members of many religious communities . . . including . . . \n     anti-Semitism . . .'';\n       Whereas in 2005, the United Nations held an unprecedented \n     session to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation \n     of the Auschwitz concentration camp;\n       Whereas democratic Israel is annually the object of nearly \n     two dozen redundantly critical resolutions in the United \n     Nations General Assembly, which rarely adopts resolutions \n     relating to specific countries; and\n       Whereas the viciousness with which Israel is attacked and \n     discriminated against at the United Nations should not be \n     allowed to continue unchallenged: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate--\n       (A) welcomes recent attempts by the United Nations \n     Secretary General to address the issue of anti-Semitism;\n       (B) calls on the leadership of the United Nations to \n     officially and publicly condemn anti-Semitic statements made \n     at all United Nations meetings and hold accountable United \n     Nations member states that make such statements; and\n       (C) strongly urges the United Nations Educational, \n     Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to develop and \n     implement education awareness programs about the Holocaust \n     throughout the world as part of an effort to combat the rise \n     in anti-Semitism and racial, religious, and ethnic \n     intolerance; and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) the President should direct the United States Permanent \n     Representative to the United Nations to continue working \n     toward further reduction of anti-Semitic language and anti-\n     Israel resolutions;\n       (B) the President should direct the Secretary of State to \n     report on acts of anti-Semitism at the United Nations and \n     United Nations agencies by member states; and\n       (C) projects funded through the Middle East Partnership \n     Initiative and United States overseas broadcasts should \n     include efforts to educate Arab and Muslim countries about \n     anti-Semitism, religious intolerance, and incitement to \n     violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10130-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 241--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 2005, AS ``LEUKEMIA, \n                LYMPHOMA, AND MYELOMA AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 243\n\n       Whereas on June 26, 2002, a 3-judge panel of the Ninth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Newdow v.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 243, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 243) Expressing Support for the \n     Pledge of Allegiance.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about yesterday's \ncourt decision which ruled that the Pledge of Allegiance is \nunconstitutional. I am concerned, but certainly not surprised, with \nthis decision. And I am very concerned with the decision's \nimplications.\n  It is time for us to take a stand against activist judges who seek to \ncircumvent the will of the American people and who issue judgments \nflying in the face of decency and common sense. With all that is going \non in our world today, to attack the Pledge of Allegiance because it \ncontains a reference to God is ludicrous.\n  Most Americans were outraged when the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \nruled that the Pledge of Allegiance was unconstitutional. Last year, \nthe Supreme Court dismissed the case. The Supreme Court said that the \nplaintiff in the Pledge of Allegiance case did not have standing. The \nCourt found that, because he was not the custodial parent, he could not \nobject to his daughter's reciting the pledge of allegiance in school.\n  When that decision came down, many people, myself included, knew that \nit would only be a matter of time before the plaintiff, Michael Newdow, \nwould be back. We were right. Yesterday, the Court, looking to the \nprevious ninth circuit decision, ruled that the use of the simple \nphrase ``under God'' was a religious act. The Court found that a school \npolicy involving the recital of the Pledge of Allegiance had a coercive \nreligious effect.\n  I strongly disagree that the pledge is coercive. I also strongly \ndisagree with the court's decision. The Pledge of Allegiance, in \naddition to containing a statement of common values and patriotism, \nrecognizes historic facts behind our Nation's founding. There are so \nmany references in America to God, our Creator. Those references can be \nseen in our currency, on public buildings, even in the Declaration of \nIndependence which is displayed a few blocks from the Capitol in the \nNational Archives.\n  This recent decision further emphasizes our Nation's need for judges \nwho are respectful of people of faith and for judges who understand \nthat America's continued reference, and reverence, toward the Creator \nare very important to our common culture.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise in support of the resolution \nexpressing the strong disapproval of the Senate to the September 14, \n2005, decision by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of \nCalifornia in the case of Newdow, et al. v. The Congress of the United \nStates of America, et.al.\n  This decision is a prime example of why we need to put judges on the \nbench who will strictly interpret the law and not legislate from the \nbench. Judges are not politicians. They are on the bench to hear the \ncases in front of them, not to pursue their own personal political \nagendas. We need more judges that will decide each case based on the \nfacts and the law, not legislate from the bench.\n  Like most Americans, those of us who are not serving on the Judiciary \nCommittee have watched intently as President Bush's nominee for Chief \nJustice of the Supreme Court has stood up to the over 21 hours of \nquestioning. Judge John Roberts has been asked nearly 500 questions, \nand his responses have added to the more than 76,000 pages of documents \nconcerning his Federal Government service. The hearings themselves have \nproved to be an incredible civics lesson for the American public, and \nto some extent the Senate, on the role of judges.\n  I have been very impressed with Judge Roberts, both when we met and \nin his considerable response during these hearings. He is a modest and \nhumble man who I believe will be a credit to our judicial system. As he \nstated in his opening remarks, ``[i]t is that rule of law that protects \nthe rights and liberties of all Americans. It is the envy of the world. \nBecause without the rule of law, any rights are meaningless.'' Judge \nRoberts believes in judicial restraint, adherence to the rule of law, \nas well as a posture of modesty and humility in a court.\n  I believe that Judge Roberts is the kind of judge that America \nneeds--a fair, independent and unbiased judge committed to equal \njustice under the law. If confirmed, I am convinced that Judge Roberts \nwill strictly interpret the law and not legislate from the bench. As he \nsaid yesterday, he does not come to the bench or to a case with an \nagenda or a platform. In fact, he reminded my colleagues that he was \nnot\n\n[[Page S10148]]\n\na politician, and he is not going to advocate positions on issues to \nwin votes.\n  Returning to the case at hand, I call on my colleagues to support \nthis resolution. The Pledge of Allegiance is a unifying force in this \nNation. It draws all of us, regardless of race, religion, gender, or \nnational origin, together in support of the common good. At a time when \nwe should be uniting to support our troops in Iraq and our neighbors in \nthe Gulf States affected by Hurricane Katrina, it is a shame that an \nactivist court is seeking to divide based on the principle of ``I'' or \n``me first,'' instead of pursuing the selfless principle of the common \ngood. Just last Congress this body came together to support the current \nPledge of Allegiance on a 94-0 vote. I hope that we will have the same \nbipartisan support again for this important issue, and I urge support \nof this resolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 243) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 243\n\n       Whereas on June 26, 2002, a 3-judge panel of the Ninth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Newdow v. United States \n     Congress that the words ``under God'' in the Pledge of \n     Allegiance violate the Establishment Clause of the United \n     States Constitution when recited voluntarily by students in \n     public schools;\n       Whereas on March 4, 2003, the United States Senate passed a \n     resolution disapproving of the Ninth Circuit's decision in \n     Newdow by a vote of 94-0;\n       Whereas on June 14, 2004, the Supreme Court of the United \n     States dismissed the case, citing the plaintiff's lack of \n     standing;\n       Whereas on January 3, 2005, the same plaintiff and 4 other \n     parents and their minor children filed a second suit in the \n     Eastern District of California challenging the words ``under \n     God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance;\n       Whereas on September 14, 2005, the Eastern District of \n     California declined to dismiss the new Newdow case, holding \n     that the Ninth Circuit's earlier ruling that the words \n     ``under God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance violate the \n     Establishment Clause was still binding precedent;\n       Whereas this country was founded on religious freedom by \n     the Founding Fathers, many of whom were deeply religious;\n       Whereas the First Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution embodies principles intended to guarantee \n     freedom of religion both through the free exercise thereof \n     and by prohibiting the Government from establishing a \n     religion;\n       Whereas Congress, in 1954, added the words ``under God'' to \n     the Pledge of Allegiance;\n       Whereas Congress, in 1954, believed it was acting \n     constitutionally when it revised the Pledge of Allegiance;\n       Whereas the Pledge of Allegiance has for more than 50 years \n     included references to the United States flag, to our country \n     having been established as a union ``under God'', and to this \n     country being dedicated to securing ``liberty and justice for \n     all'';\n       Whereas the 107th Congress overwhelmingly passed a \n     resolution disapproving of the panel decision of the Ninth \n     Circuit in Newdow, and overwhelmingly passed legislation \n     recodifying Federal law that establishes the Pledge of \n     Allegiance in order to demonstrate Congress's opinion that \n     voluntarily reciting the Pledge in public schools is \n     constitutional;\n       Whereas the Senate believes that the Pledge of Allegiance, \n     as revised in 1954, as recodified in 2002, and as recognized \n     in a resolution in 2003, is a fully constitutional expression \n     of patriotism;\n       Whereas the National Motto, patriotic songs, United States \n     legal tender, and engravings on Federal buildings also refer \n     to ``God''; and\n       Whereas in accordance with decisions of the United States \n     Supreme Court, public school students are already protected \n     from being compelled to recite the Pledge of Allegiance: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n       Sec. 1. That the Senate authorizes and instructs the Senate \n     Legal Counsel to continue to cooperate fully with the \n     Attorney General in this case in order to vigorously defend \n     the Constitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance. That the \n     Senate strongly disapproves of the September 14, 2005, \n     decision by the United States District Court for the Eastern \n     District of California in Newdow, et al. v. The Congress of \n     the United States of America, et al.\n       Sec. 2. That the Senate authorizes and instructs the Senate \n     Legal Counsel to continue to cooperate fully with the \n     Attorney General in this case in order to vigorously defend \n     the constitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this resolution that we passed is a Senate \nresolution expressing support for the Pledge of Allegiance. Because of \nthe significance of this matter, I would like to read some paragraphs \nin the resolution and then the closing resolve section:\n\n       Whereas on June 26, 2002, a 3-judge panel of the Ninth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Newdow v. United States \n     Congress that the words ``under God'' in the Pledge of \n     Allegiance violate the Establishment Clause of the United \n     States Constitution when recited voluntarily by students in \n     public schools;\n       Whereas on March 4, 2003, the United States Senate passed a \n     resolution disapproving of the Ninth Circuit's decision in \n     Newdow by a vote of 94-0;\n       Whereas on June 14, 2004, the Supreme Court of the United \n     States dismissed the case, citing plaintiff's lack of \n     standing.\n       Whereas on January 3, 2005, the same plaintiff and 4 other \n     parents and their minor children filed a second suit in the \n     Eastern District of California to challenge the words ``under \n     God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n       Whereas on September 14, 2005, the Eastern District of \n     California declined to dismiss the Newdow case, holding that \n     the Ninth Circuit's earlier ruling that the words ``under \n     God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance violates the Establishment \n     Clause was still binding precedent . . .\n\n  Mr. President, the ``whereas'' clauses continue.\n\n       Resolved, That the Senate strongly disapproves of the \n     September 14, 2005, decision by the United States District \n     Court for the Eastern District of California in Newdow, et \n     al. v. The Congress of the United States of America, et al.\n       Sec. 2. That the Senate authorizes and instructs the Senate \n     Legal Counsel to continue to cooperate fully with the \n     Attorney General in this case in order to vigorously defend \n     the constitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\n  This is an important Senate resolution, as is the one that follows \nthis, S. Res. 244, which we will address shortly. Every morning in the \nSenate, we open with that pledge to the flag of the United States of \nAmerica. It is an issue on which the Senate now speaks loudly in \ndisagreement with the most recent findings.\n  The second resolution related to this issue is S.

Mr. President, I rise today to raise some concerns \nabout H.R. 3672, the TANF Emergency Response and Recovery Act of 2005 \npassed recently by the House of Representatives.\n  I regret that the House Ways and Means Committee did not have the \nbenefit of the insights of those in Louisiana responsible for \nadministrating this critical Federal program. Because if they did, I \nthink that the bill might have been drafted very differently. I very \nmuch appreciate the leadership allowing me this opportunity to state \nthese concerns for the record and am hoping that we can work together \nin the days and weeks ahead from this point on to be certain that these \nconcerns are addressed.\n  Hurricane Katrina has left the Southeastern part of Louisiana in a \nstate of emergency which, by all accounts will have significant and \nwide spread impact on our State and local economy. As a result, larger \nthan expected numbers of individuals will be left without employment \nand in need of the services and support provided by the TANF program. \nIt is precisely to address these circumstances, although I am not sure \nMembers anticipated a disaster of this magnitude that compelled \nCongress to create a contingency fund in the 1996 Act. The purpose of \nthe contingency fund was for States to be able to access additional \nfunds in a time of need. But instead of availing ourselves of the funds \ncontained in the contingency fund to carry us through this unexpected \ndownturn, the House bill limits the use of these funds for \nnonrecurring, short term benefits to persons displaced by this \ndisaster. I am afraid that this narrow definition of eligibility will \nstand in the way of people in need getting the support they deserve. I \nam pleased that the Grassley-Baucus proposal would allow Louisiana \naccess to these funds and allow my State to direct these funds to \nfamilies in need.\n  In addition, it should be noted that while the House bill \ncontemplates that some families affected by Hurricane Katrina will need \nsome short term benefit that should be considered differently from \nregular welfare, it does not extend eligibility for these emergency \nbenefits to all families in the affected States. I believe that we \nshould extend this benefit to all families in need. I am pleased to \nnote that the Grassley-Baucus welfare proposal would extend eligibility \nof ``Hurricane Katrina Emergency TANF Benefits'' for over a year to \naffected families in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama regardless of \ntheir circumstances prior to this disaster.\n  I will raise my final point in the form of a question to my good \nfriend, the Senator from Iowa, Chairman Grassley. The House bill \nincludes a provision that provides that no penalty may be imposed \nagainst any of the States of Louisiana, Mississippi or Alabama for \nfailure to repay a loan made to a State before October 1, 2007. Given \nthe current financial conditions, our Governor is concerned about the \nState's long term ability to pay a loan of this size back in such a \nshort time. They have been assured that the intent was for this \nprovision to serve as a grant and that there is no penalty should they \nbe unable to fully reimburse the Federal Government. Is that the \nSenator's understanding?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I understand that the Senator would like assurances \nthat her State would not be penalized for failure to reimburse the \nFederal Government for funds to the State from the Federal Loans for \nState Welfare Program. I would point out that the House bill includes a \nprovision that provides that no penalty may be imposed against the \nStates of Louisiana, Mississippi or Alabama for failure to repay a loan \nmade to a State before October 1, 2007. This provision provides that \nthere will be no penalty for loans made during that time.\n  Furthermore, I appreciate the other comments from the Senator from \nLouisiana. While I think that the House passed bill represents a good \nfaith effort on behalf of the House, I agree that it does not go far \nenough and that the delegations of the affected States should have been \nconsulted as this bill was assembled. The collaborative process that we \nrelied on with Senators from States directly affected by Hurricane \nKatrina has been invaluable as we have worked to assemble the disaster \nrelief package that Senator Baucus and I announced yesterday.\n  I also recognize that my colleagues are concerned that the Senate's \nposition on this issue be appropriately represented in a conference \nwith the House.\n  I want to assure my colleagues these welfare provisions will be \naddressed during a conference with the House and that the Senate's \nposition on these welfare provisions will be vigorously represented.\n  Mr. FRIST. I appreciate the comments from my colleagues. I support \nthe chairman, and I too assure colleagues that these welfare provisions \nwill be fully litigated in a conference with the House on a health and \nwelfare disaster relief package.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S10150]]\n\n  The bill (H.R. 3672) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10150-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     RECOGNIZING 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Res. 241) designating September 2005 as \n     Leukemia, Lymphoma and Myeloma Awareness Month.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am here today to ask for my \ncolleagues' support for a resolution designating September as Leukemia, \nLymphoma and Myeloma Awareness Month. Today, I want to speak \nspecifically about leukemia, a disease that affects nearly 200,000 \nAmericans.\n  Leukemia is a devastating cancer of the blood that will kill almost \n23,000 people this year alone. It is rare to find anyone today who does \nnot know someone, a family member or a friend, who has battled \nleukemia. Recently, one of my former staff members, Jess Eiesland, was \ndiagnosed with leukemia. He is only 28. He left my office in May of \nthis year to follow in his father's footsteps and pursue a career in \nfinance. On June 18th, Jess was diagnosed with Acute Myelogenous \nLeukemia, a form of the disease characterized by the uncontrolled \nproduction of immature white blood cells by the bone marrow. Jess is \nnow back in South Dakota with his family and traveling to Minnesota to \nundergo an 11-week course of chemotherapy in preparation for a bone \nmarrow transplant.\n  In comparison, Jess is one of the lucky ones. His leukemia was caught \nearly and he has just learned that his sister, Laura, is a bone marrow \nmatch. This match will reduce Jess' risk of developing severe side \neffects from the transplant or rejecting the new cells. Only 30 percent \nof patients in need of a bone marrow transplant have a matching donor \nin their families. Others have to depend on the kindness of strangers \nwho have registered their bone marrow types with the National Bone \nMarrow Registry and volunteered as donors. In honor of Jess, a bone \nmarrow registration drive is being held in Room 124 of the Senate Hart \nbuilding on Friday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.\n  Because of the risk of rejection associated with bone marrow \ntransplants and the difficulty in finding donors, the National \nInstitutes of Health and the private sector have developed other \npromising leukemia treatments, such as cord blood transplants and the \npharmaceutical drug, Gleevec, the first of a slew of promising new \ndrugs that target the underlying causes of the disease. To promote \nthese innovative treatments, we must continue to support biomedical \nresearch. I applaud the efforts of our distinguished colleagues, \nSenators Hatch and Dodd, who introduced legislation earlier this year \nthat would encourage cord blood donations and registrations. This \nlegislation has already been reported favorably by the HELP Committee \nand I hope the full Senate can take it up and pass it soon. \nAdditionally, the Senate has requested a $1 billion dollar funding \nincrease for the NIH in fiscal year 2006 to promote Federal research \nand innovation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution designating September \nas National Leukemia, Lymphoma and Myeloma Awareness Month. Doing so \nwill further disseminate information regarding treatment innovations \nand will encourage Americans to become bone marrow or cord blood \ndonors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10151-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNIZING SEPTEMBER 2005 AS LEUKEMIA AND LYMPHOMA AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for \ndesignating September as Leukemia and Lymphoma Awareness Month. It is \nestimated that leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma will kill 60,500 people \nin the United States this year and that 110,000 new cases are diagnosed \neach year. With more than 700,000 Americans living with blood cancers, \nit is crucial that we come together to reinvigorate our resolve and \ncontinuously intensify our fight for a cure.\n  I am pleased to join the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society in encouraging \nall to put aside time to reflect on what has been achieved so far in \nfighting blood cancers, spread lifesaving knowledge, and set our sights \non progressive goals to advance our ability to support and treat those \nliving with leukemia and lymphoma. Together, we can push forward \ncritical research and keep the eradication of these diseases at the \nforefront of dialogue and education in our local and national \ncommunities.\n  I applaud the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society for its support of \ntreatment and research. Such work is integral to our ability to \nunderstand these illnesses and energize our fellow citizens in this \nvery worthy endeavor. The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society has provided an \noutstanding model of advocacy and paved the way for others to get \ninvolved.\n  I am pleased to invite my colleagues to join me in acknowledging \nLeukemia and Lymphoma Awareness Month.

Mr. President, this afternoon, the Senate passed the \nCommerce,\n\n[[Page S10152]]\n\nJustice, and Science appropriations bill with overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport. I want to thank my colleagues for their tremendous work on \nthis legislation. This appropriations bill funds critical Government \nfunctions and includes significant Katrina-related measures.\n  Earlier this afternoon, I had the opportunity to thank both Senators \nShelby and Mikulski for their great leadership on this bill. There was \na fair amount of juggling in terms of scheduling, given the fact that \nthe Judiciary hearings were underway. Everybody showed good patience, \nand we produced a very good bill.\n  More than 350,000 families have been made homeless by the disaster \nthat has unfolded over the last 2 weeks. The bill we passed today \nprovides Federal housing assistance of up to $600 per family per month \nfor up to 6 months to help those families get back on their feet. \nFamilies lost their homes, they have lost their communities, they have \nlost their jobs, and many families have lost everything. Their only \npossessions were contained sometimes in a single black plastic bag as \nthey fled their homes.\n  These are extraordinary circumstances and they require extraordinary \nactions on our part. As you heard by the legislation that was passed, \nwe are acting responsibly and aggressively in meeting the needs of \nthose victims. Helping these families put a roof over their heads is \none aspect of the real tragedy that has unfolded.\n  I thank people such as Senator Snowe for her hard work to help the \nsmall businesses recover. All of these efforts are part of this larger \neffort to respond and respond aggressively.\n  Under the bipartisan leadership of Senator Grassley and Senator \nBaucus, today the Senate passed a comprehensive tax relief package to \nhelp spur that economic process of getting people back on their feet \nand rebirth and regrowth.\n  The Grassley-Baucus legislation provides immediate and aggressive tax \nrelief to help hurricane victims build their homes, restore their \npossessions, find housing, and find jobs. It allows them to dip into \ntheir retirement plans to cover short-term expenses without being \npenalized.\n  In addition, it promotes and rewards charitable giving. As we have \nseen over the last week and a half, Americans have poured out their \nhearts for the hurricane victims. In just over 2 weeks, private \nindividuals and businesses have donated well over $700 million in \ncontributions. That is increasing every day. It is truly a testament to \nthe character of the American people, to that wonderful spirit of the \nAmerican people, that selflessness, that unselfishness, their \ncompassion, and their generosity.\n  Here in the Senate, we are working hard to reflect those values and \nto deliver swift and meaningful actions. Chairmen are working with \nranking members to finish conversations so they can forward \nappropriate, well-thought-out Katrina legislation to myself and to the \nminority leader for possible Senate action, and Chairman Enzi is \nworking with Senator Kennedy on a series of temporary education law \nchanges.\n  These measures will help tens of thousands of students affected by \nKatrina, as well as the school districts that are absorbing these \ndisplaced students.\n  Chairman Collins continues her work with Senator Lieberman to cut \nthrough redtape and bureaucracy so that FEMA can quickly remove the \nvast amounts of debris that have been left in the disaster's wake.\n  Tomorrow, in 12 hours or so, Senator Reid and I will be departing and \nleading a 14-Member Senate delegation to the gulf coast. Our purpose \nwill be to survey the disaster sites in all three States affected by \nKatrina, to visit with people who have been so dramatically affected, \nboth directly and indirectly, whose lives have been changed, to observe \nwhat is being done by local officials and State officials, as well as \nFederal officials on the ground.\n  The hurricane victims are the Senate's No. 1 priority, and it is \nreflected in the legislation that we are addressing and in the time \nspent both on the floor and by the various chairmen and ranking members \non committees.\n  We are determined that the gulf coast will be able to recover and be \nrebuilt bigger, stronger, and more prosperous than ever before. It is \ngoing to require a lot of leadership from all sectors, at the private \nand public arena, and at Federal-State and local levels.\n  It is going to require the dedication of a lot of individuals.\n  I began today meeting with 100 or so leaders from across Louisiana \nwho already had a previously scheduled meeting to come to Washington, \nDC. I met with Senator Vitter to listen to their ideas and their \nthoughts at the local level of how best to contribute to this \nrebuilding of this vital part of Louisiana.\n\n  Tomorrow, we will meet with people all along that southern coast of \nMississippi as well. I will actually be going to Alabama as well. It is \nthis dedication of individuals, the doers, the thinkers, people \nthinking inside and outside the box that I am convinced will lead to \nthis revitalization and appropriate rebuilding. It is a massive \nundertaking, but this is America and we like our challenges big. We can \nrespond in an appropriately big way. We will make history proud.\n  In about 30 minutes, the President will be addressing the Nation on \nmany of these same issues. I look forward to hearing that address. I \nlook forward to continuing to work in a bipartisan way. We have to keep \nthings bipartisan as we work to develop meaningful, long-term solutions \nfor the American people.\n  I had one big disappointment today, late this afternoon regarding \nreceiving a letter from my counterpart, the Democratic leader, whom I \nknow carefully considered the terms of the outcome, but I was \ndisappointed in that the notification was that the Senate Democrats \nwill boycott our proposal for a bipartisan joint congressional \ninvestigation into the government's response to Hurricane Katrina. It \nis clear the government has no greater responsibility than protecting \nthe security and the lives of senior citizens, and in the aftermath of \nthis devastating hurricane and the flood which followed we saw \ngovernment at all levels not live up to expectations, and, really, fail \nat all levels.\n  It is our duty, and it is our responsibility in the Senate, in \nCongress, to analyze and to investigate, provide aggressive oversight \nin order to figure out what went wrong, in order to know what changes \nmust be made and to make those changes quickly and responsibly and to \nkeep what went wrong from ever, ever, happening again.\n  Congress is going to step up to this important responsibility. We \nhave begun that in the actions over the last 2 weeks.\n  Under the proposal I gave the Democrat leader, we would appoint a \nselect committee with the members of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee as members who would participate. While \nthe Democrat leader in his letter to me says he prefers to let the \nHomeland Security Committee lead the investigation and he will continue \nto support the committee's efforts, which I do, as well, he somehow \nfeels the select committee that our leadership has proposed, which is \nmade up of the very same members of that committee, Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee, will somehow fail the American \npeople or will somehow be partisan or will somehow not be independent.\n  To me, it is an abdication of our responsibility not to have this \nselect committee specifically made up to analyze and to investigate \nwhat went wrong.\n  The proposal was modeled on some of the most serious investigations \nthat Congress has ever taken. Looking back to the 1973 Watergate \nCommittee, the 1986 Iran-Contra Committee, the 1994 and 1995 Whitewater \nCommittee, and the 1997 campaign finance investigation, that is the \nmodel which I had proposed to the Democrat leader. Republicans in both \nthe House and Senate are prepared to fulfill our constitutional \nobligations. I believe this boycott is irresponsible, it is an \nabdication of our responsibility. It begins to place partisan politics \nover finding answers for the American people.\n  We cannot wait 3 years for those answers. We need to investigate them \nand analyze the problems so we will have solutions in the short term, \nso we can quickly make changes and protect all\n\n[[Page S10153]]\n\nAmericans. In challenging times, our country expects its leaders to \nwork together and not to engage in any sort of petty bickering that \nslows down the process. It is time to get it done. The American people \ndeserve better.\n  I ask unanimous consent my proposal to Senator Reid and his letter \nrejecting it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               S.

A subpoena \n     or order may be authorized by the special committee or by the \n     chairman with the agreement of the ranking member, and may be \n     issued by the chairman or any other member of the special \n     committee designated by the chairman, and may be served by \n     any person designated by the chairman or the authorized \n     member anywhere within or outside of the borders of the \n     United States to the full extent permitted by law. The \n     chairman, or any other member of the special committee, is \n     authorized to administer oaths to any witnesses appearing \n     before the special committee. If a return on a subpoena or \n     order for the production of documentary or physical evidence \n     is incomplete or accompanied by an objection, the chairman \n     (in consultation with the ranking member) may convene a \n     meeting or hearing to determine the adequacy of the return \n     and to rule on the objection. At a meeting or hearing on such \n     a return, one member of the special committee shall \n     constitute a quorum. The special committee shall not initiate \n     procedures leading to civil or criminal enforcement of a \n     subpoena unless the person or entity to whom the subpoena is \n     directed refuses to produce the required documentary or \n     physical evidence after having been ordered and directed to \n     do so.\n       (2) Compensation authority.--To employ and fix the \n     compensation of such clerical, investigatory, legal, \n     technical, and other assistants as the special committee, or \n     the chairman or the ranking member, considers necessary or \n     appropriate.\n       (3) Meetings.--To sit and act at any time or place during \n     sessions, recesses, and adjournment periods of the Senate.\n       (4) Hearings.--To hold hearings, take testimony under oath, \n     and receive documentary or physical evidence relating to the \n     matters and questions it is authorized to investigate or \n     study.\n       (5) Testimony of witnesses.--To require by subpoena or \n     order the attendance, as a witness before the special \n     committee or at a deposition, of any person who may have \n     knowledge or information concerning any of the matters that \n     the special committee is authorized to investigate and study.\n       (6) Immunity.--To grant a witness immunity under sections \n     6002 and 6005 of title 18, United States Code.\n       (7) Depositions.--To take depositions and other testimony \n     under oath anywhere within the United States, to issue orders \n     that require witnesses to answer written interrogatories \n     under oath.

William Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bill: Thank you for providing me with your proposal to \n     have the Senate establish a select committee to review this \n     nation's preparation for and response to Hurricane Katrina. \n     Like you, I believe it is vitally important that we learn why \n     our government's leaders failed to perform one of their most \n     essential and basic tasks--protecting the American people \n     from natural or man-made disasters and swiftly coming to \n     their aid when such incidents occur. The survivors of this \n     tragedy and all Americans have a right to expect that their \n     leaders will make every effort to understand what went wrong \n     so that we can identify and implement the steps necessary to \n     ensure that what we witnessed this past month in the Gulf \n     Coast never happens again.\n       As you know, under regular Senate order, the Senate \n     Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs would \n     take the lead in any investigation of the government's \n     actions on Katrina and other disasters. This committee has \n     both the authority under Senate rules and the demonstrated \n     expertise to conduct such an investigation. At the outset of \n     our discussions about the best way for the Senate to proceed \n     on this matter, I expressed my preference for letting this \n     committee handle the Katrina investigation. I also said I \n     would be willing to consider departing from regular Senate \n     order to establish a select committee if I was confident such \n     a committee could do a better job of providing the survivors \n     and the American people the answers they deserve.\n       Unfortunately, after closely analyzing the proposal you \n     presented to me earlier this week I have concluded it fails \n     that critical test for one very. simple reason. As currently \n     drafted, I do not believe your proposed select committee will \n     conduct an independent, non-partisan investigation that will \n     take a hard look at actions by both the Bush Administration \n     and this Congress. As a result, your proposal will not \n     provide the American people the assurances that we have \n     learned every lesson from this tragedy and have developed the \n     corrective measures necessary to make our country more secure \n     in the future.\n       Consequently, I will continue my push for an independent, \n     blue ribbon commission similar to what we established in the \n     wake of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. \n     Democrats and, ultimately, Republicans agreed that approach \n     was the best way to help the American people understand why \n     their government failed them that awful day. And the \n     commission's findings were broadly supported and embraced by \n     the American people and leaders of both parties because they \n     understood that, unlike any congressional body, the \n     commission was uniquely capable of asking tough questions of \n     both the Administration and the Congress.\n       Senator Clinton has proposed that we follow this proven \n     model in the case of Katrina and I have yet to hear a \n     compelling reason why we should not. At the same time, I will \n     also continue to support the Senate Governmental Affairs \n     Committee's efforts to investigate Katrina. Chairman Collins \n     and Ranking Member Lieberman have worked well together in a \n     bipartisan manner in the past and I am confident they will \n     continue to do so in the future.\n       I remain hopeful that you will eventually agree to work \n     with me to establish a truly independent commission to \n     provide the American people answers about why their \n     government failed them and what steps can be taken to ensure \n     it never happens again. The survivors of this tragedy and the \n     American people deserve no less.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/15/senate-section/article/S10154-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10154-S10155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 2005\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
